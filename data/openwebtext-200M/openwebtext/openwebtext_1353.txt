How much good will can an apology  and half a billion dollars  buy ?
A lot , Goldman Sachs is hoping .
After first staunchly defending its outsize profits and pay , and then bristling at calls for restraint in these tough economic times , Goldman is trying a new tack :
It is apologizing for past mistakes that led to the financial crisis  and sharing at least some of its riches .
A little more than a week after Goldman ’s chairman and chief executive drew fire for saying the Wall Street giant was “ doing God ’s work , ” the bank said Tuesday that it would spend $ 500 million  or about 3 percent of the $ 16.7 billion it has so far set aside to pay its employees this year  to help thousands of small businesses recover from the recession .
At the same time , the executive , Lloyd C. Blankfein , also showed a bit of humility , acknowledging at a conference in New York that Goldman had made mistakes , and that it was sorry .
“ We participated in things that were clearly wrong and we have reasons to regret and apologize for , ” he said .
Life as I Perceive it on the Canka Luta Waste ...
And , We Are So Very NOT Amused
Sean Goldman , the 9 - year - old at the center of an international abduction and custody dispute , boarded a chartered plane in Rio de Janeiro with his American father Thursday morning and flew to the United States , ending a five - year battle in the court systems of Brazil and the United States that threatened to upset diplomatic relations between the countries .
Sean and his father , David Goldman of Tinton Falls , N.J. , touched down on American soil Thursday afternoon , said Mr. Goldman ’s American lawyer , Patricia E. Apy .
She would not reveal where they landed or where they planned to spend the weekend , citing the family ’s request for privacy , but The Associated Press reported that the plane had landed in Florida .
The father and son were reunited amid a media scrum at the gate of the United States Consulate in Rio de Janeiro .
Sean ’s Brazilian relatives , who had fought against returning him to Mr. Goldman , had refused various offers by the consulate to provide a calmer , more private way of transferring him inside the consular compound , Ms. Apy said .
Instead , Sean ’s Brazilian family chose to deliver him to the door of the compound on foot .
About 8:30 a.m. ( 5:30 a.m. Eastern time ) , the boy , flanked by his Brazilian stepfather , grandmother and a family lawyer , waded through a throng of reporters , cameramen and bystanders outside the consulate .
The boy clutched at his stepfather , João Paulo Lins e Silva .
Lombardi on Frozen Royalty :
" Our problem under this new system [ with the salary cap ] , is OK , I ca n’t pay you as a forty - goal scorer , " Lombardi explained .
" I ’m not sure I can pay you as a thirty - goal scorer .
I like you , even if you stay the same , I think I can win a [ Stanley ]
Cup for you in this role .
But if a player has to get X amount of dollars , he has to fill [ the ] role [ that fits that dollar amount ] . "
" That ’s the quandary as a manager — there was an article today about all the guys making $ 9 million , " Lombardi elaborated .
" If you ’re making $ 9 million you have to be the leader , you have to carry the ball , score — you have to be everything . "
" Do I like the guy ?
Yeah , but I do n’t like him at $ 9 million because I ’m not getting all those things .
Using that philosophy as we move down the line , do I like him at $ 5 million ?
Well , I ’ve got to have this and this .
Do I like him at $ 3 million ?
Yeah , because I only need this . "
This got me thinking about points ( the goals and assists kind of points ) .
Obviously , points are not the only reason players get the BIIIIIG bucks , but it 's , well , most of it .
As Dean Lombardi * said , " you have to be everything . "
So , when you look at the big cap hits and the big scorers , who is the best value ?
* warning : I 'm going to use everyone 's full name at least once in order to force the post editor to tag everything properly .
This might get ugly ...
I started with the top salaries by cap hit , from Alex Ovechkin down to Anze Kopitar , and then went a little below Kopi to grab some other names I was curious about , especially guys the Kings did n't sign ( e.g. Marian Hossa , Martin Havlat ) and guys the Kings traded or otherwise lost ( e.g. Mike Cammalleri , Patrick O'Sullivan ) .
Last , I threw in several Kings forwards , some of whom are still on entry level contracts .
Obviously , that 's not a fair comparison .
You can mentally delete them if you like .
I kept them in because it gives me an extra dimension for comparison , and also it makes me laugh .
The first chart is sorted by cost ( in cap dollars ) per point .
The players are color - coded , black being biggest cap hit , white being smallest cap hit , and the grays are in between .
The columns are cap hit , points , cost per point ( 1 ) , games played , points per game , cost per point ( 2 ) .
The difference between COST / PT ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) is this : ( 1 ) is the cost per point assuming the player has not missed any games ( call this the true cost ) ; ( 2 ) is the cost per point when looking only at the cost of the games the player played ( call this the adjusted cost ) .
These two numbers are usually pretty close to each other , but in the case of Hossa or Justin Williams , for example , the true cost is much higher than the adjusted cost ; and what the adjusted cost shows is what kind of value the team could have expected had the player not missed any games .
Some observations : first , the obvious ...
Entry - level players are a better deal than multi-millionaires .
Thus , all the names in white background at the top of the list .
I put Purcell in the chart just to see if there would be a difference between a successful cheap player and an unsuccessful one .
There really is n't .
Purcell is n't the value that Scott Parse or Wayne Simmonds are , but he 's still close to the top , point for point .
( Obviously , just because entry - level contracts are a better value per point does n't mean you can skate an entire team of entry level contracts .
For one thing , the big guns draw the defense , leaving the little guns more room to score .
But that 's just one of about a thousand reasons . )
Which leads me to the second obvious point : the bottom of the list features some players whose contracts are generally considered to be ...um... overpayment ( e.g. Scott Gomez , Chris Drury ) .
The middle of the chart is the most interesting .
The darker colors represent bigger cap hits , so dark colors high on the list define a subset of expensive players who are worth it .
Among the middle - weights ( light gray with black font ) , Zach Parise , Alexander Frolov , Williams , Dustin Brown and O'Sullivan are all good values , in the top half of the list .
Williams becomes much less valuable when we sort by COST / PT ( 1 ) , because his long - term injury destroys his numbers .
But Frolov , Brown and O'Sullivan are all kind of surprising , considering how underwhelming their seasons are supposed to be .
The next most expensive group ( darker gray with white font -- the $ 4 - 5 MM club ) , also has some good values ( Martin St. Louis , Hossa -- when you take Hossa 's injury out of it ) , Havlat somewhere in the middle ( which comports with his underwhelming season so far ) and Michel Handzus at the bottom .
Since Handzus is a defensive specialist , I choose to ignore this , except to acknowledge that he is generally considered to be over - paid for a third line center ( I personally think he 's worth it , given that he's the hub of the defensive system ) .
The next group ( the $ 6 MM club ) , is led by Ilya Kovalchuk .
Kovalchuk is by far the best value per point of any player with a cap hit over $ 6 MM .
Marleau is next , followed by Henrik Zetterberg , Paul Stastny , Kopitar , Cammalleri , Ryan Smyth , Danny Briere and , finally , Pavel Datsyuk .
The fact that Kopitar is a slightly better value than Cammy is good news , I guess .
Mostly , I am surprised that he is n't down closer to the bottom with the really expensive guys .
In other words , just looking at points , we 're getting our money 's worth more than we generally think .
Of the most expensive group : Joe Thornton ( rocks ) , then Ovechkin , Marian Gaborik , Brad Richards , Dany Heatley and Sidney Crosby ( I note that two of those names were UFAs last summer ) .
The bottom four are essentially busts .
Between Crosby and Eric Staal are some disappointments relative to cost .
However , that 's not the whole picture , as we will see when we sort the same table by PPG , high to low .
Now we see what we 're paying for .
The black names rise to the top , the black " busts " stay at the bottom , Kovalchuk shoots to near the very top , and I would argue that all the non-black names above Iginla ( e.g. Zetterberg , Hossa , Kopitar , Steven Stamkos , Parise , Patrick Marleau , St. Louis and Kovi ) are the real winners here .
Kopi's PPG is about the same as Marleau 's which is nothing short of amazing since I keep wishing we had Marleau and I keep feeling down about Kopitar .
( maybe this has something to do with Marleau blowing past Kopi last night , en route to one of his two goals . )
The gathering of white names down at the bottom of the list is not surprising , except that I am a little surprised that Tavares is on pace with Simmonds , Parse and Matt Moulson ( with Moulson leading the pack ) .
Even a half - point per game is nothing to sneeze at .
Though obviously Teddy Purcell 's problems are revealed by this chart .

A few honorable mentions will be awarded ; those stories will also be published .
PODCAST : Next month , HiLobrow.com will record the 2nd episode of our pre-Golden
Age science fiction podcast , “ Parallel Universe : Pazzo . ”
( Click here to listen to the 1st episode ; theme : RADIUM AGE ROBOTS . )
The 2nd episode will be devoted to fiction about RADIUM AGE SUPERMEN , from Olaf Stapledon ’s Odd John to Hugo Gernsback ’s Ralph 124C41 + to Philip Wylie ’s Gladiator .
HOW TO SUBMIT YOUR STORY : Publish it to the comments section of this post , no later than 5 pm EST on Monday , February 15th .
Do n’t include any personal info besides your name ( i.e. , no phone number , mailing address , website , etc ) .
You must enter your actual email address when posting , but only the editors of this website will be able to see it .
The author retains all rights to his or her story ; but HiLobrow.com retains the right to publish / record the story as described above .
WHO ’S ELIGIBLE : anyone , including HiLobrow.com contributors and friends .
GUIDELINES :
No more than 250 words , and only one story per author .
NB : The superman or - woman should not be a caped crusader type .
Many of the first fictional supermen were portrayed by their creators as homo superior , an evolved human whose superiority was mental , physical , or both .
Stapledon , Wylie , and many other authors of the time agreed the superman — whose values and worldview the rest of us ca n’t share , or even comprehend — would seem cold , inhuman , alien , or worse .
Even , or especially when , he or she is trying to help us .
However , a few authors took a rosier view of the superman ; Gernsback ’s Ralph 124C41 + , for example , is a scientist whose inventions help ordinary mortals .

More problems with the branding of Google 's " Nexus One " handset were claimed today , as it was highlighted that Mountain View has not secured the relevant web addresses .
The firm 's first foray into physical retailing was announced at the Googleplex on Tuesday .
Today it emerged that Nexusone.com has been owned by Peter Villanueva of Portland , Oregon , since 1998 .
It 's used to redirect to a web design services site and a paint shop .
He might like to call Mountain View to see what they 'll offer him .
Nexusone.co.uk is meanwhile occupied by a British musician named Sion , who is promoting his " fusion of ambient , dance , trance , drum ' n ' bass and jazz " .
( Warning : page automatically plays some of Sion 's " smoky jazz " . )
Given the extra bandwidth charges Sion is likely to incur as a result of Brits seeking information on the Google 's smartphone , he might consider sticking some ads on his pages .
Or turning off the smoky jazz .
Nexusone.org meanwhile , registered via an anonymising service , seems to be an attempt to send traffic to commercial mobile phone sites , but the links eventually just reload the home page .
Domain seller Sedo said : " A comprehensive domain portfolio plays a crucial part both in consumer marketing and brand awareness .
" Google ... will potentially miss out on large volumes of consumers looking for information on the new handset . "
The criticism follows legal threats by Philip K Dick 's daughter over " Nexus One " , a name taken from Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep ? .
In December she said she was taking legal advice , a claim repeated today .
Google 's seeming carelessness over branding is in contrast with Apple , which sent fanbois into their customary paroxysms by registering iSlate.com back in December . ®
Thought getting your local high school to set up a gay - straight alliance was a difficult job ?
Then get a load of this Wyoming school that wo n’t even let a “ no place for hate ” sign hang on the premises .
The Anti-Defamation League ’s attempt at branding a public school as , uh , a safe place for students has been thwarted by the school board .
School board members in Wheatland rejected a request this week to put back up banners for an anti-hate campaign at several of their schools .
The reason :
They were sponsored by a gay and lesbian organization .
One Wyoming attorney says the action may be unconstitutional .
Platte County School District 1 trustees voted 4 - 3 to keep the Anti-Defamation League ’s “ No Place for Hate ” banners down at Wheatland High and West Elementary .
The schools were two of 25 in Colorado and Wyoming taking part in the program .
One of the sponsors listed on the banner is the Gay and Lesbian Fund for Colorado .
Wheatland board members and parents took issue with that , according to the district .
The others sponsors are Qwest and the David & Laura Merage Foundation .
Which makes sense , given what supporters of the sign are up against .
When you strap on a typical running shoe , you may be fighting evolution .
Modern - day running shoes have changed the way people run , altering our gait from that of barefoot running — the manner by which people ran for thousands of years before the arrival of the cushioned shoes found on store shelves today — a new study suggests .
The study showed barefoot runners tend to hit the ground toe first , a style that minimizes forces that jar the body , while people used to running shoes have largely adopted a heel - first style that can mean lots of force on the body .
While several studies have compared running barefoot to running with shoes , the current study , published this week in the journal Nature , is the first to include analyses of runners who have never worn modern footwear , the researchers say .
Humans started wearing running shoes only relatively recently , with use of this footwear taking off in the last 40 years .
Before that , people either ran barefoot or wore shoes that would seem to offer little protection from the ground , such as sandals or moccasins .
For nearly as long , people have debated which is better .
While the new study may not solve the vigorous debate , it does add data on the physiological effects of running shoes .
The researchers are n't suggesting runners ditch their shoes .
For one , barefoot running can take getting used to , and it takes stronger muscles , so the switch could lead to tendonitis .
Heel - toe or toe - heel ?
When you run , every step you take puts forces on your body , caused by the impact of your foot colliding with the ground .
If you land with your heel first , a so - called " rear - foot strike , " this impact force is quite large , several times your weight , and occurs over a very short period of time .
" It 's like someone hitting you on the heel with a hammer two to three times your body weight , " said study researcher Daniel E. Lieberman , a professor of human evolutionary biology at Harvard University .
Runners with modern shoes usually strike the ground with their heel first , although the cushioning present at the rear of many running shoes can lessen this impact force .
But since we have n't always had this heel protection , Lieberman and his colleagues wanted to find out how humans were able to hold up against these forces when they ran barefoot .
They examined the running styles of five different groups : athletes from the United States who always wear running shoes ; athletes from the Rift Valley Province in Kenya who grew up running barefoot , but now don modern running shoes ; U.S. runners who used to wear shoes , but now go barefoot ; and runners from Kenya who either always wear shoes or have never worn shoes .
They saw that runners who were used to running in shoes most often strike the ground heel first , even when running barefoot .
Those individuals who grew up running barefoot , or switched to running barefoot , usually landed with their toes first , a so - called " fore - foot strike . "
The barefoot runners , including those who grew up running sans shoes and those who had recently switched to barefoot , sometimes landed on their mid-foot as well , but they were much less likely to land on their heel .
Lieberman and colleagues also compared the impact forces generated when runners hit the ground with their heel first versus toe first .
They found that heel - striking caused a large impact force , and this force was even greater if the runners were not wearing shoes .
In contrast , there was almost no collision force if the runners landed on their fore - feet .
The researchers suspect that barefoot runners land on their toes or mid-feet to avoid the impact they would feel if they landed their heel .
They figure barefoot runners point their toes more at each foot strike , which effectively decreases the weight of the foot that comes to a sudden halt at that moment .
The pointed toe also means a springier step , which can also decrease the forces .
" We hypothesize that this is how people generally ran before cushioned shoes with elevated heels were invented , " Lieberman told LiveScience in an e-mail .
Going barefoot
Running barefoot has become somewhat trendy lately thanks to the best - selling book " Born to Run " ( Alfred A. Knopf , 2009 ) , by Christopher McDougall , in which the author argues that barefoot running is better for you , and in which he mentions Lieberman 's previous work .
Lieberman stresses that running shoes have not been shown to increase injuries , nor has barefoot running proven to reduce damage to the body .
However , Lieberman notes that a recently published study on the topic showed no studies that demonstrate modern running shoes prevent injuries .
While there is anecdotal evidence that striking the ground with your toes first or mid-foot may help reduce injuries , such as stress fractures and runner 's knee , future studies are needed to determine whether this type of running style actually decreases injury rates , he said .
Some argue that running barefoot on hard , manmade surfaces is not good for your body .
" You run on something hard , your body has to work that much harder to help absorb those forces , and that can lead to stresses and strain , " Dr. D. Casey Kerrigan , a former professor of physical medicine and rehabilitation at the University of Virginia , told LiveScience this month .
But Lieberman says that 's not the case .
Since barefoot runners more often land on their forefoot , the collision force is virtually eliminated .
This finding held true even when the study participants ran on steel plates .
" You can run barefoot or in minimal shoes on the world 's hardest surfaces and generate almost no collision [ force ] , " he said .
But what about encounters with glass or a rocky surface ?
Lieberman and his colleagues admit that treading on such debris will hurt , and suggest you use prudent judgment when deciding on a place to run barefoot .
And they emphasize that you should only run barefoot if you want to .
Going barefoot does have its risks .
If you are used to striking the ground with your heel first , it can take a while to train your body to land with your fore - foot first .
And since this running style requires stronger feet and calf muscles , changing gaits may put your at risk for developing Achilles tendonitis , the researchers say .
The study was funded the National Science Foundation , Harvard University , and Vibram USA , among others .
Vibram is a shoe company that markets a type of minimal running shoe .
The Beamz interactive instrument is an interesting take on making music .
Instead of actually learning an instrument , musicians can simply wave through a laser trigger to trigger a different “ musical event . ”
What does that mean ?
Well , watch the video .
But basically every move through the laser sparks a bass beat , a drum fill or a synth riff .
It looks like a fun gizmo , but unless a DJ really wants something novel on stage I do n’t see it exploding on the music scene .
The device comes in two versions , one for $ 199 with a preset package of songs and a $ 299 version for upgraded software that allows the user to tweak the sounds and add their own music for use with the Beamz .
Americans tend to believe that we do everything better than anyone else .
That belief makes it hard for us to learn from others .
For example , I 've found that many people refuse to believe that Europe has anything to teach us about health care policy .
After all , they say , how can Europeans be good at health care when their economies are such failures ?
Now , there 's no reason a country can't have both an excellent health care system and a troubled economy ( or vice versa ) .
But are European economies really doing that badly ?
The answer is no .
Americans are doing a lot of strutting these days , but a head - to - head comparison between the economies of the United States and Europe -- France , in particular -- shows that the big difference is in priorities , not performance .
We 're talking about two highly productive societies that have made a different tradeoff between work and family time .
And there 's a lot to be said for the French choice .
First things first : given all the bad - mouthing the French receive , you may be surprised that I describe their society as " productive . "
Yet according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development , productivity in France -- G.D.P. per hour worked -- is actually a bit higher than in the United States .

My Uncle Ernie owned a print shop in Allentown PA .
I was there many times when I was a boy during the early 50's .
He owned one of these Linotype beasts .
I regarded it with a weird combination of wonderment and fear .
Even back then I realized what it does and , watching him work it , I acquired a basic understanding of its workings .
I can very clearly remember my respect for the dangers of the print shop with all of its moving things and the especially the molten lead .
Uncle Ernie gave up his business and went to Washington to work for the Government Printing Office .
I became an engineer .
I hope you understand why I 'll rate this 5 stars for technical content and nostalgia .

Utterly fascinating how - to film about what looks to be a now primitive and obsolete way to set and mold type .
This machine that they used automatically selects the type , spaces , prepares the mold AND puts the letters back to be used again !
The machine is explained , step by step , and doesnt really get too complicated for us so that dumdums ( like me ) can easily understand what happens .
Sure its over a half hour , but it sure is entertaining .
Oh yeah , another neat thing about this , is that was an ITALIAN training film , its been dubbed into English .
So , in short , youll get to see a 1960s Italian Industrial film !
Neat !
Highly recommended !

This disturbing video shows greek police beating and abusing Albanian immigrants , at Athens police station .
This video defies reason and humanity .
Why does n't the international community do anything and the continuing greek brutality against Albanians ?
Most of the uproar over full - body scanners has focused on privacy concerns .
There 's one larger question , however , that has n't received much scrutiny by the chattering classes : do the damnable things work ?
One German TV station says " Nein . "
By way of Americablog comes a video of a man easily concealing the makings of high - temperature combustibles in a manner that evaded a full - body scanner .
As the blogger writes : " Even if you do n't understand German , it 's easy enough to follow how this physicist beat the system . "
First the World 's Ugliest Man forced us all to remove our shoes when going through airport security .

And for what ?
So that few hundred million taxpayer dollars can be spent slowing our boarding even longer while producing images that some of the more - squeamish members of the public have likened to child porn and which can't detect bomb ingredients ?
As the video shows , the concealment of materials sufficiently incendiary to melt a frying pan is no big deal .
But perhaps we should be even more distressed by what the only English speaker in the video - who appears to be pro-scanner - says about four and a half minutes into the demo : " No system is perfect . "
Unarguable .

Lala might 've been the biggest threat to Apple 's iTunes with its free full - song previews and unlimited streaming for ten cents per track , but not anymore .
Apple has confirmed reports that it will gobble up Lala , but wo n't say how much it paid or what it will do with the startup 's services .
Here 's how I 'm hoping it 'll play out :
Build Streaming Into iTunes
It seems like a no - brainer to bake Lala 's greatest asset -- the capability to stream an entire song once for free -- right into iTunes .
Why bother ?
Because Apple 's Genius feature , which uses your existing library to recommend new tracks , would be more useful if you could actually listen to all the suggestions .
Imagine a playlist that seamlessly integrated familiar and new tracks , highlighting those that you might want to buy or storing them for later purchase .
Bring Lala's Social Features Into iTunes
Remember that rumor about Apple bringing social features to iTunes ?
While iTunes 9 only lets you blurt the names of tracks to Facebook and Twitter , Lala 's got a richer system for connecting with friends and finding people with similar interests .
And what if the Genius algorithm could be tweaked to include friends ' suggestions ?
The result is more discovery for users , and more purchases for Apple .
Merge the Libraries
Lala 's music selection is 8 million songs strong .
As of January , Apple offered more than 10 million tracks through iTunes .
I do n't know how much overlap there is between the two libraries , but it 's safe to say that all consumers would benefit by merging them for both services .
Of course , this would probably require some conversations with the music industry .
Approve the iPhone App
Simple as that .
Lala 's iPhone App , like its PC counterpart , lets you stream tracks forever at a rate of ten cents per song .
Yes , some users will stop purchasing downloads and rely on streaming instead , and that 's a threat to Apple 's iTunes revenue , but perhaps those folks will make more purchases overall .
No Price Hikes for Lala Purists
Unlike my colleague Paul Suarez , I think it 's a stretch to expect lower prices on iTunes as a result of the Lala acquisition .
In April , Apple jacked up the price on some popular songs while maki ng its entire library DRM - free , so I do n't expect iTunes pricing to suddenly come down .
However , I do hope that Lala users can continue to enjoy the service 's streaming tracks for ten cents apiece after the first listen .
I can't see any reason Apple would raise prices , but if this deal results in more Lala users , I can see the music industry looking for a little more action , particularly on chart toppers .
WASHINGTON -- China disclosed the other day that its foreign exchange reserves had increased to about $ 2.4 trillion in 2009 , a gain of $ 453 billion for the year .
These stupendous figures -- and the likelihood that the country 's reserves will rise by a comparable amount this year -- have now become a financial , economic and geopolitical reality of surpassing significance .
The significance is not , as many imagine , that China might suddenly " dump " the dollar and dethrone it as the world 's major international currency , undermining American economic power and prestige .
Two - thirds or more of China 's reserves are estimated to be held in dollars .
As an economic strategy , dumping the dollar would boomerang .
It would amount to a declaration of economic war in which everyone -- Chinese , Americans and many others -- would lose .
Consider what would happen , hypothetically .
China would first sell securities in which its dollars are invested .
That would include an estimated $ 800 billion in U.S.
Treasury bonds and securities , plus billions of American stocks and corporate bonds .
After unloading the securities and collecting dollars , it would sell the dollars on foreign exchange markets for other currencies : the euro , the yen and who knows what else .
The massive disgorging of dollars could trigger another global economic collapse .
As China 's selling became known , other foreign and American investors might jump onto the bandwagon , abandoning dollar securities and shifting currencies .
If panic ensued , markets would fall sharply .
Banks and investors would see their capital and wealth erode .
The resumption of the global recession , even depression , would shrink foreign markets for China 's exports ( in 2009 , its exports fell 16 percent ) .
To protect jobs , other countries might impose quotas or tariffs on Chinese imports .
Why would China do this to itself ?
The answer :
It would n't .
Look elsewhere for the significance of the huge foreign exchange reserves .
For starters , they confirm China 's mercantilist trade policies .
A country that practices mercantilism strives to increase exports at the expense of its trading partners .
China has done this by keeping its currency , the renminbi ( RMB ) , at an artificially low rate that gives its exports a competitive advantage on world markets .
Huge trade surpluses have resulted , although last year 's surplus declined as a result of the global slump .
It 's often said that the United States " borrows " from China , because the Chinese hold so many Treasury bonds .
This inaccurately describes reality .
When China receives dollars , it could use those dollars to buy imports .
Or it could limit the dollar inflow by allowing the RMB to appreciate , making its exports more expensive and its imports cheaper .
In 2005 , China began a modest appreciation of the RMB against the dollar ; in mid-2008 , it stopped .
Since then , the RMB has depreciated against many currencies , reports economist Nicholas Lardy of the Peterson Institute .
In 2010 , Lardy expects the trade surplus to grow .
So China accumulates dollars , which must be invested .
The large surpluses cause China to " lend " to us and other countries , regardless of whether we want the " loans . "
Even if China had no trade surplus , its foreign exchange reserves would probably grow because it receives earnings on its existing reserves .
These reserves serve other Chinese strategic purposes .
They 're used to make investments in raw materials ( oil , food , minerals ) and important technologies around the world ; or they buy political influence with foreign aid or favorable loans .
In effect , China has a $ 2.4 trillion stash to use as it pleases .
The irony : Despite complaints about big Treasury holdings , these holdings advance China 's economic aims of job creation through exports and protection against scarcities of vital commodities .
The underlying purpose is to bolster the government 's grip on power by ensuring rapid economic growth .
Granted , China is tying to generate more growth from domestic spending ; still , it is promoting strong exports until that happens .
But what 's good for China may not be good for the rest of the world , including the United States .
It 's not simply a redirection of economic power but a question of how that power will be used , consciously or unconsciously , to shape the global economic order .
Lopsided economic expansion poses many dangers .
Already , China 's huge reserves -- invested in U.S. bonds -- are cited as one reason for the low interest rates that brought on the financial crisis .
The artificially depressed RMB hurts exports from developing countries and not just the United States , Europe and Japan .
China grows at others ' expense .
The manipulation of trade subverts support elsewhere for open trading policies .
For now , China has no desire to substitute the RMB for the dollar as the primary global currency .
Its ambition is more sweeping : to create a world economy that serves China 's interests and , only as an afterthought , anyone else's .
I mean seriously , how hard is that
FOR MUCH of the Northern Hemisphere , the cold is abating .
As climate scientists long realized , a short period does not create a trend .
Even global warming advocates , who insisted that the 1998 El Nino warming was a trend , are now claiming that the cold does not contradict their warming trend .
Their time spans are evidently extremely adjustable .
The week ended with real heat : Climategate hit the United States .
On Thursday night January 14 , 2010 , in an hour - long special broadcast on KUSI - TV San Diego , John Coleman revealed new research by computer expert E. Michael Smith and Certified Consulting Meteorologist Joseph D’Aleo .
This new research demonstrates that the National Climatic Data Center ( NCDC ) has been as intensely involved in manipulating global surface data as has the Climate Research Unit ( CRU ) of the University of East Anglia , which is now under investigation in Great Britain .
NCDC is a division of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) .
The manipulated data is also used by the third organization reporting global surface temperatures – the Goddard Institute of Space Studies , a division of the National Aeronautical and Space Administration ( NASA GISS ) .
Thus , all three organizations reporting global surface temperatures may be using similar manipulated data .
D’Aleo and Smith report that in the period of the 1960 ’s to the 1980 ’s the number of stations used for calculating global surface temperatures was about 6,000 .
But it dropped rapidly to about 1,500 by 1990 .
Further , large gaps began appearing in some of the reported data .
This loss of stations and its possible consequences have been well established .
For example , it is discussed in the 2008 NIPCC report Nature , Not Human Activity , Rules the Climate .
The stations lost appeared to be mostly in colder climates – which , if the data set is not adjusted , would lead to a false indication of warming .
( D’Aleo was a contributor to the NIPCC report . )
In December , as Climategate was developing , TWTW referred to a Russian report stating the CRU was ignoring data from colder regions of Russia , even though these stations were still reporting data .
Thus , the data loss was not due to just the closing of stations as earlier thought , but due to decisions by the CRU to ignore them .
Now D’Aleo and Smith report similar activities by the NCDC .
Stations have been dropped , particularly in colder climates ( higher elevations or closer to the Polar Regions ) , and now temperatures are projected for these colder stations from other stations , usually in warmer climates .
The reports of the IPCC and governmental agencies such as the EPA are based , in a large part , on these data .
If the data are wrong , then the reports are wrong .
It is now clear that the global surface temperature data are unreliable and must be thoroughly investigated .
If not , any government policies based upon these reports should be rigorously challenged .
Thanks to the diligent work of John Coleman , Joe D’Aleo , Michael Smith , as well as many others , the US main stream media has no excuse for ignoring Climategate as merely a problem in Britain or a problem of no significance .

[ A brief comment :
It is an impossible task to arrive at one precise number for a global surface temperature .
But , one is often reported .
Whatever is reported can only be approximate .
However , if standard procedures are rigorously followed and stations are rigorously monitored , then trends can be established .
Based on the new reports , such standard procedures were deliberately altered ..
By removing stations in colder climates from the data set in recent years without doing so in past years , the CRU and NCDC exaggerate warming trends and , perhaps , even created one where there was none .
A similar effect can be produced by underreporting high temperatures in early years .
According to researchers such as Pat Michaels , this is apparently what NASA GISS is doing . ]

SEPP SCIENCE EDITORIAL #3-2010 ( Jan 16 , 2010 )
By S. Fred Singer , President , Science and Environmental Policy Project
[ Note : This is the fifth of a series of mini-editorials on the “ junk science ” influencing the global warming issue .
Other topics will include the UN Environmental Program , and some individuals heavily involved in these matters . ]
Junk Science # 5 : IPCC ’s Fourth Assessment Report [ IPCC - AR4 , 2007 ]
In line with its policy of ‘ ramping up ’ its case for Anthropogenic Global Warming ( AGW ) and escalating climate fears , IPCC - AR4 concludes : “ Most of the observed increase in global average temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic GHG concentrations ” [ my emphasis ] .
They helpfully explain that “ very likely ” means “ 90 to 99 % certain . ”
One wonders just how IPCC arrived at this rather precise estimate – since there is nothing in the report to back it up .
By now , the IPCC has mercifully abandoned some of the ‘ evidence ’ given in their earlier reports :
They no longer feature the discredited ‘ Hockeystick ’ graph ( that had done away with the Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age ) .
They recognize that melting glaciers cannot illuminate the cause of warming and that shifting and often reversing CO2 - temperature correlation does not support AGW .
Instead , the ‘ evidence ’ now advanced is essentially circumstantial .
The logic which gets the IPCC to this conclusion ( as pointed out in Scientific Alliance Newsletter 160 ) is as follows :
1 . There has been a general rise in averaged measured surface temperatures over the past century .
2 . At the same time , atmospheric concentrations of so - called ‘ greenhouse ’ gases , particularly carbon dioxide , have been rising .
All the evidence points to the net increase being caused largely by burning fossil fuels .
3. Computer models of the climate ( General Circulation Models ) cannot account for the temperature changes on the basis of known natural variability in climate .
4 . Therefore , the additional ‘ anthropogenic ’ carbon dioxide must be the primary driver of this change .
Yet as Scientific Alliance states : “ On this unproven argument , a whole climate change industry has been built ; academic researchers , civil servants , carbon traders , environmental and development NGOs , taxpayer - subsidised renewable energy companies and , of course , UN agencies beaver away in the shared assumption that this logic is compelling and demands concerted action . ”
Can you spot the ‘ hole ’ in the IPCC ‘ logic ’ ?
The key word is “ known . ”
But they totally ignore the most important natural forcing : changing solar activity that modulates the intensity of galactic cosmic radiation ( GCR ) incident on the Earth .
This fact seems known to everyone except the IPCC group dealing with the most important issue : the cause of climate change in the 20th century .
See evidence in Fig 14 of NIPCC .
It gets worse : IPCC - AR4 claims they can simulate past century ’s Global Mean Surface Temp ( GMST ) with ‘ known ’ natural and anthropogenic forcings ( as displayed in Fig 5 of NIPCC ) .
But the uncertainties shown there are huge , especially for the indirect effects of aerosols .
Of course , the major forcings from solar activity - GCR are not even considered ; nor the effects of clouds that likely produce negative feedbacks rather than reinforcing the warming of GH gases .
The upshot is that the IPCC ’s claim of matching the GMST is nothing else but an exercise in curve - fitting , with several suitably chosen parameters .
I would be impressed if IPCC could match mean zonal temp , not just GMST– or the atmospheric temp obtained from radiosondes and satellites – using the same chosen parameters .

EPA regulations based on “ spurious science ” have consequences .
As fruit and vegetable growers suffered huge losses due to the deep freeze , it is useful to note the logic of the EPA in denying farmers an ingenious means to prevent their crops from freezing .
A particular bacterium promotes ice formation on crops .
If a certain gene is removed from the bacterium , it will no longer promote ice formation .
Though shown effective in preventing ice formation , the EPA prevented general use of the technique by declaring the ice - promoting bacterium a pest , therefore the modified bacterium a “ pesticide ” to be regulated by the EPA .

US Weather Bureau Report – November 2
The Arctic ocean is warming up , icebergs are growing scarcer and in some places the seals are finding the water too hot , according to a report to the Commerce Department yesterday from Consul Ifft , at Bergen , Norway .
Reports from fishermen , seal hunters and explorers , he declared , all point to a radical change in climate conditions and hitherto unheard - of temperatures in the Arctic zone .
Exploration expeditions report that scarcely any ice has been met with as far north as 81 degrees 29 minutes .
Soundings to a depth of 3,100 meters showed the gulf stream still very warm .
Great masses of ice have been replaced by moraines of earth and stones , the report continued , while at many points well known glaciers have entirely disappeared .
Very few seals and no white fish are found in the eastern Arctic , while vast shoals of herring and smelts , which have never before ventured so far north , are being encountered in the old seal fishing grounds .
I ’m sorry , I neglected to mention that this report was from November 2 , 1922 as reported by the AP and published in The Washington Post .

President Barack Obama gave a masterful speech in Oslo last week , addressing head on a major contradiction — that a war president was accepting the world 's premier peace prize .
But he worsened another contradiction .
Commerce , he suggested , is a powerful antidote for war .
In addition , he noted that commerce has helped lift billions from poverty .
He could not be more right — and more wrong .
Commerce may indeed help fuel and sustain some conflicts .
But far too many are actually caused by it , particularly in Africa .
The tragic reality is that millions are essentially being killed by Western consumers .
This happens as Western corporations remain complicit with the tens of thousands carats of diamonds and gold being mined under slave labor conditions .
Obama 's Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech focused too much on the evils of war , and much less on the massive suffering and casualties caused by commerce - driven conflict .
The speech focused primarily on the war against terrorism while conveniently staying away from conflicts , particularly in Africa , where Western capital is making a killing .
In Africa , it is clear that conflict is driven by commercial greed and the profits of Western corporations that sell violently extracted high value minerals , resulting in tragic consequences .
While the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq are driven in large part to defend and protect commercial interests , the wars in Africa are different .
These African wars rank much lower in U.S. strategic and national security purposes and have received much less high level attention than the oil interests in Iraq and Central Asia .
Yet , these African conflicts have resulted in an estimated 5 million deaths since the late 1990s in the Democratic Republic of Congo alone .
In short , there has developed a two - tiered global response to conflicts .
In the first tier , Western countries led by the United States have instigated wars to pursue governments and terrorists who threaten their access to vital resources like oil , particularly in the Middle East and in Central Asia .
By contrast , the United States and most Western countries have stayed away from responding to resource conflicts in Africa , including those in Liberia , Sierra Leone and Ivory Coast , even as Western companies continue to profit hugely from these wars .
This has in effect created a second tier of responses that shows neither the resolve nor determination that has defined wars to ensure access to vital resources like oil in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The West benefits from this tepid response to African conflicts as much as it benefits from its aggressive use of force in the Middle East and Iraq .
The primary beneficiaries of these conflicts are western companies , such as private military and security companies , banks , insurance companies and airlines , which are the pipeline of valuable minerals like diamonds to retail outlets in the West .
Nascent efforts to regulate the market for blood diamonds , such as the Kimberley Transparency initiative , pale in comparison to the massive use of brute force against terrorism that is being conducted against the likes of al - Qaida in places like Afghanistan .
Obama 's speech reflected the choices made by international institutions that allow commerce to continue to thrive in African conflicts while causing massive suffering , dislocation and wanton loss of life .
This view of commerce as an antidote to war and conflict fails to address how illicit commerce is itself a threat to the very values that the President so vigorously and eloquently defended in his speech .
For commerce to play the same role it has played to lift people out of poverty , more attention and resources must be devoted to the manner in which it has become an engine for resource wars in Africa .

Over the last two months we ’ve noticed an interesting pattern in notice of trustee sale auction cancelations .
This is the last step before the home is either sold at auction or taken back by the bank as a bank owned property .
As we have highlighted , this process can take 18 months from the last payment made on the home given the slow pace banks are moving at .
The troubling thing is I have started piecing the data together and something seems to be emerging .
The fact that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac over the holiday now have “ unlimited ” support from the government may signal new methods of dealing with the foreclosure crisis that once again will destroy the prudent in our country and reward the Wall Street bankers with another gift .
So why have cancelations risen so much in the last few months ?
This has to do with Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac , Bank of America , Wells Fargo , Citi , and JP Morgan .
All these lenders went on a foreclosure “ holiday ” that by their own admissions , ended on January 3rd .
So that in itself would account for many of the auctions recently canceled .
A few of you sent this over from the L.A. County Treasure and Tax Collector :
Source : L.A. County Treasure
Now part of this may come from the foreclosure holiday but why cancel February ?
It probably has to do with HAMP and also something with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac now having unlimited support .
Also , HAMP offered extensions for many loans to January 31st :
“ ( BusinessWeek ) Mortgage servicers must give U.S. homeowners more time before kicking them out of the government ’s loan - modification program , reflecting further struggles in the execution of the plan .
Servicers can’t cancel an active Home Affordable trial modification scheduled to expire before Jan. 31 for any reason other than property eligibility requirements , according to a posting today on a government Web site .
They must write to borrowers to inform them about missed payments or needed documents , and give them at least 30 more days to submit them . ”
So that in itself must have set off a rash of cancelations .
You have the holiday , plus the extension , plus banks ignoring non-payers .
You can understand why the shadow inventory numbers are off the charts yet looking at standard data paints a deceiving picture .
Part of this was spurred by the horrible numbers released by the HAMP initiative :
Of the number of active trial modifications ( that now go out to five months instead of three ) only 31,000 have been converted to permanent modifications out of nearly 700,000 .
In other words , about 4 percent seem to be entering into permanent modification status which is an abysmal number .
Right now Los Angeles County has nearly 100,000 homes in the shadows if we include the MLS and all other shadow inventory .
Just looking at the MLS we get approximately 19,000 + homes :
What is interesting that homes scheduled for auction between September and today , we find a large number cancelations :
Of homes scheduled for auction between September and today in L.A. County we have seen nearly 10,000 cancelations .
This of course is due to HAMP and the above mentioned moratoriums .
I really doubt that we ’ve managed to “ save ” 10,000 homes in this time but what is more likely to have happened is delaying the inevitable foreclosure or bailout .
You can understand why the public is confused with all this information .
I ’m having to pull data from multiple sources and putting it all back together .
What we find when we put it all together is this :
-MLS public view data is artificially low
- Many cancellations only mean that foreclosures have been delayed or put into HAMP which is showing a horrible success rate
- A large number of properties with non-payers do n’t even have a notice of default but show up in 90 + days late internal bank data ( this number in California is over 10 percent of all mortgages )
- In California 1 out of every 3 mortgages is underwater
And this brings us to probably the more nefarious connection of the foreclosure dots .
Why over the holiday did the government implicitly back Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac with unlimited support ?
From the FHFA report released on January 8th :
“ Washington , DC – The Federal Housing Finance Agency today released its third quarter
Foreclosure Prevention & Refinance Report , which shows that as of November 2009 , Fannie
Mae and Freddie Mac ( the Enterprises ) , implemented more than 405,000 trial and permanent
loan modifications under the Administration ’s Home Affordable Modification Program
( HAMP ) and refinanced 4 million loans .
The report , which now includes data on
delinquencies , loan modifications and refinance activity for each Enterprise , details the actions
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have taken to prevent foreclosures and keep people in their
homes . ”
Wait , did you catch that ?
405,000 HAMP trial modifications are with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loans .
Look up at the HAMP data released by the U.S. Treasury above .
In other words , this is what is happening :
You see where I ’m going with this .
The bulk of the nearly 700,000 HAMP mods are backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
Since we own Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , that means we own most of these loans now .
And how are those loans doing ?
In fact , of all enterprise loans the distress rate is 7.6 percent ( the above chart does n’t include bank owned homes ) .
So what is really going on them ?
Why uncap the support to these agencies if they are dealing with more and more costly loans ?
One idea is with the ultimate underwater bailout .
I ran the quick numbers here :
Recent data shows that nationwide , the average amount for the underwater homeowner is nearly $ 70,000 ( much larger in California thanks to Alt - A and option ARM products ) .
First American CoreLogic in their latest report had 10.7 million homes underwater .
So to bring homes to basically zero equity , it would cost the government some $ 745 billion !
Is this where the government and crony bankers are heading ?
I have no idea but why else would you uncap Fannie and Freddie and also allow the FHA to keep on making loans while the entire portfolio still shows signs of weakness .
Why ?
Because these are the only products in town .
Corporate welfare banks do n’t dare touch the American consumer but are more than quick to take bailouts and make government backed loans .
They will push the limit to whatever the government allows them to do and right now it is allowing them to continue the toxic mortgage game .
So it would take basically TARP II only to extinguish the current negative equity .
And who would get this money ?
With HAMP , it has been a triumphant failure because it only seeks to protect the banks .
The other option would be to erase this negative equity but the vast majority of Americans are not in this spot and this would politically not fly ( as it should n’t ) .
Banks should fail ( did we agree to not let banks fail or is this something the crony bankers , Fed , and U.S. Treasury decided to do ? ) .
Current mortgage pricing is completely delusional of the risk involved .
The global markets nearly imploded because of toxic loans and right now 30 year fixed mortgages go for 5.75 percent ?
Really ?
The only reason this is happening because of the toxic Federal Reserve and horrible U.S. Treasury policies .
The recent AIG e-mails show who the U.S. Treasury is really working for .
Where does this go ?
Who really knows but anyone telling you things are good are in some form of delusion .
And I ’m sure the 85,000 jobs lost last month was also a good sign ( actually the labor force declined by over 600,000 ) .
This data should shine some light on what is going on but should also show you how flawed the entire system has gotten .

Printers equipped for 3 - D are poised to go mainstream , now that Hewlett - Packard plans to start selling them .
The company 's inkjet and laser printers are staples in offices and homes .
The devices , which can crank out three - dimensional plastic models through a process similar to printing text on sheets of paper , have until recently been available only to high - end industrial designers .
HP 's devices will be targeted at a broader market of mechanical - design professionals , and will probably cost less than $ 15,000 .
" This is the boldest step we have seen so far in 3 - D printing , " says Scott Summit , chief technology officer for Bespoke Innovations , a company that creates 3 - D artifacts for medical use .
" A lot of people want to do 3 - D printing but it is a mysterious world .
With HP embracing it , it is likely to demystify the idea to many consumers . "
HP 's printers will be manufactured by Stratasys , a company that specializes in 3 - D printers .
The printers have long been used by designers and architects in computer aided design ( CAD ) to create prototypes before finalizing on the design for large - scale production .
But these printers cost many thousands of dollars and have been popular with only a select group of specialists .
Over the last three years , hobbyists have found a way to make inexpensive 3 - D printers , bringing the technology to do - it - yourselfers .
The Makerbot , a 3 - D printer that started shipping last April , costs $ 750 for a basic kit that includes , among other things , three NEMA 17 motors to drive the machine ; nuts , bolts , bearings , belts and pulleys to assemble it ; an electronics motherboard ; and a pinch - wheel extruder to shape objects .
A premium version of the Makerbot printer costs $ 950 .
The HP - Stratasys line of printers are likely to be much more expensive than the Makerbot , since they are targeted at users in automotive and aerospace industries .
HP and Stratasys declined to mention pricing for the upcoming line of 3 - D printers .
But last year , Stratasys offered an office - friendly 3 - D desktop printer for around $ 15,000 .
" There are millions of 3 - D designers using 2 - D printers , " says Santiago Morera , vice president and general manager of HP 's large format printing business , in a statement .
" Stratasys ' technology is the ideal platform for HP to enter the market and begin to capitalize on this untapped opportunity . "
HP 's line of 3 - D printers could straddle the world between hobbyists and small design businesses such as Summit's that are looking to create individualized objects for consumers .
For instance , Summit 's firm has created a backpack for firefighters that is molded individually to each user 's body .
The backpack also doubles as a suit of armor , he says .
Another application for 3 - D printers could be prosthetic limbs , because they could be customized for every individual .
Summit says , " 3 - D printers were not used in the production stage .
But it is no longer just a prototyping tool , it 's become a manufacturing tool . "
The availability of inexpensive computer aided design ( CAD ) programs has helped make 3 - D printers accessible to more users , says Summit .
" Five years ago you had to pay quite a bit of money to get a program that would let you export your design file in the STL format that can be sent to the 3 - D printer , " he says .
" Designers had to know Solidworks or Maya .
But now you have Blender and Sketchup and other inexpensive 3 - D - design programs . "

What the fuck is wrong with you ?!
You read articles on the internet about how to make yourself fart ?
Seek professional help .
Have you done that ?
Ok , good , now here ’s what to do .
There are two different methods for making yourself fart on command : you can swallow air with your mouth and wait the 3 - 4 minutes it ’ll take for it to make its way to your colon and out the rear , or you can literally inhale air WITH YOUR BUTTHOLE ( how cool is that , huh ? ? ) which will allow you to fart immediately .
First , the swallowing air method :
Go sit on a comfortable surface , but remember the key is to sit up straight , do n’t slouch .
Fill your mouth ( do n’t inhale into your lungs ) with air .
Swallow .
Try to actually feel the air going into your stomach .
Do this several times and wait 3 - 4 minutes .
You should then have to fart several times .
Ta-da .
The inhale - with - your - butt - method
I tried this and finally figured it out and thought I should clarify on how to do this :
Lie down on a bed or somewhere flat and pull your legs up to your head so that they ’re on either side .
Basically , you inhale with your butt : just relax your rectum and let the air come in .
It takes a bit of practice but you ’ll figure it out if you work at it .
Keep doing this until you feel a fart coming on , and then release it .
I actually found a video of a guy demonstrating ( he gives good directions while doing it , though 🙂 ) and since that ’s much more amusing , I ’m also going to show you that :
Additional Resources and Further Reading
Ohhhh have I got a book for you , check this out , I suspect it ’s right up your alley ( pun intended 😀 ) : Who Cut the Cheese : A Cultural History of the Fart .
While you ’re at it you should probably check out these fun facts about farting , and maybe have a look at this hilarious story about the gift of farting on command .

Tweaked soya isoflavone LRXH609 is slimming aid Researchers at China Pharmaceutical University are doing animal experiments on a new compound that helps the breakdown of fat tissue .
The compound , LRXH609 , is an analogue of the isoflavone daidzein . [ structural formula shown below ]
Daidzein is found in soya protein and red clover .
The Chinese have added on a fatty acid and a methoxy group on to the compound .
The new compound is called LRXH609 , but the researchers call it Dzd .
Dzd is short for daidzein derivative .
Its structure is shown below .
The researchers got the idea of trying out LRXH609 from studies in which lab animals lost weight when given natural isoflavones in their food .
The derivative breaks down less slowly in the body than the original daidzein .
The researchers fattened one group of mice for a month on a high fat diet [ model ] .
Another group got ordinary food and therefore did n't fatten up [ control ] .
Another group were fattened and given 50 mg LRXH609 per kg bodyweight daily [ Dzd2 ] .
This group got less fat and their fat tissues grew less fast .
The fat reservoirs of the mice that got a daily dose of 100 mg of the isoflavone analogue [ Dzd3 ] and were fattened were even smaller than those of the control animals .
But the mice were n’t lighter .
It might just be that LRXH609 is a body recompositioning drug that speeds up the growth of muscle mass .
The new analogue probably works by blocking lipase enzymes in the gut and fat cells .
Lipases help the intestines to extract fats from food and fat cells to store energy from food in the form of fat .
The figure below shows that increasing concentrations of LRH609 in test tubes reduce the activity of the lipase enzyme .
" Dzd can significantly reduce the body and white adipose tissue weight of obese mice and ameliorate the hyperlipoidemia induced by the high fat diet without apparent ill effects " , the researchers conclude .
The article gives no indications of plans to launch the new substance on the market or of follow - up research .
Information on the sponsor does n't give much away either .
The research was financed by the researchers ' university .
Is this a substance that could be put into supplements ?
Without the FDA getting angry ?

Setting Goals : 5 Financial Milestones to Aim for By Age 30
Young professionals have a ton on their plate , which often creates a paradoxical financial conundrum .
With all the time spent on socializing , education , career , technology , and everything else — how is one supposed to focus on personal finance goals ?
The paradox is that there may be no more important time in your life than your twenties ( to mid 30 ’s ) to hit high impact financial milestones .
Not everyone will have the resources to hit all of these targets by the age of 30 ; however , there ’s no harm in striving to reach these goals .
In fact , you can only benefit from doing so .
Below are 5 financial milestones to aim for along with recommended turbo- charged “ all - star ” action items .
How many will you be able to cross off the list ?
What other goals would you recommend adding ?

Setting Goals : 5 Financial Milestones to Aim for By Age 30
1. Contribute to a Roth and a Traditional IRA
Look for a no - fee IRA through a discount broker .
It will literally take you 10 minutes to open an IRA account — the hard part is being disciplined enough to keep funding it .
Having both a Roth and a Traditional IRA gives you the opportunity to split your tax benefits between the present and your retirement .
For more tips on IRAs , including the recent updates to Roth IRA regulations , check out this post on IRA contribution limits .
Financial all - star move : open an investment account with a open an investment account with a broker like TradeKing , then start both a Roth and a traditional IRA .
Make sure to contribute the combined $ 5,000 max annually .
2. Build Six Months Worth of Expenses in your Emergency Fund
If we ’ve learned anything from living through a recession , it ’s that nobody ’s job is truly safe ( and there are times when jobs can be hard as hell to get ) .
After seeing my wife get laid off for several months during the last slowdown , I can personally speak to how thankful you will be towards having a financial safety net .
We were lucky that she was out of a job for only 3 months — it has taken many others much longer to recover .
Without our emergency fund to back us up , we might have had to rack up high - interest consumer debt .
Had it been longer , we might have had to sell our home .
Financial all - star move : Bump up your emergency savings to a year ’s worth of living expenses .
3. Make the Credit Card Companies Hate You
I do n’t advocate ditching your credit card , unless you carry a balance month to month .
A long and solid credit history pays dividends in the long run .
If you avoid miscellaneous fees and penalties and collect rewards without incurring unnecessary expenses , then having a credit card can be a useful and integral part of a solid financial portfolio .
Just make sure that you do n’t win any “ customer of the year ” awards from your credit card companies ( hint : their favorite customers rack up lots of fees ) .
Financial all - star move : Additionally , pay off all high interest ( 4 % and up ) student loan debt .
4. Collect your Full “ Pension ”
Pensions are a thing of yesteryear , right ?
Yes , but their weaker replacement , the 401 ( k ) , should be taken advantage of to the fullest .
It is a crime not to get at least your employer ’s full matching contribution in your 401 ( k ) on an annual basis , if you have the funds to do so .
Besides collecting that match , you should also think about simultaneously contributing to your IRAs , which you have a lot more control over ; in fact , you may want to consider funding your IRA first before maxing out your 401( k ) .
Financial all - star move : Try to max out your 401 ( k ) on more than one instance , before age 30 .
5. Create a Monthly Budget Plan
Expecting financial success without a budget is equivalent to an explorer finding new land without a map or a compass .
A few hours set aside to create a monthly budget covering all income sources and expenses may yield you the best return on investment you will ever see .

Too lazy for the manual ?

Financial all - star move :
Cut your expenses and maximize your income enough to be in the black every single month .

That is the definition of " Terrorism " .
The following quotes are absolute proof that these people are terrorists .
Terrorism -
The unlawful use or threatened use of force or violence by a person or group against people or property with the intent of intimidation or coercion often for ideological or political reasons .
Below is Bruce Friedrich , PeTA 's Vegan Campaign Coordinator , protesting and speaking against those that harm animals .
What he advocates in these speeches is nothing short of terrorism .
It was widely reported in 2001 that PeTA 's vegetarian campaign coordinator Bruce Friedrich told an animal - rights convention that " blowing stuff up and smashing windows is a great way to bring about animal liberation . "
And they have no problem doing these things to those that disagree with their views .
People for the ethical Treatment of Animals is a group that would have you believe that its motivations are altruistic and pure - warm and friendly organization that exists only to help animals .
It might have started out that way , but today nothing could be further from the truth .
The fact is PeTA is Unethical .
A closer look reveals that PeTA is nothing more than an extremist group that financially supports and aids arsonists , violent criminals , and terrorist groups .
To the right is Ingrid Newkirk , founder and President of People for the ethical Treatment of Animals .

The number of people unemployed in the UK has fallen unexpectedly for the first time in 18 months .
Total unemployment stood at 2.46 million for the three months to November , down 7,000 on the figure for the previous three months .
It ends the continuous rise in unemployment that began in the summer of 2008 after the recession began .
Ministers welcomed the figures but warned that joblessness could rise again in the coming months .
The rate of unemployment now stands at 7.8 % , down from the 7.9 % reported last month , the Office for National Statistics ( ONS ) said .
Meanwhile , the number of people claiming Jobseeker 's Allowance fell to 1.61 million in December .
That is a fall of 15,200 over the month - significantly greater than the 2,500 anticipated by analysts .
The number of 16 - 24 - year - olds out of work also fell over the three - month period between September and November , down from 943,000 to 927,000 .
Part - time impact
But the fall in unemployment was fuelled partly by an increase in people taking part - time work .
The number of people in part - time employment increased by 99,000 over the quarter to reach a record high of 7.71 million .
MAPPING JOBLESSNESS
Unemployment in your area
More than a million of these were working part - time because they could not find a full - time job - the highest figure since records began in 1992 , according to the ONS .
The number of people neither employed nor looking for work - not included in unemployment figures - was up to 21.2 % of the population .
That was the highest rate since August 2007 .
George Buckley , chief UK economist at Deutsche Bank , said workers were more willing in this recession to accept low pay and shorter hours in return for keeping their jobs , helping to stem job losses .
" These figures are encouraging , " he said .
" In previous recessions it took years for unemployment to stop rising , but that has n't happened this time . "
Mr Buckley admitted previous predictions of the unemployment rate reaching 10 % now looked unrealistic .
' Still tough '
The figures , which came as a surprise to many analysts , were welcomed by Work and Pensions Secretary Yvette Cooper .
" The jobs market is still tough for a lot of people , but the drop in unemployment and youth unemployment is very welcome , " she said .

" It means 450,000 fewer people are out of work than everyone expected last spring . "
But she added that unemployment would remain " difficult " for some months ahead .
Shadow work and pensions secretary Theresa May said there was still cause for conern .
" Economic inactivity has hit a record high and there are 2.3 million people out there , out of work and who want a job , but are n't included in the unemployment figures , " she said .
Economists warn that a continued recovery in the labour market would still depend on the recovery in the wider economy , encouraging companies to hire more staff .
There were some signs of increased demand for workers in the figures .
The number of vacancies being advertised rose by 16,000 compared with the previous three - month period , though it is still down significantly on a year ago .

25,000 pages posted online show Tory leader followed crash diet before election , genesis of ' no such thing as society ' and how Denis missed dinner with his chums
Her fondness for whisky is well known , as is her ability to get by on as little as four hours sleep a night .
But an even more unusual aspect of Margaret Thatcher 's lifestyle is revealed today : the Tory leader steeled herself for the 1979 general election with a crash diet that featured no fewer than 28 eggs a week .
The two - week high - protein diet included one day - Thursdays - on which eggs were on the menu for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
The only respite she was allowed in this grapefruit and black coffee , steak and lettuce diet was a glass of whisky " when meat is eaten " .
Otherwise it was " no alcohol " .
The impact of such a diet on her temperament , especially when combined with her famed lack of sleep , can only be guessed at .
But the ticks she made against each ingredient on her personal diet sheet seems to indicate that she followed the Mayo Clinic regime – well - known for rapid weight loss – rigorously .
The diet plan was tucked into the cover flap of her 1979 Economist pocket diary which is among her personal papers released today .
The 1979 files from Thatcher 's Downing Street political and press offices also reveal that even before she recited the St Francis of Assisi prayer on the steps of No 10 she was telling an American management consultant : " I shall have to take most of the major decisions myself . "
They confirm that she regarded her first cabinet as a well - balanced government that included some " fervent believers in the almost pure political belief " .
They were " balanced out " with others " not for me , but to give a certain confidence that one is determined to take the middle ground , " she told the newly elected Canadian prime minister , Joe Clark .
The papers also show that her 1987 " no such thing as society " remark , which for many critics defined the immoral truth of Thatcherism , was not off the cuff but was her view as early as 1979 .
In a two - page personal credo for inclusion but never used in her October 1979 conference speech , Thoughts on the Moral Case , she echoes the sentiment : " Morality is personal .
There is no such thing as collective conscience , collective kindness , collective gentleness , collective freedom .
To talk of social justice , social responsibility , a new world order , may be easy and make us feel good , but it does not absolve each of us from personal responsibility . "
This passage goes further when she looks forward to the creation of what she calls the New Patriotism .
She writes : " When we have succeeded with a nation of people who take personal responsibility then we shall have , and be entitled to have , The New Patriotism . "
This appears to have been too strong a sentiment even for her speechwriters and did not make it into the speech .
The 25,000 pages of her personal papers and those of her press secretary , Bernard Ingham , and policy adviser , Sir John Hoskyns , are being put online today by the Margaret Thatcher Foundation in one of the most ambitious projects of its kind .
Given the later civil war between Sir Alan Walters , her economics adviser , and Nigel Lawson , it is interesting to find that she initially wanted to establish a Gordon Brown - style Council of Economic Advisers , but this came to nothing in the face of Treasury hostility .
She tried to set up a small army of " irregular advisers " but told the US management consultant Alcon Copisarow in 1977 : " It is most important that we get the structure and strategy right and I have already come to the conclusion that I shall have to take most of the major decisions myself .
It is therefore vital that I also arrange to keep in touch with a number of key figures in the ' outside ' world . "
Michael Heseltine caused
Thatcher trouble from the off .
Her handwritten notes for the first cabinet confirm that she wanted to put him in the energy department , but he objected at the last moment and swapped jobs with David Howell at environment .
Letters of congratulation poured in from unexpected sources .
It is a surprise to see Peter Sellers and Eric Morecambe alongside the Daily Mail 's David English and the Sun 's Larry Lamb .
Harvey Thomas , who cultivated celebrities on her behalf , particulary asked for thank you letters to be sent to BBC figures including DJ Pete Murray and sports commentators Peter Lorenzo and Ron Pickering – all " staunch Conservatives " – for their help in opening doors to the likes of Bobby Moore , Barbara Windsor and Petula Clark .
But one figure refused to get too excited about it all .
Denis
Thatcher did not always find attending his wife 's engagements too much of a joy .
" Another dreaded State Banquet I 'm afraid , " the Diary Secretary informed him .
" 1. J. C . What I do for the Party !
I have entered and will show up .
2 . The same evening I was going to attend probably the best Rugby Football Dinner this year , namely the Centenary Dinner of the Middlesex RFU .
All me chums will be there !

Design patterns of 1972
" Patterns " that are used recurringly in one language may be invisible or trivial in a different language .
Extended Example : " object - oriented class " C programmers have a pattern that might be called " Object - oriented class " .
In this pattern , an object is an instance of a C struct .
struct st_employee_object * emp ;
Or , given a suitable typedef : EMPLOYEE emp ;
Some of the struct members are function pointers .
If " emp " is an object , then one calls a method on the object by looking up the appropriate function pointer and calling the pointed - to function : emp -> method ( emp , args ... ) ;
Each struct definition defines a class ; objects in the same class have the same member data and support the same methods .
If the structure definition is defined by a header file , the layout of the structure can change ; methods and fields can be added , and none of the code that uses the objects needs to know .
There are a bunch of variations on this .
For example , you can get opaque implementation by defining two header files for each class .
One defines the implementation : struct st_employee_object { unsigned salary ; struct st_manager_object * boss ; METHOD fire , transfer , competence ; } ;
The other defines only the interface : struct st_employee_object { char __SECRET_MEMBER_DATA_DO_NOT_TOUCH[ 4 ] ; struct st_manager_object * boss ; METHOD fire , transfer , competence ; } ; And then files include one or the other as appropriate .
Here " boss " is public data but " salary " is private .
You get abstract classes by defining a constructor function that sets all the methods to NULL or to : void _abstract ( ) { abort ( ) ; }
If you want inheritance , you let one of the structs be a prefix of another : struct st_manager_object ; /* forward declaration */ #define EMPLOYEE_FIELDS
\ unsigned salary ; \ struct st_manager_object * boss ; \ METHOD fire , transfer , competence ; struct st_employee_object { EMPLOYEE_FIELDS
} ; struct st_manager_object { EMPLOYEE_FIELDS
unsigned num_subordinates ; struct st_employee_object ** subordinate ; METHOD delegate_task , send_to_conference ; } ; And if obj is a manager object , you can still treat it like an employee and call employee methods on it .
This may seem weird or contrived , but the technique is widely used .
The C standard contains guarantees that the common fields of struct st_manager_object and struct st_employee_object will be laid out identically in memory , specifically so that this object - oriented class technique can work .
The code of the X window system has this structure .
The code of the Athena widget toolkit has this structure .
The code of the Linux kernel filesystem has this structure .
Rob Pike , one of the primary architects of the Plan 9 operating system ( the Bell Labs successor to Unix ) and co-author ( with Brian Kernighan ) of The Unix Programming Environment , recommends this technique in his article " Notes on Programming in C " .
This is a pattern
There 's only one way in which this technique does n't qualify as a pattern according to the definition of Gamma , Helm , Johnson , and Vlissides .
They say : A design pattern systematically names , motivates , and explains a general design that addresses a recurring design problem in object - oriented systems .
It describes the problem , the solution , when to apply the solution , and its consequences .
It also gives implementation hints and examples .
The solution is a general arrangement of objects and classes that solve the problem .
The solution is customized and implemented to solve the problem in a particular context .
Their definition arbitrarily restricts " design patterns " to addressing recurring design problems " in object - oriented systems " , and to being general arrangements of " objects and classes " .
If we ignore this arbitrary restriction , the " object - oriented class " pattern fits the description exactly .
The definition in Wikipedia is :
In software engineering , a design pattern is a general solution to a common problem in software design .
A design pattern is n't a finished design that can be transformed directly into code ; it is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations .
And the " object - oriented class " solution certainly qualifies .
Codification of patterns Peter Norvig 's presentation on " Design Patterns in Dynamic Languages " describes three " levels of implementation of a pattern " : Invisible
So much a part of language that you do n't notice Formal Implement pattern itself within the language
Instantiate / call it for each use
Usually implemented with macros Informal Design pattern in prose ; refer to by name , but Must be reimplemented from scratch for each use
In C , the " object - oriented class " pattern is informal .
It must be reimplemented from scratch for each use .
If you want inheritance , you have to set it up manually .
If you want abstraction , you have to set it up manually .
The single major driver for the invention of C++ was to codify this pattern into the language so that it was " invisible " .
In C++ , you do n't have to think about the structs and you do n't have to worry about keeping data and methods private .
You just declare a " class " ( using syntax that looks almost exactly like a struct declaration ) and annotate the items with " public " and " private " as appropriate .
But underneath , it 's doing the same thing .
The earliest C++ compilers simply translated the C++ code into the equivalent C code and invoked the C compiler on it .
There 's a reason why the C++ method call syntax is object -> method ( args ... ) : it 's almost exactly the same as the equivalent code when the pattern is implemented in plain C .
The only difference is that the object is passed implicitly , rather than explicitly .
In C , you have to make a conscious decision to use OO style and to implement each feature of your OOP system as you go .
If a program has fifty modules , you need to decide , fifty times , whether you will make the next module an OO - style module .
In C++ , you do n't have to make a decision about whether or not you want OO programming and you do n't have to implement it ; it 's built into the language .
Sherman , set the wayback machine for 1957
If we dig back into history , we can find all sorts of patterns .
For example : Recurring problem :
Two or more parts of a machine language program need to perform the same complex operation .
Duplicating the code to perform the operation wherever it is needed creates maintenance problems when one copy is updated and another is not .
Solution :
Put the code for the operation at the end of the program .
Reserve some extra memory ( a " frame " ) for its exclusive use .
When other code ( the " caller " ) wants to perform the operation , it should store the current values of the machine registers , including the program counter , into the frame , and transfer control to the operation .
The last thing the operation does is to restore the register values from the values saved in the frame and jump back to the instruction just after the saved PC value .
This is a " pattern " - style description of the pattern we now know as " subroutine " .
It addresses a recurring design problem .
It is a general arrangement of machine instructions that solve the problem .
And the solution is customized and implemented to solve the problem in a particular context .
Variations abound : " subroutine with passed parameters " .
" subroutine call with returned value " .
" Re-entrant subroutine " .
For machine language programmers of the 1950s and early 1960's , this was a pattern , reimplemented from scratch for each use .
As assemblers improved , the pattern became formal , implemented by assembly - language macros .
Shortly thereafter , the pattern was absorbed into Fortran and Lisp and their successors , and is now invisible .
You do n't have to think about the implementation any more ; you just call the functions .
Iterators and model - view - controller
The last time I wrote about design patterns , it was to point out that although the movement was inspired by the " pattern language " work of Christopher Alexander , it is n't very much like anything that Alexander suggested , and that in fact what Alexander did suggest is more interesting and would probably be more useful for programmers than what the design patterns movement chose to take .
One of the things I pointed out was essentially what Norvig does : that many patterns are n't really addressing recurring design problems in object - oriented programs ; they are actually addressing deficiencies in object - oriented programming languages , and that in better languages , these problems simply do n't come up , or are solved so trivially and so easily that the solution does n't require a " pattern " .
In assembly language , " subroutine call " may be a pattern ; in C , the solution is to write result = function ( args ... ) , which is too simple to qualify as a pattern .
In a language like Lisp or Haskell or even Perl , with a good list type and powerful primitives for operating on list values , the Iterator pattern is to a great degree obviated or rendered invisible .
Henry G. Baker took up this same point in his paper " Iterators : Signs of Weakness in Object - Oriented Languages " .
I received many messages about this , and curiously , some made the same point in the same way : they said that although I was right about Iterator , it was a poor example because it was a very simple pattern , but that it was impossible to imagine a more complex pattern like Model - View - Controller being absorbed and made invisible in this way .
This remark is striking for several reasons .
It is an example of what is perhaps the most common philosophical fallacy : the writer cannot imagine something , so it must therefore be impossible .
Well , perhaps it is impossible — or perhaps the writer just does n't have enough imagination .
It is worth remembering that when Edgar Allan Poe was motivated to investigate and expose Johann Maelzel 's fraudulent chess - playing automaton , it was because he " knew " it had to be fraudulent because it was inconceivable that a machine could actually exist that could play chess .
Not merely impossible , but inconceivable !
Poe was mistaken , and the people who asserted that MVC could not be absorbed into a programming language were mistaken too .
Since I gave my talk in 2002 , several programming systems , such as Ruby on Rails and Subway have come forward that attempt to codify and integrate MVC in exactly the way that I suggested .
Progress in programming languages
Had the " Design Patterns " movement been popular in 1960 , its goal would have been to train programmers to recognize situations in which the " subroutine " pattern was applicable , and to implement it habitually when necessary .
While this would have been a great improvement over not using subroutines at all , it would have been vastly inferior to what really happened , which was that the " subroutine " pattern was codified and embedded into subsequent languages .
Identification of patterns is an important driver of progress in programming languages .
As in all programming , the idea is to notice when the same solution is appearing repeatedly in different contexts and to understand the commonalities .
This is admirable and valuable .
The problem with the " Design Patterns " movement is the use to which the patterns are put afterward : programmers are trained to identify and apply the patterns when possible .
Instead , the patterns should be used as signposts to the failures of the programming language .
As in all programming , the identification of commonalities should be followed by an abstraction step in which the common parts are merged into a single solution .
Multiple implementations of the same idea are almost always a mistake in programming .
The correct place to implement a common solution to a recurring design problem is in the programming language , if that is possible .
The stance of the " Design Patterns " movement seems to be that it is somehow inevitable that programmers will need to implement Visitors , Abstract Factories , Decorators , and Façades .
But these are no more inevitable than the need to implement Subroutine Calls or Object - Oriented Classes in the source language .
These patterns should be seen as defects or missing features in Java and C ++.
The best response to identification of these patterns is to ask what defects in those languages cause the patterns to be necessary , and how the languages might provide better support for solving these kinds of problems .
With Design Patterns as usually understood , you never stop thinking about the patterns after you find them .
Every time you write a Subroutine Call , you must think about the way the registers are saved and the return value is communicated .
Every time you build an Object - Oriented Class , you must think about the implementation of inheritance .
People say that it's all right that Design Patterns teaches people to do this , because the world is full of programmers who are forced to use C++ and Java , and they need all the help they can get to work around the defects of those languages .
If those people need help , that 's fine .
The problem is with the philosophical stance of the movement .
Helping hapless C++ and Java programmers is admirable , but it should n't be the end goal .
Instead of seeing the use of design patterns as valuable in itself , it should be widely recognized that each design pattern is an expression of the failure of the source language .
If the Design Patterns movement had been popular in the 1980's , we would n't even have C++ or Java ; we would still be implementing Object - Oriented Classes in C with structs , and the argument would go that since programmers were forced to use C anyway , we should at least help them as much as possible .
But the way to provide as much help as possible was not to train people to habitually implement Object - Oriented Classes when necessary ; it was to develop languages like C++ and Java that had this pattern built in , so that programmers could concentrate on using OOP style instead of on implementing it .
Summary Patterns are signs of weakness in programming languages .
When we identify and document one , that should not be the end of the story .
Rather , we should have the long - term goal of trying to understand how to improve the language so that the pattern becomes invisible or unnecessary . [

Canadians have kept Terry Fox 's dream alive for 40 years , says his brother
When Terry Fox ended his Marathon of Hope and announced to the country that his cancer had returned , he told Canadians to continue where he left off .
And his brother says that 's exactly what happened .
Children exposed in the womb to chemicals in cosmetics and fragrances are more likely to develop behavioral problems commonly found in children with attention deficit disorders , according to a study of New York City school - age children published Thursday .
Scientists at Mount Sinai School of Medicine reported that mothers who had high levels of phthalates during their pregnancies were more likely to have children with poorer scores in the areas of attention , aggression and conduct .
Children were 2.5 times more likely to have attention problems that were “ clinically significant ” if their mothers were among those highest exposed to phthalates , the study found .
The types of behavior that increased are found in children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and other so - called disruptive behavior disorders .
“ More phthalates equaled more behavioral problems , ” Stephanie Engel , a Mount Sinai associate professor of preventive medicine and lead author of the study , said in an interview Thursday .
“ For every increase of exposure , we saw an increase in frequency and severity of the symptoms . ”
The connection was only detected for the types of phthalates used in perfumes , shampoos , nail polishes , lotions , deodorants , hair sprays and other personal care products .
No behavioral effects were found for the phthalates used in vinyl toys and other soft plastics .
A federal law that went into effect a year ago bans phthalates in children ’s vinyl toys and other products .
But there are no U.S. restrictions on phthalates in cosmetics and other personal care items .
They are , however , banned in cosmetics sold in Europe .
Manufacturers of the products maintain that the chemicals are safe after being widely used for about 50 years .
Scientists said the study has uncovered a new problem that could be related to phthalates - effects on a child ’s developing brain .
Until now , most research has focused on their potential to block male hormones and feminize boys or contribute to male reproductive problems .
“ Clearly environmental toxicants play a role in child neurodevelopment , and phthalates , in particular , have been understudied in this area , ” Engel said .
Dr. Philip Landrigan , a pediatrician at Mount Sinai and director of the Children 's Environmental Health Center , called it “ a new area of concern ” about phthalates .
“ Clearly it needs to be replicated , as does any study that breaks new ground , but the study itself is very well done and very credible , ” he said .
The research involved 188 children between the ages of 4 and 9 who were born between 1998 and 2002 , according to the study published online in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives .
Most were from East Harlem or the Upper East Side of Manhattan , and three - quarters of them were low - income .
The children ’s scores were based on the answers that their mothers provided to standardized questions commonly used by psychiatrists and other clinicians to help diagnose attention deficit disorders .
The mothers responded to 130 questions designed to detect problematic behaviors on a 4 - point scale ranging from “ never ” to “ almost always " and to 86 questions on another test designed to measure cognitive function , such as memory .
Some effects were stronger in boys than girls , but the associations to the chemicals were still considered significant in the girls , Engel said .
The researchers did not use doctors or other clinicians to evaluate the children .
Instead , the findings were based on the mothers ’ evaluations .
" A parent 's report about a child 's behavior is certainly subjective , ” Engel said .
But she added that mothers have been found to be very accurate in assessing poor conduct , aggression and attention problems .
The mothers were tested for phthalates during pregnancy , the most sensitive time for a child ’s brain development .
In a study published last year , Korean researchers linked childhood exposure to phthalates to ADHD .
Shanna Swan , a University of Rochester epidemiologist whose research linked phthalates with feminized genitalia in baby boys , called phthalates a “ complicated picture ” for scientists to unravel because there are many different compounds and so many potential effects to look for .
But she said she found it “ very interesting ” that Engel and her team found “ so many negative associations ” for the phthalates with low molecular weights – the ones used in personal care products .
Swan was surprised that most of the effects were correlated with a phthalate metabolite , called MMP , that is found in the lowest concentrations in people .
“ It is not a metabolite usually thought of as toxic , ” said Swan , director of the Center for Reproductive Epidemiology at the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry .
The researchers said they do not know how prenatal exposure to phthalates may lead to behavioral problems .
But they theorize that it may be because the chemicals disrupt thyroid hormones , which are critical to an infant ’s brain development .
In April , the Mount Sinai team reported effects in the same group of children when they were newborns .
The girls - but not the boys - with high exposure to phthalates had differences in alertness and orientation , two indicators of neurodevelopmental effects in infants , according to that study published in the journal Neurotoxicology .
The new study raises the question of whether phthalates and other hormone - disrupting chemicals could be playing a role in the increasing rate of attention deficit disorders diagnosed in children .
Phthalates have been around for about 50 years , and it is unknown whether people ’s exposure has increased .
“ The percentage of kids diagnosed with behavioral problems has increased over time and it ’s not clear why , ” Engel said .
“ It would be a stretch to attribute it all to endocrine disruptors .
There are probably multiple different causes . ”
Nearly every human tested has traces of phthalates in his or her body , and women are most highly exposed .
“ There is sufficient evidence to be concerned about phthalates , and it ’s prudent to reduce exposure as much as possible , ” Engel said .
“ But they are so ubiquitous right now it ’s hard to eliminate exposure without regulatory action . ”
Engel said people should “ press legislators ” to restrict phthalates in adult , as well as children 's , personal care products .
Fetuses are “ uniquely vulnerable , particularly for endocrine disruptors , ” she said .
“ But we are very concerned about the problem of post - natal exposure as well .
The kids continue to be exposed as they grow up . ”
Consumers who want to learn more about the ingredients of their brands of cosmetics can use a database compiled by the Environmental Working Group at http://www.cosmeticsdatabase.com/index.php.
However , manufacturers do n't always list phthalates on their labels .
Phthalates are solvents that are often used in cosmetics because they help retain fragrances and help lotions penetrate the skin .
Many nail polish manufacturers have already eliminated phthalates , which had been commonly used to make the polish flexible and durable .
The principal author of the study was Mary Wolff , director of Mount Sinai ’s Center for Environmental Health and Disease Prevention Research .
The team also included two researchers from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and a Cornell University scientist .

President Obama to skip out on 2010 Detroit Auto Show 06 Jan 2010
Despite the hopes of the show organizers , President Barack Obama will not be attending the 2010 Detroit Auto Show next week .
According to an administration official who spoke with the Free Press today , Obama has no plans on going to Detroit for the show to pose with plug - in hybrids or electric - vehicles .
His attendance at show would remind the American citizens about his decision to rescue General Motors and Chrysler for little political benefit .
2010 Detroit Auto Show Set to Be Big -- More Than 60 Cars Set to Be Revealed 05 Jan 2010
The world 's most prestigious auto show will be in the Motor City from Jan. 11 through Jan. 24 .

Using cells from mice , scientists from Iowa and Iran have discovered a new strategy for making embryonic stem cell transplants less likely to be rejected by a recipient 's immune system .
This strategy , described in a new research report appearing in the February 2010 print issue of The FASEB Journal , involves fusing bone marrow cells to embryonic stem cells .
Once fused , the hybrid cells have DNA from both the donor and recipient , raising hopes that immune rejection of embryonic stem cell therapies can be avoided without drugs .
" Our study shows that transplanted bone marrow cells fuse not only with bone marrow cells of the recipient , but with non-hematopoietic cells , suggesting that if we can understand the process of cell fusion better , we may be able to target certain organ injuries with the patient 's own bone marrow cells and repair the tissues , " said Nicholas Zavazava , M.D. , Ph.D. , a University of Iowa researcher involved in the work .
Although the study holds great promise for future embryonic stem cell therapies , the results may be even more far reaching .
Zavazava and colleagues used two different mouse strains , one as the donor and the other as the recipient .
When bone marrow cells were engrafted into the recipient , they tested for the presence of both donor and recipient cells and found three different types of cells : donor cells , recipient cells , and fused cells that had DNA from the donor and recipient .
They then discovered that these cells could fuse with many different types of cells in addition to embryonic stem cells , including those from the liver , kidney , heart , and gut .
Although more work is necessary to determine the exact clinical outcomes , the discovery raises the possibility that bone marrow cells could be fused to transplant organs to reduce the likelihood of rejection .
They could also be fused to failing organs to support regeneration .
" Unlike machines where the same part can be used for several different makes and models , each of us is custom built , and our immune system does the quality control , " said Gerald Weissmann , M.D. , Editor - in - Chief of The FASEB Journal .
" As a result , human replacement parts , or organs , need to closely match the tissue of the recipient .
This research uses bone marrow cells to fuse with a patient tissues so that nothing transplanted is rejected by our immune systems , and brings universal graft survival closer to reality . "
FLORHAM PARK , N.J. -- Jets coach Rex Ryan sent a game ball to Marty Schottenheimer after last weekend 's playoff upset of the San Diego Chargers , the team that fired the father of New York 's offensive coordinator following a 14 - 2 regular season .
Brian Schottenheimer said he was touched when he learned of his boss ' gesture Tuesday -- and joked that it did n't even occur to him to do it .
Marty Schottenheimer was fired in February 2007 after the Chargers lost their first playoff game despite having the NFL 's best record that season .
He had 35 wins and two AFC West titles in his last three seasons in San Diego , where his son was quarterbacks coach from 2002 to 2005 .
" It felt nice to pick up the phone after the game and talk to my father , " Brian Schottenheimer said Thursday .
After Sunday 's 17 - 14 win , the son has a chance to do something his famous father never did as a head coach : reach the Super Bowl .
The Jets play Sunday in the AFC Championship Game at Indianapolis .
Marty Schottenheimer is coaching college players this week at the East - West Shrine Game in Orlando , Fla .
PRINCETON , NJ -- The 65 percentage - point gap between Democrats ' ( 88 % ) and Republicans ' ( 23 % ) average job approval ratings for Barack Obama is easily the largest for any president in his first year in office , greatly exceeding the prior high of 52 points for Bill Clinton .
Overall , Obama averaged 57 % job approval among all Americans from his inauguration to the end of his first full year on Jan. 19 .
He came into office seeking to unite the country , and his initial approval ratings ranked among the best for post - World War II presidents , including an average of 41 % approval from Republicans in his first week in office .
But he quickly lost most of his Republican support , with his approval rating among Republicans dropping below 30 % in mid-February and below 20 % in August .
Throughout the year , his approval rating among Democrats exceeded 80 % , and it showed little decline even as his overall approval rating fell from the mid-60s to roughly 50 % .
" Prior to Ronald Reagan , no president averaged more than a 40 - point gap in approval ratings by party during his term ; since then , only the elder George Bush has averaged less than a 50 - point gap . "
Thus , the extraordinary level of polarization in Obama 's first year in office is a combination of declining support from Republicans coupled with high and sustained approval from Democrats .
In fact , his 88 % average approval rating from his own party 's supporters is exceeded only by George W. Bush 's 92 % during Bush 's first year in office .
Obama 's 23 % approval among supporters of the opposition party matches Bill Clinton 's for the lowest for a first - year president .
But Clinton was less popular among Democrats than Obama has been to date , making Obama 's ratings more polarized .
Obama still has three years left in his first term and possibly seven more as president , so there is much time for the polarization of his approval ratings to subside .
However , if the current level of polarization persists through the end of his term , Obama would exceed Bush as the president with the most polarized approval ratings .
Bush 's average Republican - Democratic gap for his eight years in office was 61 points .
This included the record gap for a single approval rating : 83 points , which occurred twice -- in September 2004 ( 95 % Republican , 12 % Democratic ) and October 2004 ( 94 % Republican , 11 % Democratic ) .
The political divide in Bush 's ratings is to some extent understated , though , given the rally in public support for Bush after the Sept. 11 terror attacks , when he received record - high approval ratings .
Even with these approval ratings , he averaged a 55 - point gap in approval by party during his first term .
During his second term , the average party gap in his ratings was 68 points , higher than Obama 's to date .
The accompanying graph makes clear how much the level of political polarization has grown in Americans ' evaluations of presidents in recent decades .
Prior to Ronald Reagan , no president averaged more than a 40 - point gap in approval ratings by party during his term ; since then , only the elder George Bush has averaged less than a 50 - point gap , including Obama 's average 65 - point gap to date .
Bottom Line
As a candidate and as president , Obama -- like his immediate predecessor , Bush -- sought to bring Americans together after periods of heightened political polarization in the United States .
But despite their best intentions and efforts , both men's approval ratings have been characterized by extreme partisanship -- with high and seemingly unwavering approval from their own party 's supporters and very little from the opposition party .
The way Americans view presidents has clearly changed in recent decades , perhaps owing to the growth in variety , sources , and even politicization of news on cable television and the Internet , and the continuing popularity of politically oriented talk radio .
The outcome is that Americans evaluate their presidents and other political leaders through increasingly thick partisan lenses .
Private companies could own , operate and profit from reservoirs and other water - storage projects built with billions in taxpayer dollars under a little - noticed provision of the $ 11.1 billion water bond that was approved by the Legislature and goes before California voters next year .
Lawmakers barely discussed the provision while considering the bond , and water experts who were asked about it by The Chronicle said they knew little about it or why it was a necessary part of the plan to overhaul the state 's water system .
The bond bill 's author , state Sen .
Dave Cogdill , R- Modesto , and other backers of the proposal said the provision provides the state with flexibility for how water storage projects can be financed .
Critics , however , said it opens the door to the privatization of the state 's most precious resource as California 's population grows and water becomes more scarce .
California historically has retained control of publicly financed water projects .
Privatization could allow companies to profit by selling back to the public a resource that is essentially the lifeblood of the state economy , or using it for their own profit - making interests like agriculture .
The bond proposal makes no mention of the prospect of private entities benefiting from the water storage projects .
The stated purpose of the huge spending proposal is to ensure an adequate supply of safe , clean and reliable drinking water for Californians into the future .
It 's titled the Safe and Reliable Clean Water Drinking Act of 2010 .
Disturbing , dangerous
Consumer advocates who oppose privatization of water resources said even they were unaware the bond included such language .
They called it " disturbing " and " dangerous . "
" The bond basically spreads the cost over the state of California .
This puts us in a position of having general taxpayers subsidizing at least some profits for a private corporation .
And that 's not right , especially at a time when we have huge budget deficits , " said Mark Schlosberg , Western regional director of Food and Water Watch , a nonprofit organization in Washington .
Storage projects have been a key component of the water bond from the beginning , and Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said he would veto the whole package - which includes another $ 8 billion for drought relief , regional water management and the Sacramento - San Joaquin River Delta , among other needs - if they were not included .
In a speech at the state Capitol this summer , Schwarzenegger made that threat , saying , " We need the whole package to restore our water today and to ensure that we have water for tomorrow . "
But the bond does not guarantee that $ 3 billion in tax dollars for new water - storage projects would actually supply more water to irrigation or public water districts .
The bond provides for the formation of what are known as joint powers authorities - usually a coalition of public entities that pool resources for projects they probably could n't do , or could n't afford to do , on their own .
The water bond , though , specifically allows for the creation of joint powers authorities that " may include in their membership governmental and nongovernmental partners that are not located within their respective hydrologic regions in financing the surface storage projects . "
It goes on to state that those authorities would " own , govern , manage and operate a surface storage project . "
Tax dollars at work
Taxpayers would pay for up to half the cost of the project , with the amount based on the monetary value of " public benefits " created by the project .
Those benefits include things like flows for the delta , flood control and water for emergencies or outdoor recreation .
A now - dormant California Water Commission would be resurrected to quantify the value of things like benefits to the delta ecosystem , fish , access to boating or water skiing and water available for wildfire suppression .
The amount of money the commission decides those benefits are worth would then be handed over to the entity building the storage facility .
That entity would pay for the rest .
Senate President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg , D - Sacramento , said voters should be confident that they will get real benefits from the $ 3 billion as the commission 's decisions would be made in a public forum , allowing for citizen input and court challenges .
" Every dollar , every public dollar , will be spent on a public benefit .
That 's what the bond says and that 's what the state water commission will be charged with assuring , " he said .
Steinberg acknowledged that the tax dollars would go for construction and that a private entity may profit off that investment .
However , he said , " In order to make money , the private entity will have to add significant value to the project itself . "
Privatization request
The language in the bond allowing for private involvement came at the request of the Glenn - Colusa Irrigation District , located along the Interstate 5 corridor north of Sacramento .
That district has long worked for the construction of a new dam there , called Sites Reservoir .
Thad Bettner , general manager of the irrigation district , said water managers in the area wanted the joint powers authority included in the bill because they think collaboration could make it easier and faster to do the myriad studies necessary for such a large project .
The district estimates a reservoir would cost about $ 3.5 billion .
He said the district has not had contact with private entities that are interested in joining a joint powers authority and that he envisions such an interest as being more on the sidelines than a direct member of the authority .
" Everyone is going to have a unique approach of how you participate , " Bettner said .
He said he understands if people have concerns about private entities benefiting from public money , but " state monies are given out to all sorts of entities for all sorts of purposes . "
Cogdill , the bond bill 's author , said private involvement in a joint powers authority would give smaller water agencies like Glenn - Colusa more options in financing such a massive public works project .
He cast doubt on any private company getting involved .
" It 's hard to imagine a private entity , quite frankly , that would be interested in doing something like that given the ( public benefit ) criteria that surrounds the projects , " Cogdill said .
He echoed Steinberg 's confidence , saying that the water commission would ensure the use of taxpayer dollars on the projects " makes sense . "
Kern water bank
Those concerned about private involvement in public water resources point to the Kern Water Bank Authority to make their case .
The Kern Water Bank Authority is a joint powers authority that oversees the Kern County Water Bank , a large underground aquifer that could hold the equivalent of half of all the precipitation that falls in California during a normal year .
The water bank was started and initially funded as a state project - with $ 77 million in taxpayer dollars .
In a controversial agreement , the state officials turned control of the bank over to the Kern County Water Agency in 1995 in exchange for water rights to 45,000 acre - feet of water , or enough to meet the annual needs of about 90,000 households .
Later that year , the Kern Water Bank Authority formed as a joint powers authority that includes the Kern County Water Agency , four other water districts and one private company , the Westside Mutual Water Co .
Westside now owns 48 percent of the shares of the water bank .
The company is owned by Los Angeles billionaire Stewart Resnick and his Paramount Farms company , which owns 70,000 acres in the southern end of the San Joaquin Valley and is the world 's largest grower of pistachios and almonds .
Resnick also is a big contributor to elected officials in California , such as U.S. Sen .
Dianne Feinstein , D - San Francisco .
This year alone he and wife Lynda Resnick gave more than $ 15,000 to Steinberg , according to campaign filings with the secretary of state .
The joint powers authority that owns the water bank has spent tens of millions of dollars on the project , but the partners also have benefited .
The state has continued to support the project with grant money , according to the California Department of Water Resources .
Paramount Farms is in the midst of a significant expansion , according to the company .
Most Kern County farmers have suffered through years of drought , and the water agency there declared a state of emergency this year due to a lack of water .
Higher costs to consumers
Officials at the Department of Water Resources said they did not believe the bond would allow for private companies to be part of a joint powers agreement , despite the plain language in the proposal and lawmakers ' belief that it does .
Mark Cowin , deputy director of integrated water management for the department , said attorneys at the agency believe the bond allows for private companies to be involved through a side agreement or contract with a joint powers authority .
Still , he said , " I think this is a legal question at this point and subject to some attorney interpretation . "
Carolee Krieger , president of the California Water Impact Network , a water consumer advocacy organization , said she was shocked to learn of the joint powers authority language in the bond .
" That 's very , very dangerous because that ... opens the door to the privatization of water , " she said , predicting that would harm consumers .
" If someone is doing this privately they are doing it for their own profit ... and if there is a profit motive there , the price is going to go up for everyone . "
The bond is set to go before California voters in November and requires a simple majority vote to pass .
With Copenhagen , Obama ’s cap - and - trade bill , and numerous green policy initiatives coming out of Westminster , climate change is finally receiving the attention it deserves in a policy sense .
But the plight of people whose lives have already been devastated by climate change has received surprisingly little attention .
Fortunately , photojournalist Peter Caton ’s new exhibition of photographs from the Sundarbans region in India helps to redress this .
The Sundarbans ( meaning ‘ beautiful forest ’ in Bengali ) is a vast area in the Ganges delta comprising a network of 108 swampy , low - lying islands .
The area is unique both ecologically , as the home of the man-eating Bengal tiger , and culturally - Hindus and Muslims both worship a deity called Bonobibi .
The region ’s low elevation above sea-level and proximity to the coast made it particularly vulnerable when Cyclone Aila struck in May 2009 , destroying many of the inhabitants ’ homes .
Caton and his partner in the field , Cris Aoki Watanabe , have been working in India since 2006 .
Despite four years of experience witnessing the effects of climate change in the Sundarbans , Caton says that the devastation caused by Aila still took him by surprise .
The island ’s inaccessibility – it is three to four hours away from Kolkata , the nearest city , and can only be reached by boat – seriously hampered the relief effort and muted the media response .
‘ On one visit I met a widow who lived alone and had had to flee and set up a new home on three occasions , ’ recalled Caton , who says the Aila cyclone is just the latest sign of the impact of climate change on the region .
‘ I watched children play in their home neighbourhood knee - deep in water , ’ he added .
Rising sea-levels destroy not only homes but livelihoods as well because if salt water contaminates the inhabitants ’ rice paddies then they become unusable for three years .
‘ I met one family which had not slept for four nights for fear of the sea breaking the embankment protecting their rice field .
They were working in shifts to repair the embankment throughout the night , ’ he says .
Working in the Sundarbans also presented other technical challenges , and Caton says he ‘ was often working in mud not up to my knees , but up to my waist . ’
This , and intolerable levels of heat and humidity , make the approach he took to his photographs all the more extraordinary -
He used studio lighting in the middle of inaccessible swamps to give his photographs the same kind of glossy sheen that might be found in the pages of Marie Claire .
Although the people of the Sundarbans are isolated and poor , they are well aware of the causes of global warming .
They feel angry with the international community for having to suffer the consequences of a man-made catastrophe for which , with one of the lowest carbon footprints in the world , they are blameless .
Caton ’s new exhibition vividly underscores not only the suffering caused by global warming , but the deep unfairness of it .
After hearing a couple of HR professionals this week referring to the millennial generation as seeming to feel “ entitled ” in the workplace , I started to think . . . while the Xers had / have a strong sense of entitlement . . . the millennials are different .
I have high hopes for this new generation entering the workforce .
They do n’t just want it . . . they ’re preparing to take it !
My HR colleagues ’ comments were really directed at younger workers who in ever greater numbers , are driving to get ahead , wanting more responsibility , sooner , now even , embracing change , driving it .
Unlike the Xers and boomers who ’s brains seem to be hard - wired to resist change in the workplace .
These “ kids ” want more of a voice when they ’re at work , similar to the voice many have online , socially .
They are demanding that their company hears the voices of those in need , they are leading the charge for corporate social responsibility .
They will challenge , and want to be challenged . . . in a way that these HR leaders felt the millennials were not prepared .
In my view , being prepared means appropriate skills and the emotional intelligence and willingness to take on leadership responsibilities , to take risks .
Simple generational math tells us there is a problem looming . . . a shortage of mid and top level leaders .
It has been predicted that this leadership void is going to dramatically impact our ability to compete , to innovate .
We can develop skills but emotional readiness at a young age is a gift .
Embrace these young people willing to step - up , and coach / mentor them to quickly develop critical` “ soft ” skills .
We need them to fill a chasm that is unfillable without them .
Some have already stepped up , just look at the launched Facebook and Tom ’s Shoes .
The millennials . . . and only 25 % are old enough to be in the workforce now . . . are not “ entitled ” they are destined to expand their leadership footprint .
Their future is now !
A large crowd had gathered outside the presidential palace in the centre of Port - au - Prince .
From a distance , set against the white stucco of Haiti 's most majestic building , it looked like busloads of tourists come to ogle at the changing of the guard .
But as you got closer it became clear that this was not a sedate , stately gathering .
The first shock was the sight of the building itself .
Its domes had caved in , each at its own bizarre angle , lending the palace the dishevelled look of a drunken nun in her vestments .
Then the mass of people outside the palace shifted into focus , queuing up in neat lines at the presidential gates .
A Red Cross van was parked on the other side of the barrier , though no basic necessities appeared to be emanating from it .
Still the people queued .
When they grew aware that there were some foreign journalists in their midst , they surrounded us .
" I want you to listen to us !
Stop !
Just listen to what we have to say ! " shouted one particularly agitated man dressed in a white shirt .
We stopped , and we listened .
" It has been four days since this thing , " the man , Jean - Claude Hilaire , began .
" And nobody has come yet .
My area , Bel Air , is devastated .
About 200,000 people have lost their homes .
Twenty thousand – kids , pregnant women – are sleeping hungry in the local park .
That 's long enough .
I need to know : is anybody coming ?
Is anybody going to do anything ? "
Hilaire 's anger spoke for itself , but who did he direct it against ?
" I am very angry with Obama .
We are the first black people who put an end to slavery .
We need the first black president of the US to help us – not in four days , not in five or 15 .
Now . "
Standing beside him , Joseph Marc - Antoine spoke at less volume but with equal force .
He is now living on the street , he explained .
He eats when he has enough Haitian dollars to buy food , and worries about his brothers who live in other parts of the city and from whom he has had no communication .
" The international community has done nothing .
We need drugs .
We need drinking water .
We can still hear people shouting from the rubble .
The smell is not good .
Of dead people . "
Driving down to the centre of town from the outlying hills , the scale of the tragedy gradually revealed itself .
It began several miles outside Port - au - Prince , where a house had imploded incongruously like an empty crisp packet .
All the other houses around it were still standing and unscathed .
Yet as we drew closer to the city the frequency of the collapsed houses picked up , from every 10th house to every fifth and then second , until finally we passed entire neighbourhoods that had slid down the hill .
Earthquake turns into landslide .
About a mile from the presidential palace we came across the first body .
Gender unknown , it was wrapped entirely in blue cloth and strapped to a stretcher made of cardboard .
It had been left , perhaps as a statement , perhaps merely for logistical reasons , on a street corner under an advertising hoarding for a drinks company .
A stream of people heading up the hill , some carrying suitcases in evident flight from the destroyed city centre , passed by the corpse without a glance .
Four days in , the sight of a body lying on the street in broad daylight no longer seems to possess the power to shock .
Marching in the other direction were pall - bearers carrying on their shoulders similarly flimsy looking stretchers .
This time , the women they bore were living , though barely .
They were heading in the direction of hospitals that are overstretched and under - resourced .
A few blocks down , a side street had been turned into a makeshift morgue with up to 30 bodies laid out side by side on the gravel .
Further out , towards the waterfront , there were reports that the piles of dead bodies had begun to fuse with the mounting anger of the ­living .
According to reporters , some of the piles had been moved into more prominent locations in what appeared to be a macabre statement of billowing frustration .
Everywhere there were the symbols and language of death .
Driving into the city , we followed a team of foreign ­rescue workers with a kennel at the back to house their sniffer dog .
It was marked " cadavers " .
The carnage has not discriminated .
From the presidential palace to shacks , from the houses of the rich on top of the hill to the poor quarters at their feet , every­thing and everyone has succumbed to the force of the quake .
A hospital for children had concertinaed , its little charges presumably still inside .
Only the wooden front doors of the building are standing .
Nor were wealthy foreigners immune .
At the Montana hotel , one of the most exclusive in the city , high up on the hillside , a team of French firefighters were inching their way into a tunnel they had carved in the side of the imploded building .
Five days ago it had been one of the plum attractions of this deeply troubled city – a spanking new high - rise hotel with all mod cons .
Though its high - rise nature now looks distinctly unwise .
The French rescue workers had managed to perform one of those miracles of these dreadful scenes .
They succeeded in pulling out four Americans alive – two who had been lucky enough to be in the hotel 's lift at the second the earthquake struck , providing them with an air pocket and an escape route , and two others who were in the reception area .
Though death was the dominant theme through Port - au - Prince 's shattered streets , the will for survival boomed out everywhere we went .
Improvisation – always the primary skill in poor countries such as Haiti – has gone into overdrive .
Blue plastic sheets have been turned into tents on the streets , a spouting water hydrant becomes a communal shower , leaves plucked from the weeds growing wild on the verges of the roads are used as a poultice to heal the smashed leg of a boy .
Directly opposite the presidential palace the formal gardens that had been designed as manifestation of national pride have become a vision of its desperation , packed full of families ­living on the ground with only sheets above their head .
An extended family of about 20 people , largely women and children , is living in one such improvised home a stone 's throw from the caved - in glory of the palace .
Among them is seven - year - old Marie , who has a soiled bandage wrapped around her head .
When the family 's home collapsed , she was inside but was small enough to be pulled out .
Her mother , Souvenir , was not so fortunate .
Her relatives retrieved her body , wrapped her in cloth , put her in a coffin and carried her to the nearest cemetery , where they buried her .
" I feel so bad .
There 's nothing for us .
I can not eat any more , I have nothing to drink , " said Magda Cayo , Souvenir 's sister .
Her son Nicolas , wearing a Michael ­Jackson T - shirt , said the tentload of the Cayo family were making do by buying scraps of food and water whenever they could put together a dollar here , a dollar there .
" I heard that Obama is sending a lot of things to Port - au - Prince .
But we have n't seen any yet .
Maybe they are on the way , " he said .
In fact , the carnage has discriminated .
On the outskirts of the city we drove past the US embassy , which stands solidly and squarely in its own estate , a statement of national pride of another sort .
The building has not a scratch on its fine granite walls .
Not a blade of grass is out of place in the lawn in front .
Even earthquakes meet their match .

WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) -- Private - sector firms in the U.S. eliminated 84,000 jobs in December , according to the ADP employment report released Wednesday .
It was the fewest jobs lost since March 2008 .
The private - sector has shed jobs for 23 months in a row .
In November , a revised 145,000 jobs were lost compared with the 169,000 originally reported , ADP said .
The ADP index does not include government jobs .
The ADP jobs data come two days before the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its estimate of December nonfarm payrolls .
Economists surveyed by MarketWatch are looking for payrolls to rise 10,000 in the BLS survey , the first gain in two years .

JANUARY 29 -- John Edwards 's ex-mistress is seeking to suppress what appears to be a sex tape featuring her and the disgraced politician , according to court records .
Rielle Hunter yesterday secured a restraining order against a former Edwards aide in connection with " a personal video recording that depicted matters of a very private and personal nature . "
Andrew Young , the ex-Edwards assistant , has said he is in possession of a tape showing Edwards having sex with a woman he believes to be Hunter , who gave birth to Edwards 's daughter Frances Quinn in February 2008 .
According to an affidavit filed yesterday in North Carolina Superior Court , Hunter reported that she was having an " intimate relationship " with Edwards in 2006 , and that the video was made around September of that year ( a copy of Hunter 's affidavit can be found here ) .
In December 2006 , Hunter recalled , she decided to destroy the video .
" Therefore I opened up the plastic casing of the miniDV cassette and pulled out the tape contained therein .
However , because I was concerned that persons seeking information about my activities were or could be searching my trash , I decided to instead store the remains of the miniDV tape in a hatbox in which I stored other important personal items in order to maintain possession and control over the Video . "
The video , which Hunter hid in a hatbox at her North Carolina residence , apparently came into Young 's possession in mid-2008 after Hunter asked him to retrieve her passport , which was stored in the hatbox .
When the National Enquirer disclosed Hunter 's relationship with Edwards , Young came forward and falsely claimed to have carried on an affair with Hunter and fathered her child .
After repeatedly lying about his involvement with Hunter , Edwards recently admitted he was Frances Quinn 's father .

U.S. President Barack Obama waves as he leaves an announcement on government efficiency at the White House in Washington December 21 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Jim Young
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - President Barack Obama may delay his year - end Hawaiian vacation to remain in Washington as a bill to overhaul the U.S. healthcare system makes its way through the U.S. Senate , the White House said on Tuesday .
“ They are going to make a decision later this evening about when the president will leave , ” White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said at a press briefing .
Obama had been expected to leave for Hawaii , the state where he grew up , on Wednesday .
Obama ’s fellow Democrats in the Senate cleared the second of three 60 - vote hurdles early on Tuesday to move the landmark legislation -- Obama ’s top domestic policy priority -- one step closer to passage by Christmas .
Republicans , who have just 40 seats in the Senate , have vowed to use every tactic they can to delay passage of the measure , which has consumed Congress for months and inspired intense political brawling .
" Best " ?
Who am I kidding ?
I do n't believe there 's any way to determine what the best sports photographs of the year are .
Photography is simply too subjective .
Almost every professional photographer has stories about winning awards for mediocre pictures while his or her best work goes unrecognized .
A contest is only as relevant as the judges making the choices , and the same contest with different judges would produce very different winners .
So perhaps I should call these photographs my favorites , because that 's what they are .
They reflect my personal tastes and biases , which regular readers of this blog will recognize : an attraction to the obscure , a passion for the absurd , and a love of that intersection between sport and culture .
Pictures full of humor , beauty , and moments both subtle and decisive draw me in .
Editing this blog has been pure joy as photographers from all over the world astound me every week with their skills .
Each week there 's always many more photographs I want to share than I have room for .
And this entry is no different .
Part one of the 100 Best Sports Photographs of 2009 covers the months of January , February , and March .
I 'll post the rest on successive Thursdays this month .
I hope you enjoy the pictures as much I do .

Air France currently allows obese people to buy two seats at a discount Air France is to offer a free second seat to obese passengers " for their own comfort " , the airline has said .
Overweight passengers can already buy an extra one with a 25 % discount , but from 1 February , this will be refunded if their flight is not full .
It also confirmed that , in common with other airlines , an obese traveller could be prevented from flying .
This was to ensure a flight can be evacuated within 90 seconds , the BBC 's transport correspondent said .
It came down to the discretion of the captain whether to let them fly or tell them to disembark for safety reasons , Richard Scott said .
The airline said it had no intention of forcing heavier passengers to pay for a second seat .
It explained that if an overweight person turned up without having booked an extra one , the check - in staff would not intervene .
The passenger would continue to the plane , where the airline said " in 99 % of cases " on - board staff would work something out as planes were rarely completely full so they would be able to position them next to an empty seat .
Other non-overweight passengers could also book a second seat for a 25 % discount , Air France said .
But they would not get the refund if the plane was not full when it took off .
Air France is part of Air France - KLM , the largest airline group in Europe by revenue .

What started out as a family celebration of New Year 's Eve in the Angel and Crown pub on Roman Road , Bethnal Green ended with four family members being attacked by a gang of muslim thugs .
Two brothers , Thomas and David Barry , had their bodies pummelled and their faces smashed when they were set upon by a gang of up to 30 " youths " armed with hammers .
The brothers had gone outside the pub to go to the aid of Thomas 's son and his 16 yr. old girlfriend who the muslim gang had already attacked .
Clearly these hammer carrying muslim ' pack of animals ' were looking for and maliciously prepared to wage street jihad - with their usual cowardly MO of greatly outnumbering any chosen victims :
" Thomas 's wife Bridget said : " They hit my husband in the head with a hammer four times .
He went down on the fourth blow .
" I came out of the pub and saw him lying on the ground in a pool of his own blood .
I thought he was dead . "
Bridget , who lives in Grove Road , said her husband had suffered deep cuts and bruising to his head , a broken foot and had surgery to piece his eye socket back together on Monday .
But she said her brother - in - law was in an even worse state and needed facial reconstructive surgery to repair his jaw , which had been broken in six places , and a broken palate .
Bridget 's 18 - year - old son escaped with minor injuries but his 16 - year - old girlfriend needed eight stitches to her head and ear after she was hit in the side of the head with a vodka bottle .
" SOURCE
David and Thomas Barry were left smashed , bloody and laying unconscious in the road .
Police from the muslim ' enriched ' Tower Hamlets " ... said the suspects are all aged 16 - 18 and are Asian .
One suspect is described as fat with black spiky hair and was wearing a black jacket . "
I suppose we should at least be thankful that the police did n't trot out the usual statement of this attack being a " one off " .
Clearly evidence grows daily as to the contrary .
The results of this latest Street Jihad attack - here is an image of David Barry 's face / skull - post attack :
But for the miracle of breakthrough maxillofacial surgery , David and his brother Thomas would have been disfigured for life .
As it is David has suffered permanent nerve damage with no feelings in the right side of his face as well as impaired hand / eye coordination which is likely to have a deleterious affect on his resuming his career as a communications engineer .
Channel 4 is currently preparing a documentary on the Barry brothers ' surgery .
What do you think are the chances Channel 4 will highlight escalating muslim gang violence as being responsible for the Barry 's horrific injuries ?
Article in full :
BROTHERS who began 2010 in hospital after a horrific hammer attack have undergone radical facial reconstruction surgery to heal their horrendous injuries .
Anyone who did not know what happened to Thomas and David Barry on New Year 's
Eve would not believe the ordeal they have been through over the last few weeks .
Both brothers were hit with hammers by a gang of up to 30 youths during the attack near the Angel and Crown pub in Roman Road , Bethnal Green , knocking them both unconscious and leaving them needing expert surgery to rebuild their faces .
But less than three weeks after their surgery , the signs of both the attack and their operations have almost completely vanished thanks to the specialist maxillofacial surgical team at the Royal London Hospital .
The injuries of younger brother David , 41 , were so severe that half of his face was caved in with a broken cheekbone , broken jaw in six places , broken palate and broken teeth .
Experts at the hospital in Whitechapel , led by consultant surgeon Simon Holmes , worked for four - and - a- half hours to rebuild the right side of his face , fixing titanium plates to his bone with 25 nuts and bolts .
David said : " The roof of my mouth was split in half so the right side of my face had dropped and my eyes were n't level .
Half of my teeth were in the normal place and the other half were about an inch lower .
" They went in through the inside of my mouth and popped my eye out of its socket so they could fit the plates in my cheek ; it 's amazing what they can do .
" And I 've been left with absolutely no scarring because it was all done from inside . "
But David , a communications engineer who lives in Ilford , said the repercussions of the attack will stay with him for life and doctors do not yet know the extent of the permanent damage done .
" I 've got no feeling in the right side of my face , " he explained .
" The nerves were so badly damaged that I 'm never going to get it back and I 'll have to live with it forever .
" My eyes are still slightly out of alignment and because of that my hand - eye coordination has gone out the window .
" I do n't know how that 'd going to affect my ability to do my job yet ; I work with very fine wires so hand - eye coordination is very important . "
Brother Thomas , 45 , a French polisher who lives in Arbery Road , Bow with his wife Bridget and son Christopher , was hit once in the face and three times over the head with a hammer during the attack .
He also underwent surgery by Mr Holmes at the Royal London for a shattered eye socket .
He said : " They made an incision in my hairline and basically tyre levered my eye socket back out . "
Both brothers are due to take part in a Channel 4 documentary about the work of the
Maxillofacial department at the Royal London Hospital .
Modern , and especially Contemporary
Art is astonishing when it comes to recycling , or reusing and recreating , rather – after all , all of Art is a constant recreation … – teaching us that it is the context and meaning that gives objects their artistic atributes , not its material or technical quality .
Does this make us all artists ?
It ’s very unlikely , but one thing is for sure , the line that devides it is getting more and more blurred and Art has definitely left the museums and democratised itself .
A sign of the times .
Maybe we ’ll experience some resistance to call Jeremy Mayer an artist .
It ’s arguable .
It ’s a fact that he ’s someone without a formal training in this area , he ’s self - taught , that is .
But that does n’t really matter and did n’t stop him from venturing into this world .
He started out by trying out other artistic areas , from design to hiper - realist drawing , from molding to foundry .
Finally , he seems to have settled for typewriters .
We Recommend :
[ Haskell - cafe ] ANN : Happstack 0.4.1
Happstack 0.4.1 STABLE is now available .
We recommend that all users of Happstack update to 0.4.1 immediately .
Migration from Happstack 0.3 should be trivial .
There was one race condition in happstack - state which could cause a state event to fail under heavy congestion .
Happstack is the Haskell Application Server Stack .
It is a scalable framework for developing web applications .
It is similar in purpose to Django , RoR , Turbogears , Grails , Seaside , etc .
Using less buzzwords , it is a collection of libraries which can be used to develop a self - contained server application which does not require SQL or Apache ( though it can integrate with both ) .
It includes : * an HTTP server * a rich DSL for deconstructing HTTP Requests and generating Responses * HTML / XML /etc templating via HStringTemplate , HSP , or Text .
XHtml * a persistent data store based on user defined Haskell data types with ACID properties and state migration * and more !!
Happstack 's modular nature means it is easy to integrate unrelated 3rd party modules such as Pandoc , or to add support for an alternative templating system .
Additionally , it does not exclude you from using SQL , or supporting other protocols besides HTTP .
HOMEPAGE : http://www.happstack.com/
SUPPORTED PLATFORMS : Happstack supports GHC 6.8 , 6.10 , and 6.12 , under GNU / Linux , FreeBSD , OS X , and Windows .
GHC 6.12 currently requires a minor patch to HJScript .
Details here : http://groups.google.com/group/haskell-server-pages/browse_thread/thread/56f388fdbaec1420
INSTALL : 1 . ensure that ~/.cabal / bin is in your $ PATH 2 . cabal update 3 . cabal install happstack * see SUPPORTED PLATFORMS for information about GHC 6.12 NOTABLE CHANGES :
For a complete list of changes see : http://www.patch-tag.com/r/mae/happstack/snapshots/all/history
Removed : * happstack - contrib has been completely removed .
If you were using something in it , please complain on the mailing list .
* removed Happstack .
Server .S3 -- newer , better maintained S3 libraries are on hackage now * removed unsupported spread - based multimaster support fileServe : * now with sendfile ( ) support !
On supported platforms sendfile allows files to be served from the disk to the network in a zero -copy fashion .
This means faster transfers , less memory and CPU usage , and no file handle leaks .
( hopefully ) .
sendfile uses native sendfile ( ) support on Linux , Windows , OS X , and FreeBSD .
Other platforms will use a sendfile emulation mode .
We recommend that you use sendFile instead of sendFileStrict or sendFileLazy , unless you have specific needs and know some reason why you must use sendFileStrict or sendFileLazy .
* FileServe internals majorly refactored .
FileServe now provides a modular way of building your own fileServe - like functions .
Also includes functions for serving a single file instead of the contents of a directory .
* added more complete list of mime - types * automatically redirect from foo to foo / if foo is a directory * filter .
and .. from request path , but allow filenames and directories which start with .
happstack - server : * ServerMonad instance for ErrorT * Added ServerMonad , FilterMonad , and WebMonad for XMLGenT * Added secure flag to cookies .
Defaults to False .
* fix supportsIPv6 to work with newer versions of network library * simpleHTTPWithSocket + bindPort for H.S.SimpleHTTP
( you can use this to start the server as root , bind to the socket , and then drop privileges . )
* Fixed Accept - Encoding parser to accepts encodings with a - in them .
Added additional tests to acceptEncodingParserTest * fix so basicAuth sets correct response code and headers .
* SimpleHTTP : added trailingSlash .
Guard which checks that Request URI ends with a / * decode body of PUT requests not just POST * added ifModifiedSince guard * added host and withHost guards to SimpleHTTP ( similar to dir and path , but for the requested hostname ) other : * happstack - state : Correct an embarrassing race condition bug .
* happstack - data : Exported getSafeGet and getSafePut * happstack : add state transition code to guestbook ( add email to form , handler , and state ) , and tar of example _local state before transition experimental : * happstack - state : now has experimental replication support using Amazon Web Services .
This support is disabled by default .
This feature is highly experimental , may not work , and may even be completely removed in future versions ( though , hopefully not ) .

And everyone who filed bug reports , tested RC1 and RC2 , and anyone else I missed .
As someone who has appreciated unique , novel ideas , it makes me incredibly happy when my players tell me my games are original .
I put a lot of effort into making sure that my games are something the players have never seen before ( and more importantly I as the GM have never seen before either – otherwise I ’d get bored while running it ) .
I suppose it shocks people a little when they ask me where I get my ideas , and I tell them , “ I steal them . ”
Back when I was writing sketch comedy in college I obsessed over coming up with an original premise for each sketch .
Leave the boardroom sketches for the rest of the troupe , I wanted something original .
Well , there was n’t a lot of original material to work with .
It seemed like everything had been done .
There was even less available when you stopped and considered all the sketches I had n’t seen before .
With no way to know what was and was n’t original I asked a friend there for some help .
What he taught me is that you can pretty safely assume that any premise has been used before .
What makes it original is where you go with it .
There have been a million boardroom sketches before .
Probably a thousand of them have involved George W. Bush .
But how many times has he taken up communism because he sucks at democracy ?
That ’s new and original , even though it started with an overused trope .
This applies to D&D too .
Take a premise or scene and push it in whatever direction you like with your own personal spin .
It diverges from the original even more when you realize you have to bring your players to the premise , and the approach they take will be unique too .
Approach * premise * exit will be something unique , even if the premise was n’t .
I wrote up an example of me ripping off a movie scene for a forum .
As much as I ’d like to retype it , this thread is about stealing so it ’s copy paste time .
At least it ’s only my own words I ’m yoinking …
Here ’s an example .
A couple games ago I ’d watched The Good , The Bad , and The Ugly while planning game start .
I wanted to copy the scene where Tuco is getting hanged for his many crimes and Clint shoots the rope so he can collect Tuco ’s reward in another town .
Well , it ’s D&D so thematically speaking shooting the rope does n’t make sense .
I also did n’t want that to be the plot , just an introduction .
I ’d always wanted to execute a player character though and I really like messing with expectations .
So let ’s hang a PC .
Oh and let ’s not just set him up for the hanging , let ’s actually go through with it !
At this point I talked to a roommate who was playing in the game .
He ’s big in the larp writing community and appreciates attempts to mess with players heads .
I told him we’d be introducing his character at the second session , but for the first game he ’d have to play this Belkar clone and not to tell the other players that it was n’t his real character .
Through various other means the players all arrived to see the hanging .
They were surprised , but not shocked when a PC arrived with his head in a noose .
I ’d been spreading rumors that the guy being hanged was innocent ( he had murdered quite a few people , but was being hanged for another crime that was n’t his ) .
The convention here would be for the PCs to jump in and save him .
They were nervous about it , but told me that they were n’t about to jump the guards over some rumors especially when it was pretty clear that the guy being hanged deserved to die .
Okay .
Halfling hangs and players apologize for making the other guy roll up a new character .
It did n’t quite go as planned of course , but what fun would GMing be if it did ?
The resulting session was new and interesting , and it took the PCs out of their comfort zones as none of them had been in a situation like that before that went against their expectations .
So just to sum up , the intro was a standard D&D introduction where a bunch of people are brought to one place ( in this case it was a festival culminating in a tourney and execution ) , a ripped off and distorted scene from a popular movie , and a broken convention that left the PCs wondering if they did the right thing .
And it all started with that ripped off scene .
I ’ve always like the philosophy that the journey is more important than the destination .
This is true in game , in both the story and the meta sense .
You can write a game that takes a scenic tour between famous scenes in Hollywood .
Each of those scenes by itself is unoriginal , but the path you take in getting from one to the next and what you pick up and carry through each of those scenes will be something new that your players ought to enjoy .

In the wake of a recent speech by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton condemning countries that censor the internet and engage in hacking , China has lobbed a return volley and accused the United States of hypocrisy and initiating cyberwarfare against Iran .
An editorial in the People 's Daily – the primary mouthpiece for China 's Communist Party – accused the United States of doublespeak and of using " online warfare " to instigate violent unrest in Iran with Twitter and YouTube following that country 's national elections in June .
" We 're afraid that in the eyes of American politicians , only information controlled by America is free information , only news acknowledged by America is free news , only speech approved by America is free speech , and only information flow that suits American interests is free information flow , " said the Sunday editorial , according to the Guardian newspaper .
The editorial was taking aim at a speech by Clinton last Thursday in which she said that access to information , and the internet , is a basic human right .
She said that countries around the world were erecting virtual walls in place of the physical walls that generally characterize oppressive regimes .
Clinton urged U.S. media companies to challenge foreign governments ' demands for censorship and surveillance .
Clinton did not mention China specifically but also said that " Countries or individuals that engage in cyberattacks should face consequences and international condemnation . "
She was speaking in the wake of an announcement from Google that it had decided to stop censoring search results on its Chinese - language search engine and may vacate China altogether after discovering that it , and nearly three dozen other companies , had been the target of a coordinated hack attack that originated in China .
The People 's Daily , however , did n't take the speech calmly .
" Behind what America calls free speech is naked political scheming .
How did the unrest after the Iranian election come about ? " said the paper .
" It was because online warfare launched by America , via YouTube video and Twitter microblogging , spread rumours , created splits , stirred up and sowed discord between the followers of conservative reformist factions . "
Last June , the U.S. State Department asked Twitter to postpone scheduled maintenance that would have increased its server capacity but also would have closed down the system for a short time during the daytime hours in Iran , preventing Iranian protestors from using the social - networking service to organize and chronicle a government crackdown .
" When we worked with our network provider yesterday to reschedule this planned maintenance , we did so because events in Iran were tied directly to the growing significance of Twitter as an important communication and information network , " Twitter co-founder Biz Stone disclosed in a blog post at the time .
" It made sense for Twitter and for NTT America to keep services active during this highly visible global event . "
Iranian voters took to the streets to protest the election between President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and defeated challenger Mir Hossein Mousavi , accusing the government of having rigged the election .
The unrest resulted in unknown numbers of deaths and arrests .
Iranian protestors used numerous social networking services to communicate with others inside and outside the country about the events in their country .
A State Department spokesman at the time denied that the U.S. was intruding on Iran 's domestic affairs .
" This is about giving their voices a chance to be heard .
One of the ways that their voices are heard are through new media , " spokesman Ian Kelly told Reuters .
China began blocking YouTube last March in anticipation of protests on the anniversary of uprisings in Tibet .
It also began blocking Twitter in June , prior to the 20th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square uprising .
Reuters reports that Facebook has also been down in the country since July .

Google 's real - time search feed can be found at Google.com / trends Google has launched real - time search to give users access to up - to - the - second information .
The search giant said it will draw real - time data from over a billion pages on the web .
The new feature will also include updates from Twitter and the social networks of MySpace and Facebook .
" Information is being created at a pace I have never seen before and in this environment , seconds matter , " said Google fellow Amit Singhal .
At an event staged at the Computer History Museum in California , the company said this was the first time that any search engine has integrated the real - time web into its results page .
" There is so much information being generated out there that getting you relevant information is the key to the success of a product like this .
It 's all about relevance , relevance , relevance , " said Mr Singhal .
Technical feat The Silicon Valley company said the feature was now live and would take a couple of days to be rolled out across the world .
Updates from Twitter will be included right away , while those from Facebook and MySpace are not expected to be integrated into results until the new year .
Real - time search will also be available on phones
The real - time stream of data will be shown within Google 's normal results page .
The feature will also be available on smart phones , such as the iPhone and those running Google 's Android operating system .
Google would not be drawn on the financial details of the deals it has done with Twitter , MySpace and Facebook .
Facebook has publicly stated it is not making money on this collaboration and that the updates it will give Google come from the public profile pages that can be seen by anybody on the web .
From a technical standpoint , the company said this was a landmark event in the world of search .
I 'm not sure how much wine was drunk in the process of coming up with a name for this feature , but you certainly have to be sober to say Google Goggles a few times in a row

" This is a technical marvel , getting all these updates in seconds , making them searchable right after they are posted and making them available so that anyone in the world can find them , " said Google 's vice - president of search Marissa Mayer .
" The updates ( on Twitter ) are so truthful and so in the moment .
That is a really , really powerful part of this .
Are you at this event right now ?
Are you on this ski slope right now ?
And because of that ' right now ' element of it , this is hugely valuable data , " Ms Mayer told BBC News .
Twitter founder Biz Stone told reporters the company was " super excited to be doing this with Google .
Relevance , relevance , relevance - they are good at it , we 're not , " he said .
Competition drive Reaction to Google 's announcement has been largely positive in the blogosphere .
" It looks really great and is a next step in search , " said Bas van den Beld at Searchcowboys.com .
Microsoft has also done a deal to show Twitter 's public updates feed " The announcement signals an aggressive push by Google to maintain its mantle as search - innovation leader amid unaccustomed pressure from rivals , " said Ryan Singel from Wired.com Danny Sullivan of SearchEngineLand said with Microsoft pulling out the stops with its own Bing search engine , Google needed to show it had its eye on the prize .
" From the PR standpoint it would not have been helpful to be a leading information resource and have people pointing out that you do n't have certain kinds of information , especially when you have a rival like Bing cutting deals and diligently going after Google , " Mr Sullivan told BBC News .
Google has around 65 % of the search market while Microsoft 's Bing which has just done a deal with Yahoo commands nearly 30 % .
Computer vision
The search giant also unveiled Google Goggles , a new visual search feature that lets consumers use a picture instead of keywords as the search query .
The tool compares the image users have taken with Google 's database to return relevant information .
" In the nature of computer vision we are at the beginning here and the technology is just getting underway , " said Google 's vice - president of engineering , Vic Gundotra .
" This today marks the beginning of this visual journey .
We are at the cusp of a an entire new computing era where devices will help us explore the world around us . "
The feature will be available on the Android platform .

Is it just me , or does this remind anyone of the pictures in the back of Mad Magazine ?
The kind where you fold the picture to reveal another image .
SANAA ( Reuters ) - Yemeni Shi’ite rebels accused the U.S. air force on Tuesday of joining attacks against them , and killing at least 120 people in a raid in the north of the poor Arab state .
“ The savage crime committed by the U.S. air force shows the real face of the United States , ” said the northern rebels , who often report attacks by the Yemeni and Saudi fighter planes , on their website .
There was no immediate report of U.S. comment on the alleged incident .
The rebels , who are fighting the Yemeni army and forces of neighboring Saudi Arabia , posted videos on the Internet that appeared to show people trying to clear rubble covering human bodies .
On Sunday , the rebels said at least 70 people had been killed in a Saudi air raid on a market in the northern town of Razeh .
The reports could not be verified as aid workers and media have limited access to the conflict zones .
U.S. - allied Saudi Arabia , the world ’s largest oil exporter , fears the growing instability in neighboring Yemen could turn into a major security threat for the kingdom by allowing al Qaeda to gain a stronger foothold there .
In Geneva , a U.N. official said U.N. agencies had appealed for $ 177 million to help people affected by the conflict .
“ The humanitarian situation is deteriorating , notably for 200,000 people displaced by successive conflicts since 2004 , ” Elisabeth Byrs of the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs ( OCHA ) , told reporters in Geneva .
“ We demand full and unlimited access to these displaced populations as well as a halt to attacks on humanitarian convoys , ” Byrs said .
U.S. - based Human Rights Watch ( HRW ) accused Yemeni security forces of widespread abuses and the killing of at least 11 protesters in response to calls for secession in southern Yemen .
“ Yemeni authorities are violating basic rights in the name of maintaining national unity , ” said Joe Stork , deputy director at Human Rights Watch ’s Middle East division .
“ Southern Yemenis should have the right to peacefully assemble and express their opinions , even on critical issues like secession , ” he said .
“ On six occasions during 2008 and 2009 ... security forces opened fire on unarmed protesters , often without warning and aiming at them from short range .
At least 11 people were killed and dozens were wounded , ” HRW said in a report on Yemen .
Activists , some of whom belong to the Southern Movement , have stepped up demonstrations in the past year , complaining that the government and northerners exploit and discriminate against the south , which holds most of Yemen ’s oil facilities .
Yemen ’s state news agency Saba said Information Minister Hasan al - Lawzi met an HRW delegation on Tuesday in Sanaa and said , “ Yemen is a democratic country which supports press freedom and respects human rights . ”

This article is part of the Lending Club Debtbuster Challenge .
I have written two other in the series : “ Debt Help – The Lending Club DebtBuster Challenge ” and “ Debt Consolidation – It Can Work . ”
How is debt slavery ?
Do n’t let anyone fool you … no debt is good .
Sure , some debt is better than other debt … but no debt is actually “ good . ”
Although there are always exceptions to the rule , typically “ bad debt ” refers to any high interest consumer debt ( like credit cards ) while “ better debt ” alludes to low interest debt ( like 1st mortgages and student loans . )
Whether bad or better , debt is bondage and it presumes upon our future ability to earn .
Let ’s examine 3 trust worthy sources to prove the point , then mull over a few ways out .
How is debt slavery ?
1 . The bible tells us so …
While the bible does not equate debt to sin , is does equate debt to slavery .
“ The rich ruleth over the poor , and the borrower is servant to the lender . ” – Proverbs 22:7
Now let ’s apply Proverbs 22:7 to a modern context :
Bankers charge us interest to borrow their money .
We labor for the better part of our lives to repay the bankers .
Sounds like debt slavery to me .
2. Common sense tells us so …
Would you rather have debt or be debt free ?
And therein lies our common sense answer . 🙂
Yes … it is possible to earn more in interest on our investments than we pay in interest on our debts , but it ’s risky at best .
Getting rid of debt guarantees us a rate of return equal to the interest rate of the debt .
While in debt , no investment can guarantee you specific and consistent returns better than eliminating the debt itself .
Ask yourself this question , “ If you were debt free … would you continue to work full - time at your current job ? ”
If your answer was even partially no , then you are likely in some form of debt slavery .
Our grandparents knew the dangers of debt slavery … why do n’t we ?
3. Mathematics tell us so …
If we were to consider neither of the previous points , we can always turn to the concrete wisdom of mathematics .
[ Borrowing + interest = more debt ] [ income – more debt = less savings & less investing ] [ more debt + less savings + less investing = more labor & less giving ]
The less money we borrow the less interest we pay to others , the more we can save , the more we can invest , the more our money pays us , which ultimately translates into less necessary labor and a greater ability to give .
I trust the bible , common sense , and mathematics .
What do you trust ?
Ways out of debt slavery
1. Sacrifice and repay
Quit acting like you deserve to go out to eat 3 – 5 times per week and get a clue .
You ’re not alone , me and the misses spent nearly $ 6,000 dining out in 2008 and thought it was totally normal … our brains were in debt slavery !
As a result of this mindset we grew complacent toward our fiscal health and mathematics caught up to us .
Our biggest problem was n’t massive bouts of irresponsible spending but rather a plain old fashioned lack of self - discipline .
Now it is time to sacrifice and repay .
2. Consolidate , sacrifice , and repay
Sometimes debt consolidation makes perfect sense , it did for us .
If your goal is simply to shift debt around , then you are approaching debt consolidation inappropriately .
The healthy purpose of debt consolidation is to combine several higher interest debts into one lower interest loan to be repaid on a graduated scale .
I advise you steer clear of debt consolidation service companies and recommend instead negotiating you own settlements and securing a debt consolidation loan through Lending Club .
We used LC to consolidate debt which saved us $ 500 and a bunch of stamps ! 🙂
Use this calculator to help determine if personal debt consolidation is right for your situation .
3. Bankruptcy
“ If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed , ye shall say unto this mountain , Remove hence to yonder place ; and it shall remove ; and nothing shall be impossible unto you . ” – Matthew 17:20 b
Should you file ?
I advise against it at all costs and beg you to turn to God instead .
Although I do not presume to know the will of God , I do know that he does not desire his children be in debt slavery .
In the scriptures Jesus healed people according to their faith and belief in his ability to do so ( Matthew 9:27 - 30 ) and likewise will help us according to his will and our belief .
If faith in God is not for you then please make sure to consult your attorney and / or accountant to determine if the last ditch effort of bankruptcy is your only viable alternative remaining .
Are you in debt slavery ?
What is your plan for getting out ?

AUSTIN — The Texas Department of State Health services has about four months to destroy blood samples taken and stored without permission from millions of babies .
State law allows the department to collect those blood samples for routine disease testing , but the state ’s been hanging on to millions of blood samples since the testing began in 2002 .
Dad Michael
Neff says blood samples taken from his two daughters should have been destroyed .
He fears the state might have used those blood samples in research projects or sold them to insurance companies .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
[ efoods ]
“ I do n’t think my kid ’s DNA should be out there , and if it is it should be mine and their mother ’s decision , ” Neff said .
The Department of State Health Services now agrees with Neff ’s position .
They ’ve settled a lawsuit filed by the Texas Civil Rights Project over the samples which the state was keeping without getting permission from parents .

The maintenance men at my apartment complex found a litter of month - old kittens behind my apartment complex .
Walle , the kitten I picked out from the litter , was so small that he fit in the palm of my hand ; he could barely walk he was so little and weak .
He was n’t gaining enough weight from wet catfood , and so I had to feed him kitten milk replacer .
He eventually got stronger and gained weight , and today he is a happy , healthy ( and very large ) cat .
Lord Falconer , a former roomate of Tony Blair , had suspended the initial inquest , performed through the Hutton Inquiry , which concluded that Dr Kelly had sliced his own wrist .
However , leading medical experts believe that suicide was unlikely .
" The primary cause of death is given as hemorrhage .
And we do not believe , as surgeons , that such hemorrhage would have been so rapid or so voluminous that Dr Kelly would have died from that .
We want to see an inquest for Dr Kelly .
I think it ’s highly likely it will be found that there was foul play , " says Dr David Halpin , an orthopedic surgeon ...
The Hutton Inquiry was legally unique , using its own rules and procedures to examine the cause of a single death .
A British member of parliament says the normal rules for inquests were not applied .
" No one was required to give evidence under oath , nobody could be found guilty of perjury , there was no proper cross-examination and all the normal safeguards related to a coroner ’s inquest were simply not present .
A proper inquest into the death of David Kelly , that ’s not happened .
And even if you do n’t subscribe to my view that he was murdered , you would agree , I hope , that everybody is entitled to an inquest if they die a violent death , " says Norman Baker , a Liberal Democrat MP .
A documentary released by the CBC in March called Anthrax War traces the recent history of biowarfare and the mysterious deaths of those involved including Dr Kelly .
Anthrax
War also investigates the mysterious deaths of some of the world 's leading anthrax scientists , including Dr. David Kelly , the UK's top military microbiologist , the Soviet defector Dr. Vladimir Pasechnik , and Dr. Bruce Ivins .
The FBI claims - despite the doubts of highly ranked U.S. officials - that Ivins was the only person behind the U.S. anthrax murders .
In tracing the 2001 bio -terror attacks in the U.S. to the heart of the U.S. bio-defense program , this film raises an alarm .
These attacks that helped prepare a country for war have also spawned a multi-billion dollar bio -defense boom .
The line between bio - offense and bio-defense is becoming extremely thin .
Biological weapons research is now being conducted by corporations and private labs without effective government oversight .
The international treaty prohibiting the development of offensive bio-weapons may no longer be sufficient to keep the world from drifting towards the unthinkable – biological warfare .
More background on the death of Dr. Kelly can be found in this previous diary .

Corporations are pitching a bizarre product -- a radical vision of the 1st Amendment .
It would give corporations rather than voters a central role in our electoral process by treating corporate political spending as protected speech .
If this vision becomes reality , businesses and other big - money players will spend billions either hyping their preferred candidates or running attack ads against elected officials who do n’t support their preferred agenda .
Voters will be forced into a couch - potato role , mere viewers of the electoral spectacle bought and paid for by wealthy companies .
The Supreme Court ’s decision in the hotly anticipated campaign finance reform case Citizens United vs. Federal Election Commission -- which may be announced as early as Tuesday -- will show whether a majority of the Roberts court is buying their argument .
The case may be the turning point in a concerted , decades - long ideological campaign -- the “ corporate free speech movement , ” as Robert L. Kerr and other scholars have chronicled .
As far back as 1971 , Lewis F. Powell Jr. ( whom President Nixon would shortly nominate to the Supreme Court ) sent a confidential memorandum to his friend Eugene Sydnor Jr. at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce arguing that corporate interests needed to take advantage of a “ neglected opportunity in the courts . ”
Because “ the judiciary may be the most important instrument for social , economic and political change , ” the memo said , the chamber and other corporate interests should develop a cadre of constitutional lawyers to file lawsuits and amicus briefs to push a corporate - friendly legal agenda in the Supreme Court .
Corporations heeded this call to arms , generously funding the chamber ’s litigation arm and founding other think tanks .
In hundreds of lawsuits and briefs , the chamber and corporations such as Exxon - Mobil and Nike have drilled in the pro-business party line that 1st Amendment protection should extend to corporate political spending -- such as the corporate - funded movie about Hillary Rodham Clinton that is at issue in Citizens United .
The case , which began on narrow grounds ( did restrictions on corporate campaign ads apply to this film ? ) has become a test of whether restrictions on political speech by corporations should be ended altogether .

Only five years after Powell sent his memo , the Supreme Court in Buckley vs. Valeo struck down campaign spending limits on 1st Amendment grounds , with the rationale that such limits “ impose direct and substantial restraints on the quantity of political speech . ”
Two years later , in First National Bank of Boston vs. Bellotti , the court held -- for the first time -- that the 1st Amendment extends to corporate political spending , striking down a law that had prevented business corporations from spending shareholder funds to influence the outcome of state ballot measures .
By then Powell was on the court , and he wrote the controlling opinion in Bellotti and was in the majority in both cases .
As 1st Amendment expert Linda Berger has pointed out , the Buckley and Bellotti cases planted the seeds of three new metaphors in election law : that money is speech ; that corporations are people ; and that elections are marketplaces .
To equate corporate campaign spending with 1st Amendment - protected speech , you must accept all three .
Each , however , is problematic .
First , although spending money may , in some circumstances , have some expressive value ( such as clicking a web link to give $ 10 to a candidate ) , it does not follow that money is speech or that the 1st Amendment should shield such spending from regulation .
After all , I can drive my car in a way that conveys a message -- disapproval of a tailgating fellow driver , for example -- but that does n’t mean that driving is speech , nor that the 1st Amendment renders traffic laws unconstitutional .
When corporations and other monied interests spend vast sums to influence the outcome of an election , they ’re not trying to communicate an idea but simply to wield economic power and to bid for influence .
Second , as Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg pointed out at the Citizens United oral argument , a corporation “ is not endowed by its creator with inalienable rights . ”
After all , corporations are legal entities created for doing business and given special advantages that are n’t available to individuals or even other business entities , including limited liability and favorable tax treatment .

Thus , although corporations have certain economic rights -- to enable them to conduct business -- a corporation has no claim to the fundamental constitutional rights held by “ We the People . ”
Corporations already have ample means to express their “ viewpoints ” -- by lobbying , testifying in Congress and conducting public education on issues -- and those corporate employees who wish to advance the corporation ’s political agenda can contribute to the corporation ’s political action committee .
Third , and finally , one should not simply import economic free - market principles wholesale into the “ free market of ideas . ”
The operating assumption of free - market theory is that , in the long term , buyers ’ preferences will steer money to the best outcomes , so that those firms that offer the best goods and services will be rewarded with the greatest market success .
However , this “ invisible hand ” assumption -- that money follows or represents merit -- has no application to elections , especially when corporations are involved .
The amount of money a corporation can spend lacks even a theoretical connection to the intrinsic worth -- or popular support -- of its political agenda .
For decades , the Supreme Court stopped short of fully endorsing any of the three metaphors , heeding former Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist ’s warning that to treat corporate spending as the 1st Amendment equivalent of individual free speech is “ to confuse metaphor with reality . ”
Instead , as campaign finance law developed , the court struck a balance between the rights of campaigners -- candidates , parties , PACs and corporations -- on the one hand and the rights of the electorate to a representative , participatory and accountable government on the other .
But since Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Samuel Alito have replaced Rehnquist and Justice Sandra Day O’Connor on the court , concern for the 1st Amendment interests of the electorate seems to have been jettisoned .
Since they joined the court , it has struck down campaign finance regulations in each of the three relevant cases it has heard , championing a 1st Amendment right to spend money freely in political campaigns without regard to the voter ’s right to a meaningful role in the electoral process .

With Citizens
United due to be decided as campaigns for this year ’s elections get off the ground , political players are keenly aware that the court could open the floodgates to corporate cash .
“ We the People ” can only hope the court steps back from the brink and instead recognizes that in a democracy , voters , not corporations , should be at the center of the political process .

OBJECTIVE : Animals self - administer many of the drugs that humans abuse , including cocaine .
This article describes studies using preclinical animal models to differentiate the influences of neurobiological predisposition from environmental modulation of cocaine addiction , including studies from the authors ’ laboratory using nonhuman primates .
METHOD : Addiction is described in terms of vulnerability , maintenance , and abstinence .
This review focuses on dopamine receptor function , in particular that of the D2 - like receptors , as measured by the noninvasive imaging procedure positron emission tomography .
Findings from human studies of addiction and animal models are reviewed .
RESULTS : There appears to be an inverse relationship between D2 receptor availability and vulnerability to the reinforcing effects of cocaine .
Environmental variables can increase or decrease D2 receptor binding in an orderly fashion , and the resulting changes in D2 function influence the vulnerability to abuse cocaine .
In maintenance , chronic cocaine exposure produces decreases in D2 receptor binding , which may be a mechanism that contributes to continued drug use .
Finally , during abstinence there are individual differences in rates of recovery of D2 receptor availability .
CONCLUSIONS :
The goal of the preclinical research described in this review is to achieve a better understanding of individual differences in susceptibility and vulnerability to the reinforcing effects of cocaine .
It is clear that the development of novel animal models will extend our understanding of the neurobiological basis of drug addiction to include a greater appreciation of the role of environmental factors in affecting predisposition , mediating continued drug use , and triggering relapse .
Recent estimates indicate that the number of new cocaine users per year more than doubled from 1992 ( 0.5 million ) to 2002 ( 1.1 million ) ( 1 ) .
From 1994 to 2001 , visits to hospital emergency rooms that involved cocaine increased by 22 % ( 2 ) .
Despite more than three decades of research into the molecular , cellular , and behavioral effects of cocaine , no pharmacotherapy for cocaine abuse has demonstrated sufficient safety and effectiveness for widespread clinical use ( 3 , 4 ) .
As astutely pointed out by Leshner ( 5 ) , most people see drug abuse and addiction as a social problem , and as such , the problem is frequently handled only with social solutions , in particular through the criminal justice system .
Recent reports indicate that the 40 % –60 % of people seeking treatment are ordered to do so by the courts or corrections system ( see reference 6 ) , suggesting that treatment does not occur until drug use has led to substantial adverse consequences to the individual .
However , if drug addiction is viewed as a brain disease , then addiction should be amenable to treatments , just as depression , schizophrenia , and anxiety are treatable .
As Leshner stated ,
Understanding addiction as a brain disease explains in part why historic policy strategies focusing solely on the social or criminal justice aspects of drug use and addiction have been unsuccessful .
They are missing at least half of the issue .
If the brain is the core of the problem , attending to the brain needs to be a core part of the solution .
( 5 , p. 47 )
In response to growing evidence , the World Health Organization recently issued a report focusing on the role of the brain in mediating drug dependence ( 7 ) .
The goal of the present review is to highlight some of the brain imaging studies of cocaine abuse with a special emphasis on the use of animal models to help us understand the human condition .
Use of Brain Imaging Techniques in Cocaine Abuse Research
Cocaine is an indirectly acting monoamine agonist , binding to the dopamine , serotonin , and norepinephrine transporters ( 8 , 9 ) .
The majority of research on cocaine has involved the dopamine system , which will be the focus of this review .
Cocaine binds to the dopamine transporter and blocks uptake of dopamine from the synapse .
The elevated levels of dopamine activate two superfamilies of dopamine receptors , D1 - and D2 - like .
This review will focus on D2 - like receptors , which have been intimately linked to drug abuse ( for instance , see references 10 – 12 ) .
The positron emission tomography ( PET ) studies that we will describe involve radiotracers that do not differentiate among subtypes of the D2 superfamily ( i.e. , D 2 , D 3 , and D 4 receptor subtypes ) .
To study the brain , powerful imaging techniques have been developed that allow for the noninvasive exploration of brain function in humans and in animals .
In this review , we will highlight studies utilizing PET .
A clear strength of PET is the ability to examine the brain repeatedly in longitudinal studies .
PET has been described as a functional measure of brain activity because it records the uptake and washout of a radioactive marker that competes with endogenous neurotransmitters ( 13 ) .
For example , the radiotracers [ 11C ] raclopride and [ 18 F ] fluoroclebopride bind to D2 - like receptors with similar affinities .
The primary dependent variable in PET imaging studies is the ratio of the distribution of radioligand in the region of interest compared to its distribution in a region devoid of receptors .
This ratio , termed the distribution volume ratio , provides a unitless number representing the ratio of receptor density ( B max ) to receptor affinity .
In theory , changes in the distribution volume ratio noted in longitudinal studies reflect changes in B max .
However , changes in the distribution volume ratio may also reflect changes in extracellular dopamine levels .
Increases in extracellular dopamine will decrease radioligand binding , whereas decreases in extracellular dopamine will increase radioligand binding ( for example , see references 13 – 15 ) .
Thus , in addition to being affected by the actual number of receptors in the tissue , the binding of these radioligands is influenced by the amount of dopamine present in the synapse .
As a result , when we describe PET data , we use interchangeably “ binding ” and “ availability , ” since both are being assessed .
In contrast to PET imaging studies , in vitro receptor autoradiography provides a measure of receptor density in a particular brain structure that is not influenced by the levels of a neurotransmitter .
The limitation , however , is that the procedures are terminal and , consequently , only one time point can be studied .
These are important considerations for longitudinal PET studies because the possibility that changes in PET measures are due to changes in neurotransmitter levels rather than the density of receptors cannot be ruled out unless additional studies are conducted .
In this review , we attempt to address this issue by also describing in vitro studies using receptor autoradiography procedures in which circulating dopamine levels are not influencing receptor density assessments .
Animal Models of Drug Abuse : One of the Most Powerful Models of Human Disease
One strategy implemented by the National Institute on Drug Abuse is the development of novel animal models to better understand the neurochemical mechanisms mediating the high abuse potential of cocaine .
A greater understanding of the neuropharmacology of cocaine will ultimately lead to improved treatment for cocaine dependence .
Animal models of drug self - administration have proven to be valid predictors of human drug abuse ( 3 , 16–20 ) .
Animals will self - administer most of the drugs that humans abuse , including cocaine , alcohol , nicotine , and heroin , by the routes ( intravenous , inhaled , and oral ) used by humans ( 17 ) .
More recently , these models have been extended to examine behavioral and physiological responsiveness to environmental variables as indicators of vulnerability to drug use ( 21 ) .
In one of the earliest studies on individual differences and vulnerability to drug abuse , Piazza et al. ( 22 ) initially characterized rats ’ behavior in an open - field apparatus on the basis of how much locomotor activity was observed prior to any drug exposure .
They found that rats characterized as “ high responders ” in an open field had higher basal corticosterone levels and were more likely to self - administer d-amphetamine than rats characterized as “ low responders . ”
Consistent with this characterization , noncontingent electric foot shock , which increased corticosterone levels in rats , facilitated acquisition of cocaine self - administration ( 23 ) .
In other experiments , bilateral adrenalectomy or administration of metyrapone , which blocks corticosterone synthesis , completely abolished the acquisition of cocaine self - administration ( 24 ) .
Thus , it appears that individual differences in vulnerability to drug abuse can be observed in animal models and that these differences may be due , in part , to stress - hormone responsiveness .
In addition , animal models of drug abuse have begun to incorporate more sophisticated designs , including the inclusion of alternative reinforcers and the study of cocaine choice , that may provide greater validity than models that simply examine the reinforcing effects of drugs ( see references 25 – 27 ) .
For example , when monkeys are given a choice between food and cocaine , there is a dose - dependent relationship between drug dose and preference ( see , for instance , references 26 – 28 ) .
That is , when low cocaine doses are the alternative to food , monkeys choose food ; at higher cocaine doses , a monkey ’s preference shifts to almost exclusively cocaine choices .
Manipulations of environmental variables can increase or decrease cocaine choice .
For example , increases in the magnitude of the nondrug alternative ( i.e. , food reinforcement ) decrease cocaine choice .
Similarly , increases in the response requirement for cocaine ( analogous to increases in the cost of the drug ) decrease cocaine choice ( 26 , 27 , 29 ) .
The converse is also true : increases in the cost of the preferred nondrug alternative increase the frequency with which cocaine is chosen ( 26 , 27 , 29 ) .
These results emphasize that drug reinforcement is not simply mediated by actions in the brain but that the environment can alter drug reinforcement and , as we will show , brain function .
A growing body of preclinical research supports the hypothesis that environmental stressors can enhance and environmental enrichment can attenuate the reinforcing effects of drugs .
This hypothesis has clear implications for clinical outcomes .
As we will discuss , these environmental stimuli affect brain function , including processes mediated by dopamine receptors .
Compared to enrichment , more work has focused on the role of stress in drug abuse ( see reference 30 ) , with stressors including foot shock or more ethologically relevant variables such as social stress and social defeat .
We will describe studies that utilize a novel animal model of drug abuse in which male monkeys live in social groups and have access to cocaine daily .
To relate the preclinical findings to a more global goal of translational research , it is important to point out several advantages of the animal models highlighted in this article .
First , drugs can have different effects on brain function depending on whether they are administered by the investigator or self - administered by the animal ( 31 , 32 ) .
Because we are interested in studying addictive behavior , drug self - administration has face validity as an animal model of a human condition .
Second , in our studies of nonhuman primates we also examine complex social behaviors and stable individual behavioral characteristics ( e.g. , aggressive and affiliative behaviors in particular ) that closely model human social interactions ( see reference 33 ) .
In macaque monkeys , the formation of social hierarchies is determined by the outcome of physical confrontations ( i.e. , fights ) .
The monkey that wins all of the fights in the social group is the most dominant , the monkey that wins all encounters except with the most dominant animal is the monkey ranked number 2 , and so forth .
This hierarchy is transitory and linear , such that if number 2 wins a battle with number 3 and number 3 is ranked above number 4 , then number 2 is above number 4 .
We view the linear hierarchy that forms , with the dominant monkeys at the top and the subordinate animals at the bottom , as a continuum from environmental enrichment at one end to high levels of stress at the other .
Socially derived stressors have high ethological validity with regard to the study of human drug abuse .
Finally , nonhuman primates have many advantages over other animal species .
There is abundant evidence that rodent and primate brains differ in the anatomy , physiology , and neurochemistry of brain dopamine systems ( 34–37 ) .
Furthermore , the nonhuman primate brain differs substantially from the rodent brain in terms of cocaine - induced changes in brain metabolism ( 38 , 39 ) .
Nonhuman primates can be studied in long - term experiments with cocaine self - administration ( over years ) that use within - subject designs , and they are capable of learning complex behaviors in order to obtain drugs .
The use of PET imaging to examine neuroadaptations allows for longitudinal examination of brain changes due to environmental and / or pharmacological manipulations ( e.g. , references 40 – 42 ) .
The studies described in the following sections will focus on three phases of drug addiction : vulnerability , maintenance , and abstinence / relapse .
Relation of D2 Receptor Binding to Vulnerability to Cocaine Abuse
Perhaps one of the most challenging issues in drug abuse research involves understanding the etiology of addiction .
Epidemiological studies suggest that approximately 17 % of the people who use cocaine become dependent on the drug ( 43 , 44 ) .
Studies in humans can generate hypotheses about potential brain markers that may indicate a predisposition to become addicted .
For example , Volkow et al. ( 45 ) studied 23 non -drug - abusing male subjects and used the dopamine transport inhibitor methylphenidate as a tool to study stimulant abuse .
First , each subject was scanned with the D2 receptor ligand [ 11C ] raclopride .
On another day , they were administered 0.5 mg/kg of methylphenidate and asked to complete an analogue self - rating scale for pleasant drug effects .
Approximately one - half ( N=12 ) of the 23 subjects reported liking the dose of methylphenidate , while nine of them described it as “ unpleasant ” ( two were indifferent to the drug effect ) .
Subjects who found methylphenidate “ pleasant ” had significantly lower levels of D2 receptor binding than subjects who reported the drug as “ unpleasant . ”
While these findings suggest an inverse relationship between D2 receptor availability and “ vulnerability ” to stimulant reinforcement , because of ethical concerns humans cannot be studied prior to drug exposure and then allowed to self - administer the drug for an extended period of time .
Animal models , however , can be used to test hypotheses generated from studies of human drug abusers .
We explored further the relationship between D2 receptors and sensitivity to psychostimulants in a novel model of drug abuse in monkeys housed together ( 40 ) .
Previous work from our group had shown a relationship between D2 receptor availability , as measured with PET , and the social rank of female monkeys ( 46 ) .
Subordinate monkeys had significantly lower levels of D2 receptor binding than dominant monkeys .
This relationship between social rank and D2 receptors generated an interesting series of questions related not only to drug abuse but also to trait theory .
Our first question was whether D2 receptor availability influenced social rank .
That is , were monkeys genetically predisposed to a particular position in the social hierarchy according to basal D2 receptor availability ?
To answer this question , we studied 20 individually housed male monkeys by using the D2 receptor ligand [ 18 F ] fluoroclebopride ( 47 ) before the monkeys were housed together .
The level of D2 receptor binding determined during individual housing did not predict eventual social rank .
That is , D2 availability was not a trait variable influencing dominance hierarchies ( 40 ) .
The next question was whether formation of the social hierarchies influenced D2 receptor availability .
When these animals were rescanned after 3 months of social housing , there were significant differences between groups , with the subordinate monkeys having significantly lower D2 receptor binding than the dominant monkeys ( 40 ) .
This finding replicated our earlier work with female monkeys ( 46 ) and extended it to males .
However , when we compared each monkey ’s [ 18 F ] fluoroclebopride distribution volume ratio when they were individually housed to the new ratio after social group formation , a profound effect was noted : the average distribution volume ratios for dominant monkeys increased by over 20 % , while those for the subordinate animals were nearly unchanged from their original baselines ( Table 1 ) .
These results suggest that becoming the dominant monkey in the social group produced large changes in dopamine receptor function .
One hypothesis that could account for the observed changes is that being the dominant monkey is analogous to living in an enriched environment .
Dominant animals have access to treats in the pen , they are groomed more often than subordinate monkeys , and they move about freely ( 33 ) .
Enrichment could affect the PET signal ( i.e. , produce increases in the distribution volume ratio ) by increasing D2 receptor densities and / or decreasing levels of extracellular dopamine in dominant monkeys .
Studies using rodents have clearly shown that environmental enrichment can affect dopamine neurotransmission in an orderly and reliable fashion consistent with both potential mechanisms .
For example , Bowling et al. ( 48 ) ) examined the effects of different rearing environments on dopamine synthesis and metabolism in rats .
The group in the “ enriched ” condition lived together , with 12 or 13 rats per cage , and was exposed to novel toys .
Another group lived under “ impoverished ” conditions consisting of individual housing without toys in the cage .
In vitro studies indicated that the rats in the enriched condition had lower striatal concentrations of dopamine than the rats in the impoverished condition .
In another study , Hall et al. ( 49 ) used in vivo microdialysis to compare rats reared in isolation with socially reared rats , and they found that dopamine levels in the nucleus accumbens were higher in the isolation - reared rats than in the socially reared rats .
Furthermore , D2 receptor densities were lower in the isolation - reared rats than in the socially reared rats ( 49 ) .
These findings clearly show that environmental variables as seemingly subtle as housing conditions can produce profound changes in the functional status of dopamine systems .
Overall , the findings in rodents are in the same direction as the effects we observed after formation of social groups by monkeys .
An important question is whether these environmentally induced brain changes have behavioral consequences .
In particular , how do these variables influence vulnerability to drug abuse ?
If , as previously noted in humans , there is a relationship between D2 receptor availability and stimulant reinforcement , then there should be differences in drug reinforcement between dominant and subordinate monkeys and subordinate animals should be more sensitive to the effects of cocaine .
This is , in fact , what we found ( 40 ) .
When subsequently allowed access to cocaine , subordinate animals self - administered cocaine at higher rates and had larger intakes than those for dominant monkeys ( Figure 1 ) .
Overall , these findings confirmed an inverse relationship between D2 receptor availability and cocaine reinforcement and suggested that environmental variables could affect brain function and vulnerability to cocaine abuse .
Decrease of D2 Receptor Binding With Continued Cocaine Use
Human PET imaging studies have shown lower D2 receptor availability in cocaine abusers than in age - matched comparison subjects ( 11 ) .
However , as already described , it is not clear whether the lower D2 receptor binding was a predisposing trait or a consequence of cocaine exposure ( see reference 11 ) .
Understanding how long - term cocaine exposure affects dopamine receptor function could ultimately lead to better treatment strategies .
One hypothesis is that D2 receptor down - regulation occurs as an adaptation to the chronic elevation in extracellular dopamine due to chronic blockade of dopamine uptake .
A strength of using animal subjects is the ability to study drug - naive subjects and to observe changes in receptor availability with exposure to a drug by means of a within - subjects , longitudinal design ( see reference 50 , for example ) .
We recently extended our studies of socially housed monkeys to examine the effects of chronic cocaine exposure in dominant and subordinate monkeys ( 51 ) .
Whereas dominant monkeys were initially protected from the reinforcing effects of cocaine by elevated D2 availability , chronic exposure to self - administered cocaine resulted in D2 measures that were no longer different from those of subordinate monkeys ( Figure 2 ) .
These findings suggested that exposure to cocaine attenuated or reversed the powerful effects of environmental context on dopamine receptor availability .
Studies utilizing in vitro receptor autoradiography of D2 receptors have consistently shown lower receptor densities in monkeys with long - term histories of cocaine self - administration ; many of these effects were directly related to dose and duration of exposure ( 52–54 ) .
A central issue for this phase of addiction is one that was raised for the first phase , namely individual differences .
For example , one issue to consider in addition to the dose of a drug taken in the lifetime of the individual is the pattern and duration of drug use .
Volkow et al. ( 11 ) noted that there was not a relationship between D2 receptor binding and the dose of cocaine used , but there was a significant correlation between D2 binding and duration of cocaine use .
The effects of duration and cocaine intake can be addressed with animal models in which cocaine availability is the primary independent variable .
The question could be phrased as , Does administering a large amount of cocaine over a short period of time produce greater long - term effects on dopamine receptor function than does administering moderate doses over longer periods ?
In a study not utilizing cocaine self - administration , in vitro receptor autoradiography was used to assess the consequences of chronic cocaine use and abstinence on D2 receptor levels ( 55 ) .
Monkeys were treated four times per day with cocaine for 2 consecutive weeks , followed by a 2 - week withdrawal period .
The investigators found no differences between cocaine - treated and control monkeys in D2 receptor densities in the caudate nucleus , prefrontal cortex , substantia nigra , and nucleus accumbens .
However , this amount of cocaine administered has since been shown to produce robust decreases in D2 receptor densities when self - administered over longer periods of time ( see , for instance , references 52 and 53 ) .
Such findings suggest that the duration of exposure is as important as the actual dose of drug administered and reinforce the importance of using contingent drug administration in animal models of addiction .
Future studies using in vivo imaging techniques will better address this extremely important question .
As we discussed for the vulnerability phase , an important question is whether there are functional consequences to cocaine - induced changes in D2 receptor binding .
Of particular interest are issues related to cognitive function , decision making , and choice behavior .
For example , Grant et al. ( 56 ) compared a group of drug abusers ( opiate and / or stimulant ) and non-drug - abusing comparison subjects on a series of neuropsychological tests to examine the long - term consequences of drug use on decision making .
In one set of studies , subjects were exposed to the “ gambling task ” ( 57 ) , which has strong face validity for evaluating cognitive deficits ( 56 ) .
The task involved four different decks of cards that differed along three dimensions : immediate gain , long - term expected gain , and schedule of penalties .
Two of the four decks had smaller gains and punishers but higher overall “ yields ” ; the comparison subjects chose from those decks most often .
In contrast , the majority of the drug abusers chose from the low - yield decks , indicating poor decision making .
To control for possible differences in IQ , Grant et al. ( 56 ) also used the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test and found no differences between the groups .
The authors concluded that impairments in decision making could certainly account for continued use of drugs in the presence of adverse social and personal consequences .
Studies with cocaine abusers cannot clarify whether such cognitive impairments are a consequence of excessive cocaine use or reflect preexisting decrements that predispose certain individuals to drug abuse .
Animal studies can address this issue .
Using our model with group - housed monkeys , we studied choice behavior involving cocaine and a nondrug reinforcer — banana - flavored pellets ( 27 ) .
Subordinate monkeys were more sensitive to the reinforcing effects of cocaine than were dominant monkeys .
That is , subordinate monkeys chose cocaine over food at a lower cocaine dose than that for dominant monkeys .
Such findings suggest that environmental context can substantially influence the preference to choose drug over nondrug alternatives even when D2 binding does not differ between groups .
Variable Recovery of D2 Receptor Binding During Cocaine Abstinence
The final phase of drug addiction to be discussed is abstinence and the variables that influence relapse .
As with vulnerability and maintenance , we will focus on dopamine D2 receptor availability .
From a clinician ’s viewpoint , abstinence is the critical phase because the population seeking professional guidance and treatment are in this phase ; it is worth pointing out that this is the phase of drug addiction about which we know and understand the least .
The preceding issues related to vulnerability ( predisposition ) and maintenance ( i.e. , changes in brain function due to chronic drug exposure ) are critical in understanding brain changes associated with abstinence .
However , understanding these variables may provide only a glimpse of the complexity involved in brain changes during abstinence .
Perhaps Childress et al. stated it best : “ This search [ for a cocaine medication ] has been complicated by the heterogenous target : drug desire that emerges during cocaine cessation … may well have a different brain substrate than desire induced by cocaine itself … and the cues that signal it ” ( 58 , p. 11 ) .
Over a decade ago , Volkow and colleagues ( 59 ) reported significantly lower D2 receptor binding in cocaine abusers abstinent from cocaine for up to 4 months .
These reductions in D2 receptor binding were associated with decreased glucose utilization in the orbitofrontal cortex and with self - ratings of dysphoria ( 11 ) .
Thus , there was an association between dopamine receptor availability and negative subjective effects during abstinence .
The study ended 4 months after the start of abstinence because all subjects had relapsed .
Animal models , on the other hand , can provide valuable insight into the neuropharmacology of abstinence and relapse because abstinence can be studied for years .
Our first efforts to study D2 receptor function during abstinence involved using PET imaging to compare D2 receptor binding in monkeys with extensive histories of cocaine self - administration and cocaine - naive comparison monkeys ( i.e. , a group design ) .
For example , the first monkey we studied had self - administered cocaine for over 3 years and had a lifetime cocaine intake of approximately 20 g. PET scans were conducted at various time points during abstinence .
Differences in [ 18 F ] fluoroclebopride binding between this cocaine - experienced monkey and a cocaine - naive monkey were apparent at all time points and , as shown in Figure 3 , did not dissipate even after 7 months of abstinence .
The image from a comparison monkey shows excellent uptake of [ 18 F ] fluoroclebopride into D2 - rich regions of the basal ganglia .
In the abstinent cocaine - experienced monkey , D2 receptor binding was more than 20 % lower .
While it is possible that the lower D2 signal in the cocaine - experienced monkey was due to elevated levels of dopamine , it is unlikely that such an effect would persist for 7 months .
The other possibility is that chronic cocaine exposure resulted in persistent reductions in D2 receptor densities .
This hypothesis has been confirmed by means of in vitro receptor autoradiography ( 52 , 53 ; see reference 54 for further discussion ) .
It is necessary to comment on animal models and “ craving . ”
As defined by Hommer , craving “ is a term derived from popular psychology that is used to describe one of the mental states — namely , the intense desire for a certain object or experience ” ( 60 , p. 187 ) .
Assessing a mental state in an animal is not a realistic undertaking .
However , we can measure behavior and hypothesize about mental states .
Describing the multitude of animal models of craving is beyond the scope of this review .
In brief , the strategies can involve persistence of drug seeking in the presence of stimuli that signal no drug is available ( 61 ) , escalation of drug seeking with changes in drug availability ( 62 ) , responding in the presence of conditioned stimuli ( 63 ) , or a return of responding that had been previously extinguished ( i.e. , reinstatement ) ( 64 ) .
The reinstatement procedure has been widely used as a model of the ability of priming injections of drugs , drug - related cues , and stress to precipitate relapse into drug taking ( reviewed in reference 65 ) .
Although the predictive and construct validity of the procedure remain to be firmly established ( 66 ) , the ability of noncontingent administration of cocaine to reinstate extinguished responding previously maintained by cocaine has been well established ( 65 ) .
Furthermore , it has been demonstrated that drugs that directly or indirectly activate the dopamine system can reinstate cocaine seeking under a food - drug choice procedure ( 67 ) .
Thus , the reinstatement procedure allowed us another means to assess potential differences in dopamine receptor function between dominant and subordinate monkeys .
Socially housed monkeys were allowed to self - administer cocaine under conditions in which they also could choose food reinforcement .
Under these conditions , as the cocaine dose increased , the percentage of total responses involving the cocaine - associated lever increased ( 27 ) .
When saline was substituted for cocaine , the monkeys shifted their responses to the food - associated lever ( Figure 4 ) .
We next examined the ability of noncontingent cocaine to reinstate responses on the cocaine - associated lever , although these responses continued to produce saline injections .
Noncontingent cocaine produced dose - related increases in responses on the cocaine - associated lever at doses up to 0.30 mg/kg in all monkeys ( data not shown ) .
However , dominant and subordinate monkeys differed in their responses to a higher cocaine dose ( 0.56 mg/kg ) .
All four subordinate monkeys responded primarily on the injection lever following this dose of cocaine ( Figure 4 ) .
Greater variability was observed in the dominant monkeys ’ responses to this dose .
These data are consistent with our earlier results demonstrating that subordinate monkeys are , on average , more sensitive to the reinforcing strength of cocaine and / or less sensitive to the aversive effects of cocaine than are dominant monkeys .
Conclusions
In this review we have attempted to briefly highlight the use of animal models and brain imaging procedures ( PET and in vitro receptor autoradiography ) to convey a better understanding of the neuropharmacology of drug addiction .
The focus on dopamine D2 receptors can be viewed as a strength as well as a limitation .
The strength of this focus is the understanding of how the level of this receptor superfamily serves as a trait influencing vulnerability to drug abuse and how it serves as a potential state variable showing malleability as a result of environmental or pharmacological manipulations .
The weakness of this focus on D2 receptors is the fact that drug addiction is not mediated by one receptor subtype .
Future studies must examine how other neurotransmitter and neurohormone systems change in concert with brain dopamine systems , as well as the development of novel radioligands for specific receptor subtypes ( e.g. , D 3 receptors ) .
In addition , increased anatomical selectivity with higher - resolution PET cameras will better address the contribution of particular brain circuitry to behavioral effects .
The use of animal models to study human disease is an extremely important tool .
We have described models that could be characterized as predictive , isomorphic , and homologous of the human condition .
In particular , the use of socially housed nonhuman primates to better understand the neuropharmacology and the behavioral and social consequences of drug abuse and to evaluate potential treatment strategies has unequivocal potential .
It is our hope that clinicians reading this review will gain a better understanding of the research questions being asked and the potential importance of the results for the development of therapies ( behavioral and pharmacological ) for drug addiction .
Finally , this review has provided evidence that the environment can profoundly affect drug abuse vulnerability , maintenance , and relapse .
Environmental stress and enrichment can influence brain function and vulnerability to drug abuse .
Furthermore , even following long - term drug use , environmental variables can affect the behavioral effects of cocaine .
The research described in this review represents the growing number of studies documenting the benefits of environmental enrichment , irrespective of genetic predispositions to abuse drugs .
Such preclinical findings suggest that outcome measures will be enhanced not only by taking individuals out of a stressful environment but also by providing alternative reinforcers — whether these are better living conditions , jobs , or other activities ( 68 ) .

TEHRAN ( Reuters ) - Iran accused the United States on Wednesday of involvement in the disappearance of a technology university researcher , Iranian media reported .
ISNA news agency referred to “ some rumors ” that Shahram Amiri , who went missing during a pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia in June , was an employee of Iran ’s Atomic Energy Organization who wanted to seek asylum abroad .
But Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki did not confirm this when he made the allegation against the United States , which suspects the Islamic Republic is seeking to develop nuclear bombs .
Iran denies the charge .
“ We have found documents that prove U.S. interference in the disappearance of the Iranian pilgrim Shahram Amiri in Saudi Arabia , ” he told reporters , according to the website of state Press TV , without giving details .
Press TV said Amiri was a researcher at Tehran ’s Malek Ashtar University , but did not give details .
It quoted his wife as saying he had not contacted his family except for a few phone calls he made at the beginning of his trip .
Malek Ashtar is involved in the implementation of “ special national research projects ” and has faculties in aerospace , electrical engineering and other topics , according to the university website .
His disappearance came months before the disclosure of a second uranium enrichment facility that Iran has been building near the city of Qom .
A woman labelled a " predatory paedophile " by police has been given an indeterminate prison sentence after she admitted sexually abusing children .
Carol Clarke , 46 , assaulted children she followed into toilets in Grimsby and other places in Lincolnshire .
Grimsby Crown Court heard that Clarke , of Cromwell Road , Grimsby , had admitted abusing children , aged between four and seven , over 30 years .
Judge David Tremberg said she would serve a minimum of four years in jail .
He told Clarke she would only be released from prison once parole board members were satisfied she no longer posed a risk to young children or the public .
" This is a sad and deeply troubling case , " he said .
Rare case Det Sgt Stewart Watson of Humberside Police said : " Predatory paedophiles such as Carol Clarke are rare .
" Experts agree that women commit only a fraction of child sexual abuse but , as little is known about female offenders , it is difficult to be accurate .
" There are still those members of the general public and even some experts who ignore women 's capacity for sexual abuse .
Judge Tremberg told her : " From the time you were a very young woman you have had and maintained a very worrying sexual preference , in particular young girls . "
Dozens of offences Clarke , who won a place at Cambridge University after being head girl at her school , was " clearly an intelligent woman " and could have endeavoured not to indulge her interest in children , he added .
At an earlier hearing Clarke admitted abusing young boys and girls , with some of her offences dating back to before 1992 .
Her offences ranged from assaulting children in toilets in Grimsby town centre to targeting them at a caravan park in Woodhall Spa , Lincolnshire .
Gordon Stables , prosecuting , said the case had been brought based on the confessions of Clarke , after she was reported to police earlier this year by a mental health care worker .
She is believed to have committed dozens of offences .
Mr Stables told the court Clarke had taken a job in an ice - cream van in order to try to get close to children , and had used events organised by her church to come into contact with youngsters .

I know , a 70 - minute long video review of The Phantom Menace sounds nutty .

What we know as the astronomically expensive Toughbook laptops over here , the Japanese know as the wildly spendy Let 's Note machines over there .
Their nomenclature is today getting upgraded by one , as the F9 , N9 , and S9 Let 's Notes make their debut housing a Core i5 - 520 M processor .
We like the F9's 14.1 - inch display and 1440 x 900 resolution best -- those are pretty much ideal dimensions for a portable workhorse -- but the real new hotness is the R9 , which crams a Core i7 - 620 UM into essentially the size of a netbook .
2GB of DDR3 RAM and 250GB storage drives are standard across the range , and the Japanese release is scheduled for February 17 .
In other news , a 17 - inch Dell Inspiron with Core i5 - 430 M guts is now up for sale on Staples for a measly $ 649 , while a similarly specced HP dv4 can also be found for a Benjamin more .

Print style sheets have been somewhat forgotten , and yet they remain important all the same .
Many people print out articles to read while traveling or when they have no access to the Internet .
Print style sheets have definite benefits .
For example , reading on paper is less tiring on the eyes than reading on screen .
Also , following tutorials is easier if you have one next to you , with your code editor open on the screen ; that way , you do n’t have to switch windows every time to look something up .
In this article we ’ll point out 10 easy tips that will help you create better print style sheets .
In case you ’ve forgotten , here ’s how to set up a print style sheet :
The media= " print " attribute ensures that users do n’t see any of the styles defined in the print.css file .
Some attention is required , though : if your main style sheet has no media attribute , the print style sheet will inherit its style .
To separate them , set your main style sheet as follows :
Here are 10 tips to get you started with the print style sheet .
1. Remove the Navigation
What is the main difference between paper and computer ?
Paper is static , while a computer is interactive .
And to facilitate that interaction , websites have navigation , which becomes useless on paper .
Hide the navigation and other parts of your website that become pointless on paper , such as sidebars that link to other posts .
The code for this is very easy : just set the element ’s display to none .
[ css ] #nav , # sidebar { display : none ; } [ / css ]
2. Enlarge the Content Area
With the navigation and sidebar removed , our content is now spread across the page .
This makes the print style sheet look more like an ordinary document , instead of a paper version of the website .
All we need to do to expand the content is reset the float , remove any margins and set the width to 100 % .
[ css ] # content { width : 100 % ; margin : 0 ; float : none ; } [ / css ]
3. Reset the Background Colors
Most browsers already ignore background properties to preserve ink .
But to make sure that the entire background is white , we can set the body to white , and then give every child element still on the page a white background .
[ css ] body { background : white ; } #content { background : transparent ; } [ / css ]
4. Reset Text Colors
By resetting the background , another problem pops up .
What if you have a dark - gray “ Author information ” box at the end of your posts , with the text in light gray or white ?
With the background now set to white , this information will invisible .
To fix this , change any light - colored text to something darker : black or , preferably , dark gray .
[ css ] #author { color : # 111 ; } [ /css ]
Take Sam Brown ‘s blog above .
Could you imagine what this would look like if he did n’t reset the text ’s colors ?
Unreadable indeed .
5. Display the Destination of Links
Because paper is not an interactive medium , readers of course cannot click through on links to gather more information .
Say someone is reading a print - out about a fancy new product .
Seeing “ Click here for more information ” all of a sudden would be rather irritating for them , would n’t it ?
This is easily fixed by adding the link destination after the link text itself , giving you something like this : “ Click here for more information ( http://hereismore.com/information).”
What ’s more , for CSS 2 - ready browsers , this can be done with plain old CSS .
Here ’s the code :
[ css ] a: link : after { content : " ( " attr ( href ) " ) " ; } [ / css ]
You can spice things up with a smaller font size , italics or whatever else .
6. Make Links Stand Out from Regular Text
Readers need to be able to distinguish links from regular text .
Basic usability rules apply here : blue and underlining is preferred , but I prefer to add bolding , too .
Remember that documents are often printed in black and white .
Do n’t depend only on color difference .
Here is the code for sensible printed links :
[ css ] a : link { font - weight : bold ; text - decoration : underline ; color : # 06 c ; } [ /css ]
# 0066 cc is a fresh blue color , and it looks like # 999999 when printed in grayscale .
With this , links will look good printed either in color or in black and white .
They will also stand out from regular text .
7. What About Font Size ?
In print , 12 points is the standard .
But how do we translate that to CSS ?
Some say setting the font size to 12 points ( pt ) is good enough .
Others recommend setting it to 100 % .
Still others say not to declare any font size in your print style sheet at all , because doing so would override the user ’s preferences .
Personally , I go with a 12 - point font size most of the time :
[ css ] p { font - size : 12 pt ; } [ /css ]
8. What About Fonts ?
Most people prefer serif fonts because they are less tiring on the eyes , they better lead the reader through the text , and so on .
Setting the font - family to serif in your print style sheet is probably a good idea , although some readers may be surprised to find that the font in their print - out is not the same as the one on your website .
Here is the code for a good print font stack :
[ css ] body { font - family : Georgia , ‘ Times New Roman ’ , serif ; } [ / css ]
One of the benefits of CSS 3 ’s @font - face property is that your special fonts can be printed , too , making print - outs look a lot more like your website !
9. My Blog Has a Lot of Comments .
What Should I Do ?
Well , this is really your choice .
On the one hand , think of all the trees you ’d be saving just by adding #comments { display : none ; } to your print style sheet .
On the other hand , comments are of great value on some blogs and contain some great discussion .
By moving the comments to their own page , you give users the choice of whether to print them .
CSS has a property that makes this very easy :
[ css ] # comments { page - break - before : always ; } [ /css ]
For example , if your article is two - and - a - half pages long , the comments would run from page 4 up to , say , 6 .
Users would be able to choose which pages to print , without losing any information .
10 . Show a Print - Only Message
“ Thank you for printing this article !
Please do n’t forget to come back to mysite.com for fresh articles . ”
Why not display a friendly message like this in the print - out ?
Or perhaps ask readers to recycle the paper they have used to preserve the environment .
Here is what that would look like :
Thank you for printing this article .
Please do not forget to come back to mysite.com for fresh articles .
[ css ] # printMsg { display : block ; } [ / css ]
You could add a bit of styling , too , like a 1 - pixel border .
Do n’t forget to add # printMsg { display : none ; } to your regular style sheet , to avoid confusing visitors .
Showcase
Here are some examples from well - known websites that have thought ( or forgotten ) about the print style sheet .
Feel free to be inspired .
Looks Good :
Here are some websites that do a great job with their print style sheets :
24 Ways :
The website for this “ advent calendar for web geeks ” has a fancy design , but I wondered how it would look in print .
The result is really nice .
The slick CSS 3 stuff has been removed .
The layout is clean and yet still slick .
The big branding has been removed , replaced by a simple right - aligned “ 24 Ways ” next to the post ’s title .
ThinkVitamin : Carsonified ’s blog is a good example of how to do print style sheets .
No real weak spots except that the URL ’s destination is not shown .
CSS - Tricks : Chris Coyier of CSS - Tricks.com has done a good job with his print style sheet .
He has removed all the clutter and moved comments to a new page , so users can choose not to print them .
Could Use Some Work
Here are some websites that are already great but whose print style sheets could use a bit of polish .
No offense to anyone in this section .
Webdesign Ledger : Webdesign Ledger seems to have neglected its print style sheet .
When you click “ Print , ” you end up with three pages of advertisements and related links .
The Design Cubicle : Brian
Hoff seems to have forgotten about his print style sheet , too .
When you print out an article , you get the comment form , too .
Flickr : Being able to print out photos to show to friends would be nice .
Flickr could have removed everything but the picture itself and the copyright information in print - outs .
But everything appears in plain unstyled HTML .

… and a bullhorn for every maniac
Of all the places to have a good faith debate about evolution , a forum hosted by a religion reporter against Ray " Banana Man " Comfort is not one .
Right now , somewhere , Ray Comfort and his designated former child star stalker are handing out a mangled copy of Charles Darwin ’s Origin of the Species at some hapless college .
Lacking important chapters where a number of crucial questions about natural selection are answered in detail and desecrated with the kind of intellectually lazy introduction that should merit a D in any philosophy or theology class , this it not the copy you would want on your bookshelf if you consider yourself a scientifically minded person .
So now , what ’s a big time religious reporter like U.S. News & World Report ’s Dan Gilgoff to do ?
Why give him a platform to debate with Dr. Eugene Scott of the NCSE about the merits to slandering and sliming a theory he adamantly refuses to understand , but fears as if Darwin ’s ghost was coming at him with a bloody chainsaw buzzing with malice .
The late George Carlin liked to joke around that some crazy people should n’t be removed from society and put in mental sanitariums , but should be given their own shows instead for the entertainment value they provide .
I will point out again that this was only a joke since it seems like today ’s mainstream media took his advice to heart and gives anybody loud and obnoxious enough a show of their own .
Same applies to Comfort who uses his religion as a moneymaking device and a foot in the doors that would otherwise be slammed shut .
And we should also remember that Gilgoff was marginalizing and dismissing atheists after a recent report about the growth of non-theism in the United States .
His motivations to host this farce of a debate seem questionable at best and I would n’t encourage you for a moment to think that anything beneficial will come of it .
Yes , Ray certainly has a right to his beliefs and if he wants to start a cult around bananas he thinks are living testaments to the power of God , ( despite actually being testaments to thousands of years of agriculture ) he ’s more than welcome to do so .
However , the problem with him and every other vocal creationist out there is that they also insist that their beliefs must be your beliefs .
Otherwise you ’re going to Hell .
And no , you ca n’t show a fossil in a science classroom because you ’ll be dooming kids to Hell too .
They ’re like epistemological bullies who tell you that should you fail to obey them , their dad will come and beat you up .
Yes , I ’m sure this is the way Jesus would ’ve wanted to be remembered .
Not as a philosopher , not as the Ghandi of Judea , but as a threat for the heathens who wo n’t fall in line with those who claim to worship him .
If we want to debate that , or tackle theological questions with a mix of anthropology thrown in for good measure , by all means let ’s get Ray along with his airheaded celebrity escort on stage and ask them some questions .
But when it comes to science , debating with the likes of Comfort is an exercise in futility .
Nothing Dr. Scott will ever say will make him let go of his hysterical phobia of science .
I ’m sure she ’s well aware of that and is only doing this to defend the work of Charles Darwin from being so obnoxiously mangled .
On his side , Ray will be throwing out the same inanities disproven so many times , an accurate count would need to be expressed by scientific notation .
His intellect barely rivals that of the banana he used as his proof of intelligent design .
And for crying out loud , the man does n’t even know how gravity works !
Why are we giving this ditz a bullhorn and a national stage ?
What does he possibly have to say that we have n’t heard before ?
How do we expect him to provide a reasonable rebuttal to an accomplished biologist ?
The only reason why there will even be a debate is because there are plenty of people who are grossly uneducated about biology either on purpose or through the callous efforts of others , cheering him on and thinking their faith gives them some sort of support .
In the sixty - four years since V - J Day , the United States has fought five wars big enough to be styled “ major . ”
Two of these , Vietnam ( 1962 - 75 , by the most common reckoning ) and Iraq ( 2003 - 11 , with any luck ) , were conceived in sin .
Their beginnings were fatally compromised by deceptions that congealed into lies , abetted by profound geostrategic misjudgments .
In Vietnam , illusions piled on illusions .
The Tonkin Gulf incident was not even an incident , since an incident , to be an incident , has to occur .
The fear that Communism would spread throughout Asia and beyond if it was not stopped in Vietnam turned out to be groundless ; so did the belief that the other side was motivated more by totalitarian ideology than by national feeling .
The Iraq War , too , was midwifed by falsehoods and follies : the falsehoods that the Baghdad regime possessed “ weapons of mass destruction ” and that Saddam Hussein ’s was a hidden hand behind Al Qaeda and the attacks of September 11 , 2001 ; the follies that the war would be a “ cakewalk ” and , most seductively , that it would “ transform ” the Middle East .
In both wars , our enemy was only sometimes a conventional army ; as often , if not more so , it was an elusive guerrilla force that was frequently indistinguishable from the civilian population .

Another two of our five big - scale wars , Korea ( 1950 - 53 ) and the Gulf War ( 1991 ) , were legitimate in their origins and ( by the standards of mechanized slaughter ) scrupulous in their execution .
The Korean “ police action ” — a euphemism , but one that carried real meaning at a time when hopes for a global order of international law were fresh and high — was fought with the sanction ( and partly under the flag ) of the United Nations .
The Gulf War , too , had the sanction of the U.N. and its Security Council .
Four decades apart , the two wars shared many features , starting with the moral and temporal clarity of their beginnings .
Both were fought in response to armed aggression across international borders .
In both , the American Administration resisted powerful political pressures to expand its objective to include the destruction and conquest of the regime responsible for the original aggression .
And , after both , the cessation of hostilities along the restored borders has held , even if its form does not quite deserve the name of peace .
The war in Afghanistan scrambles the familiar categories so thoroughly that the customary rubrics for making judgments do n’t fit .
As in Korea and the Gulf , we went to war to punish an unmistakable act of aggression — this time on our own soil .
But the aggressor was not a state ; it was a band of freelance fanatics protected by a state .
The goals of our response were as clear as the morning of September 11th : to call to account those who sent the murderers and the government that harbored them .
Our action had the backing of NATO , which , for the first time in its history , activated the provision of its charter that declares an attack against one an attack against all .
The support of the “ international community ” was nearly unanimous .
Even Iran lent a hand .
[ #unhandled_cartoon ]
During the election campaign , Barack Obama and the Democrats put forth a story — a “ narrative , ” as political reporters now like to say — about two wars .
According to the story , the “ good ” war was the war in Afghanistan .
But it failed to fully achieve its principal goal because at the crucial moment the Bush Administration , in its obsession with Saddam , diverted resources and attention to Iraq — a “ bad ” war .
The diversion allowed Bin Laden , Al Qaeda , and the Taliban leadership to slip the noose at Tora Bora — a guerrilla Dunkirk .
“ I do n’t oppose all wars , ” an Illinois state senator had famously told a rally on the very afternoon in October , 2002 , that the Iraq War Resolution was introduced in Congress .
“ I ’m opposed to dumb wars . ”
Iraq was a dumb war ; Afghanistan was , or could be , a smart one .
There was considerable truth in the narrative .
But it contained an almost subliminal suggestion that somehow the clock could be turned back — that the events of the Afghanistan war ’s first months could be replayed , this time with a better outcome .
When Obama moved into the White House , he brought the narrative with him .
In August , at a Veterans of Foreign Wars convention , he said of the conflict , “ This is not a war of choice .
This is a war of necessity . ”
By October , he had ordered in thirty - four thousand more troops , doubling the overall American deployment in Afghanistan .
But he had also begun an intensive review of the entire policy .
On Armistice Day , at a full - scale meeting of his national - security team , Obama was presented with four options .
According to what little has leaked out from under the closed doors , all four options called for more American troops , from ten thousand at the lower end to forty thousand at the upper .
Though some in the Administration favor a smaller military footprint instead of a larger one , that was not among the choices offered to the President .
For this fifth war , there was no fifth option .
The President rejected all four .
He has apparently decided against anything like a quick drawdown , but he wants a map that plots an eventual way out , not just an abundance of ways further in .
As he told an interviewer , there can be no “ indefinite stay , ” no “ permanent protectorate . ”
And he has questions he would like answered .
So do the rest of us .
Does it make sense , for example , to spend lives and treasure trying to eradicate “ safe havens ” in Afghanistan when Al Qaeda has so many other — well , options , from Sudan to Hamburg ?
Will a bigger , longer , and presumably bloodier occupation advance or retard the ultimate aim of discouraging Islamist terrorism ?
Will adding American troops — at a million dollars a year per soldier — encourage Afghans to fight for themselves or prompt them to leave the fighting to us ?
Can Afghanistan ’s nominal government , with its President elected by fraud and its recent rating as the second most corrupt on earth , be finessed or somehow remade ?
The sum we are already spending annually on Afghanistan is greater than its gross domestic product .
Are there nonmilitary ways we could deploy that sum which would advance our goals as efficaciously ?
Would even forty thousand additional troops suffice for anything resembling the ambitious nation - building program that General Stanley McChrystal , the top military commander in Afghanistan , has proposed ?
( Counterinsurgency theory suggests that it would take more than ten times that many ; would forty — or ten , or twenty — thousand be only a first installment ? )
Any counterinsurgency campaign , we ’re told , requires a very long commitment .
Is the voluntary association of democracies called NATO , organized to deter war more than to wage it , capable of sustaining a twenty or thirty years ’ war ?
For that matter , does the United States — a decentralized populist democracy struggling with economic decline and political gridlock — have that capacity ?
And what about Pakistan ?
The President has come under heavy criticism for taking the time to ponder the imponderables .
“ The urgent necessity , ” a respected Washington columnist wrote the other day , “ is to make a decision — whether or not it is right . ”
Really ?
Does the columnist suppose that a country unable to find the patience for weeks ( even months ) of thinking could summon the stamina for years ( even decades ) of killing and dying ?
What Obama seems to have discovered is that this is no longer the war that began eight years ago .
That war was an act of retribution and prevention .
But now who are we punishing ?
What are we preventing ?
The old narrative is broken .
The fifth war is becoming a sixth . ♦
Port - au - Prince , Haiti ( CNN ) --
Earthquake victims , writhing in pain and grasping at life , watched doctors and nurses walk away from a field hospital Friday night after a Belgian medical team evacuated the area , saying it was concerned about security .
The decision left CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Sanjay Gupta as the only doctor at the hospital to get the patients through the night .
CNN initially reported , based on conversations with some of the doctors , that the United Nations ordered the Belgian First Aid and Support Team to evacuate .
However , Belgian Chief Coordinator Geert Gijs , a doctor who was at the hospital with 60 Belgian medical personnel , said it was his decision to pull the team out for the night .
Gijs said he requested U.N. security personnel to staff the hospital overnight , but was told that peacekeepers would only be able to evacuate the team .
He said it was a " tough decision " but that he accepted the U.N. offer to evacuate after a Canadian medical team , also at the hospital with Canadian security officers , left the site Friday afternoon .
The Belgian team returned Saturday morning .
Gijs said the United Nations has agreed to provide security for Saturday night .
The team has requested the Belgian government to send its own troops for the field hospital , which Gijs expects to arrive late Sunday .
Responding to the CNN report that Gupta was the only doctor left at the Port - au - Prince field hospital , U.N. spokesman Martin Nesirky said Saturday that the world body 's mission in Haiti did not order any medical team to leave .
If the team left , it was at the request of their own organization , he said .
Edmond Mulet , the U.N. assistant secretary general for peacekeeping operations , told reporters later that local security officers deemed the makeshift hospital unsafe .
" It seems that we 've heard some reports in the international media that the United Nations asked or forced some medical teams to not work any more in some clinic -- that is not true , that is completely untrue , " Mulet said Saturday .
CNN video from the scene Friday night shows the Belgian team packing up its supplies and leaving with an escort of blue - helmeted U.N. peacekeepers in marked trucks .

Gupta -- assisted by other CNN staffers , security personnel and at least one Haitian nurse who refused to leave -- assessed the needs of the 25 patients , but there was little they could do without supplies .
More people , some in critical condition , were trickling in late Friday .
" I 've never been in a situation like this .
This is quite ridiculous , " Gupta said .
With a dearth of medical facilities in Haiti 's capital , ambulances had nowhere else to take patients , some of whom had suffered severe trauma -- amputations and head injuries -- under the rubble .
Others had suffered a great deal of blood loss , but there were no blood supplies left at the clinic .
Gupta feared that some would not survive the night .
He and the others stayed with the injured all night , after the medical team had left and after the generators gave out and the tents turned pitch black .
Gupta monitored patients ' vital signs , administered painkillers and continued intravenous drips .
He stabilized three new patients in critical condition .
At 3:45 a.m. , he posted a message on Twitter : " pulling all nighter at haiti field hosp .
lots of work , but all patients stable .
turned my crew into a crack med team tonight . "
Are you in Haiti and safe ?

He said the Belgian doctors did not want to leave their patients behind but were ordered out by the United Nations , which sent buses to transport them .
" There is concern about riots not far from here -- and this is part of the problem , " Gupta said .
There have been scattered reports of violence throughout the capital .
" What is striking to me as a physician is that patients who just had surgery , patients who are critically ill , are essentially being left here , nobody to care for them , " Gupta said .
Sandra Pierre , a Haitian who has been helping at the makeshift hospital , said the medical staff took most of the supplies with them .
" All the doctors , all the nurses are gone , " she said .
" They are expected to be back tomorrow .
They had no plan on leaving tonight .
It was an order that came suddenly . "
She told Gupta , " It 's just you . "
A 7.0 magnitude earthquake flattened Haiti's capital city Tuesday afternoon , affecting as many as 3 million people as it fanned out across the island nation .
Tens of thousands of people are feared dead .
Haiti , the poorest nation in the Western hemisphere , lacked adequate medical resources even before the disaster and has been struggling this week to tend to huge numbers of injured .
The clinic , set up under several tents , was a godsend to the few who were lucky to have been brought there .
Retired Army Lt. Gen. Russel Honore , who led relief efforts for Hurricane Katrina in 2005 , said the evacuation of the clinic 's medical staff was unforgivable .
" Search and rescue must trump security , " Honoré said .
" I 've never seen anything like this before in my life .
They need to man up and get back in there . "
Honoré drew parallels between the tragedy in New Orleans , Louisiana , and in Port - au - Prince .
But even in the chaos of Katrina , he said , he had never seen medical staff walk away .
" I find this astonishing these doctors left , " he said .
" People are scared of the poor . "

Fuck this noise .

I 'm jumping up on my soapbox here , because I am sick of being vilified for being who I am .
By logic , this should n't even affect me - I 've been off the dating market for three years , and will continue to be for the foreseeable future .
But the constant drumbeat of " this is what 's wrong with you ! " permeates even the most stable of towers , and it is beyond ridiculous that there is an entire industry waiting to tell women all the things that are wrong with them .
And why am I supposed to compensate for being black , smart , or accomplished ?

Tipsters hit us with this gem yesterday , titled " Why Do Smart Women Have The Toughest Time Dating ? " written by Alex Benzer , author of Tao of Dating , Tao of Persuasion , and Tao of Sexual Mastery .
And he has the answer for all of the smart women out there who can't find a man :
What compels me to write this article today is a recent trip to the Harvard - Yale Game festivities , reminding me of how smart , educated women routinely sabotage their own chances for romantic fulfillment .
Because , as fabulous as these ladies are , all of their failed relationships have one thing in common : themselves .
And frankly , telling them that men are losers or even proving it conclusively does n't improve anyone 's plight .
Useful advice is about something you can change .

And what needs fixing ?
According to Benzer , we think too much , we 're too difficult , we 're competitive , and not quite feminine enough .
Some choice quotes from Benzer :
Once a relationship with Mr Smartypants is under foot , often she unconsciously starts to compare and compete with him .
She feels intimidated by his intelligence : " Is he smarter / more educated / more successful than me ? "
Now she 's feeling silly when she does n't know something , or tries to one - up him and have the upper hand .
The guy does n't quite know what 's happening , except that the very trait that made him attractive in the first place is now causing tension .
Remember that guys admire and respect a woman who can take charge and kick ass .
Guys respect and absolutely adore a woman who can take charge and kick ass but does n't feel the need to prove it around him .
According to Marianne Williamson 's insight in A Woman 's Worth , " In intimate relations with men , I want to major in feminine and minor in masculine . "
Newsflash from the cosmos : masculine things gravitate towards feminine things .
So if you want more masculine things ( e.g. guys ) in your life , then cultivate your feminine energy .
Men are suckers for your sensuality , the swing of your hips , the nape of your neck , the curve of your lips .
They absolutely love it when you take pleasure in the physical world through touch , food and sex .
Men also love it when you 're open to needing and receiving their help .
They like to feel useful and wanted , even though they know full well that you can open doors and run companies on your own .
Receptivity is a quintessential feminine quality , so if you want more good men in your life , be receptive to their offerings .
If you 're embodying joy , compassion and sensuality , telling him how great he is , making him feel like a billion bucks and the conqueror of worlds , you have no competition .
Anywhere .
Good men will come out of the woodwork to find a goddess like you .

Roger that .
While Benzer starts off his piece extolling all the things he loves about smart women , it 's clear what needs to happen from his piece .
Less books , more of this :
And when you 're finished making sure you 've achieved an acceptable level of hotness for society at large , adhere to the three principles Chris Rock so helpfully outlined in Bigger and Blacker : men want food , sex , and silence , so feed him , fuck him , and shut the fuck up .

Simple right ?
It so simple that every time I read a dating guide ( penned by either gender ) I already know what 's coming .
Wear tighter clothes .
Suck more dick .
Cook more food .
Be nicer .
Be prettier .
Wear skirts and dresses .
Work your stove , not your brain .
On and on and on .
And why do n't I see articles telling men to step their game up if they want to land a smart woman ?
From my feminist writings , I know there are way too many men that have no idea there is a difference between approaching someone and street harassment .
( Here 's a clue - if she does not respond to any of your advances , and you keep going , you 're rolling into harassment territory . )
And I 'm not saying you should never approach someone on the street .
But it 's kind of bad when the best thing I can hope for when someone tries to pick me up on the street sounds like this :
Can we please get an article about spitting game to a smart woman ?
Here , I 'll start off :
1 . Though a quaint hobby from a time long ago , some people still enjoy reading books .
Therefore , if you approach a smart woman and she is reading , a good thing to ask is " What are you reading ? " or " Would you recommend that book ? "
Refrain from saying things like " I have n't read a book since I finished high school ! " or " Why is a pretty girl like you reading ? "
This will not impress her and may actually ruin your chances .

2. Smart women like to discuss a variety of interesting topics on dates .
Do not be intimidated - many women enjoy conversation around the arts , current events , theory and ideas , interesting books , television shows , cooking , travel ... even more " taboo " topics like politics and religion .
Find out her interests by asking her questions .
Add in your own recommendations , and feel free to adjust the gender identification / sexuality to make it relevant to your own experience .

Why Do the Smartest Women Have the Toughest Time Dating ?
[ Huffington Post ]
( This guest post originally appeared at House.gov )
This past week we celebrated the end of what most people agree was a decade best forgotten .
New York Times columnist and leading Keynesian economist Paul Krugman called it the Big Zero in a recent column .
He wrote that “ there was a whole lot of nothing going on in measures of economic progress or success ” which is true .
However , Krugman continues to misleadingly blame the free market and supposed lack of regulation for the economic chaos .
It was encouraging that he admitted that blowing economic bubbles is a mistake , especially considering he himself advocated creating a housing bubble as a way to alleviate the hangover from the dotcom bust .
But we can no longer afford to give prominent economists like Krugman a pass when they completely ignore the burden of taxation , monetary policy , and excessive regulation .
Afterall , Krugman is still scratching his head as to why “ no ” economists saw the housing bust coming .
How in the world did they miss it ?
Actually many economists saw it coming a mile away , understood it perfectly , and explained it many times .
Policy makers would have been wise to heed the warnings of the Austrian economists , and must start listening to their teachings if they want solid progress in the future .
If not , the necessary correction is going to take a very long time .
The Austrian free - market economists use common sense principles .
You can not spend your way out of a recession .
You cannot regulate the economy into oblivion and expect it to function .
You cannot tax people and businesses to the point of near slavery and expect them to keep producing .
You cannot create an abundance of money out of thin air without making all that paper worthless .
The government cannot make up for rising unemployment by just hiring all the out of work people to be bureaucrats or send them unemployment checks forever .
You cannot live beyond your means indefinitely .
The economy must actually produce something others are willing to buy .
Government growth is the opposite of all these things .
Bureaucrats are loathe to face these unpleasant , but obvious realities .
It is much more appealing to wave their magic wand of regulation and public spending and divert blame elsewhere .
It is time to be honest about our problems .
The tragic reality is that this fatally flawed , but widely accepted , economic school of thought called Keynesianism has made our country more socialist than capitalist .
While the private sector in the last ten years has experienced a roller coaster of booms and busts and ended up , nominally , about where we started in 2000 , government has been steadily growing , because Keynesians told politicians they could get away with a tax , spend and inflate policy .
They even encouraged it !
But we cannot survive much longer if government is our only growth industry .
As for a lack of regulation , the last decade saw the enactment of the Sarbanes - Oxley Act , the largest piece of financial regulatory legislation in years .
This act failed to prevent abuses like those perpetrated by Bernie Madoff , and it is widely acknowledged that the new regulations contributed heavily not only to the lack of real growth , but also to many businesses going overseas .
Americans have been working hard , and Krugman rightly points out that they are getting nowhere .
Government is expanding steadily and keeping us at less than zero growth when inflation is factored in .
Krugman seems pretty disappointed with zero , but if we continue to listen to Keynesians in the next decade instead of those who tell us the truth , zero will start to look pretty good .
The end result of destroying the currency is the wiping out of the middle class .
Preventing that from happening should be our top economic priority .
It ’s getting harder to make a living as an editor of the printed word , what with newspapers and other publications cutting staff .
And it will be harder still now that Jack Lynch has published “ The Lexicographer ’s Dilemma , ” an entertaining tour of the English language in which he shows that many of the rules that editors and other grammatical zealots wave about like cudgels are arbitrary and destined to be swept aside as words and usage evolve .
Also , despite what some fussbudget may have told you , civilization will not end when this happens .
Mr. Lynch , a professor of English at Rutgers University , subtitles his book “ The Evolution of ‘ Proper ’ English , From Shakespeare to ‘ South Park , ’ ” and those quotation marks around “ proper ” are telling .
He takes us back to a time , half a millennium ago , when the very concept that there was a right and a wrong way to speak and spell things did not exist .
Those edible things that come out of chickens were “ egges ” in the northern part of England and “ eyren ” in the southern .
“ Eggs ” were still years in the future .
Not until the 17th century did people begin thinking that the language needed to be codified , and the details of who would do that and how have yet to be resolved .
Should it be accomplished through a government - sponsored academy , an officially sanctioned dictionary , or what ?
These and other means were attempted , but meanwhile ordinary folks , dang them , kept right on talking and writing however they wanted , inventing words , using contractions and so on .
Odd quests against specific words and uses were cropping up even in the 1600s , and they reveal the modern - day grammar warriors who campaign against , say , “ finalize ” to be tomorrow ’s ridiculous footnote .
Jonathan Swift , for instance , had a thing about the word mob , a truncation of the Latin “ mobile vulgus ” ( fickle crowd ) .
Who knows how many other masterpieces he might have written had he not wasted all that energy fighting a battle that did n’t need fighting .

BOULDER , Colo . –
Turns out climate policy has some tipping points .
Failure to set and meet strict targets for greenhouse gas emissions cuts over the next 40 years could put long - term goals – such as limiting planetary warming to 2 º C by 2100 – permanently out of reach .
That 's the conclusion of one of the first analyses to explore the relationships among energy use , mid-century targets and long - term policy options , published Monday by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
The study establishes the notion of " feasibility frontiers , " the point at which end - of - century goals become unobtainable or increasingly unlikely unless specific mid-century benchmarks are met .
The study also for the first time establishes odds of hitting specific long - term targets .
If energy demand remains high , for instance , it finds that even if the world 's governments manage to cut global emissions in half by 2050 and then do everything possible to limit emissions from 2050 on , society has only even odds of limiting global temperature increases to 2 º , a goal noted in the recent Copenhagen Accord .
These so - called " mid-century " benchmarks must be hit , in other words , to preserve options for future generations .
The study was published by scientists from the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder , the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Austria , and the Energy Research Center in the Netherlands .
" The long - term target discussion , as important as it is , is less important than the interim , " said Michael Oppenheimer , a climate scientist and policy expert at Princeton University who was not involved in the study but is familiar with the research .
Another example of a long - term goal is a cap on atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations , which today are rising as a result of human activity .
The science is not clear what level poses a threat , but some research suggests concentrations must remain at or below 450 parts - per-million to prevent drastic climate change .
Some advocacy groups seek a goal of 350 ppm , a level the atmosphere surpassed during the Reagan administration .
Preindustrial levels were 287 ppm ; today 's readings are closer to 387 .
But emissions today are on a path toward 550 ppm or beyond .
If a 50 percent emissions cut is deemed too expensive for today 's economies , and emissions instead remain flat for the next few decades – no easy feat in itself – the chances of holding atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations at 480 parts per million or less evaporate .
Even a future with 550 ppm CO2 becomes – depending on various energy assumptions – difficult or extraordinarily expensive to achieve , according to the analysis .
" There 's a cost to preserving options , " said NCAR climate scientist and lead author Brian O'Neill .
" What is the value of preserving an option you may want to exercise in the future ? "
Gary
Yohe , an economist at Wesleyan University , said the paper is notable for showing that climate policy has tipping points that work much the same way such thresholds work in various Earth systems .
Tip an ecosystem or planetary process – such as the atmospheren – too far in one direction , and it may suddenly and irreversibly " flip " into an altered state that precludes any notion of going back to the unaltered version .
These feasibility frontiers work similarly .
Fail to make specific targets by mid-century , O'Neill said , and no amount of effort will bring long - term goals in range .
The authors preclude any pie - in - the - sky solutions such as radical behavioral change or unproven technologies such as geo-engineering and nuclear fusion .
Other scientists call the work groundbreaking for the urgency it lends to a task that has so far eluded the world 's leaders : translating long - term goals into short - term action .
The discussion about near - term targets , Oppenheimer said , is the next step in both climate modeling and policy .
" The policy decision has always been one step behind the reality , and what Brian 's doing is really looking over the horizon . "
As more countries focus on the next few decades , Oppenheimer said the task , oddly enough , becomes easier .
" A lot becomes possible .
The world opens up in terms of where we need to go , how ambitious we can be , how ambitious we need to be , " he said .
" You want to send policy makers a message that their emissions decisions really need to fit within a certain box .
" This is the next step in a longer discussion . "
And it puts the cost of failure in plain language , added Yohe , who was not author of the study but is familiar with the research .
" There are thresholds here as well , " he said .
" You might find yourself running into a wall where you thought there was a door . "
" These guys have said if you wait too long , or if you do n't do 'x , ' the cost of even trying to achieve 'y ' is just going to go through the roof , " he added .
" That 's a currency that everybody talks about . "

If Amazon is Santa , 400 folks living in RVs outside the Coffeyville , Kansas fulfillment center this winter are the elves .

A few years back Chris Dunphy and Cherie Ve Ard flipped the bird to their desk jobs , packed their belongings in a custom 17 - foot solar - powered fiberglass camper , and hit the road to live " at the intersection of Epic and Awesome . "
A couple months ago , while staying with friends , they noticed that Amazon was luring RVers to Coffeyville , Kansas , the site of the retail giant 's original and largest fulfillment center .
" We were located in San Diego at the time , " explained Cherie .
" We 're part of a community of younger full - time RVers on Nurvers.com , a group of non-retired - age folks who are living the mobile lifestyle and kind of going outside the norms of ' Wait for retirement to travel . ' "
They noticed other RVers were flocking to Kansas to work for Amazon .
The pay was n't great — just above $ 10 - an - hour , typically — but Chris and Cherie were planning on being in St. Louis for the holidays .
Why not kill a month in Kansas working for Amazon ?

Fast forward a couple of weeks , and the self - styled " technomads " were putting down stakes at a state park about 20 miles from the four enormous but dull warehouses that comprise the Coffeyville hub .
Their first day inside , Chris was awed .
" Walking inside reminded me of the scene from Indiana Jones when they abandon the Ark in that giant warehouse .
It 's three stories high .
It feels like an industrial library .
Shelves going up and up and up . "
Hundreds of employees scurried , some " orange - badges " or " green - badges " hired by two temporary employment services mixed with the sought - after blue - badges of full - time Amazon employees , guided to their next destination by computers that flashed lights when bins were full or guided workers through the maze with handheld computers .
" Pickers are basically playing a human Pac - Man game .
They 've got a computer scanner that they carry around that tells them where to go .
They find their little shelf .
One slot might be a book .
The next shelf over might be a toaster .
Or an iPod .
The next slot after that might be a pair of jeans . "

Amazon did n't always lure in " workcampers " from the RV community .
" From what the agency people had told us , Amazon had a bad experience busing in people from Tulsa , " says Chris .
" There was a lot of theft and a lot of people who were n't really serious about the job . "
Advertisement
Workers from Tulsa were adding a 4 - hour round - trip commute to an already grueling 10 - to - 12 hour shift , Cherie is quick to add .
" They 'd get there exhausted . "
Enter the workcampers , people making a go at living in their RVs full time — many of whom might be otherwise overqualified .
" I think Amazon was skeptical at first , " says Cherie .
" But after the first trial year they were very , very impressed .
Workcampers came in enthusiastic about working , since most are professionals .
We 've owned businesses or been managers . "
White collar workers , trying their hand at the gypsy life .
Even better , the workcampers were able to stay locally .
Advertisement
Not all of the camps provided for the workcampers were exactly inviting .
Chris and Cherie pulled into the one just before Thanksgiving , but could tell it would n't make for a pleasant stay .
" The closest one was a city park called Walter Johnson .
RVs were very close together .
Half the campsites had full hookups , which meant they had water , electricity , and sewer dump on - site .
Half the sites just had electricity and water and they had what they call a ' Honey Wagon ' that comes around and pumps your sewage out a few times a week . "
Some RVers had been in Coffeyville since August .

Worse , it was cramped and muddy .
" Coffeyville also had a flood three years ago , so it was very , very wet and muddy because the area had been washed out , then rained on recently . "
They eventually moved on to a state park , which was lovely , but also four times farther away .
They rarely had time to enjoy the scenery .
" We were on the night shift , " says Chris , " Our day would start when we would wake up at three in the afternoon .
Work started at five . "
Advertisement
" Every shift starts with what they call a ' Stand Up . '
You gather in one area with your usual department — ours was called ' Sortable Singles , ' which sounds like it should be the name of a dating site — and they 'd count off how many people they needed in each department .
Run through a few announcements .
Give you a few safety tips .
And then they lead you through five minutes of group stretches . "
Cherie was mainly a packer , putting items in the box and scanning them .
Chris , on the other hand , was a " water spider . "
He explains , " A water spider is responsible for keeping all the packers supplied , so ideally they 'd never need to stand up and leave their station to get any other supplies like all the different sizes of boxes , plus making sure their tape machines and paper - spitter machines are operating . "

" I never quite exactly figured out why they call it a water spider .
My guess is back in the history of assembly line jobs , the water spider would be the person who would bring people on the line water to drink .
Nobody seemed to know ! "
The Mocha Factory
Work was monotonous and — for a couple who had been living a relative life of leisure — full of endless hours of standing on one 's feet .

" 24 - Hour Fitness , Amazon - style , " laughs Chris .
Cherie liked to think of it as having " a personal trainer for 60 hours a week . "
Inside the warehouses , machines and man alike were controlled by Amazon 's computerized assembly line .

In one part of the factory , Chris watched two giant elliptical carousels , each one the size of a football field , carry wooden trays around at 15 m ph .
" All the items are coming in the totes on one side of this giant machine .
There are people who take each individual item , scan them and put them on the trays as they go by .
The trays get to a chute where their order is being assembled , tilt , and the product flies down into that space .
When all the items for a particular order are assembled in one place an orange light comes on and somebody comes by . "
Above , another carousel brought an endless procession of empty boxes to be filled with the orders .
It was n't exactly what Cherie had envisioned .
" When we told people were going to do this , someone said ' Whenever I click the order button on Amazon , I always imagine a chorus of happy , singing Oompa - Loompas riding around on Segways and shipping my stuff . '
Well ... no .
It 's not exactly like that . "

" The computer has to prioritize how it 's going to send out all the pickers in this giant facility .
So someone could order a book and a sweater and an iPod , and those could be in completely different corners of the whole facility .
But somehow they all arrive within about 30 minutes of each other . "
It 's efficiency even Willy Wonka could love .
Chris and Cherie would n't work another season at Coffeyville , but not because they were miserable .
" Everybody treated each other really nicely ! " says Chris .
It 's just that the two are " experience junkies , craving the new , " even if working for Amazon certainly gave them a fresh perspective on American culture .

" You 'd have a tote come down the line , and you 'd have adult toys right next to kid toys in the same bin , " laughs Cherie .
" The Obama Chia Pet was an oddity .
And the Bill Clinton corkscrew .
And I did have a tote one afternoon that was full of mooning gnomes . "

Chris geeked on it pretty hard .
( Before he became an migrant worker , Chris was a founding editor for boot magazine — later known as Maximum PC .
He also worked for Palm . )
" Just getting to experience that type of work , to literally see consumer culture flow beneath your fingertips , was absolutely fascinating .
You feel the pulse of the market . "
Besides their paychecks , all they 're left with are memories — cameras were n't allowed inside .
Advertisement
" One of the rules at Amazon is that you 're not allowed to bring anything into the facility that they sell . "
Chris went through a bit of withdrawal .
" One of the hardest things about the job was going without my iPhone for a month .
It was a great way to break the addiction of wanting to Twitter about things .
You'd be like , ' Oh my God , I just saw this Bill Clinton corkscrew and you wo n't believe where the corkscrew comes out . '
But oh crap , I can't tweet . "
In 2007 , more than 1,500 Filipino inmates performed the choreography for “ Thriler ” and Michael Jackson became their fan .
Travis Payne , Jackson ’s choreographer said that Jackson watched the videos of Cebu Provincial Detention and Rehabilitation Center ( CPDRC ) prisoners during breaks from his tour rehearsals for “ This Is It “ .
According to the New York Times , Bryon decided to post videos of the prisoners dancing online to publicize some of the positive changes he implemented at Cebu since joining the staff in 2004 .

Uganda backs down on anti-gay legislation
After months of resistance against international pressure to overturn Uganda ’s now - notorious Anti-Homosexuality Bill , Uganda ’s politicians seem to be pulling back .
In early January , Uganda ’s President Yoweri Museveni expressed concern that the bill was too harsh and on Jan. 12th noted :
" Because it is a foreign policy issue , it is not just our internal politics , and we must handle it in a way which does not compromise our principles but also takes into account our foreign policy interests . "
The U.N. and the U.S. government , along with countries such as Britain , Canada and Sweden , have expressed their strong disapproval of the bill .
Their displeasure has had an effect : during a January 19th cabinet meeting , the Ugandan government agreed to form a committee to amend the bill , with cabinet members citing the possibility of aid cuts by Western governments as a chief reason behind their reservations .
The bill ’s author , MP David Bahati , held strong for a little longer .
That is , until today when he expressed willingness to change some key clauses of the legislation .
Of course , none of this means that gay Ugandans will be getting a fair shake anytime soon — especially when 95 percent of those surveyed in the country believe homosexuality should continue to be criminalized .
Although the U.S. government has condemned the bill , the American evangelical influences behind it are widely known .
For example , Rick Warren , who advised most of the bill ’s leading supporters ( such as Pastor Martin Ssempa ) , was barely ahead of Museveni in distancing himself from it .
Also heavily circulated were the allegations by Jeff Sharlet that President Museveni , his ethics minister Nsamba Buturo and David Bahati , all have ties to U.S. politicians linked to The Family ( a secretive evangelical organization with plenty of political influence ) .
Now , with human rights activists and journalists fully in the mix , friction over the bill has led to a proxy battle over the U.S. ’ cultural influence in the region .
On Christmas Day , police in the U.K. rounded up tourists taking photos of the royal family at Sandringham church and confiscated their cameras .
At The Independent , Dominic Lawson 's dismay subsides to confusion : Britain 's police are " descending into obvious madness , " he writes . " … Their explanation of their behaviour is usually much harder to understand than the errors they seek to mitigate . "
In his view , the many similar absurdities ( also recently arrested was a man who took photographs of a chip shop ) are united by a simple and apolitical motive .
Lawson puts it thus :
If the innocent citizen reacts with the outrage of the genuinely guiltless , the officers involved may well take a special pleasure in humiliating him – and it is this which makes most people meekly accept official behaviour , even if they might strongly suspect it is the police who are behaving illegally .
Brits have a term for these sort of officials : jobsworths .
The police know that they 're harming what they ostensibly protect , but have n't been ordered to give a damn .
And the result of that is far worse : " none of us can feel safe : exactly the inverse of what our masters ' policies are supposedly designed to achieve . "

Stephen De Mowbray joined the Secret Service after World War II For 30 years Stephen De Mowbray has maintained a self - imposed silence on a career that once took him to the heart of one of British intelligence 's most controversial episodes .
In 1979 he quit his job with the Secret Service because he believed officials had failed to take seriously the claim that British intelligence had been further penetrated by its enemy - the Soviet Union 's KGB .
A number of spies had been discovered in the 1960s but De Mowbray believed there were more .
But he found no - one at the top willing to listen .
" People thought I was either mad or bad because I was trying to do something , " he says of that time .
Three decades later , De Mowbray decided to tell his side of the story after reading the authorised history of the Security Service ( MI5 ) , published last October .
It dismisses the view that there were further traitors in the Security Service .
Conspiracy theories ?
In the book , De Mowbray 's claims are the subject of a chapter subtitled " paranoid tendencies " which recounts his work as well as that of two colleagues , Peter Wright ( author of the controversial Spycatcher ) and Arthur Martin .
The book quotes an MI5 director saying of the group : " Involvement in counter - espionage cases induces in some a form of paranoia . "
De Mowbray himself is referred to - although not by name - as " the leading SIS ( Secret Intelligence Service ) conspiracy theorist " .
" I was this SIS officer , " De Mowbray confirms .
De Mowbray joined the Secret Service shortly after World War II and in the 1960s was assigned to work in the field of Soviet counter - intelligence investigating the operations of the KGB .
I vowed to myself that I would never let go of this case
Stephen De Mowbray
The British establishment was in the process of being rocked by a series of scandals in which a number of individuals were revealed to be working for the other side .
De Mowbray was assigned to work on the case of a KGB officer named Anatoliy Golitsyn , who defected in 1961 .
Golitsyn remains a controversial figure .
De Mowbray argues he provided a number of crucial leads .
Critics say he became prone to exaggeration .
Golitsyn's information suggested there were more traitors in the West , including within its intelligence agencies .
At the same time , two MI5 officers - Arthur Martin and Peter Wright - had also both come separately to the same conclusion - that there was a penetration at the highest reaches of the Security Service .
Extraordinary times
They called on MI6 to help and De Mowbray was assigned to assist them .
" There were extraordinary things going on , " recalls De Mowbray .
" Martin was running people against the Soviets and those operations were going wonky . "
Meanwhile Peter Wright 's bugging devices , which had been installed in Soviet premises around the world , were also failing to produce intelligence .
These operations were known only to very few senior officers in MI5 .
" I was utterly horrified at the thought that this was happening , " says De Mowbray .
De Mowbray still believes he was right
When the small group added in Golitsyn's claims they came to believe that there was a mole at the very top - either Graham Mitchell , the number two at MI5 , or his boss Roger Hollis .
" I vowed to myself that I would never let go of this case , " recalls De Mowbray .
In his authorised history of MI5 , Christopher Andrew describes the investigations into Hollis and Mitchell as " the most traumatic episodes in the Cold War history of the Security Service " .
Mitchell was investigated first .
As recounted in the authorised history , this involved bugging his phone , feeding him false information and putting him under close surveillance .
" We followed Mitchell all over the place , downtown when he left from the office , trying to chase him up the steps in Waterloo when he went home , " recalls De Mowbray .
Even after his retirement , Mitchell was still monitored .
Nothing was found .
Next Hollis was investigated but eventually also cleared .
" There were suspicions with both of them , " De Mowbray argues .
" There are not suspicions now .
But somebody was doing it . " ' KGB campaign '
In 1964 , De Mowbray was posted to Washington where he worked more closely with Golitsyn and his sponsor in the CIA , James Jesus Angleton .
Angleton became convinced that the KGB was mounting a wide - scale deception campaign to hide its true capabilities and the presence of its spies in the West .
I could not reconcile myself to doing nothing : I had made so many commitments to myself and to others to pursue the problem to the end that I could not wash my hands and forget about it
Stephen De Mowbray
He was eventually dismissed from the CIA .
Critics said he damaged the organisation through his investigations into a CIA " mole " who never existed .
In the authorised history of MI5 , it is argued that Golitsyn became an increasing " liability " because of his " passionately paranoid tendencies " .
De Mowbray disagrees with the portrayal of Golitsyn .
He says he has been misrepresented and disputes details presented of Golitsyn's visits to the UK , arguing that some of them were genuinely productive in terms of intelligence leads .
De Mowbray became increasingly frustrated at the lack of action and complained repeatedly to his superiors through the 1970s .
He was moved away from the investigation .
" I could not reconcile myself to doing nothing : I had made so many commitments to myself and to others to pursue the problem to the end that I could not wash my hands and forget about it , " he explains .
He argued that MI5 had not properly investigated itself and was incapable of doing so .
" It was a very difficult situation for years on end , " he says now of that time .
Peter Wright was also convinced of high - level penetration De Mowbray went as far as approaching the Cabinet Secretary , Sir John ( later Lord ) Hunt .
He referred De Mowbray on to a former Cabinet Secretary , Lord Trend , who conducted a review of the subject and found insufficient evidence to support the allegations .
" Do n't expect me to tear Whitehall apart about all this , " De Mowbray recalls Lord Trend telling him .
He was told he could not have his old job back in counter - intelligence and soon after De Mowbray applied for early retirement .
He went off to the US initially to help Golitsyn write a book on Soviet deception and later to help him on his unpublished memoirs .
He had no further contact with the intelligence services and steered clear of public comment until reading the authorised history of MI5 .
The consensus view has now developed , reflected in Christopher Andrew 's book , that there were no further high - level penetrations in British intelligence .
But De Mowbray remains convinced that there is a dark secret that has still not come out .
" When I left most people were oblivious of the situation " , he says .
" Maybe I was wrong ?
But I do n't think I was . "

Electronic publishing has revolutionized the art of writing , now less than two months since it happened , we have the very first book about Climategate .
My first story on Climategate appeared on November 19th , 2009 : Breaking News Story : CRU has apparently been hacked – hundreds of files released
I ’ve read the book , and it appears to be an accurate and detailed portrayal of the history not only of the Climategate events and the players , but also of the events leading up to it .
I ’m flattered that this book mentions me and my surfacestations project several times .
I was interviewed for the book , and this website is featured prominently –and they borrowed liberally from both the posts and the comments .
For those of you that want to follow a detective story , this one has as the twists and turns of Mickey Spillane with a Hardy Boys approach to a matter of fact story line .
I highly recommend it .
This book is being published in electronic downloadable form , and is available for purchase online .
You ’ll recognize the authors as regulars here and at Climate Audit .
Please consider purchasing this book , as it will provide funds to get Mosh out of the flat in San Francisco he shares with Charles The Moderator , who are becoming the climatic odd couple of our time .
Here are excerpts of the book :
In October of 2004 McIntyre and his criticism was on the radar of climate scientists .
Tom Wigley writes Phil Jones about McIntyre ’s and McKitrick ’s work ( MM03 ) which is making its way around the internet .
Wigley is not as dismissive of McIntyre ’s and McKitrick ’s work as is Michael Mann .
In fact , Wigley calls Mann ’s paper a very sloppy piece of work …
At 20:46 21/10/2004 , [ Tom Wigley ]
Phil ,
I have just read the M&M stuff critcizing MBH .
A lot of it seems valid to me .
At the very least MBH is a very sloppy piece of work — an opinion I have held for some time .
Presumably what you have done with Keith is better ? — or is it ?
I get asked about this a lot .
Can you give me a brief heads up ?
Mike is too deep into this to be helpful .
Tom .
As Wigley notes M & M ( McIntyre and McKitrick ) have some valid points in their criticism of MBH ( Mann and his co authors 1998 paper ) .
What Mann viewed as a stunt others found merit in .
Wigley asks Jones about his reconstruction work with colleague Keith Briffa .
Briffa , as the Climategate mails show and as his studies show was less certain about reconstructions of the MWP than Mann was .
Jones , of course , is stuck between supporting Briffa or Mann , both co-authors .
Most importantly Wigley recognizes that Mann is too deep in this to be helpful .
Mann has too much at stake to be objective .
Jones replies , by this time taking on some of Mann ’s attitudes toward McIntyre and McKitrick :
From : Phil Jones p.jones@xxxxxx
To : Tom Wigley wigley@xxxxxx
Tom ,
The attached is a complete distortion of the facts .
M&M are completely wrong in virtually everything they say or do .
I have sent them countless data series that were used in the Jones / Mann Reviews of Geophysics papers .
I got scant thanks from them for doing this – only an email saying I had some of the data series wrong , associated with the wrong year / decade .
I wasted a few hours checking what I ’d done and got no thanks for pointing their mistake out to them .
If you think M&M are correct and believable then go to this web site
Point I ’m trying to make is you cannot trust anything that M&M write . ….
Bottom line – there is no way the MWP ( whenever it was ) was as warm globally as the last 20 years .
There is also no way a whole decade in the LIA period was more than 1 deg C on a global basis cooler than the 1961 - 90 mean .
This is all gut feeling , no science , but years of experience of dealing with global scales and varaibility .
Cheers
Phil
Jones ’ “ gut feeling ” is at stake and he is clearly agitated by his encounters with McIntyre , a marked difference from their exchange in 2002 .
In 2002 , McIntyre was merely a researcher asking for data , but by 2003 McIntyre was a published author leveling criticisms at Jones ’ co author Michael Mann .
Jones also refers Wigley to a web site that discussed M&M .
The fight over MM03 was largely taking place on the web as McIntyre had started to write about his findings on a blog called www.climate2003.com.
For independent researchers like McIntyre , posting articles on the internet was far more expedient than publishing in page limited journals .
And just as citizen - journalists had transformed print journalism with the advent of blogs , climate science looked ripe to be transformed by the internet .
McIntyre and McKitrick also adopted a publication model used by econometricians : they posted their data and their code so that anyone could check their work , find errors and suggest improvements .
This gave them the moral high ground of transparency as opposed to Mann ’s and Bradley ’s shadowy world of “ independent scientists , ” although Mann and Bradley would certainly argue with some legitimacy that they were only following a century - old practice . ”
…
Steve McIntyre struggle for years to get accurate data out of the hands of an elite team of scientists in England and the U.S. , only to be stymied by continued refusals and runarounds .
At the beginning the data concerned work highlighted by your host , Anthony Watts , about the fidelity of the temperature records here in the United States .
Later , it revolved around the data used in construction of proxy temperature records , such as the Hockey Stick Chart , now infamous for shoddy analysis and poor sample selection .
Climategate , written by Steve Mosher and Tom Fuller , is an account of the events leading up to the leaking of over 1,000 emails and assorted files that exposes the unethical and perhaps illegal practices used by the Hockey Stick Team to protect their turf as well as their information .
These rock star scientists dined with the elite and feasted on government grants , but it was all predicated on ‘ hiding the decline : ’
Making sure no - one saw how shaky their data , analysis and conclusions actually were .
Hide the decline did n’t refer to temperatures –it was worse .
It was a decline in the quality of their data they were trying to hide .
This book puts it all into context–and in context it is worse .
Mosher actually played a small part in bringing the details to light ( although your zany moderator Charles the First was more instrumental ) , and Fuller covered the story for examiner.com from day one of the scandal .
Here ’s an excerpt : “ In Chapter 6 we introduce the Army of Davids that will start the laborious process of documenting all the surface stations in the US .
McIntyre starts dissecting the Jones 1990 paper and his intense focus on individual cases finds a sympathetic ear in Anthony Watts , who launches an even more detailed look at individual cases in the US .
Discussions about UHI and data and code turn from a focus on Jones 1990 to a focus on NASA and their GISSTEMP code , which is eventually released .
At the start of May , McIntyre links to a blogger named Anthony Watts , a former TV meteorologist who was convinced that temperature monitoring stations in the United States were in dire shape and could not be trusted to create a temperature record , especially one that the world would use as a reference point for dealing with climate change .
During the summer , Watts would launch a nationwide volunteer effort to document the weather collection stations used by NOAA , NASA , CRU and Jones .
The effort that Trenberth thought too large for any one individual would be handled under Watts ’ generalship by a true army of Davids across the nation , using the tools of the internet .
The goal very simply was to document the status of the temperature collection stations .
Many hands made light work of the job scientists thought too large to attempt .
Tom Karl of NOAA takes notice of Watts but is not sure how it will turn out .

Thanks Phil ,
We R now responding to a former TV weather forecaster who has got press , He has a web site of 40 of the USHCN stations showing less than ideal exposure .
He claims he can show urban biases and exposure biases .
We are writing a response for our Public Affairs .
Not sure how it will play out .
Regards , Tom
That effort , ridiculed at first by bloggers in the warmist faction , would in the end garner Watts a visit to NCDC to discuss his work .
Moreover , in the end NOAA would engage in an effort to bring the climate network up to better quality standards .
As of July 2009 the volunteer effort , hosted at www.surfacestations.org.
had surveyed 1,003 of the 1,221 stations used by NOAA and corrected mistakes in the official metadata . :
Readers from this site can finish that part of the story .

ObamaCare at Any Cost A bill that raises prices but lowers costs , and other miracles .
One of the Bush administration 's most pernicious legacies is the never - ending War on Terrorism , a perpetual state of emergency that supposedly authorizes the president to break the law , abridge civil liberties , and ignore due process , all under a cloak of secrecy .
Last week former Vice President Dick Cheney accused the Obama administration of forsaking Bush 's War on Terrorism .
If only it were true .
After watching the official reaction to the failed Christmas Day bombing of Northwest Flight 253 from Amsterdam to Detroit , Cheney complained that " President Obama is trying to pretend we are not at war . "
In addition to Obama 's " low - key response " to Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab 's fizzled underwear bomb , Cheney cited the administration 's plans to close the military prison at Guantanamo Bay , release some detainees held there , and try suspected terrorists in federal court .
" We are at war , " Cheney insisted , " and when President Obama pretends we are n't , it makes us less safe . "
If Obama is pretending we are not at war , he is not doing a very good job of it .
" Our nation is at war against a far - reaching network of violence and hatred , " he declared in his inaugural address .
" I do n't think there 's any question but that we are at war " with terrorists , his attorney general , Eric Holder , said at his confirmation hearing that same month .
" We are indeed at war with Al Qaeda and its affiliates , " Obama said in May .
" As the president has made clear , " his chief counterterrorism adviser , John Brennan , said in August , " we are at war with Al Qaeda . "
It 's true that Obama prefers to say we are at war with terrorists rather than terrorism , because , as Brennan put it , " you can never fully defeat a tactic like terrorism any more than you can defeat the tactic of war itself . "
But since Al Qaeda and its allies wo n't be signing an instrument of surrender anytime in the foreseeable future , the implications are similar .
Nor does there seem to be much difference between Bush and Obama in terms of the policies said to be justified by this permanent war .
The closing of Guantanamo , which was supposed to happen this month but has been delayed until next year at the earliest , is by the Obama administration 's own account a symbolic move , aimed at removing a conspicuous " recruiting tool " for Al Qaeda .
But the policy that Guantanamo represents will continue .
Under the Bush administration , detainees were either released , tried in civilian court , tried by military tribunals , or held indefinitely without trial , depending on the president 's whim .
Under the Obama administration , detainees will either be released , tried in civilian court , tried by military tribunals , or held indefinitely without trial , depending on the president 's whim .
Furthermore , Obama reserves the right to keep detainees locked up even if they are acquitted , an option that makes you wonder why he bothers with trials at all .
Obama and Bush are also of one mind when it comes to the necessity and propriety of shipping detainees off to cooperating countries that may have fewer compunctions about torture and of listening to Americans ' phone calls and reading their email without a warrant .
They likewise agree that national security requires the suppression of lawsuits aimed at holding the government accountable for violating people 's rights in the name of the War on Terrorism — excuse me , the War on Terrorists .
Cheney not only exaggerates the differences between his former boss 's anti-terrorism policies and Obama's ; he puts way too much faith in the power of martial rhetoric to stop bombs from going off .
In the case that provoked his tirade , as with the September 11 attacks , it was the government 's failure to connect crucial pieces of information that prevented the attacker from receiving the scrutiny he should have .
" We need to …make sure we can put those pieces together , " Brennan said on Sunday , " so that we take every step possible to prevent these individuals from getting on planes . "
Does such competence require a declaration of war ?

Biggest Week 4 injury questions for all 32 NFL teams :
What 's next for Michael Thomas , George Kittle and others
Thomas and Kittle could be nearing a return but the status of others like Julio Jones is still unclear .
NFL Nation reporters have the latest updates .
This is a question that I get very frequently , and I always tried to dodged the bullet , but I get it so much that I feel that I have to provide an answer .
Obviously , I am ( not so ) slightly biased toward NHibernate , so while you read it , please keep it in mind .
EF 4.0 has done a lot to handle the issues that were raised with the previous version of EF .
Thinks like transparent lazy loading , POCO classes , code only , etc. EF 4.0 is a much nicer than EF 1.0 .
The problem is that it is still a very young product , and the changes that were added only touched the surface .
I already talked about some of my problems with the POCO model in EF , so I wo n’t repeat that , or my reservations with the Code Only model .
But basically , the major problem that I have with those two is that there seems to be a wall between what experience of the community and what Microsoft is doing .
Both of those features shows much of the same issues that we have run into with NHibernate and Fluent NHibernate .
Issues that were addressed and resolved , but show up in the EF implementations .
Nevertheless , even ignoring my reservations about those , there are other indications that NHibernate ’s maturity makes itself known .
I run into that several times while I was writing the guidance for EF Prof , there are things that you simple can’t do with EF , that are a natural part of NHibernate .
I am not going to try to do a point by point list of the differences , but it is interesting to look where we do find major differences between the capabilities of NHibernate and EF 4.0 .
Most of the time , it is in the ability to fine tune what the framework is actually doing .
Usually , this is there to allow you to gain better performance from the system without sacrificing the benefits of using an OR / M in the first place .
Here is a small list :
Write batching – NHibernate can be configured to batch all writes to the database so that when you need to write several statements to the database , NHibernate will only make a single round trip , instead of going to the database per each statement .
Read batching / multi queries / futures – NHibernate allows to batch several queries into a single round trip to the database , instead of separate roundtrip per each query .
Batched collection loads –
When you lazy load a collection , NHibernate can find other collections of the same type that were n’t loaded , and load all of them in a single trip to the database .
This is a great way to avoid having to deal with SELECT N+1 .
Collection with lazy = ” extra ” – Lazy extra means that NHibernate adapts to the operations that you might run on top of your collections .
That means that blog .
Posts .
Count will not force a load of the entire collection , but rather would create a “ select count ( * ) from Posts where BlogId = 1 ” statement , and that blog .
Posts . Contains ( ) will likewise result in a single query rather than paying the price of loading the entire collection to memory .
Collection filters and paged collections - this allows you to define additional filters ( including paging ! ) on top of your entities collections , which means that you can easily page through the blog .
Posts collection , and not have to load the entire thing into memory .
2nd level cache – managing the cache is complex , I touched on why this is important before , so I ’ll skip if for now .
Tweaking – this is something that is critical whenever you need something that is just a bit beyond what the framework provides .
With NHibernate , in nearly all the cases , you have an extension point , with EF , you are completely and utterly blocked .
Integration & Extensibility – NHibernate has a lot of extension projects , such as NHibernate Search , NHibernate Validator , NHibernate Shards , etc .
Such projects not only do not exists for EF , but they cannot be written , for the most part , because EF has no extension points to speak of .
On the other side , however :
The original dating in 1967 found the fossils to be 130,000 years old
The age estimate comes from a re-dating of Ethiopian rock layers close to those that yielded the remarkable fossils .
The skulls , known as Omo I and II , push back the known presence of Homo sapiens in Africa by 40,000 years .
The latest dating work is reported in the science journal Nature .
It puts the specimens close to the time expected for the evolutionary emergence of our species .
Genetic studies have indicated Homo sapiens arose in East Africa - possibly Ethiopia or Tanzania - just over 200,000 years ago .
" These are the earliest known examples of our own species and that suggests they lived earlier still , " commented Nature senior editor Dr Henry Gee .
" But I am not sure how much further back you could go and still have Homo sapiens - before they graded into some other , earlier species , " he told the BBC News website .
Dig return
The skulls were first brought to the attention of the world by the famous fossil hunter Richard Leakey , whose team unearthed the specimens in sediments along the Omo River in southernmost Ethiopia , near the town of Kibish .
They found the skull ( minus the face ) and partial skeleton ( parts of arms , legs , feet and the pelvis ) of Omo I , and the top and back of the skull of Omo II .
Omo River : Revealing secrets about the origin of humans
The team even returned to the original excavation area , using old scientific reports , photographs and film to identify the precise dig co-ordinates .
" Omo I actually has the better information on it , " explained co-author Professor Brown , from the University of Utah 's College of Mines and Earth Sciences .
" [ The records and maps ] are correct and we actually went back and found a few more pieces of the skeleton and some of them glue on to the pieces that were found in 1967 . "
Climate clincher
The original dating in 1967 found the fossils to be 130,000 years old .
This was based on the decay rate of radioactive uranium atoms contained in oyster shells found near the skulls - " but that date should always have been taken with a pinch of salt " , Professor Brown told BBC News .
" Molluscs are not really very good for that kind of thing . "
Some new finds are clearly related to old ones
These crystals were retrieved from chunks of pumice in volcanic ash layers above and below the skulls .
They suggested the specimens must be between 104,000 and 196,000 years old - but with some additional climate evidence on ancient flooding in the region , the team was able to show the Omo finds were actually very close to the 196,000 - year mark .
Dr Chris Stringer , from London 's Natural History Museum , worked on the skulls more than 20 years ago .
He told BBC News : " I was of the opinion that Omo I was a modern human - Omo II seemed much more primitive .
So , from my point of view I thought Omo II might be older than Omo I .
" But it seems that they are about the same age and that shows that the populations in Africa at that time were very variable .
They show different mixtures of primitive and modern characteristics . "
The previous oldest Homo sapiens skulls were uncovered in sediments near a village called Herto in the Afar region in the east of Ethiopia .
These were dated to between 154,000 and 160,000 years old .
To be human
Although researchers are pushing at the evolutionary base of our species , they still have much to discover in terms of these early people 's behaviour .
Professor Brown explains : " ... the cultural aspects of humanity in most cases appear much later in the record - only 50,000 years ago - which would mean 150,000 years of Homo sapiens without cultural stuff , such as evidence of eating fish , of harpoons , anything to do with music ( flutes and that sort of thing ) , needles , even tools .
The Herto skulls were dated to about 160,000 years ago
Professor John Fleagle , of New York state 's Stony Brook University , adds : " There is a huge debate in the archaeological literature regarding the first appearance of modern aspects of behaviour such as bone carving for religious reasons , or tools , ornamentation ( bead jewellery and such ) , drawn images , and arrowheads .
" They only appear as a coherent package about 50,000 years ago , and the first modern humans that left Africa between 50,000 and 40,000 years ago seem to have had the full set .
" As modern human anatomy is documented at earlier and earlier sites , it becomes evident that there was a great time gap between the appearance of the modern skeleton and ' modern behaviour ' . "

Recently by Ron Paul : Americans Deserve a Transparent Fed
Statement before the Foreign Affairs Committee , United States House of Representatives , December 10 , 2009
Mr. Speaker thank you for holding these important hearings on US policy in Afghanistan .
I would like to welcome the witnesses , Ambassador Karl W. Eikenberry and General Stanley A. McChrystal , and thank them for appearing before this Committee .
I have serious concerns , however , about the president ’s decision to add some 30,000 troops and an as yet undisclosed number of civilian personnel to escalate our Afghan operation .
This surge will bring US troop levels to approximately those of the Soviets when they occupied Afghanistan with disastrous result back in the 1980s .
I fear the US military occupation of Afghanistan may end up similarly unsuccessful .
In late 1986 Soviet armed forces commander , Marshal Sergei Akhromeev , told then - Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev , " Military actions in Afghanistan will soon be seven years old .
There is no single piece of land in this country which has not been occupied by a Soviet soldier .
Nonetheless , the majority of the territory remains in the hands of rebels .
Soon Gorbachev began the Soviet withdrawal from its Afghan misadventure .
Thousands were dead on both sides , yet the occupation failed to produce a stable national Afghan government .
Eight years into our own war in Afghanistan the Soviet commander ’s words ring eerily familiar .
Part of the problem stems from a fundamental misunderstanding of the situation .
It is our presence as occupiers that feeds the insurgency .
As would be the case if we were invaded and occupied , diverse groups have put aside their disagreements to unify against foreign occupation .
Adding more US troops will only assist those who recruit fighters to attack our soldiers and who use the US occupation to convince villages to side with the Taliban .

Proponents of the president ’s Afghanistan escalation cite the successful surge in Iraq as evidence that this second surge will have similar results .
I fear they might be correct about the similar result , but I dispute the success propaganda about Iraq .
In fact , the violence in Iraq only temporarily subsided with the completion of the ethnic cleansing of Shi’ites from Sunni neighborhoods and vice versa — and all neighborhoods of Christians .
Those Sunni fighters who remained were easily turned against the foreign al - Qaeda presence when offered US money and weapons .
We are increasingly seeing this success  breaking down : sectarian violence is flaring up and this time the various groups are better armed with US - provided weapons .
Similarly , the insurgents paid by the US to stop their attacks are increasingly restive now that the Iraqi government is no longer paying bribes on a regular basis .
So I am skeptical about reports on the success of the Iraqi surge .
If you like this site , please help keep it going and growing .
Likewise , we are told that we have to win in Afghanistan so that al - Qaeda cannot use Afghan territory to plan further attacks against the US .
We need to remember that the attack on the United States on September 11 , 2001 was , according to the 9/11 Commission Report , largely planned in the United States ( and Germany ) by terrorists who were in our country legally .
According to the logic of those who endorse military action against Afghanistan because al - Qaeda was physically present , one could argue in favor of US airstrikes against several US states and Germany !
It makes no sense .
The Taliban allowed al - Qaeda to remain in Afghanistan because both had been engaged , with US assistance , in the insurgency against the Soviet occupation .
Nevertheless , the president ’s National Security Advisor , Gen. James Jones , USMC ( Ret. ) , said in a recent interview that less than 100 al - Qaeda remain in Afghanistan and that the chance they would reconstitute a significant presence there was slim .
Are we to believe that 30,000 more troops are needed to defeat 100 al - Qaeda fighters ?
I fear that there will be increasing pressure for the US to invade Pakistan , to where many Taliban and al - Qaeda have escaped .
Already CIA drone attacks on Pakistan have destabilized that country and have killed scores of innocents , producing strong anti-American feelings and calls for revenge .
I do not see how that contributes to our national security .

The president ’s top advisor for Afghanistan and Pakistan , Richard Holbrooke , said recently ,  I would say this about defining success in Afghanistan and Pakistan .
In the simplest sense , the Supreme Court test for another issue , we ’ll know it when we see it .
That does not inspire much confidence .
Supporters of this surge argue that we must train an Afghan national army to take over and strengthen the rule and authority of Kabul .
But experts have noted that the ranks of the Afghan national army are increasingly being filled by the Tajik minority at the expense of the Pashtun plurality .
US diplomat Matthew Hoh , who resigned as Senior Civilian Representative for the U.S. Government in Zabul Province , noted in his resignation letter that he  fail [s ] to see the value or the worth in continued U.S. casualties or expenditures of resources in support of the Afghan government in what is , truly , a 35 - year - old civil war . 
Mr. Hoh went on to write that  [ L]ike the Soviets , we continue to secure and bolster a failing state , while encouraging an ideology and system of government unknown and unwanted by [ the Afghan ] people . 
I have always opposed nation - building as unconstitutional and ineffective .
Afghanistan is no different .
Without a real strategy in Afghanistan , without a vision of what victory will look like , we are left with the empty rhetoric of the last administration that when the Afghan people stand up , the US will stand down . 
I am afraid the only solution to the Afghanistan quagmire is a rapid and complete US withdrawal from that country and the region .
We cannot afford to maintain this empire and our occupation of these foreign lands is not making us any safer .
It is time to leave Afghanistan .

The Best of Ron Paul
Human rights abuses in Iran are now as bad as at any time in the past 20 years , Amnesty International reports tomorrow in a survey marking six months since June 's disputed presidential election .
Amnesty documents " patterns of abuse " by the Basij militia and revolutionary guards involving beatings , rape , death threats , forced confessions , intimidation and official cover-ups .
Many detainees have been subjected to show trials and five have been sentenced to death .
" The authorities have resorted to exceptionally high levels of violence and arbitrary measures to stifle protest and dissent , " says the 80 - page report .
" The courts have not been an instrument of justice to hold police , security forces and other state officials to account … or to protect the rights to freedom of expression , assembly , association and religion . "
According to official figures , 36 people died in violence after the election , but the opposition puts the figure at more than 70 .
At least 4,000 people were arrested after the poll on 12 June and some 200 remain in jail .
This week , 200 people were arrested during protests around university campuses on national students day .
Protests began when the sitting president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , claimed victory over the leading opposition candidate , Mir-Hossein Mousavi , amid claims that the result had been rigged .
Amnesty quotes an unnamed former detainee who was held with 75 others for more than eight weeks in a container at the notorious Kahrizak detention centre in Tehran .
He was told his son would be raped if he did not " confess " and was beaten unconscious with a baton .
Last month , Ramin Pourandarjani , a young doctor who had treated inmates at Kahrizak and had reportedly been forced to certify the death of at least one torture victim as resulting from meningitis , died in suspicious circumstances .
Ebrahim Mehtari , a 26 - year - old student , described being held in a tiny cell , interrogated while blindfolded and accused of " working with Facebook networks " and tortured into making a confession .
He said : " They frequently beat me on the face ; I was burned with cigarettes under my eyes , on the neck , head .
I was beaten all over …
They threatened to execute me and they humiliated me . "
An independent medical examination substantiated his claims .
But all the relevant documents disappeared , the authorities refused to investigate and his family were warned not to talk about the case .
Amnesty says Iran refused to co-operate with its investigation and has denied the organisation entry into the country since the 1979 Islamic revolution .
Many of the cases have been documented previously , but the cumulative effect of the data underlines what Amnesty calls " a clear pattern of systematic gross human rights violations by Iranian security forces condoned or even encouraged by powerful political and religious figures in Iran . "
The report says government officials " have done their utmost to ensure that accounts of rape are discredited and not circulated further " .
Amnesty has harsh words for the show trials of leading opposition figures .
" The trials , broadcast to the nation , featured coerced ' confessions ' , ' apologies ' and incrimination of others .
Rather than bringing people to justice , the purpose was to validate the authorities ' account of the post-election unrest and to make clear the severe consequences of opposing the authorities . "

Mashhad is in north - east Iran , not north - west as it originally said .
This has been corrected .
I was lured in the same way as everyone else .
The tiny Asian man at his tiny , underfurnished booth was showing off a flying X - wing toy .
To draw spectators , he 'd deftly fly the toy to another booth , hold it there for a second , and fly it back to his booth along with captivated floorwalkers .
The Incom T - 65 RCX4 is an X - Wing fighter helicopter , with four screws , one each on the front , back , and two sides .
Of course , there are lots of helicopter toys out there , but the RCX4 wowed with its dexterity .
The tagline of vendor Digittronics is " easy to fly , " and the demo showed off the RCX4's ease of handling features , including gyroscopic control of balance , and some kind of automatic climb rate control .
The operator could abandon the controls for several seconds , and the RCX4 would stay serenely in the the air , drifting slightly but stable and level .
The RCX - 4 comes in a snappy aluminum case , along with remote , charger , and batteries .
On being taken out of the case , the user snaps its removable S - Foils onto the main body , locking them into attack position .
Then the RCX - 4 is ready to fly .
The remote is big and powerful - looking , with multiple sticks , and in the operator 's hands , the RCX4 flies both in graceful hovering motions and purposeful aggressive patterns .
Unfortunately , I could n't sweet talk him into letting me get my hands on the controls .
The CRX4's battery is a single , 500 mAh Lithium Polymer cell , and lasts through ten minutes of flight , meaning the power draw is about 11 W while in flight .
The recharge time is the same , so with two or three batteries , continuous flight is possible .
Of course , as cool as it is , this toy can never hit the mainstream , for IP reasons .
It 's clearly an X - Wing .
Everyone in the booth knows it 's an X - Wing .
The proprietor chuckled knowingly when I prodded him on this point , and smiled beatifically .
His demo reel , an abridged version of which is on YouTube , featured the toy snubfighter flying in a wide variety of outdoor environments , including flying a circle around an inflated windsock and dive - bombing the camera at what he claimed was 40 miles per hour .
The music in the background was all drawn from Star Wars , mostly from The Empire Strikes Back .
And while we congratulate him on his taste , LucasArts is unlikely to agree .
This toy , if it ever comes to mainstream attention , is due for a quick , untimely death .
And more 's the pity , because it rocks .
I want one for my birthday .
A Catholic brother is accused of sexually assaulting a boy he had been counselling after the youngster was molested by another man , a court has been told .
Former Vincentian brother William Stanley Irwin , 54 , of Pyrmont in inner Sydney , appeared briefly in Sydney 's Downing Centre Local Court today charged with two counts of gross indecency on a male under the age of 18 in the mid-1980s .
The court was told Mr Irwin was arrested last week and had since been stood down from his teaching job at St Aloysius ' College at Milsons Point on Sydney 's lower north shore .
Mr Irwin is the 10th man to be charged with sexually assaulting boys at a central western NSW boarding school .
His arrest follows an investigation by Strike Force Belle into claims of sexual assaults on students at two secondary colleges at Bathurst between 1960 and 1993 .
5:30 p.m. : The Maple Leafs have sent Viktor Stalberg to the AHL Marlies after the rookie from Sweden played just eight games with the NHL club .
Stalberg , 23 , had one assist and two penalty minutes with the Leafs .
Called up from the Marlies was Jiri Tlusty , 21 .
The Czech native had four assists in 14 games with the Leafs last season .
Goalie Joey MacDonald was returned to the Marlies after the Leafs activated goalie Vesa Toskala from the injured reserve list .
4 p.m. : Leafs coach Ron Wilson said " there 's a good chance " injured sniper Phil Kessel will make his much anticipated Leafs debut Tuesday when the club plays on home ice against Tampa .
" There 's a good chance of it , yeah , " Wilson said as the Leafs wrapped up practice Thursday at the Pepsi Center in Amherst , near the University of Buffalo .
Kessel 's arrival with the Leafs has been nothing short of sensational ever since the club traded away a boatload of draft picks in September to acquire him from Boston .
His debut has been hanging in the air while he recovers from off - season surgery to repair a torn rotator cuff and labrum in his left shoulder .
Kessel himself was somewhat unsure if Tuesday would be the day for his return .
" I do n't know yet , it 's ( five ) days away , so I 'll see how I feel , " Kessel said .
Kessel has been practicing with the club at full tempo for over three weeks now .
He has yet to receive clearance to play in a game .
But he says he has received clearance for full physical contact in practice .
" Yeah , I 've been cleared for that for a week now , " Kessel said .
There has been no indication at practice as to how the Leafs will go in terms of lines once Kessel is returned to the active roster .
It appears Wilson is leaning toward Jason Blake as a winger on Kessel 's line .
An ideal set up man at centre could be Matt Stajan .
In the meantime , Wilson said Toskala will backup tomorrow 's game against Buffalo ( Jonas Gustavsson to start ) .
Toskala has been on the injured ( knee ) ever since a collision in the goal crease with New York Rangers forward Chris Drury two weeks ago .

Toskala is expected to start Saturday in Montreal when the Leafs wrap up a five game road trip against the Habs .
It 's not likely Gustavsson will be given back - to - back games .
The rookie Swede has had a trying start to the season , having recovered from a minor heart condition and a groin injury .
3 p.m. : Leafs are on the ice at the Pepsi Centre in Amherst , on the border of the University of Buffalo .
Lines remain the same from last night 's game in Dallas .
Three goalies remain with the team – Jonas Gustavsson , Vesa Toskala , and Joey MacDonald .
Toskala , who has been out for almost two weeks now with a knee injury , looks like he is getting ready for this weekend .
No official word yet , but the Leafs may be looking to get him into Saturday 's game vs. Montreal .
The Leafs play in Buffalo Friday night , and Gustavsson is expected to be in goal .
Lines at practice :
Ponikarovsky - Grabovski-Hagman
Stalberg - Stajan - Stempniak
Blake - Mitchell - Kulemin
Orr-Primeau - Wallin
Extras :
Mayers - Kessel - Rosehill

The Bible 's Amazing Scientific Accuracy and Foresight
AlwaysBeReady.com ^ | unknown | Charlie H. Campbell
Posted on by CondoleezzaProtege
Even though the Bible was completed 2,000 years ago , long before the invention of the microscope , the telescope , satellites , etc. it does not contain any scientific errors .
This might be considered a miracle in itself .
Without exception , every ancient religious writing has certain unscientific views of astronomy , medicine , hygiene , etc .
The Quran says in Surah 18:86 that the sun sets in a muddy spring .
Quran 18:86  when he reached the setting - place of the sun , he found it setting in a muddy spring 
The only exception to these kinds of errors , among ancient religious writings , is the Bible .
Not only is the Bible free from scientific errors , it miraculously makes known numerous , accurate scientific facts about the universe thousands of years before modern scientists caught up .
There are lots of them .
For times sake I will give you a few quick examples .
A. The Sun
In contrast to the Quran , the Bible teaches that the sun is actually on a circuit through space .
Writing of the sun in Psalm 19:6 , David said ,  Its rising is from one end of heaven , and its circuit to the other end . 
For many years critics scoffed at this verse , claiming that it taught that the sun revolves around the earth .
Scientists at that time thought the sun was stationary .
However , it has been discovered in recent years that the sun is in fact on a circuit through space , just like the Bible says .
B. The Shape of the Earth
When the rest of the world believed the earth was flat , Isaiah declared that the world was round Isaiah 40:22  It is He who sits above the circle of the earth . "
The Hebrew word there for circle [ chuwg ] literally means sphere . 
When did Isaiah write these words ?
Between 740 and 680 B.C.
That was at least 300 years before Aristotle suggested , in his book On the Heavens , that the earth might be a sphere .
Other verses are Proverbs 8:27 and Job 26:10 .
More than 2,000 years later some people still believed that Christopher Columbus ( 1451 - 1506 ) was going to sail off the edge of a flat planet in 1492 !
C. The Suspension of the Earth
Before Isaac Newton discovered gravity Hindus believed that the earth rested on the back of an elephant who stood on the back of a turtle that was swimming in a great endless sea .
The Greeks believed that the mythical god Atlas carried the earth on his shoulders .
What did the Bible say ?
In one of the oldest books in the Bible , Job said in Job 26:7 ,  He [ God ] hangs the earth on nothing .
Scientists did not discover that the earth hangs on nothing until 1650 .

The Torah states that you are required not to harvest from your fruit trees for three years .
This comports with modern tree management practices .
The army is also required to build latrines , and cover them when moving on .
This comports with relatively modern sanitation practices .
Etc. A person could go on for quite some time showing how Torah is correct and was eventually supported by science .

Again , the Bible is not a science textbook .
You wo n’t find the human genome there either ...
It is not a science textbook , BUT IT IS SCIENTIFICALLY ACCURATE .
That ’s the point .
Here ’s some more fun facts from Campbell : D. The Stars Before the telescope was invented , man was able to number the stars .
The Greek astronomer and mathematician Hipparchus ( 190 - 120 B.C. ) said there were exactly 1,026 stars .
The astronomer , and mathematician Ptolemy said there were 1,056 stars .
The German astronomer , Johannes Kepler ( 1571 -1630 ) , counted 1,006 .
The whole thought of the stars being uncountable was contrary to modern science until the invention of the telescope .
When Galileo first pointed his telescope to the heavens in 1608 , we discovered there were a lot more stars than anybody had ever imagined , just as Jeremiah had said : Jeremiah 33:22  The host of heaven [ a reference to the stars ] cannot be numbered , nor the sand of the sea measured . 
Today , with the help of powerful telescopes and modern satellite photographs , scientists estimate the universe contains approximately 100 billion galaxies containing approximately 200 billion stars each .
Carl Sagan ( 1934 -1996 ) , the world famous astronomer , said ,  The total number of stars in the universe is greater than all the grains of sand on all the beaches of the planet Earth .  ( Cosmos , p. 196 ) .
That is enough stars for every person alive on planet earth to personally own approximately 2 trillion stars each .
Dr. Mark Eastman says ,  Counting at a rate of ten stars per second it would take over 100 trillion years .
Surely the host of heaven cannot be numbered !
If you want more of these kinds of amazing scientific insights , check out : answersingenesis.org and icr.org
How did the authors of the Bible know that the stars were uncountable , that the earth was round and hangs on nothing ?
Were they taking lucky guesses ?
I do n’t think so .
Their flawless accuracy rules that out .
The Bible says in 2 Peter 1:21 that “ Holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the Holy Spirit . 
God , who knows all there is to know about the universe
He created , superintended the writing of the Bible to make sure that what He wanted written , was written .

Why no mention of the galaxy through which the Sun makes it 's circuit ?
It 's these twisted and dishonest interpretations of the Bible that make religion look bad .

fair enough .
and as i said before : the Bible does not contain the Periodic Table nor does it have a sketch of the human anatomy or a detailing of the human genome .
It ’s not meant to be a science journal , but it ’s meant to reveal Jesus Christ , save your soul , prepare you for eternity , and allow you to have a relationship with the Creator of the Universe .
However it is not just on those few scientific statements that I trust the Bible — but archeological , historical , and literary evidence .
Click the original link and check it out .
If you do n’t agree , then you do n’t .
But at least it ’s some food for thought . :)
Thank you for your response !

I think the bible was right on much of the science of the day .
After all disciplines like astronomy are as old as man and nearly as varied as the races .
On the other hand there are a great many scientific areas that are unmentioned .
Things like orbital mechanics would have had no place in the world of man 5000 years ago .

> I think the Bible got Pi wrong .
Scientifically accurate and mathematically accurate are two different things .
It would be scientifically accurate to say that the Earth circles the sun ; mathematically though it is not a circle , but an ellipse .
( A circle would have an eccentricity of zero , instead it is about 0.01671 ... which is pretty close to zero . )
Now , as to Pi , the question I have for you is how would you describe Pi in a world of natural numbers ?
Three , there is no closer answer .
And in many cultures that ’s all that was used , even as recently as the Vikings .
So , in conclusion :
Mathematics is not [ the same as ]
Science , it is actually far stricter .

Today we are proud to announce a new operating system , a port of Google 's famous Android platform for the x86 ( 32 - bit ) architecture .
Simply named Android -x86 , this Live CD Linux distribution is designed mostly for the Eee PC netbooks , but can also run on any other 32 - bit ( x86 ) platform .
The current stable version of Android - x86 is based on Android 1.6 ( Donut ) and it's powered by Linux kernel 2.6.29 with kernel mode - setting ( or KMS for short ) enabled .
It has support for the EXT3 , EXT2 , NTFS and FAT32 filesystems , and can be run directly from the CD ( yes , no installation required ) !
But , if you like it and you want to install it on your hard drive or on a USB stick , we have a short tutorial for you at the end of the article .
" The original plan was to host different patches for android x86 support from open source community .
A few months after we created the project , we found out that we could do much more than just hosting patches .
So we decide [ d ] to fork our code base that will provide android x86 support on different x86 platforms , and set up a git server to host it .
To reflect this major change , we create this new project . " - the developers behind the Android - x86 project said on their website .
The main desktop
Highlights of Android -x86 1.6 :
· Based on Android 1.6 ( Donut ) ; · Linux kernel 2.6.29 with KMS enabled ; · Support for Wi -Fi connections ; · Graphical user interface for Ethernet configurations ; · Hard drive installer ; · Support for suspend / resume functions ( S3 mode ) ; · Shows the status of the battery on netbooks ; · Support for mouse wheel / cursor ; · ALSA driver for better audio ; · Support for the native resolutions of netbooks ; · Support for netbook 's webcams ( via V4l2 ) ; · Support for external monitors ; · Automatic mount of external disk drives ; · Support for Bluetooth ; · Busybox ; · Proxy support .
Until now , Android -x86 was tested on the following Eee PC models : 701 , 701SD .
900 , 900A , 901 , 904HD , 1000 , 1000HE , 1000HD , 1005HAG , S101 , T91 ( VESA mode , touchscreen works ) , Eee Top 1602C ( VESA mode , touchscreen works ) and Lenovo ThinkPad x61 Tablet .
As you can see , except for the T91 and Eee Top 1602C models , which run only in VESA mode , all the other models enumerated above can run in their native resolution ( 1024x600 or 800x480 ) thanks to the i915 Intel video driver .
How to install Android -x86 ?
Below is a quick guide that provides you with instructions about how to install the Android - x86 Linux distribution on your Eee PC or home computer .
It can be installed on a local / external hard drive or a USB flash drive .
If you do n't have an external / internal CD - ROM on your system , you can write the ISO image to a USB stick by following our " How to Run Linux from an USB Flash Drive " tutorial .
Insert the CD or USB drive and boot from it ( check your BIOS settings for that ) .
At the boot loader select the last option : " Install Android - x86 to harddisk . "

As Kotaku 's resident colorblind gamer , I feel a duty to point out that some of my brethren have asked Infinity Ward to patch Modern Warfare 2 to remove the game 's red - green / enemy - teammate confusion .

In MW2's multiplayer , the fastest way to differentiate friend from foe is if their name is green ( teammate ) or red ( enemy ) .
These colors also are used to to distinguish combatants on the game 's radar .
Colorblind gamers are asking for the ability to change friend / foe colorations so they can game without confusion .
Advertisement
The petition points out that Call of Duty : World at War had the option of changing enemy / friendlies from red / green to orange / blue .
" The Ghost Recon games have also had a similar feature .
With this being such a huge release , this option should come as standard , especially when almost 10 percent of people are affected by colour - blindness in some form . "
I realize that when fewer than one in 10 men deal with this kind of vision ( and half of one percent of women ) we 're absolutely talking about optimizing for a minority .
The game is built , it 's selling like nuts , updates cost money , and I 'd be astonished if Infinity Ward rolled a patch for an affected population this small .
And honestly , you grow up colorblind , you learn workarounds for the condition ( on the traffic signal , top means stop , low means go . )
G/O Media may get a commission Subscribe and Get Your First Bag Free Promo Code AtlasCoffeeDay20
But , to future devs , red and green are the most commonly transposed colors in colorblindness .
Pick a different pair , and you wo n't have us colorblind tugging on your pants leg with these kinds of frivolous - sounding demands .
For those curious , in that image the colorblind are supposed to see a number 17 .
Everyone else should see a number 15 .
I can't see shit .

This is my first year as an Academy member , and my first year voting for awards .
As a member of the Writers branch , I ’ll be casting ballots for Original Screenplay , Adapted Screenplay and Best Picture .
Since it ’s all new to me , I thought I ’d walk readers through the process .
A few weeks ago , I got a printed Reminder List — a catalog listing all the films eligible for Best Picture .
It ’s from this list that I have to pick and rank my top ten films .
I ’ll hand - write the titles on a form that goes in a green envelope , which must be received by the accounting firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP by 5 p.m. January 23 , 2010 .
Nominating ten films for Best Picture is a change from previous years , in which there were only five nominations .
But the system of ranking your choices dates back to 1936 .
It ’s a form of preferential voting designed to more accurately reflect the will of voters .
But man , it ’s complicated .
It ’s easier to explain what it ’s not .
It ’s not a weighted ballot .
You might think that your top pick gets 10 points , while your second pick gets nine points , etc .
It ’s not that .
In fact …
You ’re really only voting for one title .
Your ballot will only be counted towards one film .
That film will be the one you ranked first , unless your number one pick has the smallest number of votes and is thus out of the running .
In that case , they count your second pick .
If needed , they ’ll continue on to your third , fourth or later picks until your ballot is cast for exactly one picture .
It ’s not “ wasting your vote ” to rank your number - one pick first .
You might think your favorite movie is a longshot for a nomination , but that film could get enough second - or third - place votes to put it in the top 10 .
And if it does n’t , your vote will go to your next - highest choice .
But the rules state that a picture ca n’t be nominated without at least one number - one vote .
A full ballot does n’t hurt your top picks .
In WGA board elections , I ’m always mindful that casting a vote for a candidate I half - heartedly support might knock out the candidates I truly want .
So I ’ll often cast a short ballot with just my top choices .
For Academy
Award nominations , that ’s not a factor .
While it ’s unlikely that my tenth - ranked choice would benefit from my vote , it does n’t hurt to include it .
This year , in a change from previous years , the final voting for Best Picture will also use preferential voting .
Instead of picking one film , voters will rank the ten nominees in order .
At the new members reception , Academy leaders stressed the importance of seeing all ten nominees .
I ’m mostly caught up , but I ’ll be sure to watch any ones I ’ve missed before final voting .
Nominations for the two writing categories work basically the same as Best Picture .
We ’re given a list of eligible screenplays , and a form upon which to rank our choices in each category .
Only screenwriters vote for the writing awards .
“ It is a magical and revolutionary device at an unbelievable price , ” said Steve Jobs unveiling Apple ’s “ latest creation ” yesterday in San Francisco .
Although we may doubt if the iPad really brings “ magic ” and “ revolution ” to us , we have to admit the prices are unexpectedly low .
Yesterday , Apple ’s stocks started to climb fast only when Jobs revealed how much we ’ll have to spend on the device .
All the rumors were saying the tablet will be not less than $ 999 , and from this point of view the actual prices look really affordable .
$ 499 for the basic version ( 16GB , no 3G ) is something nobody expected ; also $ 829 for the bloated 64GB , 3G version wo n’t scare anyone .
So , what do you get for this price ?
iPad is 0.5 inch thick , 1.5 pound device with 9.7 - inch , 1024 x 768 , LED - backlit , responsive high - resolution Multi- Touch display that features IPS technology and has a wide 178 degree viewing angle .
It ’s powered by 1GHz “ A4 ” chip designed by Apple ( using their own P.A. Semi technology ) and is claimed to have 10 - hour battery life and a month of standby .
It ’ll come with a 30 - pin dock connector , a microphone , a speaker , Bluetooth ( 2.1 + EDR ) , 802.11n
WiFi and optional 3G , as well as an accelerometer and a compass .
i Pad comes in two versions — one with Wi-Fi and the other with both Wi-Fi and 3G .
iPad includes the latest 802.11n Wi -Fi , and the 3G versions support speeds up to 7.2 Mbps on HSDPA networks .
Every iPad is unlocked and comes with a GSM micro-SIM .
Together with AT&T , Apple announced 3G pre-paid data plans for iPad : 250MB for $ 14.99 and an unlimited plan for $ 29.99 a month contract - free ( with on - device activation and management , and a free use of AT&T WiFi hotspots ) .
International deals will come in June .
i Pad syncs with iTunes just like the iPhone and iPod touch , using the standard Apple 30 - pin to USB cable .
The device features 12 Multi-Touch applications .
Every app works in both portrait and landscape , automatically animating between views as the user rotates iPad in any direction .
The operating system is based on iPhone OS , so the iPad can run all iPhone apps – either pixel - for - pixel in a window , or pixel - doubled fullscreen .
Apple says they rewrote all of our apps for this display .
Apple released a new SDK for iPad , allowing developers to target iPad ’s specifics while developing new apps .
The SDK includes a simulator that lets developers test and debug their iPad apps on a Mac , and also lets developers create Universal Applications that run on iPad , iPhone and iPod touch .
Apple also announced the new iBooks app for iPad , which includes Apple ’s new iBookstore that will feature books from “ major and independent publishers ” – five new big Apple ’s partners : Penguin , Simon & Schuster , Hachette Book Group , Macmillian and Harper Collins .
i Pad has almost full - size soft keyboard but it also connects to the new iPad Keyboard Dock with a full - size traditional keyboard ( $ 70 ) .
Additionally , there is a " camera connection kit " to allow to plug a camera in over USB or use an SD card ( $ 30 ) and a leather case ( $ 40 ) .
Unfortunately , iPad does n’t support Adobe Flash and multitasking .
There is also no camera and HDMI output .
New Apple device will be available in late March worldwide for a suggested retail price of $ 499 for the 16GB model , $ 599 for 32GB and $ 699 for 64GB .
The Wi-Fi + 3G models of iPad will be available in April in the US and selected countries for a suggested retail price of $ 629 for the 16GB model , $ 729 for the 32GB and $ 829 for the 64GB .

Is an iPad a Revolutionary Device ?
While watching the movie " The International " , I came across the following quote by the New York DA , trying to explain the layers of bullshit that make the truth almost impossible to uncover .
" There 's what people want to hear , there 's what people want to believe , there 's everything else , THEN there 's the truth !
When I heard the quote , I could n't help but think of the nonsense surrounding the ongoing Price / Halak debate .
It was onsense that boiled to the surface once again on the strength of 243 great minutes by Jaroslav Halak in mid- December .
This debate continues to be driven by individual ego , bias and agenda and based very little on substance .
It is very easy to understand how it happens .
An individual makes a declaration that Price is better at a pub or on a message board and watches intently hoping to have their opinion proven right in order to trot out their prediction to prove their wealth of knowledge ( EGO ) .
Said individual now watches each game looking for flaws in Halak 's game to justify their statement ( BIAS ) then pushes forth those flaws in order to make his or her point ( AGENDA ) .
At this point the opinion has become skewed and the quest for the truth has dissipated .
He or she ignores what they do not want to hear or believe and search out those with an agreeable perspective .
The result ?
Sides are formed and you have Team Price and Team Halak .
Ego , agenda and bias constantly lead to intelligent individuals making nonsensical statements .
When Team Price brings up lack of goal support , Team Halak 's response is " the team plays tighter in front of Price and does not take chances because they are worried he will let in a bad goal " .
Team Price 's counter argument ?
" The Canadiens play a looser game in front of Halak because they know they will need 3 - 4 goals to win the game " .
Neither of these statements is based in reality and are the rationales seem to have been created in order to push forth and back up individual agendas .
Everybody has a personal preference that skews their perspective , but it is a shame that the internet has devolved into a giant pissing match of " I told you , I was right , therefore I win and hence you are dumb " arguments .
At the end of the day does it really matter if you are right ?
Does anybody keep score ?
The loudest opinion is not the most insightful and succinct .
All that matters to me is that I provoke thought and provide you a window into my mind to see what I am thinking .
It is then up to you to figure out whether you want to continue to peer through that window or not .
Bill Simmons is diametrically opposed to almost every pro sports team I support .
He is a Bruins ( Habs ) , Red Sox ( Yankees ) , Celtics ( Raptors ) and Patriots ( Jets ) fan .
I read him because I appreciate his perspective and look past his admitted bias .
In his 700 page " Book of Basketball " his thesis revolved around " the secret " , a secret he discovered while watching the 1986 Boston Celtics perform .
The team was an integral element in the foundation of his love of the game .
Should I then be surprised that he spent the first 650 pages praising the " the secret " of the 1986 Celtics and the players who embraced this secret , then finally come to the conclusion that the greatest team of all - time was the 1986 Celtics ?
Of course not , but he sure made a damn good case and I admired his opinion because he poured over every book written about the legends of the game , watched endless video and did not rely solely on statistics to come up with his opinions alone .
At the end of the day , I read 700 pages and did n't care whether he was right or wrong , he succeeded in moving the gears of my mind .
When individuals try to discredit my perspective as having a Price bias , ultimately they are correct .
Like Simmons and the Celtics , I got my goaltending Ph. D watching Patrick Roy .
I watched him take a position that was being played in a nonsensical manner and improve it to unparalleled levels .
From his evolution of using equipment not only to protect himself , but stop the puck , to his work in exploiting percentages to his advantage , Roy began the lineage that lead to today 's goaltender .
Because of this , my idea of the ultimate goaltender resembles Carey Price more than Jaroslav Halak .
Does that cripple my credibility ?
That is up to you to decide .
I am not skewing numbers , nor am I basing my opinion on numbers alone .
The point of these articles is to provide the reader with nuggets of information hidden beneath the surface for the reader to either buy into what I 'm selling , or pass on it .
It is of little significance to me whether or not you come to the same conclusion as I .
I cannot provide you with the truth because I cannot break through your personal bias , agenda or ego .
Your truth is always going to remain what you want to hear and believe .
It will exist in your influences and your preferences .
These articles are the truth that I believe , ultimately it is up to you to peer through the window or pass it by .
All told , these balanced and fair number comparisons and scenarios make their own case .
Price / Halak December 2009
December was an interesting month in this ongoing debate .
Just when everybody thought Price had solidified the starting job in November , Halak rebounded and added fuel to the fire with a dominant December showing .
During a 243 minute span , Halak faced 186 shots while surrendering only 6 goals for an obscene .967 SV % .
WIth one of the best young goaltending tandems in the NHL , a large number of Canadiens fans however , chose not to appreciate their contribution in saving a lost season , but rather chose to simplify the teams struggles in their eyes by turning their frustration towards the last line of defense .
With the images of Halak 's dominant stretch fresh in everyone 's mind , it seemed as though he had finally distanced himself from Price .
As Price struggled while allowing a couple of brutal softies that cost the Canadiens a pair of games , the perception began to emerge that Halak had outplayed Price in the month of December .
However , a look at their stats over those 17 games does not back up that perception .
On the whole , the overall mental imagery of Halak 's strong performances bypasses the 3 games in which he gave up 14 goals on 100 shots .
Not contrarily , the visual impact of Price reaching over his head and deflecting two pucks into his own net is too powerful to offset the memory of the 4 games in which he gave up only 5 goals .
The biggest difference maker in the perception of the month , was that Halak 's four great games took place in succession .
Watching Halak 's sustained greatness over that streak tends to work as a sort of blinder for some other individual game performances for the rest of his month
The strong streak also masks the fact that in four of his five December starts , Halak registered mediocre save percentages of .838 , .852 , .889 and .889 .
Price 's month was full of bad goals ( 5 by my count ) , three of which were crucial mistakes in losses against Pittsburgh , New Jersey and Minnesota .
These mistakes overshadowed five strong but unconsecutive starts with save percentages of .971 , .926 , .927 , .933 and .974 .
Taken all togeher , these easily overlooked factors lead to their save percentages being essentially one goal apart .
Looking strictly at their win totals can also lead to incomplete conclusions .
Last month I introduced Win Threshold in order to emphasize that wins are essentially a byproduct of goal support and that they are in fact a team - based statistic .
Halak produced 4 of his 6 wins against Toronto , Carolina , Florida and the New York Islanders ( who own a combined 51 - 70 - 29 won / loss record ) with his most impressive win coming against the Atlanta Thrashers .
During the month , the winning percentage of the teams he faced was a combined .520 .
Price faced only one team below the .500 level , the Maple Leafs .
Seven of his eight opponents were at .500 or better .
Halak's win threshold during December was .914 as the Canadiens provided him with 31 goals in his 9 starts .
Price 's win threshold in December was .930 as the offense produced 17 goals in 8 starts .
Halak enjoyed plenty of goal support in December .
A goals against average of 3.18 and a save percentage of .914 would have produced a .500 record .
His play was exemplary against the Senators , Islanders , Thrashers and Hurricanes , but in those 4 games he had 16 goals in support .
As Robert pointed out , the return of Markov helped to rejuvenate the powerplay and Halak was a definite beneficiary .
Price 's December was a stark contrast to Halak .
In order to salvage a .500 record , Price would have had to produce league - leading numbers , as his goal support was almost non-existent .
Shockingly , he almost did .
The Canadiens produced only 17 goals in 8 games and 5 times registered less than 2 goals
Through all this research , I have begun to ignore a goaltender 's won / loss record when I assess a goaltenders play .
Halak 's record during his career in games in which the Canadiens scored 2 goals or less is 3 - 23 .
His record in which they register 3 goals or more is 38 - 2 - 2 .
Looking at current stars Ryan Miller , Roberto Luongo and Martin Brodeur ( the league leader with 27 wins ) further illustrates this point .
Ryan Miller 's record in games where the Sabres register 2 goals or less in 2010 ?
4-10 .
Roberto Luongo 's record in games where the Canucks register 2 goals or less in 2010 ?
2-10
Martin Broduer 's record in games where the Devils register 2 goals or less in 2010 ?
5 -9-1
After viewing the threshold and goal support numbers , it becomes pretty clear that wins are a team based statistic and should not be used to solidify any argument in regards to the effectiveness or value of a goaltender .
Looking at Halak 's December opponents , I wondered if his statistics had been influenced by the strength of his schedule ?
Have his statistics been earned under the same conditions as Price ?
Over the last 3 + seasons , Halak has faced 25 teams with sub .500 records in his 70 career starts .
Parity reigns supreme in the new NHL as only 5 of 30 teams finished below .500
In the last 2 seasons .
Halak has faced a sub .500 team four of every 10 starts when less than 20 % of the league has a losing record .
Contrast that to Price who has faced 21 teams below .500 in 116 starts .
( Note : all records referenced were through January 4th , 2009 , by the time this is posted borderline teams like the Isles , Panthers and Lightning might move above or below the .500 level altering the figures slightly , but when Halak faced them , they were on the south side of .500 ) .
The results paint a striking portrait .
Halak has certainly benefited from an easier workload .
It is shocking to see how dominant Halak has been against the bottom 5 in the league and how mediocre Price has been .
Is this a function of poor focus on Price 's part ?
Should this be viewed as a negative against Price ?
Or do you assess that it is better to excel against the teams that you will face more often ?
Personally , I want the goaltender that produces against the majority of the league because only 16 % of the league is below .500 .
This is a telling statistic in terms of assessing the future and the reason that the emotion and euphoria of Halak 's 243 minutes cannot be overstated in regards to his overall body of work .
You do not trade the 5th overall pick who has compiled a resume at age 22 that only 3 - 4 players in modern history can equal at the same age , especially when the bulk of your secondary option 's success has occurred against the bottom five teams in the league .
Unfortunately , Halak has placed a gun to Gainey 's head in regards to a decision , He can no longer wait to see who is better .
He has to base his decision on their whole body of work and choose .
So that means their junior careers ( Price ) , their AHL careers ( Price ) and their NHL careers ( statistically even ) are the basis for his judgement .
Add in that he has groomed Price and laid the brickwork of his foundation and Gainey would not be doing his due diligence if he chose Halak over Price .
It would be a pure gamble based on guesswork and hope .
Gainey is perhaps counting on one of his peers overstating a month or two of work and overpaying for Halak 's services .
At this point , his overall body of work does not warrant a top six forward , but the combination of his potential and his recent play might shake one loose .
Halak has played great , but I also do n't think it is a coincidence that since Gainey went to the media about the shopping Halak on Dec 10th that Halak has started 5 of his 8 games against teams below .500 while Price has faced zero in his seven starts .
Halak 's numbers since November 1st have been fantastic .
The biggest difference that I have noticed between Halak and Price over the last two months is the gaps between spectacular and concentration lapses .
They are less pronounced with Halak .
Outside of his rebound control , his play has been remarkably efficient .
His positioning has been strong and remains one of the reasons that his saves seem less spectacular .
His focus has allowed him to remain efficient and as an undersized goaltender this is critical .
The video below shows Halak at his best .
It is as though he has a rope attached from his pants to the center bar of the net allowing him to square up the shooter at all times .
The result ?
Pucks acting like magnets to the CH logo on his chest .
In almost every instance he has maintained the proper depth in his crease and his gap control on breakaways has removed the option of the deke , forcing the shooters into low percentage shots that he easily contains .
Approaching 25 , he is beginning to figure out the pace and tendencies of the league and mature as an NHL goaltender , there is no doubt that he has become a number one NHL goaltender , the question is can he become a dominant franchise changing goaltender ?
Price 's numbers represent to me why statistical analysis alone is unreliable .
I have watched every game , viewed every goal and charted shot position and watched him play great hockey in October and produce terrible stats .
In October he simplified his game and returned to the economical beast he was when he entered the league .
He used his size to his advantage , moved away from strictly butterfly towards a hybrid style that allowed him to remain non-committal ( allowing him to wait out the shooter ) , he avoided concentration lapses and with that allowed less poor goals .
In November he took his game to the next level with sprinkles of athleticism to his game while maintaining an economy of movement .
Price looked like he had many figured things out .
Then the concentration lapses began to creep back into his play .
With these lapses came bad / questionable goals in December ( 8 of the 18 by my count ) and although he provided plenty of highlight reel saves , to me these represented a slight regression as he was relying on instinct and athleticism to bail himself out .
If you watch the highlight reel below , almost all of his spectacular saves are born of questionable positioning .
Over pursuing the play and scrambling back , average gap control on breakaways that force him to rely on his length and quickness to make the save .
The positive being that he has the ability to make these remarkable recoveries .
The negative aspect being some of them are unnecessary .
His stats present somewhat of a paradox , they suggest a goaltender that is getting better every game even though his consistency and positioning have regressed .
This is the tease of his youth , watching all the tools flash their brilliance individually , coming tantalizingly close to coalescing into the dominant goaltender we all expect , then back to the tantalizing flashes .
GOALS AGAINST
This is the one area where Halak blows away Price in December .
Strength of opposition and goal support have no bearing on the softies that Price has allowed .
They were concentration lapses of the highest degree , long shots that he misjudged and point shots that he failed to track properly , plays that he should complete regardless of the situation .
It also cannot go without mention that the perception continues to be reality in regards to his weakness high glove side , half of the poor goals he allowed were high glove side and two were back breakers .
Most of Halak 's transgressions were from failure to control his rebounds or born of Huet disease ( drop in the butterfly , do n't battle to track the puck and assume you have your percentages covered and the puck will hit you ) .
All goals that can be argued as faultless , but goals that most likely were reassessed in the following day 's practice .
Halak has been fantastic on mid range shots , allowing only two goals all season between 21 ' - 39 ' .
HIs save percentage in each zone has also risen from an early season low of .712 to his current mark of .842 .
The Canadiens improved penalty kill continues to benefit both goalies as Halak carried an obscene .962 SV % while shorthanded in December , when added to his elite level .935 even strength percentage the results lead to a monster month in which he was honoured with the Molson Cup and the NHL 1st star of the week during the last week of December .
I can picture Bob Gainey sitting at his desk , feet up , hands clasped , smoking a stogie as he places Paul Holmgren on hold .
Bombardment would be the proper verb to describe what Halak faced in December .
WIth the Canadiens consistently surrendering 40 + shots per game , Halak was relied upon to remain flawless in order to keep the Canadiens season alive .
When adding in attempts at the goal ( missed shots + blocks ) , Halak 's nightly menu consisted of over a shot attempt per minute ( 67 ) .
It is not a recipe for long term success and when coupled with the stronger teams on the schedule and little goal support , it lead to unsatisfactory results .
The shot quality is decreasing as the season progresses , and with Halak 's superb work beyond 20 feet , if the Canadiens can continue to improve and limit shots to the perimeter , both goaltenders will continue to provide big numbers .
While Price 's numbers continue to improve seemingly across the board , two numbers are concerning .
His even strength save percentage continues to drop from the elite levels he produced in October , it is the only statistic that is consistent with my perceived drop in his level of play .
His overall numbers were masked early by an inept penalty kill and his decline is now being masked by the dominance of the same unit .
Price was also unbeatable early in the season from beyond 40 feet , but that number is also beginning to slip .
Am I greatly concerned with these trends ?
Not really , it comes with the gamble of rolling the dice with a young goaltender and judging by his history we are in for another peak and decline over the next 3 months .
After hanging Price out to dry over the first 2 months , the Canadiens have begun to show signs of limiting scoring opportunities .
His shot attempts have finally dipped below a shot per minute and he was rarely hung out to dry like he routinely was during the first two months of the season .
Let 's just call it the Andrei Markov factor .
When Jacques Martin makes the required tweaks to his " give up 40 shots per night and rely on the goaltender " system , the Canadiens should be in good position for a strong second half surge .
The December verdict : I will preface this by mentioning that this whole discussion should be a non-starter , both goalies have been a godsend in 2010 and the Canadiens would be in the Taylor Hall sweepstakes without them , but the controversies never seems to go away .
I made mention of Larocque / Dryden and Hayward / Roy in my pre-season article , but their is really no excuse for this debate in today 's environment .
20 - 30 years ago the casual fan did not have access to player game logs , shot logs , previous years standings , strength of opposition , the SI vault or highlights at your fingertips to develop an educated opinion .
Their opinion was based on what they saw with their own eyes , what the weekly Hockey News statistics told them and the hyperbole they were spoon fed by local media .
That was and remains understandable , but watching what the fanbase is doing to these kids is not .
This whole debate is raging over individual egos and has nothing to do with what is happening on the ice or in the locker room .
Mentioning either of their names in blame for a loss is uninspired , unimaginative and just plain lazy .
The simple answer to the question is that both goaltenders have been great in 2009 - 10 .
I deemed them equal in October , Price ran with the ball in November and Halak outplayed Price in December .
A boxing scorecard would read 10 - 10 , 10 - 9 , 9 - 10 for a three round score of 29 - 29 .
When factoring in win threshold / goal support , quality of competition and future potential , my opinion from October remains unchanged .
Neither goaltender is significantly outplaying the other and the things I see from Price foretell a higher ceiling .
Little did I know that when I prefaced the season by asking god to bless the irrational nature of Hab fans that they would in turn provide me with an excuse to blather on for 4000 + words about a goaltending controversy based entirely on hyperbole .
So in honour of unearned obscene hit counts , God Bless us all ..... again !
This article was part of a project we ran to celebrate the International Year of Astronomy 2009 .
The project asked you to nominate the questions about the Universe you 'd most like to have answered , and this is one of them .
We took it to the physicist Nicholas Mee and here is his answer .
How long is a day ?
How long does it take the Earth to spin once on its axis ?
What 's this strange figure ?
Carry on reading ...
It might seem obvious that the answer to both these questions is 24 hours .
But the correct answer is not quite so straight forward .
The Earth 's axis always points in the same direction relative to the distant stars , at least to a good approximation .
This direction is close to the direction towards the star that we know as Polaris .
It actually takes the Earth slightly over 23 hours and 56 minutes to rotate once around this axis .
In this time all the stars appear to revolve once around the Earth and return to their starting positions .
Astronomers call this period of time a sidereal day .
The word " sidereal " is derived from the Latin word " sidereus " , which means star .
Unless we are astronomers and concerning ourselves with the positions of the stars in the night sky , we prefer to measure the time with respect to the position of the Sun .
We define a day to be the period of time between consecutive appearances of the Sun due south in the sky .
The sidereal day is shorter than the solar day : at time 1 the Sun is directly overhead .
At time 2 , the Earth has rotated once about its axis , but the Sun is not yet right overhead .
We have to wait another 1/366 of a full roation until it is .
Image courtesy Gdr .
The Earth is not only spinning on its axis , it is simultaneously orbiting the Sun .
In the period of time that it takes to spin once , it will also have travelled about 1/366 of the way around its orbit .
This means that one complete rotation of the Earth will not quite bring the Sun back to its starting point in the sky , we will have to wait for the Earth to turn for a further 1/366 of a full rotation .
This period of time is about 24 hours divided by 366 , which is around 24 × 60/360 minutes — almost exactly four minutes .
And this extra four minutes gives us our 24 hour day .
It is the time between the Sun being due south in the sky and returning again to exactly the same direction due south .
Rapid travel between distant places first became feasible in the Victorian era .
This meant that it was now necessary to compare the time in one place on the Earth 's globe with the time at other places .
It was no longer practical for the time to be determined locally by the position of the Sun everywhere throughout the world .
For instance , there would be a ten minute difference between the local time in London and the local time in Bristol , just 120 miles away ; a distance that could have been travelled by rail in under two hours by the middle of the 19th century .
By an international convention of 1884 the Royal Observatory at Greenwich , just outside the British Imperial Capital of London , was established as the place at which the time would be set for the whole world .
When the Sun is due south at Greenwich it is twelve o'clock noon and this sets the time for the rest of the world .
Greenwich Mean Time , or GMT , became the standard for setting clocks everywhere .
This accounts for the G and T in GMT , but what about the M ?
Well , the motion of the Earth around the Sun is not quite as simple as we have suggested above .
If the Earth 's axis was perpendicular to the plane of the Earth 's orbit around the Sun and the Earth 's orbit was a perfect circle , then indeed our explanation would be exactly correct .
But the Earth 's axis is inclined at an angle of about 23.5° from the perpendicular to the plane of the Earth 's orbit .
And although the Earth 's orbit is close to being circular , it is actually an ellipse , so it is shaped like a slightly squashed circle .
The Earth 's orbit is elliptical and the Earth 's axis is tilted with respect to the orbital plane .

These two factors mean that the time taken for the Sun to return to a position due south in the sky varies slightly throughout the year .
On average this period of time is 24 hours .
But at some times of the year it is slightly longer and at other times of the year it is slightly shorter .
The name Greenwich Mean
Time is exactly what it suggests .
It is the time averaged over the year , so that days are defined to all be exactly the same length .
The year has been chopped up into equal sized lumps .
The result is that if we use a sundial to tell the time , it will not necessarily give exactly the same time as our watch .
Accurate sundials often have a table of corrections engraved upon them that indicate the number of minutes that the Sun is ahead or behind GMT at different times of the year .
The difference between the mean solar time and the actual solar time is called the equation of time .
The Sun is furthest behind GMT around 12th February , when it is about 14 minutes 20 seconds slow .
It is furthest ahead around 3rd November when it is about 16 minutes 23 seconds fast .
The Sun 's position coincides with GMT on four days of the year : 16th April , 14th June , 2nd September and 25th December , so you can relax after your Christmas dinner in the knowledge that your new watch will be telling the same time as your sundial .
We can plot the position of the Sun at 12 o'clock GMT each day throughout the year and this will give us a representation of the equation of time in the sky .
For part of the year the Sun will appear to be a few minutes late and will be slightly to the east of due south .
At other times of the year the Sun will be slightly ahead of GMT and will appear to the west of due south .
Plotting the position throughout the year will produce a figure in the sky that looks like the numeral 8 .
The top of the 8 is the position of the Sun at the summer solstice when it is highest in the sky .
The bottom of the 8 is the position of the Sun at the winter solstice when it reaches its lowest point in the sky .
This figure is called the analemma .
The analemma drawn on a map of the sky .
The horizontal axis measures the time lag in minutes , and the vertical axis measures the declination of the Sun in degrees .
The four days on which the Sun 's position coincides with GMT can be read off the graph , as they are the days on which the analemma figure crosses the vertical zero line of the graph .
The analemma has the same shape at every latitude , but its position in the sky differs from place to place .
For instance , in the Arctic , part of the southern loop is never visible as the Sun is completely below the horizon in the middle of winter ; whereas at the equator the analemma is traced out directly overhead .
And also , in the southern hemisphere the analemma appears upside down relative to the northern hemisphere .

If the Earth 's orbit were perfectly circular , then the two lobes of the analemma would be mirror images of each other .
However , as the Earth 's orbit is elliptical this makes the form of the analemma asymmetrical .
The speed with which the Earth travels around its orbit is dependent on its distance from the Sun : when it is closer to the Sun it travels faster .
This is described by Kepler 's second law of planetary motion , which states that a line joining the Earth and the Sun sweeps out equal areas in equal time .
The Earth reaches its closest point to the Sun around 3rd January .
So in the middle of the northern hemisphere winter the Earth is covering a greater proportion of its orbit each day than it is in the northern hemisphere summer .
This affects the appearance of the analemma .
The lobe that is traced out in the northern winter is bigger than the lobe that is traced out in the summer .
Also , if the date of closest approach to the Sun coincided exactly with the winter solstice , 21st December , which corresponds to the lowest point of the analemma , then the left side of the analemma would be a mirror image of the right side .
This is because the Earth would be moving at the same speed around the Sun on any particular day after the winter solstice as it did the same number of days before the winter solstice .
The eccentricity of the orbit of the planet Mars is much greater than the eccentricity of the Earth 's orbit .
In other words , the ellipse formed by the orbit of Mars is more squashed than that of the Earth .
For this reason the analemma on Mars is pear shaped .
It has lost one of its lobes completely .
In the picture on the left the position of the Sun is plotted every 30 martian days .
In recent years the Syrian artist Issam Kourbaj has drawn inspiration from the world of science and , in particular , light and optics .
Issam is artist in residence and bye - fellow at Christ 's College , Cambridge and he has used the analemma as a motif during the University 's 800th anniversary year .
This was the source of inspiration for his analemma sculpture , a computer generated representation of which is shown here .

Issam has also designed an analemma sundial that was used as a performance art piece which formed part of Light Matter , a celebration of 800 years of science at Cambridge University .
If you 'd rather tell your time by the Sun than your watch , then why not build you own analemmatic sundial ?

ALGIERS , Algeria , Jan. 10 ( UPI ) --
Algerian troops killed at least 10 Islamic militants and seized a large cache of weapons about 155 miles southeast of the nation 's capital , officials said .
The troops attacked the militants near the village of Slim , west of M'sila , after being tipped to their activity in the area , KUNA , the Kuwait news agency , reported Sunday .

More than 30 Islamic extremists have been killed in the region in recent weeks , including four in mid-December , military officials said .
The best thing that conservatives and independents can do to pay tribute to Scott Brown 's victory in Massachusetts is to raise their glasses in an expeditious toast , drink it heartily , and then immediately return to the front lines .
There is only a limited amount of time allotted them to delight in the thrill of this victory and learn from their opponent 's agony of defeat .
It is now time to return , emboldened and better - equipped , to where the battle for America is the fiercest , and reengage the tooth - and - nail struggle to prevent the Obama administration from fulfilling its all encompassing - visions of statism .
There are some important reasons why we can not afford to bask in the glow of victory for too long .
The enemy has been only temporarily routed .
It will now seek to regroup and return with a vengeance .
Our job is to force it to make a full , unconditional retreat , back to the slimy rock from under which it crawled in the first place .
As a matter of the first order , we must not underestimate the infectious decadence of career liberal congressmen , which is only surpassed by the boundless depravity of their patrons .
The enemy will lick his wounds and quickly resume operations .
And any residual despondency of this so - called " progressive " contingency will soon give way to protracted waves of insane fury .
It is a difficult job when you are fully engaged in the process of dismantling a republic -- or as Obama calls it , remaking America .
And we are sending Scott Brown to shine a light into the dingy conclave of rabid wolves that is Congress , most of whom are dressed in sheep 's apparel .
Let us pray that Brown does not forget that many of those who will try to feign camaraderie have perfected the art of derailing the ambitions of insolent novices who jaunt into their midst and try to entertain any serious discussions of policy .
The first clue -- call it the calm before the storm -- should be the sudden conciliatory tone that Democrats have suddenly adopted on the heels of this thrashing .
Senator Harry Reid , a man who only until recently cherished the peace and intimacy of closed - door meetings , is now adamantly convinced that a fairer exchange protocol be strictly adhered to if the nation 's representatives are to continue debating the massive overhauling of one - sixth of the nation 's economy .
In this novel diplomatic approach , he ostensibly declared that the health care vote should be put on hold until the new senator from Massachusetts is duly seated .
But this apparent change of heart is due only to Reid 's sudden realization that his troops have been scattered .
Now that that magical 60th vote is not as attainable , Reid must assume a more docile posture .
The time when Democrats did not feel the least obliged to extend the hand of bipartisanship to their Republican peers has run its course .
Displays of arrogance which were commonplace before their agenda became imperiled must be reserved for another time , if and when Democrats experience another media - contrived resurgence of popularity ( which is highly unlikely in the near future ) .
But we must also not forget that even in this time of cautious revelry , this same media still remains the Republican Party 's implacable nemesis .
They will continue to try their best to destroy the flicker of hope that Scott Brown represents for those they deride as the " party of no . "
Realistically , we cannot expect this self - immolating media to turn against their idol -- that is , not until they begin to see an irreversible diagnosis that he is about to fully implode .
This could very well happen before the remaining years of his term elapse , but we must not let this expectation steer our focus away from the job of protecting this country from Obama 's destructive policies while he still presides .
We must also remember that Scott Brown is a relatively young senator entering the predatory world of ravenous mercenaries and seasoned demagogues who know the lay of the land better than he does .
Many of them will try in earnest to tempt him into compromise .
Their primary goal will be to lead him astray from the promises and aspirations that brought him into the fold in the first place .
The liberal media will gladly live up to their responsibility of informing us of every rock he stumbles upon , and it will do its part to ensure that it keeps an eagle 's eye on his every move with a zeal comparable in degree only to the indifference with which they ignore the impudence of politicians in their favored wing of Congress .
Above all , we must not underestimate the media 's ability to spin a triumphant tale from this crushing defeat .
The Democrats still have the deranged left base at their disposal , and they will work together to marshal their revisionist skills and refashion a more auspicious narrative from the ashes , making Obama look as good as possible even in the wake of what is arguably nothing short of a seismic shift in the country 's political landscape .

What ’s the most expensive dinner in America ?
An omakase meal of pristine , perfectly sliced sushi , the fish flown in from Tsukiji market in Tokyo and prepared for you personally by a Yoda - equivalent sushi master ?
Or maybe a 12 - course tasting menu from a Michelin three - star French chef , each plate a culmination of several components made by an army of kitchen staff ?
Not exactly .
It ’s most likely $ 500 - per- person Japanese hot pot -- yes , hot pot .
A popular style of Asian home cooking , hot pot comes from a nearly 1,000 - year - old culinary tradition of dipping sliced meat or seafood and vegetables into bubbling broth , supposedly à la Genghis Khan .
A communal dish cooked and shared at the dining table , it ’s soul food , great for cold weather and for feeding an intimate group ( emphasis on the intimate -- you are , after all , eating from the same pot ) .
Lately , though , the humble hot pot does n’t seem so humble .
Masayoshi Takayama , the sushi chef whose New York restaurant Masa might be the epitome of rarefied Japanese dining in the U.S. , has taken it to Las Vegas .
At Shaboo , the restaurant he just opened there , his version of shabu - shabu -- traditionally paper - thin slices of beef quickly poached with vegetables in a water - based broth -- will cost you more than the recent price of an All Nippon Airways round - trip flight to Tokyo .
American chefs are putting shabu - shabu on their menus too , using Wagyu beef or sashimi - grade fish or foie gras .
But hot pots are by nature informal , cozy affairs , with everybody leaning over a big pot in the middle of the table , taking from it whatever they want .
That ’s the appeal of so many Sichuan , northern Chinese and Taiwanese hot pot restaurants in the San Gabriel Valley and casual shabu - shabu joints on the Westside or in Little Tokyo .
And they are easy enough to make at home that they can be impromptu meals .
A new book by chef Tadashi Ono and food journalist Harris Salat titled “ Japanese Hot Pots : Comforting One - Pot Meals ” has enthusiastic home cooks pulling out their enameled Dutch ovens and konbu ( kelp ) to make Hakata chicken or pork belly and greens hot pot .
It ’s “ the quintessential Japanese comfort food , ” Salat writes .
But what about five - hundred - dollar hot pot ?
Takayama unveiled Shaboo , his shabu - shabu restaurant , on Christmas Day in Las Vegas ’ $ 8.5 - billion CityCenter .
There are custom - molded individual cooking vessels ; high - tech induction burners set into the tables ; and ingredients such as wild bluefin tuna belly wrapped around julienned Japanese leeks , taraba crab legs from Hokkaido , sliced abalone , winter yellowtail , and beef from the Ohmi region of Japan .
A supplemental dessert of white truffle ice cream costs $ 95 .
The restaurant ’s name is a slightly infelicitous play on the words “ shabu ” and “ taboo . ”
Will the “ Viva Elvis ” crowd go for it ?
The Japanese consider shabu - shabu the highest expression of hot pot , in accordance with the culinary principle of using the freshest food , lightly cooked , beautifully presented .
The closer it is to its natural state , the better to draw the most pleasure from a single thin sheet of beef .
Takayama describes the cooking method by waving his hand back and forth in the air , mimicking the motion of the meat as it is swept through the poaching liquid .
“ You slowly dip , cook , then dip it in sauce ” -- cooking it yourself is part of the enjoyment .
( Shabu - shabu means “ swish - swish , ” referring to the way in which ingredients are cooked in the hot pot . )
Traditionally this is accomplished with chopsticks , but at Shaboo with special tongs in the shape of crab claws .
The golden bowl
“ I wanted solid gold pots , but the heating technology is n’t available here , ” he says .
“ Maybe in two or three years .
When I agreed to open this place I said I was going to buy gold bowls . . . 60 for $ 80,000 each . ”
$ 80,000 ?
" $ 80,000 . ”
Now I daydream about eating hot pot from a gold bowl .
But Japanese cooks traditionally use a donabe , a clay vessel with a slightly rounded bottom and domed lid .
And really all you need is a cast - iron Dutch oven to make hot pot at home .
( Cast iron distributes and retains heat well . )
And though shabu - shabu may be the most highly regarded , there are simpler types of hot pots , called collectively nabemono -- one - pot meals that are more substantial than soup but not as thick as stew .
There are two ways to cook hot pots : at the table -- using a tabletop burner -- setting out a platter of ingredients to be cooked by guests ( shabu - shabu style ) .
Or on the stove , with the finished dish brought to the center of the table , from which the contents are ladled into small bowls , or diners can help themselves .
It ’s de rigueur to pick up your own food from the pot with your own chopsticks .
Whatever the type , the foundation of the hot pot is the broth , which often includes dashi , a stock of konbu and dried bonito flakes .
For his seafood shabu , Takayama uses a golden broth of dashi made with konbu and niboshi , or dried anchovies .
The stock for his beef shabu is prepared in an eight - hour process making a consommé from konbu , niboshi , seared Ohmi beef tendon , carrots , onions , garlic , beef and chicken bones , and bay leaf .
Into the pot you can put a wide variety of meat or vegetables : slices of rib-eye , whole shrimp , salmon , chicken , lamb , mushrooms , spinach , dumplings .
A friend of mine used to make a scallop sausage for hot pot from scallop mousseline with chives that was so good I ’m still thinking about it years later .
Greens such as mizuna , a mustard , and shungiku , the leaves of chrysanthemums , are easy to find at Asian stores and farmers markets .
A rich broth
Chef Michael Mina , who has been serving shabu - shabu of sliced abalone , shiitake mushrooms , scallions and Kobe beef rolled with spicy radishes at his latest restaurant , American Fish ( also in Las Vegas ’ CityCenter ) , starts with a dashi of konbu , bonito and ginger .
“ Beef with dashi is really delicious , ” he says .
“ And foie gras .
What that does is really fortifies the broth , leaves a lot of richness behind .
When thinking about ingredients , you have to think about both how it ’s going to cook in the broth and what it does to the broth . ”
Take pork belly , for example .
In a hot pot recipe from the “ Japanese Hot Pots ” cookbook , thin slices of pork belly are dipped into a simmering broth of dashi , mirin and soy sauce , imbuing the liquid with the rich flavor of pork .
A duck gyoza nabe is made with chicken stock , mirin and konbu , enhanced by vegetables such as cabbage , negi ( Japanese leeks ) and shiitake and enoki mushrooms -- the chicken stock complementing the duck filling in the dumplings .
It ’s served with a dipping sauce of chile oil , soy sauce , rice vinegar and scallions .
Other condiments for shabu - shabu include gomadare ( sesame sauce ) and ponzu .
At Shaboo , hottate scallops come with a dipping sauce of lobster bisque .
When it came to nabe cooking , my mom , a born - and - bred Tokyoite , mostly made sukiyaki .
In Kanto ( Tokyo area ) fashion , the ingredients -- sliced beef , tofu , nappa cabbage , itokonnyaku noodles , onions , chrysanthemum leaves -- are simmered in a shallow pot of broth made with a little caramelized sugar , soy sauce and sake .
( Sautéing the beef before adding the other ingredients and the broth would be Osaka - style . )
Arrange ingredients as you might a composed salad , in neat bunches .
The vegetables are just cooked through and the beef added last so that it ’s as tender as possible .
You could even cook the sliced beef shabu - shabu style at the table .
It is beefy , just slightly sweet , and warming .
And it costs less than $ 10 per person to make , no gold bowls necessary .

Despite this cost challenge , however , the report projects steady growth for hybrid and electric cars — including mild - and full - hybrids ; plug - in hybrids ; extended range electric vehicles ; and fully electric vehicles .
Under the most likely scenario of the industry ’s evolution , BCG estimates that 26 % of the new cars sold in 2020 in the major developed markets ( China , Japan , the United States , and Western Europe ) — or approximately 14 million cars — will have electric or hybrid power trains .
That same year , the market for electric - car batteries in those regions will reach $ 25 billion .
Although lithium - ion cell and pack costs are expected to fall sharply by 2020 , they are unlikely to drop enough to support widespread adoption of fully electric vehicles without a major breakthrough in battery technology , according to a new study by The Boston Consulting Group ( BCG ) .
Of the roughly 14 million electric cars forecast to be sold in 2020 in China , Japan , the United States , and Western Europe , BCG projects that some 1.5 million will be fully electric , 1.5 million will be range extenders , and 11 million will be a mix of hybrids .
The new report , Batteries for Electric Cars : Challenges , Opportunities , and the Outlook to 2020 , concludes that the $ 250 per kWh long - term cost target used by many carmakers in planning their future fleets of electric cars is unlikely to be achieved unless there is a major breakthrough in battery chemistry that substantially increases the energy a battery can store without significantly increasing the cost of either battery materials or the manufacturing process .
The study , a companion to one released in January 2009 that analyzed the technical and cost tradeoffs of competing alternative power - train technologies , addresses the two principal variables in BCG ’s analysis of the developing market for electric cars : the technical attributes and the costs of lithium - ion batteries for electric - vehicle applications .
Given current technology options , we see substantial challenges to achieving this goal by 2020 .
For years , people have been saying that one of the keys to reducing our dependency on fossil fuels is the electrification of the vehicle fleet .
The reality is , electric - car batteries are both too expensive and too technologically limited for this to happen in the foreseeable future .
— Xavier Mosquet , Detroit - based leader of BCG ’s global automotive practice and a coauthor of the study
The authors drew on BCG ’s work with automotive OEMs and suppliers and on a detailed analysis of the relevant intellectual - property landscape .
They conducted more than 50 interviews with battery suppliers , automotive OEMs , university researchers , start - up companies working on leading - edge battery technologies , and government agencies across Asia , the United States , and Western Europe , and also created a battery cost model to project future costs .
The report explores four main questions :
What technological challenges must be overcome in order for lithium - ion batteries to meet fundamental market criteria ?
As battery technologies reach maturity , what might their cost profiles look like ?
What will electric vehicles ’ total cost of ownership ( TCO ) amount to ?
How are industry participants likely to align themselves as they jockey for position in the evolving market ?
Tradeoffs among five principle Li-ion chemistries .

Technology .
The BCG authors did not address the impact of new battery chemistries , lithium - based or otherwise , “ because none of the players we interviewed expect that batteries based on new chemistries will be available for production on a significant scale by 2020 . ”
However , the authors note , “ there is increasing interest and activity , particularly among university research laboratories , in exploring new electrochemical mechanisms that might boost the specific energy and performance of future batteries . ”
The report explores five principle chemistries — lithium nickel cobalt aluminum ( NCA ) ; lithium nickel manganese cobalt ( NMC ) ; lithium manganese spinel ( LMO ) ; lithium titanate ( LTO ) ; and Lithium iron phosphate ( LFP ) — along six dimensions : safety ; life span ( measured in terms of both number of charge - and - discharge cycles and overall battery age ) ; performance ( peak power at low temperatures , state - of - charge measurement , and thermal management ) ; specific energy ( how much energy the battery can store per kilogram of weight ) ; specific power ( how much power the battery can store per kilogram of mass ) ; and cost .
Without a major breakthrough in battery technologies , fully electric vehicles that are as convenient as ICE - based cars — meaning that they can travel 500 kilometers ( 312 miles ) on a single charge and can recharge in a matter of minutes — are unlikely to be available for the mass market by 2020 .
In view of the need for a pervasive infrastructure for charging or swapping batteries , the adoption of fully electric vehicles in 2020 may be limited to specific applications such as commercial fleets , commuter cars , and cars that are confined to a prescribed range of use .

Cost and TCO .
Even if battery makers can meet the technical challenges , the authors wrote , battery cost may remain above the $ 250 per kWh target .
Citing the current cost of similar lithium - ion batteries used in consumer electronics ( about $ 250 to $ 400 per kWh ) , many original - equipment manufacturers ( OEMs ) hope that the cost of an automotive lithium - ion battery pack will fall from its current price of between $ 1,000 and 1,200 per kWh to between $ 250 and $ 500 per kWh at scaled production .
BCG , however , points out that consumer batteries are simpler than car batteries and must meet significantly less demanding requirements , especially regarding safety and life span .
So actual battery costs will likely be higher than what carmakers predict .
To show how battery costs will decline , BCG uses the example of a typical supplier of lithium - nickel - cobalt - aluminum ( NCA ) batteries .
BCG ’s analysis suggests that by 2020 , the price that OEMs pay for NCA batteries will decrease by 60 to 65 % , from current levels of $ 990 – $ 1,220 per kWh to $ 360 – $ 440 per kWh .
So the cost for a 15 - kWh NCA range - extender pack would fall from around $ 16,000 to about $ 6,000 .
The price to consumers will similarly fall , from $ 1,400 – $ 1,800 per kWh to $ 570 –$ 700 per kWh — or $ 8,000 – $ 10,000 for the same pack .
Even in 2020 , consumers will find this price of $ 8,000 to $ 10,000 to be a significant part of the vehicle ’s overall cost .
They will carefully evaluate the cost savings of driving an electric car versus an ICE - based car against the higher up - front cost .
It will be a complex purchase decision involving an evaluation of operating costs , carbon benefits , and potential range limitations , as well as product features .
— Massimo Russo , a Boston - based partner and coauthor of the report
Industry Dynamics .
The report envisions two possible scenarios for significant strategic alliances in the industry : one in which OEMs forge new alliances with cell manufacturers , and one in which they stick with tradition by buying batteries from Tier one suppliers that , in turn , may forge their own alliances with cell manufacturers .
The electric - vehicle and lithium - ion battery businesses hold the promise of large potential profit pools for both incumbents and new players ; however , investing in these technologies entails substantial risks .
It is unclear whether incumbent OEMs and battery manufacturers or new entrants will emerge as winners as the industry matures .
As it stands today , the stage is set for a shakeout among the various battery chemistries , power - train technologies , business models , and even regions .
OEMs , suppliers , power companies , and governments will need to work together to establish the right conditions for a large , viable electric - vehicle market to emerge .
The stakes are very high .

Nice piece by Chrystia Freeland * on lessons from Canada , the only G7 country to avoid a major financial meltdown .
I ’ve always liked to cite Canada in economic discussions ; as I once wrote ,
Canada has often been a very interesting case – the country that defies the trends , that demonstrates by example the hollowness of the conventional wisdom of the moment .
And so it is with finance .
Those who think that “ too big to fail ” is the essence of the problem have to explain why Canada , with basically just five banks , has avoided crisis .
Those who blame the Fed for keeping interest rates too low too long have to explain why Canada , which basically had the same interest rate experience we did , did n’t have anything like the same problems .
So what ’s Canada ’s secret ?
Regulation , regulation , regulation .
Much stricter limits on leverage , much stricter limits on unconventional mortgages , and an independent consumer protection agency for borrowers .
Barney Frank ’s reform bill would move the United States a long way in Canada ’s direction .
And that may be the simplest way to explain why it ’s a good thing , eh ?
* But one small correction : Michael Kinsley did n’t make up the headline “ Worthwhile Canadian Initiative ” ; it was an actual headline on a column by Flora Lewis of , yes , the New York Times .
Top Gear Bolivia road trip
We began our Top Gear adventure to drive three 1970 ’s 4x4 vehicles from the Bolivian jungle to the Pacific Ocean from the town of Rurrenabaque .
Our first challenge was to cross the tributaries of the River Beni in our vehicles , which resulted in us and our equipment taking regular unplanned baths .
To see personal bags and equipment floating around in the back of cars is not the best start to any day .
Much to my amazement , however , the Blazepoint Ndura Rugged laptop powered up and continued as normal , despite having sat in a submerged bag .
John Zerzan first shot into celebrity philosopher status in 1995 after the New York Times featured him in 1995 as a supporter of the Unabomber 's anti-technology doctrine .
He has since become a leading light of the primitivist movement in the US .
In an exclusive interview with DNA , he explains why modern civilization is fundamentally anti-human , ' green ' technology is ' psycho ' and Stone Age is the way to go .
American philosopher John Zerzan 's thesis is simple : civilization is pathological , and needs to be dismantled .
Zerzan 's radical critique of civilization , laid out in books such as Elements Of Refusal ( 1988 ) , Future Primitive ( 1994 ) , and Running On Emptiness ( 2002 ) draws on anthropological research to argue that domestication of nature and domestication of humans go hand in hand .
And this is accomplished primarily through technology .
According to him , the dystopia of the Wachowski Brothers ' Matrix trilogy is already here : the technological - industrial ' machine ' is already running the world , a world where individual humans are but insignificant little cogs with barely any autonomy .
No single human being - neither the most powerful politician , nor the most powerful businessman - has the power to rein in the system .
They necessarily have to follow the inexorable logic of what has been unleashed .
He believes that the climate change summit in Copenhagen is a joke , and environmentalists are too superficial in their critiques to make a difference .
In an exclusive interview , the California - based Zerzan , who was in Mumbai recently for a lecture tour , talks about why going back to the primitivism of the Stone Age is the only meaningful ' green ' alternative .
Your work has been described as ' anti- civilisational ' .
Are you seriously against civilisation ?
Of course .
Anti-civilisational thought draws attention to the nightmare that 's unfolding right now .
It asks some basic questions that have n't been asked .
It tries to change the subject away from the manoeuvring on the surface of dominant systems , in favour of going to the roots of it , and posing alternative directions , alternative projects , on a very basic level .
I mean , here we are , as a species , and we can't breathe the air .
What more do you have to say ?
You mean you 're being literal when you say we have to go back to the Stone Age ?
Absolutely , otherwise it 's just talk .
We have to dismantle this whole mess , and start thinking practically , start regaining the skills we once had as people on this planet .
We 're just becoming more and more dependant on technology , which drains everything away - it drains community away , it really drains experience away , it drains meaning away .
So how does one get back to the primitive way of life ?
The first step is to have a chance to raise questions like these - beyond the fraud of politics and parties and bullshit that never really challenge anything but only guarantee that things get worse , by avoiding the primary stuff .
Nothing 's ever going to change unless there is a chance for people to become engaged on a level of discussion that is meaningful , that really does question this path of technology - led ' progress ' , and why we are on this path , and what drives this .
So what brought us to this path in the first place ?
I would say it goes all the way back to division of labour , domestication , and the rise of symbolic culture .
What about division of labour ?
It is with division of labour , and the consequent growth of inequality and estrangement from the earth and from each other that you see , coincidentally or not , the emergence of symbolic culture .
Symbolic culture dates back to before domestication and agriculture , but it established the ground for domestication to occur .
The rise of division of labour in primitive society also marks the beginning of stratified society , and it appears to emerge fairly suddenly in the Upper Paleolithic era [ 45,000 to 10,000 years ago ] just before domestication .
Without symbolic culture and language , would we be still be human ?
Well , if you define it that way !
Today ' being human ' means , very symbolic , if not totally symbolic , although that 's been pushed back , too .
It was thought that about 60,000 years ago , you had homo sapiens sapiens [ the modern humans ] .
But today the consensus is they appeared 200,000 years ago .
Here we 're already moving back out of the symbolic , which is interesting , as it has implications .
What kind of implications ?
For example , we define intelligence as our skill in manipulating symbols , but that 's not the only way , and why do we define it that way ?
Because ours is a fully symbolic culture , and to get around in it and achieve things in it , you have to do these things : you have to know the math and everything else .
But in a world where you do n't have that , intelligence means something else , and there is obviously intelligence before the symbolic .
Given that we were n't symbolic a million years ago , and Thomas Wynn and other anthropologists say we had the same level of cognitive development then as we do today , it certainly was n't applied to symbolic projects or symbolic culture - there is no evidence whatsoever that early humans applied their intelligence to symbolic projects .
So how can you say we 're not human unless we 're symbolic ?
All that is great and grand about humans , would they have been possible without symbolic culture ?
That 's just the dominant way of looking at it .
For example , if you look at art , religion and so forth as compensations and consolations for what is lost in modern civilisation , then it does n't seem so fabulous any more .
In fact , its giving us less and less I think .
What is this thing that you say we have lost in modern civilisation ?
Community is one thing , and sharing .
That 's the text book orthodoxy of pre-historic human society : their number one value was sharing : food sharing , and anti-hierarchy .
And you see that in a few - there are more than a few here in India - forager societies that still exist .
These are things that we have lost .
Take community : there is no community .
Today it 's just mass society - people dispersed and isolated and stressed out and relying on drugs more and more and that 's why communal values are disappearing .
Because if you do n't have community , where will the communal values come from ?
That 's why things are falling apart .
That 's quite possibly the reason why early humans did n't want to change things .
They did n't want to change the existing technology : the stone tools , for example .
When the archaeologists now say that for a million years they did n't change it despite having the intelligence to do so , what explains that ?
But then , if you 've got a good thing , why change it ?
But is n't the rise of civilization just a natural expression and progression of human nature ?
Well , if you want to talk about human nature - and people who are having a good time are always bringing that up - well , what 's the human nature ?
That which obtained for a million years , or the last 9,000 years ?
One is a second of time , compared to the existence of homo sapiens .
What about the Hobbesian view of human nature - that without culture , life would be nasty , brutish and short ?
The Hobbesian view has been discredited completely .
Any Anthropology I course tells you that .
It 's the textbook thing : among primitive humans , there was no organised violence , there was sharing , women were not objectified , people worked very , very little , people actually lived longer than was thought .
The American anthropologist Marshall Sahlins ' book Stone Age Economics ( 1974 ) is the single best single source of information on the original affluent society : people 's needs were met , they were not poor , even if they do n't earn anything , but we - our needs are never met even though we fill up the place with stuff .
Then why did Hobbes ' view gain such wide currency ?
Because it suited the system perfectly .
It 's the basic ideology for civilization .
In fact , people have been told this all along from the very first cities , the walled cities : do n't go out there , you 'll die , nature 's wild , and it 's a good thing you are here , with the army and the temples to protect you .
And that 's what we 're told right now , you can't leave - people are scared .
When this all collapses , people with no skills , no orientation to the earth , they wo n't last .
But I think people feel it .
In the US , there is a great deal of anxiety and fearfulness - even if it's not allowed to be articulated publicly - over the question of , could this all collapse ?
More people think it 's a matter of when than if .
Many believe sustainable or green technology can save us from impending ecological collapse .
I just saw a billboard on my way here , it was for steel .
It said , " We make green steel " and " we 're contributing to the ecosystem " or something like that .
I mean , how insane is that ?
A f***ing steel mill is green ?!
That 's just outrageously psycho !
Here , as in the US , with all this talk about ' sustainable ' , and ' green ' - the idea is that if you keep using those words , you are trying to tell people , " Well , actually that 's okay , we 're thinking about it , we 're concerned , we 're working on it " - all that shit .
Well , its just lies .
You just keep on greasing the wheels with it , and hoping people will go along with it , a little while longer .
What are your thoughts on the Copenhagen summit ?
Its cosmetic stuff , but they wo n't get even that out of it , because the rich nations are blocking it .
More than a decade after the Kyoto accord , things have not only gotten worse , they have become worse than they had imagined it would in terms of the speed of change .
Many believe that technology 's benefits outweigh its drawbacks , like medical science , for example .
If you were to become ill , would you not go to a hospital ?
Sure , I 'm not going to say , oh no , I wo n't go to a hospital .
I do n't have a choice - what am I going to do ?
But we 're just trapped in it , and we 're just supposed to forget that it is technology that has created nearly all the diseases in the first place .
So they say more technology will solve our problems , and you know , and its just getting worse , it 's not getting better .
Medical technology is the strongest case that can be made ; but the simple fact is that it all depends on industry - depends on the factories , and the mines - all your surgical equipment and monitors and what not - obvious as that is , it 's always left out of the discussion .
If there is a discussion , it is carefully limited to how do we best use technology ?
So , are we living in a culture of denial ?
Oh yeah , massive denial , I do n't know how to compare countries , but the US certainly is on top of the list .
But it is an enforced denial too : if people can't even think about an alternative , then what are you left with ?
You do n't want to see how bad things are , do n't want to meditate on how bad its going to be for your kids , in a matter of a few years .
It 's a protective thing , it 's not healthy , but it 's understandable , as it helps you cope with the system .
But is n't technology essentially neutral ?
Technology has values embedded in it .
By technology , I mean systems of technology , as opposed to tools .
There is a certain distancing in modern technology , a certain coldness , a certain kind of standardization , inflexibility , and dependence on experts is another of its values .
But with a simple tool , you can more easily imagine a state of rough equality , where people are not dependant on experts .
That 's the best way to read society : look at its technology , and you can tell what its dominant value is .
To take an example , in Indian urban society at least , cell phone technology has really taken off in recent times .
What does it say about this society , according to you ?
Well , instead of the face - to - face , we trade it for getting to be on the phone , all the time , often over nothing .
Yes , we can talk to friends a thousand miles away , but we do n't know our neighbours , we do n't even want to know our neighbours , we 're trained to seal ourselves off , and the technology helps us that way ; we screen out everything , and pretend we are really in touch with people , when we 're more isolated than ever .
That 's an easy measurement - how many people live alone , how many have fewer friends , do people visit each other less ?
- there is an entire sociological list of things .
And that 's what you get in the techno culture .
So there are certainly values there with mobile phone technology , not to mention the value of the likelihood of getting brain cancer , and poisoning the earth when they go into the land .
You do n't just stop with technology .
You say that human reason itself is not value - neutral .
The Frankfurt School of thinkers came up with that , about instrumental reason .
Reason is n't value - free .
It could be a reason that pretends it 's objective and scientific but it 's actually inclined toward being a tool of domination .
It 's just an abstraction to say , ' reason ' .
You need to ask what kind of reason it is .
How is non-instrumental reason different from instrumental reason ?
Non-instrumental reason has an awareness of what the dominant reason , if you will , is really involved in , what is its project .
We do n't look at the hidden assumptions all that often .
For example , we take domestication for granted , and it 's nothing but more control and more domination at deeper levels , colonising nature at deeper levels .
For instance , GM foods and cloning and nanotechnology - they drive domestication even more , down to the molecular or atomic level .
But if I were n't operating in the sphere of domestication , I would n't be using reason as an instrument here , because , why would you want to control nature ?
Pre-domestication , you take what nature gives , and that 's great , you do n't devise all these ways to fence it off , and breed what you want , and try to figure out new levels of control .
But this is the logic today , and it 's certainly not value - free .
People would argue that all this technology and domestication and mastery over nature are necessary to feed an expanding population .
Well , various leftists , including Noam Chomsky , say that too , except that the unnaturally high population is related to the civilisation project .
That 's when the population started going up .
Overpopulation is a symptom more than anything else .
Population would start going down if you unplug things like domestication .
But is it really possible to do that today ?
To unplug technology and the mindset it has created ?
Well , it 's not like pulling the plug , or let 's do this tomorrow .
It could not happen that way , as the population is very high .
But you could go in that direction , start figuring out the way to undo it , as a conscious project .
That would be more appealing than the prospect of all these people in entire blocs who will starve to death when the power goes out , because they do n't have any skills , and then there could be food riots and then what ?
It 's not a pretty picture .
I think the responsible way is to think through that and start getting equipped , and turning that around .
Chomsky and other people call us genocidists .
Well , if anybody is genocidist , quite frankly , it 's them , because they do n't want to have any discussion of things like this .
And it's weird that they are n't more concerned than they are about all these millions of people in megalopolises all around the world - they are screwed if there is a crash .
Nobody is allowed to think about it or even put it out there .
How can any such change come about unless there is change in policy at the level of the state and government , where all key decisions get made ?
No , that 's a dead end , that 's the trap of the system .
They want us to keep playing that shit , you know , keep on voting , which really means , vote for the slightly less awful person than the other .
That guarantees that we 're stuck in this shit .
No , no , that can't be the answer , that just enables , legitimizes , and reproduces the lie of democracy .
If we keep on doing that , then there really is no hope .
The first and easiest thing is to drop out of that - do n't vote , do n't play the game the system sets up for us to play .
So you say the state has to be kept out of it ?
Completely .
You can't get rid of civilization by recourse to the state .
You can look at it historically : when and why does the state appear ?
Or cities , or any institution , starting from division of labour and domestication .
The state and all those things are part of the prison that holds it together .
What do you think of work ?
This is another thing Marshall Sahlins pointed out : the more symbolic culture there is , the more work there is .
And it 's true .
We are working more and more , I mean , what happened to the promise of technology ?
None of these things have worked out the way the way they were proclaimed .
Now , in the US , if you take a couple , they are both working ; often each is working more jobs than one ; all stressed out , they 've got no time for their kids , and all the rest of it .
Is there a way of organising life that does not revolve around production and consumption ?
Production and consumption is the paradigm of a mass society : mass production means mass consumption which means mass culture , which means mass media , mass everything , and the ' massified ' world , becomes less healthy .
That 's not the way to go , and I think that 's a reasonable statement .
How was your meeting with the Unabomber ?
I visited him when he was in county jail in Sacramento .
We have the same ideas , but not the same tactics .
The media are always trying to say , you agree with the Unabomber , do n't you ?!!
But yes , the thesis that technology is autonomous and decides pretty much what happens is true .
It 's even truer especially when we let it go without even treating it as an issue .

( CNN ) --
In the brutal aftermath of Haiti 's earthquake , Jean - Robert Gaillard turned to his low - tech radio for solace and for a lifeline .
When the earthquake hit , the 57 - year - old from Petionville , Haiti , found most of his normal lines of communication -- his cell phone , the Internet , even his ability to walk down the street and talk to someone -- severed by the disaster .
But Gaillard used a neighbor 's generator to power up his radio and connect to a handful of amateur radio enthusiasts in the United States -- many of whom were eagerly listening to radio static for calls like his .
Unlike many other people in Haiti , Gaillard was able to contact family members in the United States soon after the January 12 earthquake hit to tell them he had survived .
In those first hellish moments , that connection seemed like a miracle .
" It relieved the tension of my family members , " he said , speaking by Skype from Haiti on Tuesday , which he says was n't possible until more recently .
" They could hear my voice .
They knew that I was OK . "
Much has been made about the role flashier technologies like Twitter , Skype and text messaging have played in helping disaster victims find loved ones and communicate with international aid workers .
But it is worth noting that , when all else fails , the low - tech hum of a radio frequency is sometimes the only line of communication that 's open .
i Report : Search list of the missing and the found
Enthusiasts of amateur radio -- or ham radio -- are quick to use this as evidence that international aid groups and governments should rely more heavily on radio in disaster situations .
Ham radio signals bounce off of a layer of charged particles in Earth 's atmosphere , called the ionosphere , and , depending on the conditions , can work at times when other modes of communication fail .
But amateur radio is best viewed as one of many communications options in the wake of a disaster , said Keith Robertory , manager of disaster services technology at the American Red Cross , who has been helping in Haiti relief efforts from Washington .
The best communication technology in a disaster , he said , is whatever happens to work at the time .
" Amateur radio is a very powerful tool if the amateur radio operators are in the area where the disaster occurs , " he said .
" There 's a window of opportunity for amateur radio operators right at the beginning [ of a disaster ] .
...
That 's where they are extremely valuable . "
Because that window has now passed , cell phone connections , text messages , Twitter posts and Skype calls are becoming more significant , he said .
A 23 - year - old woman , for example , was rescued in Haiti after text messages were sent from beneath the rubble of a school building .
Full coverage | Twitter updates
Radio stations in Port - au - Prince , the Haitian capital , have been broadcasting almost since the earthquake , providing the only means of communication for some people , Agence France - Presse reports .
Some mobile phone towers in Haiti fell during the earthquake , and cell phone service was not returned to much of the country until at least two days after the tremors first shook the poor Caribbean nation , according to a mobile phone company operating in Haiti .
About a third of people in Haiti have access to mobile phones , compared to nearly 90 percent of people in the United States .
Reports suggest Internet connections also were spotty in the earthquake 's aftermath ; and only about 11 percent of Haitians have access to the Web in non-disaster situations , according to the CIA World Factbook .
Aid groups and journalists have relied on satellite phones , which work independently from local Internet and mobile phone infrastructure as long as the sky is n't too cloudy .
Such technology is n't commonly available for disaster victims , however .
Carol Wilson , compliance director for Trilogy International Partners , which provides mobile phone service to about 1 million people in Haiti , said 80 percent of the company 's cell towers in Haiti were working as of Tuesday .
The company is donating out $ 5 worth of free phone calls to its customers and is giving people double the amount of minutes they would normally get so they can catch up with loved ones and communicate with aid groups , she said .
The main problem with mobile phone connections now , she said , may be fuel , since generators are used to power most cellular towers in Haiti .
In the immediate wake of the disaster , before cell phone coverage was restored , William F. Sturridge , a ham radio operator in Flagler Beach , Florida , said he was able to connect a priest living on the remote Haitian village of Ile - a - Vache with his family members in the United States .
On Wednesday morning , the day after the earthquake hit , he said he heard a faint call of " hotel , hotel , " which signifies the " HH " letters at the beginning of radio call signs in Haiti .
He responded immediately .
" When other systems do n't work , [ radio ] always works , " he said .
" It does n't matter -- no matter where you are in the world ... you can get a [ high - frequency ] signal out and somebody will hear . "
After connecting with the priest in Haiti , Sturridge said he called the man 's brother to tell him his sibling had survived the earthquake .
" He was super worried , " he said .
" They had n't heard from him , and it was wonderful to be able to pass the information and hear the relief in the voice . "
Sturridge said he 's been listening for radio calls from Haiti almost non-stop , with no sleep , since the earthquake hit a week ago .
The 51 - year - old is disabled , and he said the radio gives him a lifeline to the outside world as well .
" It 's very difficult for someone who is bed - bound to be able to work and be able to enjoy the benefits of helping other people , so this is one way I can do this very easily , " he said .
" Certainly , I can't think of anything more rewarding than saving a life . "
While the ability for even one person to communicate with the outside world immediately after a disaster has potentially huge impact , the number of people making calls from Haiti by amateur radio appears to be very small .
Brian Crow , who has been communicating with people in Haiti by radio from outside Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , said only three people in Haiti have made contact with the United States by ham radio since the earthquake .
Crow said his primary role has been taking calls , finding out what aid is needed , and relaying the information to Web sites collecting news about missing people .
A number of sites -- including CNN's iReport and Google -- are creating databases with information about missing people in Haiti .
Other groups have put together population estimates based on satellite maps as a way for aid groups to target their relief efforts .
And a site called Ushahidi is mapping text messages and calls for help in Haiti to give aid groups a better picture of dire needs for food , water and medical help .
Gaillard , the Haitian man who used ham radio to contact loved ones , said the week following Haiti 's earthquake has been absolute hell .
But the fact that he could get on the radio and talk to people outside the situation made him feel connected to the world and has given him the strength to keep going .
" We are in God 's hands now , " he said .
Last week , the Center for American Progress , a think tank with close ties to the Obama administration , published an acerbic essay about the difference between true deficit hawks and showy “ deficit peacocks . ”
You can identify deficit peacocks , readers were told , by the way they pretend that our budget problems can be solved with gimmicks like a temporary freeze in nondefense discretionary spending .
One week later , in the State of the Union address , President Obama proposed a temporary freeze in nondefense discretionary spending .
Wait , it gets worse .
To justify the freeze , Mr. Obama used language that was almost identical to widely ridiculed remarks early last year by John Boehner , the House minority leader .
Boehner then : “ American families are tightening their belt , but they do n’t see government tightening its belt . ”
Obama now : “ Families across the country are tightening their belts and making tough decisions .
The federal government should do the same . ”
What ’s going on here ?
The answer , presumably , is that Mr. Obama ’s advisers believed he could score some political points by doing the deficit - peacock strut .
I think they were wrong , that he did himself more harm than good .
Either way , however , the fact that anyone thought such a dumb policy idea was politically smart is bad news because it ’s an indication of the extent to which we ’re failing to come to grips with our economic and fiscal problems .
" The Oilers took the wrong guy ! "
How many times have we heard that refrain in the last decade ?
Marc Pouliot and Jean - Francois Jacques over Zach Parise .
Trading for Jeff Woywitka over Corey Perry .
Drafting Jesse Niinimaki instead of ... well , pretty much anybody .
Those who condemned such transactions as they were happening became minor hockey Nostradamuses , pronouncing grim prophecy about every transaction the Oilers made , and the trouble with the Oilers since 2004 is that if you said grim things about any of their transactions , you were probably right .
But what is their greatest hockey sin ?
No , not trading Ryan Smyth for Robert Nilsson and Ryan O'Marra .
Not the fact that Ethan Moreau continues to have a hockey career .
Not even the franchise - crippling Nikolai Khabibulin contract .
We had , ultimately , the choice between two assistant GMs of Canadian NHL teams , and we picked the wrong one .
It 's hard to turn a franchise around when the first thing you do is appoint the wrong leader .
Scott Howson was right there .
He was in our hands .
And we let him get away to the Columbus Blue Jackets .
Yes , we were outwitted by the team that gave Doug Maclean a job .
Howson , formerly general manager of the Oilers ' AHL affiliate in Hamilton ( these were the heady days when the Oilers had an AHL affilliate ) jumped to the Oilers in the general purge of the Glen Sather regime as " assistant to the general manager " , which I presume means that he fetched Kevin Lowe 's coffee and got his shirts drycleaned .
A year afterwards he was made plain ol ' assistant general manager , and in June 2007 those bastards the Blue Jackets lured him over to run their hockey team .
There are two major differences between Howson 's biography and Steve Tambellini's .
The first is that Howson , after his playing career , worked his way up through hockey management .
By the time he was assistant to the general manager in Edmonton he already had a few years experience as the top Bulldog under his belt , not to mention a few more years learning the ropes in an advisory role .
Steve Tambellini , meanwhile , went straight from his playing career to the Vancouver Canucks front office , where he took a role in - of all things - public relations , possibly the least hockey - related field one can imagine .
The second was that Howson never lingered in any one place too long before either moving up or moving on .
Steve Tambellini ... well , he did not do that .
In 1997 , he was made Senior Vice President of Hockey Operations with the Canucks , which at least was n't a PR job .
The next year he became Director of Player Personnel , adding another impressive - sounding title with unclear actual responsibilities to his resume .
He spent a decade directing that player personnel before being made Dave Nonis 's assistant general manager .
By the time Nonis was fired on April 14 , 2008 , Steve Tambellini had been with the Canucks for the best part of two decades .
In this time his ascent had been mediocre , like the guy who gets promoted because he 's been working in the office longest and is the only one who knows where the spare copy paper is kept .
In that time with the Canucks , the NHL had experienced what I will approximate as one million billion general managers being fired , and yet until the Oilers came knocking nobody had said " let 's get that guy who 's been in Vancouver for a hundred years . "
Tambellini was also Director of Player Personnel for Team Canada at the 2002 Olympics , 2003 World Junior Championships , and 2004 World Cup , which is an even odder addition to one 's resume given that , when one gets a direct answer as to what a Director of Player Personnel does , it 's usually something like " mumble mumble development mumble mumble tracking prospects mumble mumble " and what one would be tracking prospects for in a two - week tournament is beyond me .
Of course , the bizarrely inbred world that is Canadian senior hockey management has produced many such oddities over the years .
Now , maybe Steve Tambellini just liked Vancouver .
I can't blame him .
Vancouver 's a lovely city .
The transit system works most in the time , there are some great bars , there are , like , nine casinos .
But funny thing about that .
Go through the old archives and it's easy to find Tambellini being linked and interviewing for NHL jobs : the New York Islanders were reportedly interested in Tambellini because , in the magnificent words of Larry Brooks in the New York Post , " there are n't many credible candidates who wish to walk into [ the Islanders ' ] hockey department " .
He was attached to the Toronto Maple Leafs after Pat Quinn 's departure , athough Quinn had wanted Tambellini as his replacement according to the Toronto Star ( nothing to see here , just move along ) .
He was linked with other jobs as well , those are merely the greasiest .
In fact , after Dave Nonis took the pipe on April 14 , 2008 , Tambellini was in line to get a general manager 's job in Vancouver itself .
The Canucks deliberated , interviewed Tambellini , and then duly hired Mike Gillis , better known as " Markus Naslund 's agent " , somebody with no management experience whatsoever .
Apparently the sight of Tambellini being passed over in favour of an agent was enough to get the Oilers excited : within two months he had been made general manager of the Oilers .
Suffice to say that , in the year and a half since his appointment , Steve Tambellini has gone hunting for magic bullets with a vengeance .
Like the teenager finally getting the keys to Dad 's sports car , he is taking reckless risks and acting like he truly , genuinely believes he 's All That .
Dany Heatley !
Nikolai Khabibulin !
Even the rumours about Vincent Lecavalier !
If you 're a former Olympian wih a bad contract and Steve Tambellini has n't been linked with giving up way too much to get you , you should probably reevaluate things .
Not to put too fine a point on it , but has Tambellini brought in any players who were good value for money ?
Even one ?
" Could n't trade Dustin Penner no matter how hard he tried " does not count as a qualification .
Meanwhile , down in Columbus , Scott Howson has been quietly acquiring value contracts and turning a team that Doug Maclean had utterly ruined into a pretty solid hockey team .
Not only good but sustainable , with a lot of nice veterans on excellent contracts which will allow the Blue Jackets to continue to stock the larder and get gradually better .
It 's almost like he 's been paying attention to hockey for the last half decade , while Steve Tambellini spent that time flying around to try and get a job before being rejected in favour of agents or old goalies .
There 's a lesson there somewhere .
And it 's not just " give Scott Howson a blank cheque when his contract with Columbus is up and ask him to write in whatever he thinks is fair " .
Predictably , I used a classical 555 astable circuit .
I studied a few circuits .
I hoped to run my circuit on just one button battery , either a 1.5 or 3 v .
This led me towards transistor flip - flop circuits .
I tried a few different circuits to no avail before my impatience pushed me to the 555 .
I was hoping to make a circuit that would flash the LED for 50 - 100 ms out of every second , so that the internet would run for weeks on one battery .
In choosing the 555 , there were two compromises .
Firstly I required two batteries instead of one ( the 555 requires a minimum of 5v ) .
Secondly I would n't be able to make a short flash for extended battery life as the 555 does n't allow an off / low output longer than the on / high output .
The following is optional :
I prototyped the circuit on a breadboard .
I played about with resistors I had to hand .
Using two 1 mega ohm resistors gave me a time of approximately 0.7 seconds low and 1.4 seconds high .
Watching the clip from The IT Crowd , the time period seems to be long , so this circuit is probably more accurate to the TV show than my short - flash idea .
If you 've not done much electronics then prototyping can be a VERY good idea , allowing you to switch components and play around as you wish .
Imagine soldering your circuit together and , after finding it not working , discovering it could have been solved in the prototype stage when you could easily change things .
I then soldered the circuit on the veroboard .
One tool not mentioned thus far is a veroboard track cutter .
This is a cross between a screwdriver and a drillbit , used to cut the copper tracks on veroboards ( necessary when using DIL chips ) .
These are , in my opinion , overpriced , so I just used a drillbit with my fingers .
I had already used a section of the stripboard for another project in progress , so I snapped off as much as possible , which probably was n't enough .
As you can see from my pictures , it is all a bit tight .
I am quite impressed at how compact I kepts the main parts of the circuit .
The main problem was , as you can probably see , the CR2032 holders , which are bloody chunky and did n't fit so happily ( there was enough space for one but the second was n't so happy .
Got it in eventually though ) .
As you can see from my photos , I have n't shown you the bottom ( copper track ) part of the circuit .
That is because it is a monstrosity which should not be privy to prying eyes .
Also , the wires , you see , are curly .
These are for connection to the LED are soldered between pin 3 on the 555 ( the output pin ) and the resistor ( which goes to the negative rail , used to protect the LED ) .
I have curled them by wrapping them around a pencil .
I did this so that they are more flexible , and just easier to deal with .
This did unsurprisingly well when I posted it to Twitter , so I ’ve archived it here for posterity .

One of the healing measures suggested when Ireland ’s Catholic clerical sex scandals shocked the country last year was a proposal to erect a monument in Dublin to all the youths abused for decades at schools and orphanages run by religious orders that looked the other way .
The idea , proposed by the government ’s Ryan report last May , won so much support that half a million euros were earmarked for the project .
The government appointed a group to consider what the Irish Times called “ the most difficult public art commission in the history of the state . ”
It ’s just become even more difficult because one group of clerical abuse victims has now said the funds should instead be donated to victims of the Haiti earthquake .
The gesture would “ genuinely mean more to victims of clerical abuse than a piece of stone on O’Connell Street , ” the victims ’ group Right of Place said last week at a meeting with Prime Minister Brian Cowen .
O’Connell Street is Dublin ’s main thoroughfare , an ideal place for any memorial .
Others disagree .
Christine Buckley , who works at the Aislinn Centre to support victims , said she recognised the deep suffering of Haitian people .
But Ireland , whose government and citizens have already contributed millions in aid to Haiti , should still be able to afford just over 3 euros per each child affected by abuse , she said .
The Ryan commission that issued the shocking report about abuse committed throughout much of the past century recommended that the monument should have the words of an 1999 government apology inscribed on it :
“ On behalf of the State and all citizens of the State , the Government wishes to make a sincere and overdue apology to the victims of childhood abuse for our collective failure to intervene , to detect their pain , to come to their rescue . ”
Beyond that , it is unclear what the monument , if built , would look like .
The Irish Times said in November it should be “ less like an official war monument and more like a Holocaust memorial , ” adding that it had to be “ dignified and angry , beautiful and raw , defiant and ashamed . ”
One precedent could be the Famine Memorial statues on the banks of Dublin ’s River Liffey , which depict a group of emaciated people apparently straining to reach a ship that would take them from Dublin to America in the 1840s .
“ I ca n’t say what it ’s going to be like , ” Buckley told Reuters .
“ ( But ) the state can afford to spend 3 euros on each of us . ”
The church has made shamed apologies for the abuse published in the Ryan report and in a second inquiry into how Roman Catholic archbishops obsessively covered up widespread sexual abuse of children by priests until the 1990s , findings which were released in November .
Some bishops have resigned over the latest scandal but it has emerged in the past week that church leaders were far from united in their response to the revelations .
The Irish Catholic newspaper published remarks from a letter sent from one bishop criticising Dublin Archbishop Diarmuid Martin — who has taken the initiative in admitting faults and pushing for change — for not standing by his priests during the controversy .
“ Your criticism was unfair , ” Bishop Dermot O’Mahony was quoted as telling Martin , who was appointed to the Dublin post in 2003 after years in Rome and in the Vatican diplomatic service .
“ You were out of the diocese for 31 years and had no idea how traumatic it was for those of us who had to deal with allegations without protocols or guidelines or experience in the matter of child sexual abuse . ”

The Memphis Commercial Appeal reported that Paulk and Williams scuffled during the AutoZone Liberty Bowl awards luncheon and nearly flipped over a table while fighting over a dessert .
According to the paper , one player had the other in a headlock and was hitting him .
Both East Carolina and Arkansas ' players , coaches and administration members were in attendance as well as bowl officials and dignitaries .
Paul Scott ( R - Grand Blanc ) is running for the GOP nomination to be the next Secretary of State in Michigan .
He has made stopping transgender people from changing their sex on their license part of his four most important priorities .
" I will make it a priority to ensure transgender individuals will not be allowed to change the sex on their driver ’s license in any circumstance .
It ’s a social values issue .
If you are born a male , you should be known as a male .
Same as with a female , she should be known as a female " ( Michigan Messenger ) .
He made clear that this was a priority of his in order to stop biologically male trans women from using female restrooms .
Michigan law currently allows transgender people to legally change their sex .
The representative is threatening to turn back the tide on civil rights even though just a few months ago residents of Kalamazoo , Michigan reaffirmed their commitment to protections based on gender identity at the polls .
Tell Paul Scott to stop using transphobia as a political tool to advance his candidacy .

Le 29 novembre , un vol Rio - Paris a rencontré des conditions similaires à celles de l'avion qui s'est écrasé en juin .
C'est une information que révèle Le Figaro .
Il y a dix jours , le vol AF 445 , qui est le nouveau nom donné au vol AF 447 d'Air France depuis l'accident du 1er juin dernier qui avait fait deux cent vingt - huit victimes , a subi de fortes perturbations exactement dans la même zone que celle où l'AF 447 a disparu .
Faute d'avoir récupéré les boîtes noires , toujours au fond de l'Atlantique , les enquêteurs attendent de pouvoir analyser les données du vol AF 445 .
Le bureau d'enquêtes et d'analyses ( BEA ) en charge de l'investigation sur le drame a aussitôt lancé une enquête .
Le parallélisme entre l'accident du 1er juin et l'incident du 29 novembre est saisissant , note le quotidien .
Le vol AF 445 aurait rencontré des conditions météo perturbées dans le " pot au noir " ( zone de convergence intertropicale ) proches de celles de l'AF 447 .
Il s'agit également de la même famille d'avion : un Airbus A 330-203 pour l'AF 447 et un A 330-200 pour le vol 445 .
L'incident aurait eu lieu à 18 kilomètres de la zone supposée de disparition de l'AF 447 , la nuit aussi .
En revanche , l'AF 445 n'a pas subi de givrage de ses sondes Pitot et de pertes d'informations anémométriques , à la différence du vol AF 447 .

With the new tablet device that is debuting next week , Apple Inc. AAPL 1.51 % Chief Executive Steve Jobs is betting he can reshape businesses like textbooks , newspapers and television much the way his iPod revamped the music industry — and expand Apple 's influence and revenue as a content middleman .
In developing the device , Apple focused on the role the gadget could play in homes and in classrooms , say people familiar with the situation .
The company envisions that the tablet can be shared by multiple family members to read news and check email in homes , these people say .
Despite its digital legacy , Apple is betting that its Tablet can revitalize television , magazines and newspapers in the way iTunes changed music .
Ethan Smith joins the News Hub panel to discuss .
For classrooms , Apple has been exploring electronic - textbook technology .
Apple also has been looking at how content from newspapers and magazines can be presented differently on the tablet , according to the people familiar with the situation .
Other people briefed on the device say the tablet will come with a virtual keyboard .
Apple has recently been in discussions with book , magazine and newspaper publishers about how they can work together .
The company has talked with New York Times Co. NYT 1.93 % , Condé Nast Publications Inc. and HarperCollins Publishers and its owner News Corp. , which also owns The Wall Street Journal , over content for the tablet , say people familiar with the talks .
New York Times Chairman Arthur Sulzberger declined to comment in an interview Wednesday on its involvement in the new device except to say , " stay tuned . "
Apple is also negotiating with television networks such as CBS Corp. and Walt Disney Co. DIS - 1.05 % , which owns ABC , for a monthly TV subscription service , the Journal has reported .
Apple is also working with videogame publisher Electronic Arts Inc. to show off the tablet 's game capabilities , according to one person familiar with the matter .
Journal Community
Apple 's strategy contrasts with how other technology companies are approaching media .
Notably , Google Inc. offers content to consumers largely free on properties like its video - sharing site YouTube , making relatively little distinction between clips from users and those of professional media companies , although YouTube this week said it plans to experiment with movie rentals .
Web sites like Twitter and Facebook also provide outlets for user - generated content .
Mr. Jobs has a longstanding strategy of devising new ways to access and pay for quality content , instead of reinventing the content .
Apple 's iTunes Store , for instance , became the world 's largest music retailer partly by making it easy for people to buy music , most of it from major record labels , by the song instead of by the album .
Its digital - media receiver Apple TV was also designed so people can buy and rent movies and television shows .
Mr. Jobs is " supportive of the old guard , and [ he ] looks to help them by giving them new forms of distribution , " says a person who has worked with the CEO .
" What drives all of these changes is technology , and Apple has an ability to influence that . "
Apple 's divide with Google over how it views media content also drives the wedge deeper between the two companies .
Apple 's iPhone , for example , currently closely integrates Google 's mapping and search technology , but a person familiar with the matter said Apple was in serious discussions with Microsoft Corp.
MSFT 1.48 % to incorporate its
Bing search engine into the iPhone as the default search and map technologies .
Microsoft declined to comment .
The talks were reported earlier by BusinessWeek .
Details of how Apple charges for the content on its tablet could n't be learned , but people familiar with the company 's thinking say Apple could change conventional payment structures .
One person familiar with the matter said the company was discussing with the New York Times how it could charge for news through iTunes .
It is unclear how people will access content wirelessly off the tablet .
An Apple spokesman said the company " does n't comment on rumors and speculation . "
Mr. Jobs did n't respond to a request for comment .
Mr. Jobs ' effort to repackage and resell more media content is n't without obstacles .
He already has faced resistance from television companies and cable - network providers over Apple 's desire to license just their best content rather than all of it .
Many music executives complain that it has become a powerful gatekeeper between the labels and customers .
What 's more , the iTunes Store 's music downloads have n't grown fast enough to offset the decline in CD sales for music companies .
On Monday , Apple sent out an invitation to a media event on Jan. 27 " to see our latest creation . "
The tablet , which Apple currently plans to ship in March , will have about a 10 - to 11 - inch touch screen , say people familiar with the situation .
Apple CEO Steve Jobs spoke during an event in September 2009 .

Apple 's tablet foray faces several obstacles .
Analysts say demand will depend on its price , which some believe will be about $ 1,000 .
Apple must also convince consumers the product is worth buying in addition to an iPhone and a laptop computer .
And Apple faces competition from cheaper netbooks and other devices such as Amazon.com Inc.'s AMZN 0.12 % Kindle e-book reader .
The tablet 's success will depend " on how this product can fit into the user 's daily life ... and whether you have enough content to make it important enough to use it , " said Henry Lu , senior vice president of Taiwanese computer company Micro - Star International Co. 2377 0.76 % , which failed at selling a tablet computer a few years ago .
In the academic arena , Apple could face hurdles wooing universities if the tablet does n't meet their needs or is n't compatible with other computing devices that students are using .
Amazon had been hoping to target the market with its 9.7 - inch screen Kindle DX e-book reader , for example , but schools said the device was n't sufficiently interactive and lacked basics such as page numbers and color graphics .
One person familiar with the matter said Apple has put significant resources into designing and programming the device so that it is intuitive to share .
This person said Apple has experimented with the ability to leave virtual sticky notes on the device and for the gadget to automatically recognize individuals via a built - in camera .
It is unclear whether these features will be included at launch .
Apple 's content - related efforts heated up in the fall .
In October , Apple sent representatives to the Frankfurt Book Fair , the industry 's largest trade fair , according to one person familiar with the matter .
At the same time , Apple pitched media companies on a " best of TV " subscription service to television networks under which customers would pay a monthly fee for on - demand access to programs from a bundle of participating TV networks , giving consumers another way to readily access television content .
At a meeting in New York with one network in October , an Apple executive said the company was specifically looking to access four to six shows per channel , said one person familiar with the meeting .
Apple also has been planning a revamp of its iTunes music service by creating a Web - based version of it that could launch as soon as June , say people familiar with the matter .
Tentatively called iTunes.com , the service would allow customers to buy music without going through the specialized iTunes program on computers and iPhones .
People familiar with Apple 's plans say a central part of the new strategy is to populate as many Web sites as possible with " buy " buttons , integrating iTunes transactions into activities like listening to Internet radio and surfing review Web sites .
In November , Apple hired Tracy Augustine , a former executive at textbook publishers Cengage Learning Inc. and Pearson Education Inc. , as the director of world - wide education .
Ms. Augustine is responsible for " driving global strategy and revenue for the education online store for students , " according to her Linked In description .
Ms. Augustine did n't respond to a request for comment .

WASHINGTON , Jan 28 ( Reuters ) - President Barack Obama will announce on Thursday $ 8 billion in grants to develop the first U.S. high - speed , intercity rail service the White House says will create or save thousands of jobs .
Obama is heading to Tampa , Florida , after delivering his State of the Union address Wednesday night in which he promised Americans that job creation would be his top priority this year , in the face of stubborn double - digit unemployment .
The grants will help fund the development of 13 high - speed “ rail corridors ” across the country , the White House said .
One of the new rail corridors will be in Florida .
The grants come from money already earmarked for the projects in Obama ’s $ 787 billion stimulus package that Congress passed last year .
“ This historic $ 8 billion investment is expected to create or save tens of thousands of jobs over time in areas like track - laying , manufacturing and rail maintenance , ” the White House said in a statement
It said more than 30 rail manufacturers , including foreign companies , had agreed to establish or expand their base of operations in the United States if they won contracts to help build the new rail corridors .
In addition to the $ 8 billion stimulus money , $ 1 billion a year will be set aside for five years in the federal budget to jump - start the program .
Politics can get weird .
This is to be expected since the stakes are high and money or power drives some folks to extremes .
Then again , some of these people were no doubt a little extreme , weird , or extremely strange to begin with and politics was just their next logical step .
1. The Donation that really a Political Gambit
The letter from Constantine professed undying and rather expensive gratitude .
The Emperor gave Pope Sylvester I the controlling sovereignty over most of Western Europe .
Why ?
Well , according to the letter Constantine wrote he was so grateful for having been cured of leprosy by the pope .
The only problem was there is no record anywhere then or now of the Emperor having the dread disease .
In fact , the document itself was n’t seen until around A.D. 750 or 800 about 400 years after the ruler passed on to his own reward .
This did not keep the Vatican from using the letter as a sort of deed of custody to add land or tariffs paid to the Holy Roman Empire .
A scholar named Lorenzo Valla discovered and published a report regarding a number of historical inconsistencies with the Donation letter , but no one really had the clout to put an end to the deceit until the end of the 1920’s .
It was none other than Benito Mussolini , himself about to pull a few fast ones with the public , who finally forced Rome to let go of a huge slice of Italy .

2. Too Delicate To Vote , Tough Enough to Be Tortured
Strangely enough in two places as committed to ‘ fairness ’ and the ‘ rights of the individual ’ women had to suffer and protest for their right to vote in the U.K. and the United States .
For this reason the terms suffrage and suffragette is related to this fight , but few still remember how demeaning and difficult a time the women had it before winning such a basic right for themselves .
Most of the women who protested were from middle class backgrounds who felt stymied by their lack of ability to change their own situations either socially or economically .
They started the movement for rights starting with the right to vote for their own representation in general elections .
While there are currently many historians especially among those who lean toward the conservative trends who feel that the suffragettes did themselves a disservice by protesting , chaining themselves to fences or causing public disturbances it should be noted their methods gained them more attention and sympathy than simply writing letters to a newspaper .
Their fight also proved their point in a weird and ironic way as the reasons many politicians and religious leaders opposed women voting was their supposed fragility and inability to take on weighty subjects .
During the course of the suffragettes movement in U.K. the woman were jailed , beaten , starved , and then out of fear of being blamed for having starved the woman jailers force fed a few of the group ’s leaders by jamming a rubber tube down their throats .
Women in the U.S. likewise faced adversity before finally winning their campaign .
Strangely now that all the anger and hatred has died down even historians often discount or downplay the violence these women experienced which was in reality no differently or less viciously fought against than for any other group protesting for political equality .

3. Conspiracy Theory gone wrong
The name Benjamin Loan is n’t as well known as many of his contemporaries like Andrew Johnson , Lincoln or General Lee.
Loan started out well studying law and being admitted to the bar in 1840 .
Soon he became a practicing lawyer in Missouri .
As he was an opponent of slavery he joined the Union Army and was immediately commissioned as a brigadier general .
He continued his military service until 1863 when he was elected to Congress .
After the assassination of President Lincoln by John Wilkes Booth however , his career took a drastic and weird turn .
He and several other congressmen accused Andrew Johnson of having been involved in the conspiracy to murder President Lincoln .
They demanded answers to certain questions and suggested that no one benefited more from the murder of Abraham Lincoln then Johnson who became acting President .
It was n’t that their questions did n’t have merit .
They wanted to know about apparent changes made to diary of John Wilkes Booth .
They also wanted to know why John Wilkes Booth had visited Johnson ’s house on the day of the assassination and left his card .
The message Booth left was odd .
“ Do n’t wish to disturb you .
Are you at home ? ”
Speculation ran on both sides about this quirky message some believing that the far thinking Booth was planning ahead and trying to cast Johnson in a suspicious light .
Others like Loan thought the message sounded almost like a code , which seemed odd since a member of Booth ’s band of conspirators named George Atzerodt was tasked to kill Johnson at home at the same moment Lincoln was being shot in the theater .
Atzerodt claimed to have lost his nerve and tried to find it at a bar in several shots of whiskey .
By the time he ’d tried to carry out his deed men were already running through the streets shouting the news about Lincoln ’s murder .
Still despite Atzerodt statements and confession the entire plot seemed strange to Loan and the conspiracy theorists so they made it known they did n’t think Johnson should be trusted .
Their campaign of doubt backfired .
As it often happens to those who express such dark theories about their leaders Loan and the others felt public opinion turn against them instead .
Johnson ’s career and reputation continued untarnished by the allegations , but Loan lost his seat in 1868 and was forced back into his practice of law .
He died in 1881 with none of his questions every truly answered .

4 . Might as well elect the dog …
Some of the weirdest campaigns have n’t even involved the human race at all .
There have been a number of times through history when voters have shown either their angst or apathy regarding their political choices by running and even electing members of the animal kingdom .
Perhaps the most amazing cases of a non -human being elected to office through involved foot powder getting the vote .
Perhaps it was apathy , or a misunderstanding , or just a case of the voters deciding six of one , half dozen of the other but a company ’s ad campaign for their foot powder resulted in a successful bid for office instead .
Apparently in July of 1996 elections were held in the small town of Picoza Ecuador and the foot powder company named Pulvapies decided to cash in by using the public ’s interest in the process to promote their foot powder .
They passed out a leaflet the same size , design , and color as the official voting paper imprinted with the slogan “ For Mayor : Honorable Pulvapies . ”
The dozen or so candidates who found themselves beaten out of office by a cure for stinky feet were humiliated and threatening to sue the pharmaceutical enterprise for fraud .

5 . The strange tale of Mary Rosh – Woman , man or political beast ?
John Lott is writer who likes guns , economic theory and conservative politics apparently in that order .
Born in 1958
Lott holds several degrees and has held research positions at UCLA , Yale , Wharton and several other universities .
When he began writing for the public with titles such as “ More Guns , Less Crime ” , “ The Bias against Guns ” and “ Freedomonmics ” it was natural that forums , chat rooms , and blogs heated up with either praise or criticism of the books .
This was n’t unusually , but soon internet users came to notice that time after time any place where the book was mentioned and especially if it was even tamely given a negative treatment a woman name Mary Rosh would show up and pen a long defense of Lott ’s work .
What was very strange was she did n’t have many other interests .
She did n’t show to respond to other writer ’s works , or haunt the blogs where such subjects were discussed at any other time .
She appeared to be fairly obsessed with Lott .
Eventually Mary had a logical explanation for this – she was a former student of John Lott ’s and she fondly remembered those days hearing his lectures .
She continued to show up to give glowing reviews of the book on places such as Amazon.com and to fire back with critical remarks at any other researchers or critics of Lott ’s research or writing .
When it came to his theory about more guns meaning less crime Mary used her supposedly pint size to make her point claiming to weigh only 114 pounds therefore in need of a firearm for protection .
Forum and blog readers begin to grow suspicious and when some noticed that the writing and Mary Roch and John Lott was very similar they begin to uncover a trail that lead from Roch straight to John Lott .
Blogger Julian Sanchez tracked Roch down to a fake persona
Lott had taken on to defend and glorify his own work .
Lott tried claiming his son and wife had used the alias to defend him , but few took this idea seriously .
The non-existent Mary Roch has the distinction of being known as the very first internet “ sock puppet ” a beast designed to serve as a loyal online invisible friend to anyone with a political agenda .

It ’s said politics makes strange bedfellows , but the truth is it also breeds a lot of weirdness .

Communication is a central aspect of everyday life , a fact that is reflected in the wide variety of ways that people exchange information , not only with words , but also using their face and body .
Scientists from the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics in Tübingen , Germany , found out that we are able to recognize facial expressions in motion -- for example , in a movie -- far better than in a static photograph .
The video sequence needs to be at least as long as one tenth of a second to gain this dynamic advantage .
A facial expression can state a lot .
A nod indicates understanding , a frown may say : " Please explain that again ! "
Scientists from the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics discovered that we are able to classify an expression much better when it moves naturally rather than when it is " frozen " in a photograph .
In order to gain the advantage of dynamic information , we need to see the expression moving for at least 100 milliseconds .
If the video sequence is shorter , our brain is less capable of interpreting the facial motion .
Some expressions rely on changes in head orientation , for example , a nod or a shake of the head , others on the complex deformation of facial parts , such as wrinkling our nose to signalize disgust or a frown .
In order to examine to what extent we are able to recognize -- based on facial expressions -- the mood of a person with whom we are interacting , the scientists showed participants pictures of humans with various different expressions .
Among them were simple , emotional expressions , such as " happy " and " sad , " but also more complex ones such as agreement , confusion , or surprise , which are usually used to emphasize or modify statements in a conversation .
In order to investigate whether these expressions are recognized more easily in motion or in static pictures , a short video sequence was shown to the participants .
The video recordings began at a neutral expression , showed an emotion , and ended at the last frame before the face started to head back to a neutral expression .
The frame used in the static conditions was the last , so - called ' peak ' frame of each dynamic sequence .
The participants were then asked to identify the expressions based on the shown sequence or single frame .
In further experiments , the video sequences were converted to a series of photographs that was shown to the participants .
Nevertheless , the expressions were still recognized more accurately in the video sequence .
This showed that the dynamic advantage is not due to the presence of multiple images , but that some form of dynamic information is being used .
In order to figure the degree to which facial expression recognition relies on natural movement , the frames were presented as a movie , but in a random order .
Comparisons of the performance in this scrambled condition to the original video sequence shows that the recognition rates were still higher in the original than in the scrambled version .
The chronological direction is of importance as well .
If the video sequences are temporally reversed , they are again identified less accurately .
Finally , the more temporal information we receive , the better we are able to recognize expressions -- at least up to 100 milliseconds .
The results show that neither pictures , nor motion alone are of importance , but that we need a combination of the correct temporal sequence and the correct facial motion to reliably interpret facial expressions .
" Facial expressions , like gestures and body motion , are a dynamic phenomenon and need to be investigated with the help of video sequences in order to get a better understanding of the dynamic information that is being processed , " says Dr. Christian Wallraven , co-author of the study .
" Our results also have implications for the area of computer animation , since its goal is to create artificial avatars and facial animations that are able to communicate realistically and believably , " says the physicist and perception scientist .

Paparazzi pictures of 300 stud Gerard Butler looking all fat in Barbados have everyone in a tizzy .
Finally it seems male celebrities will be held to the same impossible body standards as their female counterparts .
Thank God .
For so many years Hollywood 's leading men , even of the leading and romantic varieties , have been allowed to fall into a state of disrepair after first seducing fans with their svelte physiques .
Just look at Russell Crowe , Luke Wilson , and Vince Vaughn .
This was acceptable behavior , to get all big and bloated and still play men who women fawn all over in the movies .
It seems like Fatty Butler is putting this to rest .
" From Spartan to softie : Gerard Butler packs on the holiday pounds and shows off his new beach body , " reads the headline in the New York Daily News .
" Gerard Butler packs some paunch on his Barbados holiday as his Spartan muscles become a distant memory , " says theU.K.'s Daily Mail .
Celebitchy cuts right to the chase with , " Gerard Butler shows off his gut & moobs in Barbados . "
These are the types of headlines usually reserved for female celebs like the Olsen twins , who are a constant source of speculation for being either too fat or dangerously thin .
Jessica Simpson , who got the " Fat Jessica : Still Hot ? " treatment when she gained a couple pounds last year .
Britney Spears is only in the tabs good graces now that she has lost the weight from her Video Music Awards debacle in 2007 .
Butler needs to follow Britney 's example ( did you ever think anyone would say that ever ? ) and get back in shape and remind the public that he is a hunk of burning love .
After all , look at what we fell in love with ?
His role in 300 was predicated more on his abdominals than it was his acting ability , and that 's what we want .
Sorry , we 're not going to lobby for more lax standards for celebrities .
If they want to be famous , they have to pay the price by being famously fit .
After all , if we want to look at people carrying a bit of fat around the midsection we 'll start following politics .
Other than starring in movies and TV shows and making albums , stars have nothing else to do but go to the gym and eat right .
They also have money and the access to afford the best trainers , nutritionist , yoga instructors , or surgery , if it really comes to that .
And part of their job description is to be more beautiful than the fatties that we see every Saturday at the mall buying bigger sweatpants .
No matter what you might say about Madonna 's scary arms , she managed to keep a stellar body into her 50s .
Same with Jamie Lee Curtis , Demi Moore ( not quite fifty ) , and even Sally Boniva Field !
These women know that maintaining a career as an actress means being held up to nearly impossible standards , and it 's finally time for the men to join in .
Hear that , Val Kilmer ?
Better get to the gym , Alec Baldwin .
Robert Downey Jr and Brad Pitt are still rocking killer bodies well into their prime , and that is going to be the standard for the future .
That means Zac Efron will never eat another piece of chocolate cake in his life , but such is the price of fame .
The Star cover above , while predominantly concerned with women , also includes some men , which shows that they are starting to get the heat for looking good in public as well .
Let 's hope that Gerard is the final nail in that coffin .
We 're just sick of seeing man boobs with the men behind them getting a free pass from public ridicule .

Neil Young finally has his first Grammy Award , but it 's not for his music .
Not overtly , anyway .
Obviously , the man 's storied singing and songwriting career , now encroaching on its 50th year , has something to do with it .
Still , while Young will compete with his peers in a couple of Grammy categories – in " best solo rock vocal performance " for the title track to last year 's Fork In The Road album , and " best boxed or special limited edition package " for his gargantuan Archives , Vol. 1 : 1963-1972 set – at the awards ceremony in Los Angeles tomorrow night , the one trophy he 'll have going in is for a side of his life he keeps quiet about : his philanthropy .
Young was officially minted as the Recording Academy 's " MusiCares Person of the Year " Friday night at a gala dinner in L.A. , an event that no doubt had him squirming uncomfortably in his seat .
Especially when such fellow musicians as Elton John , John Mellencamp , k.d. lang , Sheryl Crow , the Red Hot Chili Peppers , Wilco and his old pals Crosby , Stills and Nash got up and started serenading him with his own songs .
He deserves the MusiCares honour , though .
His quiet humanitarianism goes way back .
He 's been a crusader for environmental issues forever , and active with the Cerebral Palsy Foundation since his first son , Zeke , and then his second son , Ben , a quadriplegic , were diagnosed with the disease .
He 's a frequent donor to the Epilepsy Foundation , too , since both he and his daughter , Amber Jean , have the illness .
He co-founded Farm Aid with Willie Nelson and John Mellencamp in 1985 to help save humble American family farms facing foreclosure , and still sits on its board of directors .
He 's also one of the founders of the Bay Area 's Bridge School , an organization that assists and educates children with severe physical and / or speech impairments , and stages a famed annual , all - star benefit concert in support of the facility .
Young , of course , does n't trumpet any of this .
But the 64 - year - old Toronto and Winnipeg expat does n't trumpet much of anything about himself .
Neil Young , the philanthropist , is just one of the many faces of a genuine rock `n ' roll enigma .
Those faces are why so many of us find Young such a compelling figure .
So , as a salute to Canada 's most fondly regarded musical export , we present a few more :
ICONIC FOLKIE
With his long hair , flannel shirts and acoustic guitar , the sensitive , socially conscious Neil Young who drifted in and out of Buffalo Springfield and CSNY during the late `60s and early `70s was the perfect poster child for hippie - era folk .
His songs , however , really were folk music in another sense , notes author Bob Mersereau , whose 2007 book Top 100 Canadian Albums was " dominated " by Young and topped by 1972's Harvest .
" His music is so understandable , " says Mersereau .
" You can immediately start your own music life by playing Neil Young songs around the campfire and everybody will love you for it .
It 's all Bs and As and Ds – it 's really easy to play Neil Young songs . "
Adds Nicholas Jennings , author of the Can-rock history Before the Goldrush : " He launched a million Neil wannabes .
On every street corner in every major Canadian city in the early `70s , there was a kid in a flannel shirt playing sad songs from Harvest and After the Goldrush .
I was one of them .
He struck a chord with a generation then , but the difference is he 's continued to do that with successive generations . "
Calgary rocker Chad VanGaalen , often compared to Young , sums up the appeal : learning a Neil Young song is " a good way to learn rock ' n ' roll etiquette . "
GUITAR GOD
As we all know , Quiet Neil begat Loud Neil , the rancorous electric noisemaker and Crazy Horse bandleader who answered punk with the seething Rust Never Sleeps in 1979 and foreshadowed `90s grunge with Freedom and Ragged Glory .
It 's this Neil , he of the roaring feedback , 20 - minute grind - downs and brain - boggling one - note solos , who 's enchanted thousands of other guitarists with his intuitive , almost subconscious , playing style .
" Everything sounds broken down , like its going to fall apart any second , " says Mike Boyd of local roots `n ' roll outfit the Hunting Horns .
" Nothing is ever precise , but it sounds perfect .
That 's exactly how I 've always wanted my playing to sound . "
Indie guitarist Luke Doucet echoes the sentiment .
" I spent thousands of hours learning how to play `well . '
I learned how to play slide in any key , how to play 16th - note quadruplets at lightening speed , how to hear a slippery country lick and immediately replicate it , how to play the pedal steel .
I learned to cop solos , verbatim and up to speed , by Mark Knopfler , Brian Setzer , Mark Ribot , Chet Atkins and many others .
All of these things so I could communicate transparently and passionately through the guitar .
" Neil can do none of the above and yet his musicality and the flow of expression , unobstructed and unaided , communicate so transparently and so passionately as to defy reason .
He has managed to clear all of the impediments from his mind , like a master yogi .
The man must meditate like Buddha . "

Contrary to his homespun sound and image , Young has historically exhibited a keen interest in new gadgets , technology and cool inventions in general .
He 's been an early adopter of everything from eight - track recorders to modern digital studio gear .
He loves model trains enough to own part of the Lionel company .
The robotic Vocoder voices on Trans grew out of his experiments in electronic communication with his paralyzed son .
He helped develop an entire interactive , multimedia software platform – dubbed the " Shakey Platform , " after his filmmaking alias , Bernard Shakey – so the Archives series would work the way he wanted , allowing his fans online access to a vast , ever - expanding collection of photos , videos , audio interviews and printed documents offered to complement the music as one listens to the box sets .
His environmentally themed Greendale tour in 2004 was powered entirely by biodiesel .
Lately , Young 's inventing obsession has turned to creating the perfect , zero-emissions vehicle – one that 's still sized large enough to satisfy the demand for , as he puts it , " a big , American car . "
To this end , he 's started the LincVolt project , which thus far has seen him and a team of researchers convert his beloved 1959 Lincoln Continental convertible into a hybrid vehicle that will , they hope , eventually require no fuel or oil at all .
CRANK
To love Neil Young is to occasionally be baffled , even angered , by Neil Young .
It 's hard to think of a musician of his stature who has as consistently refused to play to expectations .
He followed up the smash success of Harvest with three of his darkest records ever – Time Fades Away , On the Beach and Tonight 's the Night – dubbed the " Ditch " trilogy because at the time Young said he'd rather " drive for the ditch " than stay in the " middle of the road " where Harvest had taken him .
His random ' 80s experiments in rockabilly , country , synth - pop , blues and other styles resulted in albums so unsuccessful that he was sued by Geffen Records for not sounding like himself .
On the Greendale tour , he and Crazy Horse played a bare minimum of hits while members of Young 's family and crew acted out a bizarre environmental pantomime onstage .
In 2006 , disgusted that no younger musicians were publicly coming out against the Iraq war , he rushed out a Bush - bashing screed called Living With War highlighted by the tune " Let 's Impeach the President . "
Then he joined CSNY on the road for the Freedom of Speech tour , playing virtually nothing but protest songs and sparking near - riots in some cities .
" It 's an absolute refusal to bend , " says Mersereau .
" You can not move this man .
He will do whatever he wants .
He 'll be politically charged when he feels , he 'll go against the flow when he feels .
He 's the ultimate rock ' n ' roll symbol for defiance and attitude , and for artistic pursuits . "
ROLE MODEL
Not surprisingly , Young 's unwavering commitment to whatever whim he 's feeling in the here and now , and his willingness to sometimes screw up in public , has made him a best - case scenario for artists looking to build musical careers of their own in his wake .
Jennings even goes so far as to call him a " moral compass " for idealistic artists coming up behind him .
He 's certainly the ideal model , agrees writer Jason Schneider , author of Whispering Pines : The Northern Roots of American Music from Hank Snow to the Band .
" I think for Canadians especially , he 's always embodied everything musicians here want : the best of both worlds , " says Schneider .
" He conquered America , more or less on his own terms , and was able to preserve his formative years there through his ranch , his toy trains , and every other wild idea he 's ever had .
I think that 's basically what everyone wants , to be able to indulge any creative impulse we get and have people admire us for it . "
Exactly , says VanGaalen : " He 's gone about his musical career in the way he wanted to .
For better or worse , he seems to have done it in his own way .
He got away with what he got away with , with very little compromise .
Whether playing with a band or working solo he always seems to have had a vision .
There is no compulsion to attach him to any particular label .
He 's always just been Neil Young . "

Introduction
I ’ve been contemplating moving some of my projects stored in Subversion to Git , as much because I think Gitosis is incredibly well done as anything else .
But , because I tend to worry about major changes such as this , I want to be able to go back to Subversion for any particular projects where Git is n’t working out .
This might happen , for example , because a client has decided that he really hates Git .
This document describes how to do this .
1
Using this method , you can move back and forth between Git and Subversion as often as you like , and even use both systems at the same time to update checkouts .
The key restriction is that you must be sending your commits from only one of the two systems at any one time : while it ’s possible for clients to update from either the Subversion repository or the Git master repository and receive all of the latest changes , committers must use only one of the following two methods :
via Subversion protocol ( whether the client be svn or git svn ) to the Subversion repository ; or via Git to the master Git repository .
There ’s a bit of work involved on the administrator ’s part when you want to switch from one to the other .
If you interleave commits without doing this work , you ’ll end up with a mess that ’s going to be painful to clean up .
2
Authors File Configuration
You ’ll probably want to set up an authors file , as described in the git - svn manpage or in this blog entry about Subversion to Git conversion .
To make my life easy , I set up a standard authors file and I use it for all of my conversions .
During conversion , when git svn fetch fails due to an author name not being found , you can just update the file and start another fetch ; it will resume where it left off .
One note : in versions of Git up to at least 1.6.5.1 , there ’s a bug in the use of the svn.authorsfile configuration property ( at least when set in $ HOME /. gitconfig ) : it ’s honoured by git svn fetch , but not git svn clone , even though a clone is just an init followed by a fetch .
So if you use this , you ’ll need to do a separate init and fetch .
Terminology and Layout
I ’m assuming that your initial configuration is like mine : one or more Subversion repositories each with several projects in it , each project having a trunk and possibly several branches and tags .
I convert each project in my Subversion repository to a separate Git repository , to match my typical “ unit of checkout , ” as it were .
Remember , with Git you can clone and have a working copy only of a full repository , and ( at least with Gitosis and most Git tools ) you cannot manage access control in less than repository - size chunks .
I do import all of my Subversion branches for a particular project into the same Git repository as the trunk .
While I need independent control of users ’ read and write access for different projects , I ’ve never had to give a user separate access rights to different branches within one project .
The tags , however , are a special case , because Subversion ’s “ tags ” are actually branches used under the convention that you never commit to them .
These can be converted to either branches or tags in Git .
I ’m not going to discuss this further here , though , as I do n’t have any tags in the projects I ’m converting .
If someone else cares to do a write - up on this , send me an e-mail and I ’ll add a link to it here .
If you do have tags , and need to maintain them , I ’d suggest you just convert them as Git branches to maintain them using the Subversion convention , and add Git tags later , if necessary .
So what we ’re going to do when we convert a project is create a new Git repository which I will refer to as the “ master repository ” .
Commits moving from Subversion to Git during the conversion process will be committed to the Git master repository , and , should you decide to convert back the other way , only commits in the Git master repository will be brought back into the Subversion repository .
This Git master repository will be a bare repository compatible with the standard Gitosis layout .
Exporting from Subversion to Git
To copy your commits from the Subversion repository to the Git master repository , we first use the git svn init command .
If you have no branches or tags , or if you ’re using the standard Subversion layout , you can simply provide the Subversion URL to your project as the command line argument to init , or provide a - - trunk= url option :
git svn init \
svn+ssh://repo.example.com/home/repo/client/project \ gitproject
Note that the URL you use must work from the location where you ’re going to place the final Git master repository .
Thus , even when doing a conversion on the same machine that has the Subversion repository , I use an svn+ssh : URL for this .
I use a non-standard layout where my trunk , branches and tags are all kept under the project directory , so that the paths in the Subversion repository look like this :
/client/project/trunk /client/project/branch/foo /client/project/branch/bar /client/project/tag/baz
If you do this sort of thing , you ’ll need to use the -- branches and -- tags options to init .
There ’s a bug here , too .
The documentation claims that these options ( and -- trunk ) take full URLs , but they do n’t unless you ’re using just -- trunk alone .
So if you use these options , you want to specify the common prefix of the path as the command - line argument , and the subdirectories under those with options :
git svn init \ -- trunk=trunk --branches=branch -- tags=tag \ svn+ssh://repo.example.com/home/repo/client/project \ gitproject
If you ’ve not done so already , at this point you want to set up the authors file as described above and either set your svn.authorsfile git configuration option or use the -- authors - file option on the following fetch command .
You can now just cd into the gitproject directory and do a git svn fetch to do the work of copying the commits .
This can take many minutes or even tens of minutes , depending on the size of your project , the speed of your disk and network connection , and so on .
Preparing the Master Repo
At this point you ’ve got a repository that includes a working copy in your gitrepo directory .
This needs to be converted to a bare repository that you will use as your master repository .
As I write this , this is n’t difficult : just move the gitrepo /.git subdirectory to the appropriate place .
3
But this is n’t guaranteed to work in the long run because the way Git stores repository information may change .
Unfortunately , at this time there ’s no “ proper ” method we can use to do this .
The Git FAQ suggests that you use git clone , but that wo n’t work in this situation because the clone will be lacking the information that git svn uses to push Git commits back into the Subversion repository .
I ’ll try to update this post if Git changes such that just moving the gitrepo /.git directory to a new name and location does n’t work .
But if you ’re reading this long after it ’s been written , be wary , and check for yourself that the renaming technique is still valid .
At any rate , for the moment we can just use mv to make the change .
Move that .git directory to the location where you want your Git master repository , under an appropriate name , and you ’re set .
If you ’re using Gitosis , the bare repo would go under the repositories directory , e.g. :
mv gitproject /.git /home/git/repositories/project.git
Before you do this , or at least before you give access to this new Git master repository to others , you may want to :
Change the permissions on your Subversion repository to be read - only for all users by adding or modifying the section for that project in the conf / authz file in the repository directory ;
Do another fetch to catch any last commits that snuck in before you did this .
Remember , it ’s vital that you never have commits in both repositories that are not in the other at the same time .
Dealing With Branches
At this point your developers now have the ability to clone the master repository , and , once cloned , switch to any of the branches imported from Subversion using the standard Git syntax :
git fetch git@repo.example.com :project.git remotes/branchname:branchname
However , there ’s one hitch : how do your users find out what the branch names are ?
They ca n’t see them in the output of git branch - a in their cloned repository , because the remote tracking branches in the master repository were n’t copied .
( The remote branches they see in that list are the local branches in the master repository . )
If they have direct ( i.e. , via a filesystem ) access to the master repository , the solution is simple ; cd to that directory and run git branch -r .
Note that the - a output may be confusing , especially if you ’re not using coloured output , because though the Subversion tracking branches are remote branches , they do not have the usual remote / prefix .
However , those who have access only via the http or git protocols ( including Gitosis users ) cannot do this .
The best solution I can think of in this case is to have someone who does have such access run git branch -r and commit the output of it as a file in the repository , perhaps called / Branches .4
Updating the Subversion Repository
If you ’ve reached this point , you ’ve now switched to Git. Congratulations !
However , even if you never switch back , it may be useful to keep your Subversion repository up to date with the new commits coming in to your Git master repository .
This is simple enough to do with a git svn dcommit , but there ’s a catch : you ca n’t use this from a bare repository .
( dcommit requires a clean working copy for its operations . )
But creating a repository with a working copy from a bare repository is quite simple , at least at this time and given all of the caveats listed above in “ Preparing the Master Repo . ”
Create a new directory elsewhere on your filesystem , say , gitproject , and copy the bare repository into the .git subdirectory into that .
A git reset -- hard in that directory will make the working copy files re-appear , and then a git svn dcommit will push the new commits back into the Subversion repository .
If you ’re doing this on a regular basis in order to keep a read - only copy of the Subversion repository available , you ’ll probably want to use rsync to quickly synchronize the bare repository with gitproject /. git before you do the dcommit .
You may also be able to skip the reset -- hard step ; I ’ve not checked to see what dcommit does in these circumstances .
Going Back ( and Forth )
If you decide you want to revert a project back to using Subversion as the master repository , set the permissions for your Git master repository to read - only , perform the procedure above , and set the permissions for your Subversion repository read - write .
We ’ve put together a compilation album with the hit songs of each one of the artists promoted on FrostWire and FrostClick to add up to the first million downloads .
All the music in this compilation available for free or under creative commons by these 21 wonderful artists .
Their music has been distributed through the BitTorrent and Gnutella networks with FrostWire .
World Class Music Experience
In November 2008 we came up with the idea to team up with FrostWire to really go after world class content creators that were willing to share their work for free .
At the beginning the search was hard , we had to come up with a series of requirements so that we could guarantee great quality content and it quickly became the rule of thumb that if the entire team would have their music in our portable mp3 players that was a strong sign that the artist should be promoted .
This compilation brings you the best of the best in free music that the FrostClick Team came across during the first months of 2009 .
In only 21 weeks we had our first 1,000,000 copies distributed , some artists reaching over 75 thousand downloads during their promotion ( 7 to 10 days ) , nowadays FrostWire artists can get over 100 thousand downloads during their runs on the FrostWire welcome screen .
Virtual Booklet
After years of buying hundreds of CDs and many times being frustrated with lousy CD Booklets ( no lyrics , no cool pictures ) we decided you should not suffer the same disappointment with our compilation .
You ’re not only going to download a compilation with high quality mp3 hits , but you will get a Virtual Booklet with 44 high resolution pages which you can decide to print , or see with your favorite image viewer ( you can even redistribute them since the art is all licensed under Creative Commons as well )
For each artist we ’ve included 2 high resolution booklet pages with information about the artist , song , license , number of downloads , facts and where available we ’ve even put the lyrics of the song to sing along .
A web page ( booklet.html ) has been included at the root of the compilation folder , you can open it to see the booklet in a very convenient way .
Images will automatically adjust their sizes to your web browser window , an they ’re presented in pairs , on the left the artist on the right : song lyrics , interviews or important facts about the artist .
The compilation booklet also includes some of the best photos sent by FrostWire users , featuring FrostWire inspired Art and pictures of the FrostWire Stickers all over the world .
The Booklet has been created keeping in mind the standard size of the regular CD Booklets in case you wish to print for a physical CD .
You can try a low resolution preview of the booklet .
Download Numbers
FrostWire FrostClick promotions have now totaled over 1,725,000 downloads and a second compilation album is already on its way .

On New Year ’s day , Peter Steinfels posted his last “ Beliefs ” column for the New York Times .
Reviewing twenty years of occasional commentary , he reflected on the polarization of American religious rhetoric :
Not only abortion and older questions of public morality and church - state relations , recently heightened by the political mobilization of conservative believers , but also newer issues like embryonic stem - cell research , physician - assisted suicide , and same - sex marriage , have pitted significant elements of traditional Christianity , Judaism , Islam and other faiths against leading voices of political and cultural liberalism .
I do n’t know whether Steinfels is right about increasing polarization across all traditions and topics .
It ’s as much as I can do to keep up with Christian debates around sex .
But I can see that Steinfels gets one thing right , if unintentionally .
He deploys the most familiar rhetorical device from the last two decades of church debates : the fight is between “ significant elements of traditional Christianity ” and “ political and cultural liberalism . ”
Religious tradition against secular liberalism : Steinfels ’ neat divide has been immensely useful for those on the “ traditional ” side .
Of course , the division is also misleading — to use no stronger word .
It depends on two sleights - of - hand .
First , Steinfels has to forget that “ significant elements ” of Christianity hold , often for traditional reasons , that same - sex marriage is religiously justified — indeed , that refusing it constitutes a religious fault .
Then Steinfels has to ignore all the ways in which current “ traditional ” positions are n’t traditional at all .
The first trick is easier to catch than the second .
While there are of course figures who criticize church teachings on “ cultural and political ” grounds , there have been for half a century now dozens of theological and historical writers in favor of changing those teachings .
Those writers do n’t take themselves to be resorting to secular principles to make their arguments .
Indeed , they have frequently been critical of social views toward gender and sexuality .
Take Sherwin Bailey , who published Homosexuality and the Western Christian Tradition more than fifty years ago — thirty years before Steinfels began his column .
As a writer and church lecturer , Bailey helped lead the Church of England to review its teaching on homosexuality .
An Anglican priest , a pastor , and a historian , he had theological reasons for thinking the churches should change their teaching on sex , some of them drawn from new medical or psychological discoveries .
But he also knew — he meticulously argued — that “ traditional ” church teachings on sex had themselves been cobbled together over centuries out of dubious material : misreadings of biblical passages , undisguised social prejudices , fantasies masquerading as science .
When “ significant elements ” of the Church of England began to change their view on homosexuality , it was n’t because they wanted to throw over religious tradition in order to embrace some passing secular trend .
It was because they had been led , for religious reasons , to reexamine what was being claimed as traditional .
Bailey ’s story has been repeated many times in the last fifty years .
It ’s impossible even to summarize all the teaching , writing , and preaching that has gone into distinguishing the core of Christian traditions from their accretions and deformations .
What we are living through is not a fight between a pristine Christianity and the encroaching world , but a divide within Christianity over what exactly should count as tradition .
It is n’t a fight between religious conservatives and activist revolutionaries .
It is a deep disagreement inside Christianity over what conserving faithfulness means .
You would n’t know this reading Steinfels ’ description of our recent debates .
To be fair , he is hardly alone .
Most reporting of religious debates over sexuality , whether in the Times or on the wire services , assumes the same division — or performs the same sleights - of - hand .
When self - proclaimed “ traditional ” voices are quoted against same - sex marriage , they are allowed to claim scriptural evidence , church history , and even the name “ Christian . ”
When other Christian clergy or believers are quoted in support of same - sex marriage , they become “ activists ” who are allowed only to speak about civil rights or fairness or — sometimes — wispy Christian principles , but not about scripture or church history or faith itself .
I used to think that this was the fault of progressives — that we reverted too often to the bland language of fairness , toleration , or rights .
So I tried always to give reporters scriptural and historical arguments .
They rarely found their way into print .
I wondered whether the forced simplification of religious journalism had a built - in bias for obvious , “ literal ” readings of scripture .
Or whether the need to tell a story — to sell a story — drove reporters back to the familiar plot : venerable belief versus modern liberalism .
So I began to experiment with saying very traditional religious things in interviews .
“ I support ordaining openly lesbian and gay candidates because that ’s where I ’m led when I study scripture and pray . ”
“ My belief in incarnation pushes me toward the blessing of same - sex unions . ”
The reaction was mostly awkward silence .
I could hear the typing stop at the other end of the line .
So I decided to attack the assumed familiar plot directly — to go after the division , enshrined by Steinfels , between tradition and innovation .
I began to tell reporters what I fully believe : no present church position on sexuality would be recognizable to Christian writers of two hundred years ago — much less two millennia ago .
Part of the reason is that the basic terms and psychological models have changed astonishingly in the last century .
All Christian writers , even the most “ traditional , ” assume the existence of things ( like “ sexuality ” ) and mechanisms ( like the unconscious ) that are neither scriptural nor traditional .
But the more striking difference is the scope contemporary “ traditionalists ” give to sexual pleasure in marriage .
Evangelical writers famous for attacking homosexuality write pillow books for Christian newlyweds advocating sexual techniques that church traditions classify as unchaste and unnatural — indeed , as acts of sodomy .
What Steinfels and many other journalists label “ traditional Christianity ” is , when it comes to sex , actually an all too modern selection and rearrangement of a few old elements detached from the contexts and practices that gave them meaning .
The claim for tradition amounts to repeating a few old formulas of condemnation , while the other teaching drops away .
This is n’t a tradition .
This is violently selective repetition — an ongoing revenge on tradition .
No reporter has yet bought my story .
I do n’t expect that Steinfels would .
But I am bold enough to suggest — to plead — that he use at least a little of his new leisure to reconsider the storyline he ’s been following for the last twenty years .
It ’s not a story about the debate so much as a position within it .
GRANBY , Colo . --
The death of the mother of New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees has been ruled a suicide .
Mina Brees , an attorney from Austin , Texas , died Aug. 7 while visiting Colorado .
Grand County coroner Brenda Bock concluded this week that the 59 - year - old Brees died of a prescription drug overdose and ruled the death a suicide .
Bock said Brees died while staying at the home of a friend in Granby near Rocky Mountain National Park .
It took longer than three months for autopsy results to be released , but Bock said that 's typical for cases involving toxicology tests .
The Austin American Statesman reported that three days before Brees died , the Texas attorney general 's office subpoenaed her business records .
She had allegedly sent letters to some restaurants in Austin and Houston stating that they had lost their rights to use their names to a company she represented , Chicksports , but they could win the rights back by paying up to $ 25,000 .
She was also the president of Chicksports but that was n't mentioned in the letter .
Relations between Drew Brees and his mother were strained at times and the quarterback asked her to stop using his picture in TV commercials touting her candidacy for a Texas appeals court seat in 2006 .
Mina Brees said she had not anticipated upsetting her son and sent out replacement commercials omitting mention of him .
At the time , Drew Brees called his relationship with his mother " nonexistent , " saying it crumbled six years earlier when he refused to hire her as his agent .
Austin attorney Marty Akins , the brother of Mina Brees , declined comment late Friday .
KANSAS CITY ( Reuters ) -
If you recently tweeted about how you were chillaxin for the holiday , take note : Fifteen particularly over - or mis-used words and phrases have been declared “ shovel - ready ” to be “ unfriended ” by a U.S. university ’s annual list of terms that deserve to be banned .
A Twitter page is displayed on an Apple iPhone in Los Angeles October 13 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Mario Anzuoni
After thousands of nominations of words and phrases commonly used in marketing , media , technology and elsewhere , wordsmiths at Lake Superior State University on Thursday issued their 35th annual list of words that they believe should be banned .
Tops on the Michigan university ’s list of useless phrases was “ shovel - ready . ”
The term refers to infrastructure projects that are ready to break ground and was popularly used to describe road , bridge and other construction projects fueled by stimulus funds from the Obama administration .
And speaking of stimulus , that word -- which was applied to government spending aimed at boosting the economy -- made the over - used category as well , along with an odd assortment of Obama - related constructions such as Obamacare and Obamanomics .
“ We say Obamanough already , ” the LSSU committee said .
Also ripe for exile is “ sexting , ” shorthand for sexy text messaging , a habit that has caused trouble this year for public figures from politicians to star athletes .
Similarly , list makers showed distaste for tweeting , retweeting and tweetaholics , lingo made popular by users of the popular Twitter networking website .
And do n’t even get them started on the use of friend as a verb , as in : “ He made me mad so I unfriended him on Facebook , ” an Internet social site .
Male acquaintances need to find another word than “ bromance ” for their friendships , and the combination of “ chillin ” and “ relaxin ’ ” into “ chillaxin ” was an easy pick for banishment .
VOTED OUT
Also making the list was “ teachable moment . ”
“ This phrase is used to describe everything from potty - training to politics .
It ’s time to vote it out ! ” said one list contributor .
“ Toxic assets , ” referring to financial instruments that have plunged in value , sickened list makers so much the phrase was added to the list , along with the tiresome and poorly defined “ too big to fail ” which has often been invoked to describe wobbly U.S. banks .
Similarly , “ in these economic times ” was deemed overdue for banishment due .
Also making the list -- “ transparent / transparency , ” typically used , contributors said , when the situation is anything but transparent .
One list contributor wanted to know if there was an “ app , ” short - hand for “ application ” popularized by the mobile iPhone ’s growing array of software tools , for making that annoying word go away .
And rounding out the list -- “ czar ” as in car czar , drug czar , housing czar or banished word czar .
“ Purging our language of ‘ toxic assets ’ is a ‘ stimulus ’ effort that ’s ‘ too big to fail , ’ ” said a university spokesman .
If you are looking for a superior text editor , your search might just begin and end with a nifty program called “ Geany . ”
One of my biggest concerns when I switched from Microsoft Windows to Linux was finding an adequate replacement for my favorite text editor .
For years , I used a commercial program called “ TextPad , ” but it was a Windows - only product , so my search began .
Geany is a text editor using the GTK2 toolkit with basic features of an integrated development environment .
( click image to enlarge )
I had no problem switching my word processor preference from Microsoft Word to Open Office.org ’s package .
That provided a nearly identical suite of programs for word processing , spreadsheets and PowerPoint - type presentations .
However , much of the writing I do does not require a full - fledged word processing program .
I use the OpenOffice Writer for printed versions of my work , but the right text editor can provide a more convenient writing platform for personal notes and posting assignments with editors via the Internet .
Enter GeanyTo be perfectly accurate , Geany is not a text editor per se .
It was actually developed by its project contributors to provide a small and fast integrated development environment ( IDE ) with a dependency on only a few libraries so it would run on any Linux distribution without a lot of technical hand - holding .
As an IDE , Geany is a software application that provides comprehensive tools for programmers for software development .
It is open source ; its code is licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public License .
Included in Geany ’s feature set is a source code editor , a compiler , and other such programming tools .
Not being a programmer , I simply let these features hide behind the very simple user interface .
Geany ’s UI is a perfect environment for composing text and organizing paragraphs , in much the same way that a programmer works with writing code .
It gives me all the functions available in a full - fledged word processor without the feature bloat and complexity that get in the way of note - taking and wordsmithing .
Unusual Find
Linux is home to at least a dozen commonly used text editors , but these are mostly lightweight reincarnations that have very little in the way of distinguishing features .
Whether the intended use is writing code or composing content , programs such as Leafpad , Zedit and Medit are of little use for much more than basic note entries .
By comparison , Geany is a heavyweight , despite its small size and simple user interface .
For me , one of its two most critical features is not found in even most word processors — split screen , both vertically or horizontally .
And the spellcheck module eliminates the usual workaround of loading a completed text file into a word processor program .
A Closer Look
Geany is a text editor using the GTK2 toolkit .
This is a library to build graphical user interfaces ( GUIs ) that was originally developed for the X Window functionality in Linux OSes .
Since Geany only requires the GTK2 runtime libraries , it can be used in multiple Linux environments running the KDE or GNOME desktop environments .
Like most open source software , Geany ’s detailed documentation file is available on the Web site .
But unlike many open source products , Geany ’s how - to - use - it file is very complete and easy to use .
Mutual Aid
Getting user help , though , can be a bit daunting for newbies .
Geany ’s users and developers communicate via mailing lists .
Relying on mailing lists for support is a throwback to the earlier days of computing .
An easier approach is user forums .
Still , the Geany Web site also provides a good starting set of information in its FAQ ( Frequently Asked Questions ) section .
Flexible Installs
Geany runs on Linux , FreeBSD , NetBSD , OpenBSD , MacOS X , AIX v5.3 , Solaris Express and Windows — but the Windows port of Geany is missing some features .
Geany for Windows is available in a portable version for USB sticks .
Linux versions , though , do not run the portable version .
Geany for the MacOS X is available here .
Some Experience Needed
Installing Geany is usually uncomplicated .
If the target Linux distribution includes the Geany package in its software distribution manager , all is good .
If not , you can get it here — but this is likely where newbies will run into some trouble .
The downloaded file is compressed .
Besides uncompressing it , you may have to compile the results so it can be used by your particular Linux flavor .
Newcomers to Linux can find specific details on how to do this by checking with the users forums on the Internet for their particular Linux distribution .
Third - Party Packages
Chances are , you use one of these Linux distributions .
If so , you can grab Geany from the resident package management system and install it sweat - free :
ArchLinuxAltLinuxCentosCruxDebianFedoraFreeBSDGentooMandrivaNetBSDOpenBSDOpenSolarisPardusPuppy LinuxSlackwareSlaxSolarisSolarisExpressSourceMageSuseUbuntu
A Composing Gem
Geany lets me compose text with the same efficiency that I loved in the Windows TextPad program .
Many of these functions are equally suitable for those writing code .
For instance , setting the preferences option to load the list of files from the last session keeps all of my current projects on the screen every time I load Geany .
I can configure Geany to place each file in a tab , much like tabbed browsing .
Placing the pointer on any tab and spinning the mouse wheel cycles through the list of open documents .
Other Gems
Geany also allows two sidebars to show bookmarks and a file list .
Clicking on a file name lets me jump to that text file .
Maybe not so important to code writers is the word - count feature .
This to me is indispensable .
I can get a word count of the entire document or just the highlighted section .
A plug - in manager feature in the Tools drop - down menu provides additional features such as auto - saving files and adding a file browser tab to the sidebar .
Closing Thoughts
When I used Microsoft Windows , I was happy to pay for TextPad to get all of its hard - core features beyond what the free shareware version offered .
Now that I am an avowed Linux user , I am even happier to have replaced my prized Windows TextPad text editor with Linux ’s Geany for free .
That is one of the real beauties about open source software .
Geany comes with top - of - the - line features often not available in less accommodating Linux text editors .
The Graun is reporting that some of the climate scientists at the centre of the email scandal have received abusive emails .
Yuk .
I hate it when people behave like this .
I laughed though when I read David Appell 's coverage of the story :
A society in which anyone , but especially scientists , are not free to express their findings , thoughts , and opinions ( regardless of what they are ) without being threatened by death is a society which no longer respect freedom , reason , rationality , or decency .
It goes without saying that hounding them out of their jobs or closing journals to them is quite acceptable ( if they are sceptics of course ) , but abusive emails , no .
Free speech goes for people you disagree with too .
( As a footnote , now we know that the break - in suffered by Andrew Weaver was a misleading piece of spin ( the breakin was a year ago , during a spate of such incidents at the university ) I think I would like to see these abusive emails . )
Blondes are more aggressive than brunettes ' because they attract more male attention '
After years of being the butt of jokes about being dumb , blondes may be having the last laugh after all , research has revealed .
An academic study has found that women with fair hair are more aggressive and confident than brunettes or redheads .
This is because blondes attract more attention than other women as they are generally viewed by men as more attractive and so are used to getting their own way , the researchers claim .
Platinum lining :
Their blonde hair may have set Celebrity Big Brother contestant Ivan Trump and underwear businesswoman Michelle Mona 's apart
The study indicated that the more ' special ' people feel , judged by physical strength for men and looks for women , the more likely they are to get angry to reach social goals .
The theory might , perhaps , help to explain the success of businesswoman Michelle Mone , founder of the Ultimo underwear brand , and of former Olympic skier , model and current Celebrity Big Brother housemate Ivana Trump .
The experts found that even those who dye their hair blonde take on natural blondes ' attributes - which might partly explain the longevity of Dolly Parton 's career too .
The country and western singer once said : ' I 'm not offended by all the dumb blonde jokes because I know I 'm not dumb ... and I also know that I 'm not blonde . '
The study , which examined links between confidence and aggression , involved 156 female undergraduates in America .
Root of the matter : Dolly Parton has said : ' I know I am not dumb and I also know I 'm not blonde '
Aaron Sell , of the University of California , who led the research , said : ' We expected blondes to feel more entitled than other young women - this is southern California , the natural habitat of the privileged blonde .
' What we did not expect to find was how much more warlike they are than their peers on campus . '
He said he suspected that blondes exist in a ' bubble ' where they have been treated better than other people for so long they do not realise that men , in particular , are more deferential towards them than other women .
' They may not even realise they are treated like a princess , ' he said .
The study was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science .
It also found that although blondes are more aggressive , they are less likely than brunettes or redheads to get into an actual fight themselves - possibly to ensure they preserved their looks .
Evolutionary psychologist Catherine Salmon , of the University of Redlands , California , said : ' Blondes are more confident in their abilities , although the results do not necessarily support their confidence .
Unfair :
In her blonde days Ann Widdecombe said : ' People talk to me more slowly now '
' Maybe responding to their own stereotypes , brunettes tend to work harder and expect less special treatment .
‘ Women who go blonde quickly get used to the privileges of blondeness - usually male attentiveness . '
Opinions differ , however , among those who have been on both sides of the blonde divide .
Broadcaster Vanessa Feltz , who admits to dying her hair , has said : ' I become more battling when I 'm blonde .
You 're noticed more . '
But when former shadow home secretary Ann Widdecombe went blonde she noted : ' People talk to me more slowly now . '
FOCUS Online : Was macht die Super - Klasse so „ super “ ?
Und mehr noch , was macht sie zu einer „ Klasse “ ?
David Rothkopf : „ Klasse “ kann man definieren als eine Gruppe , die bestimmte Charakteristika gemein hat .
Das muss nicht heißen , dass sie alle an das Gleiche glauben oder auch sonst in irgendeiner Form monolithisch sind .
Das Gemeinsame an dieser Klasse ist das Niveau an Macht und Einfluss , das sie erreicht haben , und dass ihre Macht und ihr Einfluss globale Reichweite haben und von ihnen auch global eingesetzt werden .
Und wie für alle Klassen gilt , dass viele der Zugehörigen sich kennen , gemeinsame Interessen haben – aber manchmal auch miteinander im Konflikt sind .
FOCUS Online :
Und was macht sie so „ super “ ?
Das globale System , das keiner Steuerung durch eine Regierung unterliegt , überlässt viele Entscheidungen und Vorgaben einer kleinen Gruppe von super - mächtigen Individuen .
Diese Individuen handeln in ihrem eigenen Interesse und verstärken somit noch die ungleiche Verteilung von Einkommen und Macht , zu Lasten anderer Klassen .
Und darum finde ich den Begriff der „ Klasse “ auch angebracht , obwohl wir dachten , mit dem Ende der Sowjetunion 1991 seien auch alle Klassenfragen gelöst worden .
Sie gehen davon aus , dass diese Gruppe , in deren Hände die Geschicke der Welt liegen , etwa 6000 Personen umfasst .
Eine Zahl , die Sie in ihrem Buch als erstaunlich klein beschreiben , die aber sicher noch groß ist im Vergleich zu dem , was andere glauben .
Das Magazin „ Time “ beispielsweise begnügt sich mit einer Liste der 100 Einflussreichsten , und in die werden oft Namen hinein gepackt , die außerhalb der USA kaum noch Bedeutung haben .
Wie etwa Tony Dungy , Trainer einer Football - Mannschaft in Indianapolis ... Oder Rush Limbaugh , der nicht mehr als ein ultrarechter Spinner und Radiokommentator in den USA ist ... „ Time “ beschränkt sich auf 100 Namen , weil in einem Magazin kaum mehr unterzubringen wären , und es sucht Namen aus , mit denen man das Heft verkaufen kann .
Das kann man nicht wirklich ernst nehmen .
Aber zugegeben : Man kann 6000 Personen zur Super - Klasse zählen , oder 4000 , oder 60 000 – es kommt auf die Kriterien an , für die man sich entscheidet .
Aber im Vergleich zu den mehr als sechseinhalb Milliarden Menschen auf der Erde bleibt es ein winzig kleiner Bruchteil .
Und viel wichtiger als die Größe dieser Gruppe ist , dass es andererseits drei Milliarden Menschen auf der Welt gibt , die praktisch keinerlei Einfluss auf ihr eigenes Schicksal haben .
Welche Kriterien muss Ihrer Ansicht nach diese Super - Klasse erfüllen ?
Meine Definition ist : regelmäßige Einflussnahme auf das Leben von Millionen Menschen , über Grenzen hinweg .
Das tun zum Beispiel die führenden Politiker der mächtigen Staaten der Welt , aber vor allem auch die großen internationalen Unternehmen – mit oft sehr unterschiedlichen Leitungsstrukturen .
Rupert Murdoch verfügt in seiner News Corp. sicher über ganz andere Macht als Jeffrey Immelt an der Spitze von General Electric , wo es einen einflussreichen Aufsichtsrat gibt .
Dann muss man noch die Spitzen der Finanzwirtschaft hinzurechnen , und natürlich ein paar Hundert Leute bei den Hedgefonds und institutionellen Investoren , die das Geld anderer verwalten .
Zählen
Sie dann noch die Führer von Religionsgemeinschaften und einiger nichtstaatlicher Organisationen hinzu , dann kommen Sie sehr schnell zu einer Gruppe dieser Größenordnung .
Und welche Namen stehen auf dieser Liste ?
Das werde ich oft gefragt .
Es gibt keine Liste , denn darum geht es nicht .
Die würde sich laufend ändern , weil Namen neu hinzukommen und andere wegfallen müssen .
Aber auch so wird niemand bestreiten , dass es eine kleine Gruppe gibt , die eine ernorme Macht hat .
Und wie gelangt man in diese Top - Liga ?
Vielleicht durch regelmäßiges Erscheinen auf Veranstaltungen wie dem Weltwirtschaftsforum in Davos ?
Manche fallen in diese Super - Gruppe , weil sie etwas geleistet haben , das einmalig , tief greifend und einflussreich ist – wobei dies auch ein Terrorakt sei könnte .
Für diese Personen ist es unerheblich , ob sie nach Davos eingeladen werden oder nicht .
Aber für alle anderen ist der Zugang zu anderen Mitgliedern ihrer Elite ein großartiges Instrument , ihren Einfluss zu mehren .
Darum wollen sie in Davos oder bei der Party von Allen & Company in Sun Valley auf der Gästeliste stehen – nicht nur , weil sie dort Kontakte zu anderen Mächtigen knüpfen können , sondern weil sie dazugehören wollen .
Mit anderen Worten : Manche gehören dazu , weil sie Macht haben , wie etwa Stephen Schwarzman , Chef der milliardenschweren Investmentfirma Blackstone , andere haben Macht , weil sie dazu gehören , wie etwa der Ex-Rockmusiker und Live - Aid-Begründer Bob Geldof ?
Alle Mitglieder dieser Gruppe haben etwas gemeinsam – das geradezu monomanische Streben nach irgendeiner Art von Erfolg .
Und wenn man den Erfolg errungen hat , dann findet man sich plötzlich in einer ganz anderen
Welt mit ganz anderen Maßstäben wieder .
Schön , man könnte ein größeres
Haus haben oder noch eine Milliarde mehr – aber das brächte einem vielleicht weniger Status , als wenn man von Politikern nach seiner Meinung gefragt wird .
Trotzdem fällt es schwer , sich vorzustellen , dass etwa Stephen Schwarzman und Angelina Jolie auch nur irgendetwas gemeinsam haben .
Beide haben Einfluss auf ihre besondere
Art – aber was verbindet sie zu einer „ Klasse “ ?
Sie können sich gegenseitig nützlich sein .
Wenn Angelina Jolie sich für einen guten Zweck einsetzen will , braucht sie Leute , die Schecks dafür ausstellen können .
Und wenn Stephen Schwarzman einen Saal mit Leuten füllen muss , von denen er etwas will , braucht er jemanden , der diese Leute in den Saal lockt .
Jeder wird so zum Werkzeug des anderen .
About the author
( NewsTarget ) According to a recent Associated Press investigation , agri-giant Monsanto regularly employs business practices that not only aim to eliminate all competition , but essentially position the company as the sole proprietor of all things related to food .
While old news to many in the natural health community , the mainstream press is beginning to recognize the world domination tactics being employed by Monsanto that are slowly destroying the integrity of the global food supply .
Monsanto's genetic modification program has reached 95 percent of domestic soybean crops and 80 percent of domestic corn crops .
It has plans in the works to insert its patented genes into wheat crops as well , given U.S. farmers agree to use them this time around .
These percentages are likely even higher when considering the natural and unintended spread of pollen and seeds from these genetically - modified organisms ( GMOs ) into conventional or organic fields .
According to Neil Harl , an agricultural economist from Iowa State University , Monsanto now has patented control over 90 percent of seeds and seed genetics , a chilling notion that has far - reaching consequences .
Since the company regularly buys up independent seed companies , its competition is dwindling and the prices for its patented seeds continue to rise .
The U.S. Department of Justice ( DOJ ) and at least two state attorneys general are probing Monsanto 's contracts and agreements that many are alleging violate antitrust laws .
Everything from exerting unreasonable control on farmers who purchase its seeds to flat out lying about their benefits is under investigation .
Once a farmer agrees to use even a single Monsanto gene or seed he is essentially locked into a contract with Monsanto that is very difficult to get out of logistically .
Once the seed traits have proliferated a crop , removing it in order to revert back to a conventional seed is extremely difficult and expensive , leaving many farmers helpless to escape Monsanto 's control over them .
Monsanto's contracts also contain provisions that mandate the destruction of all seeds containing its genes if and when a seed company changes ownership , making it easy for Monsanto to buy up seed companies cheaply and eliminate all competitor participation in the bidding process .
Many seed growers and crop farmers feel cornered by Monsanto as it solidifies its control over the entire seed and crop industry .
Most have no other option but to continue using Monsanto products or else face ruin .
Unless the DOJ steps in and clamps down on Monsanto 's quest for total control , the world 's food supply may eventually be controlled by a single biotechnology corporation .

The dollar rallied against most rivals Tuesday as expectations for faster economic recovery in the U.S. fueled demand for the greenback .
The euro fell to its lowest point in three and a half months , while the dollar hit nearly a two - month peak against the yen as investors adjusted positions in year - end trading .
The greenback has strengthened ...
Burglars " leave their human rights outside " when they break in to a property , Conservative leader David Cameron has said .
He promised to strengthen the law to protect householders who exercise their " legitimate " right to self - defence when confronted by an intruder .
This would mean fewer cases were taken to court , he told the BBC .
The government said Mr Cameron 's comments amounted to a " wonderful sound bite " but " not a practical policy " .
The Tory leader has previously spoken out on the issue after TV presenter Myleene Klass complained that she was cautioned by police for waving a knife at intruders who entered her garden .
His latest comments come after businessman Munir Hussain , who was jailed for permanently injuring an intruder who attacked him and his family , was freed by the Court of Appeal .
' Threat to family ' Speaking on BBC One 's Politics Show , Mr Cameron said : " It 's to make sure that fewer cases , frankly , are taken to court , that fewer people are arrested for doing what I think is perfectly legitimate , which is to defend yourself in your own home .
" The moment a burglar steps over your threshold , and invades your property , with all the threat that gives to you , your family and your livelihood , I think they leave their human rights outside . "
Mr Cameron said that , under the Conservative proposals , householders would only face prosecution if they used " grossly disproportionate " force against a burglar .
He added : " You 're raising the bar effectively .
That will be a good step forward . "
But Lord Mandelson said : " It 's a wonderful sound bite but that 's all it is .
You know it 's not a practical policy .
" It 's not a practical principle of law that you can operate and which you say that anyone who is attempting to burgle another house , thereby renounces all their rights under the law .
What sort of country is he trying to create ?
" Of course it will receive short - term public applause from those who want to get tough on burglars , as we do in our government , but where 's the practical common sense policy thinking ? "

The Teabuggers , those pesky kids charged with a federal felony for getting into Louisiana Senator Mary Landrieu 's office under false pretences , see themselves as avant - garde Republican activists / humorists .
So why are n't they , or any other right - wingers , funny ?
On the surface it makes no sense .
Why should political ideology affect humor when it does n't affect earnings potential or charity - giving or most anything else ?
But there is no good right - slanted Onion , or Daily Show or Bill Maher and no right - wing satirist who can nail liberals like Stephen Colbert nails conservatives .
In 2007 Fox tried to launch a show to take on Comedy Central ( despite Jon Stewart , in particular , sniping across political lines ) .
The 1/2 Hour News Hour , marked by canned laughter , was described as " so heavy handed that it seems almost like self - parody , " and was quickly cancelled .
If the Teabuggers , whose idea of hilarity is at the ' dress up funny ' level of high - school skits , are the cutting edge , the new generation , then prospects are not looking good for the future either .
Maybe it 's because absurdity and hypocrisy — staples of political humor — are far more prevalent on the right .
If a family - values conservative gets caught with a wide - stance in an airport bathroom stall , or claims to be " hiking the Appalachian trail " when he's in fact schtupping the Argentinian woman , that is amusing .
When liberals cheat or lie it tends to be far more mundane .
Or it might be that comedy , like journalism , is best when it comforts the afflicted and afflicts the comfortable .
It 's certainly partly built of empathy .
ACORN , for all of its flaws , mainly works to give voice to the disenfranchised .
Sure , you can trick them and sneakily edit your reporting and make them look silly , like O'Keefe did .
But comforting the comfortable , and afflicting the afflicted just comes off as mean and nasty and smug .
See : Dennis Miller and Ann Coulter .
Coulter and Miller were a sorority girl and and frat boy — Delta Gamma and Sigma Tau Gamma respectively .
Which stands in contrast to the depressed , substance - abusing end of society that spawns many funny people .
Richard Pryor made jokes about his cock looking like a foot from all the STDs he'd caught , and about setting himself on fire while smoking crack .
We fear he would not be at all Sigma Tau Gamma material .
O'Keefe , from all we know about him , is more their stuff .
He has grown up in a wealthy bubble , in slacks and blazers from the cradle up .
That bubble is almost a prerequisite of conservatism — it 's hard to be poor , or experience poverty , and still think poor people are just lazy .
That is not to say privilege is a bar to humor or empathy , but if the toughest experience you 've had is Juanita ironing an inadequate crease into your golf pants even though you 've told her about this before , you may struggle to wield the comedy of universal experience .
Even if they have done some dumb , amusing things with their lives , conservatives are not given to self - deprecation , another shortcut to laughs .
If Rush Limbaugh joked about Oxycontin , or Bill O'Reilly made falafel gags in the same way Letterman referenced his cheating , they might be more likeable .
Perhaps in the end it 's just because , in the words of Stephen Colbert , " reality has a well - known liberal bias . "
Reality is funny .
The rest is just wearing silly costumes for Andrew Breitbart .
Los Angeles , California ( CNN ) -- Roy Edward Disney , the nephew of Walt Disney , died Wednesday after a yearlong battle with stomach cancer , according to a Walt Disney Co. spokesman .
Disney " played a key role in the revitalization of the Walt Disney Co. and Disney 's animation legacy , " the company said .
He died in a Newport Beach , California , hospital at the age of 79 .
His father -- Roy O. Disney -- co-founded the Disney entertainment business with Walt Disney in 1923 .
Roy E. Disney 's 56 - year association with the company culminated in 2003 when he stepped down as vice chairman of Disney 's board and chairman of the Disney Studio 's Animation Department .
He kept the title director emeritus and consultant in recent years , the company said .
" As head of Disney Animation , Disney helped to guide the studio to a new golden age of animation with an unprecedented string of artistic and box office successes that included ' The Little Mermaid , ' ' Beauty and the Beast , ' ' Aladdin ' and ' The Lion King , ' " the company said .
A private funeral service and cremation are planned , the company said .
His ashes will be scattered at sea , it said .
He was born in in Los Angeles seven years after his father and uncle began building the Disney empire .
His entertainment career began in 1952 -- after he attended Harvard University and Pomona College -- with a job as an assistant film editor on the " Dragnet " TV series .
He joined the family business a year later as an assistant film editor at the Walt Disney Studios .
He received two Oscar nominations .
One was as a writer and production associate on the 1959 short subject film " Mysteries of the Deep , " and the second was for his work in 2003 as executive producer of " Destino , " a film based on storyboards and original art by the iconic artist Salvador Dali .
Disney founded Shamrock Holdings , an investment company owned by the Disney family , in 1978 .
He also was an avid competitive sailor , the company said .
He held several elapsed - time records for offshore races in the Pacific Ocean , including multiple wins in the 2,225 - mile Transpac race between Hawaii and California , it said .
CNN 's Brittany Kaplan contributed to this report .
Bienvenue dans le monde merveilleux de l’effet Droste .
J’ai écumé le web à la recherche des images les plus étourdissantes .
Attention à ne pas vous faire aspirer par ces photos car déjà je vois votre tête se rapprocher toujours plus du centre de l’image , vous vous penchez en avant et votre corps s’allonge comme un spaghetti aspiré par un ouragan ?
Fermez les yeux un instant sinon vous allez être englouti .
Cette illusion dont j’ai déjà parlé méritait bien un véritable zoom .
Non ?
Pour ceux qui ne connaissent pas encore l’effet Droste , voici ce qu’il en est dit d’un point de vue historique :
L’effet Droste tire son nom d’un paquet de cacao de la compagnie du chocolatier Droste aux Pays - Bas qui montre une infirmière portant un plateau sur lequel il y a un paquet de cacao .
L’image sur ce paquet de cacao est encore une infirmière portant un plateau sur lequel il y a un paquet de cacao… ( ad infinitum ) [ CNRS ]
On peut donc dire que l’effet Droste est la capacité d’une image à contenir l’image qu’elle représente et celà , à l’infini .
Pour arriver à créer l’effet , il existe des explications mathématiques incroyables et surtout incompréhensible .
D’ailleurs , M.C. Escher s’était amusé à tenter de réaliser un tableau avec cet effet .
Hélas , n’étant pas mathématicien , il n’a jamais réussi terminé et la tâche blanche au centre n’a pu être complété qu’en 2003 grâce à une équipe de mathématiciens de l’université de Leiden .
Mais j’en ai déjà parlé ici .
Trêve de blabla , regardez un peu comme c’est hypnotisant …

Finance about Christmas gifts has claimed that PS3 ’s pads must be replaced after running out of charge .
“ It ’s all fun and games until the battery dies , ” said author Anne Kadet .
“ Unlike its competitors , which use replaceable AA batteries , the PS3 ’s remote control is glued shut .
When the battery goes , Sony customers have to blow $ 55 on a new controller . ”
You ’re right , Anne .
That really is a glaring design fault .
The frantic hole - digging continues : “ Sony says there ’s an ‘ environmental benefit ’ since gamers do n’t have to toss their batteries on a regular basis , but Isidor Buchmann , president of battery - equipment maker Cadex Electronics , says captive batteries are becoming common because it ’s cheaper for companies to eliminate the battery housing and hatch . ”
Spectacular .
Merry Christmas .
Thanks , mart .
Kirsten Dunst earns millions for a film .
But what about the actor who dubs her into Spanish ?
The world 's top voice artists tell all - in their own words
Mexico's Kirsten Dunst : Claudia Motta
I began dreaming of acting as a little girl , watching Japanese cartoons .
I fell in love with the voices .
Later I got into radio and then into dubbing - and I love it .
After I spoke Kirsten Dunst 's lines in Spider - Man , they asked me to do Mona Lisa Smile , Wimbledon , and others .
She 's a favourite in my stable of characters now , and I 'm so pleased things are going well for her in Hollywood .
I do n't imitate the actor , I get into the personality of the role .
I focus on the gestures and reflect that in my voice , even if there was no sound in the original .
I add to the drama because to dub well you have to be as good an actor , or better .
They paid me 10,000 pesos ( £ 500 ) for Mary Jane in Spider - Man .
The problem is that distributors do n't put us in the credits .
Suppose Kirsten
Dunst thought , " Gosh , how nice I sound in Spanish . "
She would n't have known who the voice belonged to .
Much of my work is for television .
I 'm best known for playing Bart Simpson for 10 years .
When different actors were brought in because of a contract dispute , the public demanded we be brought back .
Mexican dubbers mostly use a kind of neutral Spanish without accents or regional expressions so all Latin America can understand .
We have the best dubbing industry , and the competition in Argentina and Venezuela just does n't have our finesse or tradition .
Top Cat in Spanish has a personality and feeling that is missing in English - and I take my hat off to the woman who voiced the witch in Snow White .
France 's Angelina Jolie : Françoise Cadol
Sometimes my home phone will ring and when I say " hello " there will be a sharp intake of breath at the other end .
I know immediately it 's a dubbing fan who has got hold of my number .
Once a woman rang me and started gasping .
Then after a silence , she said : " Sorry , I 'm just so emotional at hearing you , I can't speak , I 'll have to call back . "
There are people in Paris who keep scrapbooks on dubbing , who collect signed photos , who know what you 've dubbed despite your name rarely appearing on the credits .
I respect people 's reasons for wanting to contact me , but I do n't send out photos .
People feel they know the voice and they want to know you .
A voice is a very moving thing .
Dubbing is taken seriously in France , and people get very upset if an actor who has dubbed a star for a long time suddenly changes .
Audiences want continuity .
I get invited on to TV shows to discuss dubbing - people are interested in the process .
I have been Angelina Jolie since Tomb Raider because I was the voice of Lara Croft in the video games .
I thought Jolie was very good in Mr and Mrs Smith - you could tell she and Brad Pitt were having a good time making that film .
I do n't seek out information on her in the celebrity mags , or follow her life at all , but I get on very well with the French actor who dubs Brad Pitt - a well - known actor in his own right .
I 'm also Gong Li , Sandra Bullock , Patricia Arquette and the voice of Mary Alice in Desperate Housewives .
I dub films because I enjoy it , it 's artistic - and it is a skill that teaches you a lot about acting .
I 'm currently writing my fourth play for my theatre company and dubbing allows me to keep on doing the work for theatre .
I 've acted in theatres all over Paris , I 've been on the TV , but the greatest irony is that I 've never actually appeared on the cinema screen .
Italy 's Renée Zellweger : Giuppy Izzo
I was born into the business .
My teacher was my father .
He had four daughters and most evenings at dinner he would try to teach us something about intonation .
He had a saying : " Your voice is the soundtrack of your life . "
One of my sisters also entered the business and is now a dubbing director as well as a dubbing artist .
It was a bit like growing up as a circus child , really .
My first job was as the 10 - year - old daughter in The Goodbye Girl .
I 've no idea how many other films I 've dubbed since then .
I 've voiced Renée Zellweger in both her Bridget Jones movies and several others .
I 've studied her diction , her movements and her breathing so much that I feel I know her .
We 've not met , though - the only actor I 've both dubbed and met is Ellen Pompeo , the star of Grey 's Anatomy .
She came up and hugged me at a conference in Milan in the summer .
The key to this profession is obsession with detail .
To get the same effects as in the original , I try , as far as I can , to imitate the actor 's movements as I say her lines .
Anyone who saw me working would think I was nuts .
I lay down on the floor for the bedroom scenes in the Bridget Jones films .
At the end of one of them , there 's a scene in which Bridget is badly out of breath .
I ran twice around the block before we recorded it .
China 's Tom Cruise : Ren Wei
Tom Cruise was my latest voice acting role , but I have played hundreds of parts since I joined the Shanghai Film Dubbing Studio in 1986 .
I was Ewan McGregor in Moulin Rouge , John Travolta in Broken Arrow , Joseph Fiennes in Enemy at the Gates , Hugh Jackman in Kate and Leopold and Vincent Perez in Fanfan la Tulipe .
But my real dream is to become a tenor .
Luciano Pavarotti is my idol and I have n't given up trying to get a role in a musical .
I have a good voice , dancing skills , and acting experience .
I just need a chance .
I guess I was chosen to voice the Tom Cruise role in Mission : Impossible III because my age and physique are similar to his .
Some people say I even look like him from a certain angle .
It was a tough job .
While Atang [ the Cantonese nickname for Tom Cruise ] had months to make the film , I had to do the whole thing - from learning the script to dubbing all the lines - in four days .
We always have to rush because of the piracy problem in China .
If we do n't get the translation and dubbing done quickly , an unauthorised version will be out on the streets before ours .
Every day I worked for at least 12 hours .
I studied Atang 's voice and tried to imitate his style of talking .
It was an action movie , so there was lots of running about and shouting , which was hard to emulate in a studio .
It was very intense and I had to cover a big range of emotions .
In the fighting scenes , it was all " Get down , get down !
Go , go ! "
Then there were romantic moments when his voice breaks up as he tells his wife how much he loves her .
I had to watch the original English version time and time again to get the feeling right .
When it was all over I was so hoarse that the director told me to go home and take a rest .
The crew cracked jokes : " Tom Cruise runs so fast he breaks his legs , Ren Wei shouts so loud he breaks his voice . "
I have never used the fact that I am Atang 's voice actor to chat up women , but I have received letters from fans who say they really like my delivery .
But that is not what is most important .
My main aim is to satisfy the original actor as much as the audience .
Germany 's Julia Roberts : Daniella Hoffmann
It all started out with the casting for Pretty Woman back in 1990 .
Back then I did n't expect it to be a big deal - more like a B - movie .
I was among the finalists and I think it was my laugh that clinched it .
I can do a good , really filthy laugh just like Julia Roberts - I love it when she laughs .
Since Pretty Woman
I 've played her in every film .
My vocal range is very like hers , so it all comes pretty naturally .
With Ally McBeal , whom I also dub , I put on a very different voice , much higher .
I do n't often get recognised as being the voice of Julia Roberts .
I think women 's voices are much harder to identify than men's .
But being Julia has definitely brought work my way .
Some adverts want the sound of " Julia Roberts " and I have also done Charlotte 's Web because it was originally Julia who did the voiceover .
When I come in to record I generally have n't seen the film I 'm going to dub .
It used to be different : we used to get the videos to take home beforehand .
But these days they are amazingly strict about new releases .
When I did a voice for Star Wars , I was n't even told in advance what film we were doing - just to turn up .
But when I play Julia Roberts I do n't need to prepare or anything .
I follow her lead .
I mean , the woman is a great actress , an Oscar - winning actress - why should I change anything about her work ?
India 's Arnold : Schwarzenegger : Pawan Kalra
I 've done most of the big names : I was Arnold in The Terminator and True Lies ; I voiced Owen Wilson in Shanghai Noon and Shanghai Knights ; and Hugh Jackman in Van Helsing .
A number of people say I look like Bruce Willis and I did Bruce as the cop in Sin City .
I think Brad Pitt is one of the finest .
I have just done him in Spy Games - a great film .
Pitt is a very fine actor who can both overplay and underplay a role .
You really have to watch how he speaks , it is fantastic .
Dubbing is an art requiring a voice of many textures and tones .
Not everybody can do it just because they have a good voice .
Voiceover artists are cast and we have writers who make the scripts fit the lip movements of the actors on screen so that it runs as smoothly as possible .
There are sometimes arguments over how to translate a single phrase .
It is hardest with black actors like Eddie Murphy and Will Smith .
They are not only very funny but they speak very , very fast .
Trying to street talk quickly in Hindi is extremely tough .
After two days your mouth gets really tired .
My brother was in the film business .
I was running my father 's transport company in Bihar , out there in the sticks .
But I had done some performances , so my brother said : come out and try .
So I did .
And here I am , eight years later .
A film for TV takes two days .
I will make 20,000 rupees ( £ 250 ) .
For theatre release it is more like 50,000 rupees ( £ 625 ) .
It 's really exploding .
I do films , commercials and TV shows now .
There are a lot more people saying " I heard you on television " these days .
But it 's a really competitive industry .
When I started there were just a few people - now everybody thinks they can voice movies .

A golf club in Northamptonshire has used the freezing weather to turn its course into a ski slope .
Instead of shutting because of snowfall , Cold Ashby Golf Club in Northampton has transformed its course into a winter fun park .
Staff have set up a portable ski lift on the grounds , which has the suitable rolling terrain for skiing .
A spokesman for the club said : " You can sometimes forget you 're not in the Alps . "
To catch a hacker , you must think like a hacker .
Security expert Andrew Whitaker explains the hacker mentality and points out how hackers combine multiple exploits to achieve their goals .
Andrew is the lead author of Chained Exploits : Advanced Hacking Attacks from Start to Finish , which teaches how attackers chain together attacks .

Nothing makes you worry more about your job security then when the network that you 're paid to secure gets hacked .
You work tirelessly to ensure that systems are patched , unnecessary services are turned off , configurations are hardened , and procedures are followed .
Here 's the problem , though :
You must be right 100 % of the time , but hackers have to be right only once .
You find yourself in the boss 's office .
" What went wrong ?
How did we get hacked ?
I thought you said that our network is secure , " he says , in a displeased tone .
With your job on the line , you try to retrace the steps of how your network was compromised .
Retracing the attacker 's steps is n't an easy task .
It 's not always as simple as naming a single vulnerability that was exploited .
Often hackers use a number of exploits that are chained together to form an attack .
When faced with incident response , you must see the attack from the attacker 's perspective .
This means looking at your network from all angles , finding openings , and tracing out how an attacker could combine multiple exploits to achieve a malicious goal .
To foil an attack , you must think like the attacker .
Missing the Obvious
Few security professionals today know how to think like an attacker .
Knowing how to install locks on your front door does n't train you in thinking like a burglar .
In the same way , knowing how to configure a firewall or other security technologies does n't train you to think like a hacker .
Too often , security professionals spend their time learning technologies , rather than learning about what they 're trying to guard against .
Which leads to this question :
How exactly do you think like an attacker ?
No one becomes a malicious attacker overnight .
It takes years of late nights in the basement gulping energy drinks , listening to progressive techno music , and writing cryptic assembly code .
Okay , maybe there 's a little more to it than that .
But not much .
Let 's examine the common characteristics of malicious hackers .
Hackers Love Technology
A hacker is someone who loves technology .
The term hack is believed to have come from the MIT Tech Model Railroad Club , where members would " hack " DEC programmed data processors to try to improve electric trains , tracks , and switches .
A similar passion for understanding and improving technology is what led to the birth of UNIX , Linux , and Apple .
Behind each of these technologies are people who are , in the true sense of the word , hackers .
Taking this idea forward to today , a malicious attacker loves technology perhaps even more than you do .
He or she knows the security products you 've implemented , beyond just configuration ; the hacker may even reverse - engineer these technologies to unmask how they really work .
Hackers Think Outside the Box
You can tell a lot about people by how they cook .
Some like to follow a recipe perfectly , using the exact amount of each ingredient and checking off steps as they go .
Others are more carefree , throwing in a splash of one ingredient and a dab of another .
This latter group is n't interested in the set recipe on the box ; they prefer to try something different , to see how it turns out .
Such is the mindset of the malicious attacker .
To use the cliché , he or she thinks " outside the box . "
This is important to remember , because while you spend time reading manuals and configuring your firewalls and servers as the vendors instruct you , the hacker is wondering what happens if a certain bit is changed in a packet , or if a particular machine instruction is incremented .
This out - of - the - box thinking extends beyond just modifying code or packets .
It 's part of the mindset of hacking .
When I perform penetration tests , my mind races with options on how I 'm going to attack my target .
If an attack fails , I have three or four other attacks ready to go .
It 's the difference between thinking linearly and viewing an attack like a massive spider web or the map of a city , with multiple ways to get from one point to another .
If one path is blocked , many others can lead me to the same destination .
Unfortunately , I seldom get the opportunity to try every avenue of attack .
A penetration test is limited in scope and time .
But someone maliciously attacking your network has all the time in the world .
To quote Benjamin Franklin , " He that can have patience can have what he will . "
If an attacker wants in badly enough , it 's just a matter of time .
Hackers Chain Attacks
In addition to loving technology and being an out - of - the - box thinker , an attacker looks for ways to chain together multiple exploits into one large attack .
On the cover of my book Chained Exploits : Advanced Hacking Attacks from Start to Finish is a picture that serves as a good visual metaphor for chained exploits :
A trail of ants carries parts of leaves up a tree trunk .
The ants work separately , but the whole group is working together to carry their food .
Each ant takes a small part of a leaf ; when combined , these parts make up the entire leaf .
The same approach is taken by skilled hackers ; rather than relying on a single attack point , they chain their exploits together to form one larger attack .
Take the following scenario as an example .
You get a call at 2 a.m. from a frantic coworker , saying that your website has been breached .
You jump out of bed , throw on some clothes , and rush down to your workplace .
When you get there , you find your manager and coworkers in a frenzy , wondering what to do .
You look at the web server and go through the logs .
Nothing sticks out .
You go to the firewall and review its logs .
You do n't see any suspicious traffic heading for your web server .
What do you do ?
I hope you said , " Step back and take a look at the bigger picture . "
There are many ways to attack a website , and some of them do n't involve attacking the web server from the Internet .
An attacker may attack a router , a backup server , a database server , and finally creep in to attack the web server .
Never assume that the attacker launched a single exploit from the Internet to your network .
A skilled attacker combines multiple exploits , which means that your job will require unwinding the chain of attacks and following the trail back to the attacker .

It ’s official : Stephen Harper ’s going to Copenhagen .
After months of noncommittal remarks and avoiding any declaration on emission reductions , Harper , realizing he was about to be left out of the big kids ’ party , followed Barack Obama ’s announcement with his own .
But while Obama — even with his lacklustre greenhouse - gas reduction targets — will be a welcome face among the tens of thousands of attendees at the all - important United Nations climate - change summit , this wo n’t be a comfortable trip for Harper .
The closer the Copenhagen talks get , the louder the cries of the international community become .
Blaming Canada has become more than a joking mantra ; it has become the battle cry of environmentalists , journalists , students , politicians , authors , and scientists around the world .
They ’re calling us names .
They ’re sick of our stunts .
They do n’t want our dirty oil , and they do n’t want our vapid politics .
Thanks to the tar sands , Canada has become climate enemy number one among industrialized countries , and most recently among the Commonwealth nations trying to oust Canada from its midst .
The bad rap started shortly after Canada ratified the Kyoto Protocol and then promptly spat in the face of the global community we ’d just made promises to , rendering what should ’ve been a binding treaty into little more than a scrap piece of paper .
Instead of curbing our emissions since then like we promised to , they ’ve skyrocketed by 34 percent above the Kyoto target for 2012 .
So it ’s no wonder that governments around the world are skeptical of our intentions .
They should be .
The tar sands are quickly replacing the seal hunt in terms of the shock and horror they inspire on the international stage .
And it ’s scary to think how far both Harper and Iggy will go to protect their precious dirty oil .
If they ’ll put seal meat on the menu at Parliament to defend the seal hunt , what will they do to defend the honour of the tar sands ?
Offer bite - sized bitumen brownies to visiting dignitaries ?
Mandate that all government vehicles must run off the bituminous sludge ?
Perhaps Her Excellency Michaí«lle Jean can take a trip downstream from the tar sands to Fort Chipewyan and eat some cancerous fish with the locals .
( See ?
It ’s just an extra eye — not so bad ! )
On November 30 , the Guardian published a brilliant if prickly article by acclaimed author and journalist George Monbiot , which bore the headline : “ Canada ’s image lies in tatters .
It is now to climate what Japan is to whaling ” .
He goes on to say : “ Canada is slipping down the development ladder ....
The price of this transition is the brutalisation of the country , and a government campaign against multilateralism as savage as any waged by George Bush . ”
Monbiot continues : “ Until now I believed that the nation that has done most to sabotage a new climate change agreement was the United States .
I was wrong .
The real villain is Canada .
Unless we can stop it , the harm done by Canada in December 2009 will outweigh a century of good works . ”
And how do we as Canadian citizens feel about this ?
Not good .
A recent survey tells us that close to 65 percent of Canadians are embarrassed by our government ’s inaction and dreading the inevitable fall - out of again being the bratty child at the table of grown - ups .
So Harper will be there .
But Greenpeace will , too .
And each time he acts like that bratty child — each time he throws a tantrum , or crosses his arms and pouts , “ I do n’t wanna ! ” — we ’ll remind him that he RSVPed to the grown - ups ’ table , and it ’s high time he acts like one .
Jessica Wilson is a media and public relations officer for Greenpeace Canada .
The title for this installment is stolen from a brilliant Canadian physical therapist named Diane Lee .
I had the pleasure of listening to her speak in 2004 and this thought process was one of the many gems I took away .
This may be confusing to many as I ’ve always advocated working at higher intensity to burn more calories and lose weight more efficiently .
Here is the problem as Diane Lee so eloquently put it .
Running is a poor choice for most people .
I often talk about the group of people I like to call the “ speed limpers ” .
They are the men and women you often drive by on the road that are running with a visible limp .
Usually they have a knee sleeve of some kind on .
When you ask them about their problem they will almost always reply “ it loosens up after a while and then I ice and take some Advil after ” .
What a lousy idea .
Guess what , good exercise should make you tired but , should n’t hurt your joints .
The discomfort should be limited to the muscles and should go away almost immediately after you are done .
In my opinion running is only good for doctors and physical therapists .
We have an entire cottage industry built up to take care of the injuries caused by running .
The reality is that most people are not made to run .
More importantly , they are particularly not made to run long distances .
Until the Cooper led aerobics craze of the seventies many of us did n’t know what a plantar fascia , iliotibial band or patella - femoral joint was .
Most of us in the industry do now .
We know because these are just a few of the litany of sites of injury afflicting runners .
More bad news .
Running is even worse for women .
Women runners seem to to sustain more running related injuries than men .
My recommendation .
High intensity exercise is best done on a bike .
The best bikes are the Schwinn AirDyne dual action bikes .
They are the best work tools on the planet for fitness .
Not surprisingly most people who ever ridden an AirDyne hate it .
Do you know why ?
Because it is really hard and nearly impossible to cheat .
You ca n’t slump over or lean on the handle bars .
I know this will anger the runners .
The truth is I ’m not trying to stop runners from running .
I ’m just trying to stop fitness enthusiasts from needlessly hurting themselves .

A person ’s will is a very important document .
It lets the world know what to do with their possessions , and in some cases it can go a long way until one determines how someone would like to be remembered after they ’re gone .
As the following examples indicate , it seems like some people just want to be known for being extremely weird .
1 .
Charles Vance Millar
Millar was a Canadian lawyer and investor who died in 1926 .
He was known for having a good sense of humor and a love for practical jokes , and his will reflects this .
It contained all sorts of strange and funny requests , such as leaving a vacation house in Jamaica in the joint custody of three people that he knew hated each other .
But Millar ’s will is most famous for the final clause , where he stated that the cash value of his very large estate would be given to the woman who gave birth to the most children in a span of ten years .
This set off the so called Great Stork Derby , where numerous women from Toronto , apparently with nothing better to do , tried to win the prize .
The Supreme Court tried to have the whole thing struck down , but Millar , with his law experience , had made the contest pretty much bullet - proof .
Four women eventually split the title , taking home $ 125,000 each .
And all they had to do was give birth to and raise nine children !

Jeremy Bentham
Bentham is already famous for being an extremely influential philosopher and for playing an important part in the creation of University College London , but his will gave him no small claim to fame either .
Dyeing in 1832 , Bentham ’s final wish was for his body to be dissected in public as a part of a lecture on anatomy .
OK , that ’s pretty strange , but really he just donated his body to science .
But that was n’t all , after that was done he wanted his skeleton and head to be preserved and stored in a display cabinet .
Yeah , he was weird .
The so called “ Auto - icon ” was built by stuffing the skeleton with hay and dressing it in Bentham ’s clothes .
It was originally kept by one of his close friends ( really , what says friendship better than keeping your dead buddy ’s body preserved in your house ? ) but it eventually came into the ownership of University College London .
It ’s on public display , although with a wax head because the real one is under lock and key after being the subject of numerous and without doubt some very strange students ’ pranks .
They even took Bentham ’s body out to “ participate ” in key staff meetings .
It seems that nothing adds to staff morale like forcing everyone to sit next to a skeleton for a couple of hours .

People tend to leave most of their belongings to family members when they die , but there are exceptions to this rule , of course .
Sometimes the family members do n’t get along well , or there is something about their way of life that is n’t approved of .
That ’s why T.M.
Zink ’s wife and daughter were pretty much left out of Zink ’s 1930 will : they had an unfortunate and undesirable characteristic , as Mr Zink saw it .
Specifically , they were women .
Yes , it appears T.M. Zink , despite marrying and fathering a daughter , was a misogynist .
He bequeathed his daughter five bucks and his wife absolutely nothing , which left tens of thousands of dollars to be put into a trust fund .
There , it would sit for 75 years before the wealth , that had accumulated , would be used to create the Zink Womanless Library .
No books by women would be allowed to grace its shelves , no art by women on the walls , and no furniture by women for men to sit on .
It was even going to have a “ No Women Admitted ” sign on the front door , so it was sort of a combination higher learning centre and juvenile tree house .
But it was not to be , as Zink ’s daughter began a legal battle .
The court realised Zink ’s idea was irrational and the money was given to her .
We do n’t know what happened next , but it would have been nice if she had used it to build the T.M. Zink Can Suck It Library .

Opinion of Stevens , J .
SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
CITIZENS UNITED , APPELLANT v. FEDERAL
ELECTION COMMISSION
on appeal from the united states district court for the district of columbia
Justice Stevens , with whom Justice Ginsburg , Justice Breyer , and Justice Sotomayor join , concurring in part and dissenting in part .
The real issue in this case concerns how , not if , the appellant may finance its electioneering .
Citizens United is a wealthy nonprofit corporation that runs a political action committee ( PAC ) with millions of dollars in assets .
Under the Bipartisan Campaign Reform
Act of 2002 ( BCRA ) , it could have used those assets to televise and promote Hillary : The Movie wherever and whenever it wanted to .
It also could have spent unrestricted sums to broadcast Hillary at any time other than the 30 days before the last primary election .
Neither Citizens United ’s nor any other corporation ’s speech has been “ banned , ” ante , at 1 .
All that the parties dispute is whether Citizens United had a right to use the funds in its general treasury to pay for broadcasts during the 30 - day period .
The notion that the First Amendment dictates an affirmative answer to that question is , in my judgment , profoundly misguided .
Even more misguided is the notion that the Court must rewrite the law relating to campaign expenditures by for - profit corporations and unions to decide this case .
The basic premise underlying the Court ’s ruling is its iteration , and constant reiteration , of the proposition that the First Amendment bars regulatory distinctions based on a speaker ’s identity , including its “ identity ” as a corporation .
While that glittering generality has rhetorical appeal , it is not a correct statement of the law .
Nor does it tell us when a corporation may engage in electioneering that some of its shareholders oppose .
It does not even resolve the specific question whether Citizens United may be required to finance some of its messages with the money in its PAC .
The conceit that corporations must be treated identically to natural persons in the political sphere is not only inaccurate but also inadequate to justify the Court ’s disposition of this case .
In the context of election to public office , the distinction between corporate and human speakers is significant .
Although they make enormous contributions to our society , corporations are not actually members of it .
They can not vote or run for office .
Because they may be managed and controlled by nonresidents , their interests may conflict in fundamental respects with the interests of eligible voters .
The financial resources , legal structure , and instrumental orientation of corporations raise legitimate concerns about their role in the electoral process .
Our lawmakers have a compelling constitutional basis , if not also a democratic duty , to take measures designed to guard against the potentially deleterious effects of corporate spending in local and national races .
The majority ’s approach to corporate electioneering marks a dramatic break from our past .
Congress has placed special limitations on campaign spending by corporations ever since the passage of the Tillman Act in 1907 , ch. 420 , 34 Stat. 864 .
We have unanimously concluded that this “ reflects a permissible assessment of the dangers posed by those entities to the electoral process , ” FEC v. National Right to Work Comm . , 459 U. S. 197 , 209 ( 1982 ) ( NRWC ) , and have accepted the “ legislative judgment that the special characteristics of the corporate structure require particularly careful regulation , ” id. , at 209 –210 .
The Court today rejects a century of history when it treats the distinction between corporate and individual campaign spending as an invidious novelty born of Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce , 494 U. S. 652 ( 1990 ) .
Relying largely on individual dissenting opinions , the majority blazes through our precedents , overruling or disavowing a body of case law including FEC v. Wisconsin Right to Life , Inc. , 551 U. S. 449 ( 2007 ) ( WRTL ) , McConnell v. FEC , 540 U. S. 93 ( 2003 ) , FEC v. Beaumont , 539 U. S. 146 ( 2003 ) , FEC v. Massachusetts Citizens for Life , Inc. , 479 U. S. 238 ( 1986 ) ( MCFL ) , NRWC , 459 U. S. 197 , and California Medical Assn. v. FEC , 453 U. S. 182 ( 1981 ) .
In his landmark concurrence in Ashwander v. TVA , 297 U. S. 288 , 346 ( 1936 ) , Justice Brandeis stressed the importance of adhering to rules the Court has “ developed … for its own governance ” when deciding constitutional questions .
Because departures from those rules always enhance the risk of error , I shall review the background of this case in some detail before explaining why the Court ’s analysis rests on a faulty understanding of Austin and McConnell and of our campaign finance jurisprudence more generally .
1 I regret the length of what follows , but the importance and novelty of the Court ’s opinion require a full response .
Although I concur in the Court ’s decision to sustain BCRA ’s disclosure provisions and join Part IV of its opinion , I emphatically dissent from its principal holding .
I
The Court ’s ruling threatens to undermine the integrity of elected institutions across the Nation .
The path it has taken to reach its outcome will , I fear , do damage to this institution .
Before turning to the question whether to overrule Austin and part of McConnell , it is important to explain why the Court should not be deciding that question .
Scope of the Case
The first reason is that the question was not properly brought before us .
In declaring § 203 of BCRA facially unconstitutional on the ground that corporations ’ electoral expenditures may not be regulated any more stringently than those of individuals , the majority decides this case on a basis relinquished below , not included in the questions presented to us by the litigants , and argued here only in response to the Court ’s invitation .
This procedure is unusual and inadvisable for a court .
2
Our colleagues ’ suggestion that “ we are asked to reconsider Austin and , in effect , McConnell , ” ante , at 1 , would be more accurate if rephrased to state that “ we have asked ourselves ” to reconsider those cases .
In the District Court , Citizens United initially raised a facial challenge to the constitutionality of § 203 .
App. 23 a–24a .
In its motion for summary judgment , however , Citizens United expressly abandoned its facial challenge , 1:07 –cv–2240–RCL–RWR , Docket Entry No. 52 , pp. 1 –2 ( May 16 , 2008 ) , and the parties stipulated to the dismissal of that claim , id . , Nos. 53 ( May 22 , 2008 ) , 54 ( May 23 , 2008 ) , App. 6 a .
The District Court therefore resolved the case on alternative grounds , 3 and in its jurisdictional statement to this Court , Citizens United properly advised us that it was raising only “ an as - applied challenge to the constitutionality of … BCRA § 203 . ” Juris .
Statement 5 . The jurisdictional statement never so much as cited Austin , the key case the majority today overrules .
And not one of the questions presented suggested that Citizens United was surreptitiously raising the facial challenge to § 203 that it previously agreed to dismiss .
In fact , not one of those questions raised an issue based on Citizens United ’s corporate status .
Juris .
Statement ( i ) .
Moreover , even in its merits briefing , when Citizens United injected its request to overrule Austin , it never sought a declaration that § 203 was facially unconstitutional as to all corporations and unions ; instead it argued only that the statute could not be applied to it because it was “ funded overwhelmingly by individuals . ”
Brief for Appellant 29 ; see also id. , at 10 , 12 , 16 , 28 ( affirming “ as applied ” character of challenge to § 203 ) ; Tr. of Oral Arg. 4–9 ( Mar. 24 , 2009 ) ( counsel for Citizens United conceding that § 203 could be applied to General Motors ) ; id. , at 55 ( counsel for Citizens United stating that “ we accept the Court ’s decision in Wisconsin Right to Life ” ) .
“ ‘ It is only in exceptional cases coming here from the federal courts that questions not pressed or passed upon below are reviewed , ’ ” Youakim v. Miller , 425 U. S. 231 , 234 ( 1976 ) ( per curiam ) ( quoting Duignan v. United States , 274 U. S. 195 , 200 ( 1927 ) ) , and it is “ only in the most exceptional cases ” that we will consider issues outside the questions presented , Stone v. Powell , 428 U. S. 465 , 481 , n. 15 ( 1976 ) .
The appellant in this case did not so much as assert an exceptional circumstance , and one searches the majority opinion in vain for the mention of any .
That is unsurprising , for none exists .
Setting the case for reargument was a constructive step , but it did not cure this fundamental problem .
Essentially , five Justices were unhappy with the limited nature of the case before us , so they changed the case to give themselves an opportunity to change the law .
As -Applied and Facial Challenges
This Court has repeatedly emphasized in recent years that “ [ f] acial challenges are disfavored . ”
Washington State Grange v. Washington State Republican Party , 552 U. S. 442 , 450 ( 2008 ) ; see also Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood of Northern New Eng. , 546 U. S. 320 , 329 ( 2006 ) ( “ [ T ] he ‘ normal rule ’ is that ‘ partial , rather than facial , invalidation is the required course , ’ such that a ‘ statute may … be declared invalid to the extent that it reaches too far , but otherwise left intact ’ ” ( quoting Brockett v. Spokane Arcades , Inc. , 472 U. S. 491 , 504 ( 1985 ) ; alteration in original ) ) .
By declaring § 203 facially unconstitutional , our colleagues have turned an as - applied challenge into a facial challenge , in defiance of this principle .
This is not merely a technical defect in the Court ’s decision .
The unnecessary resort to a facial inquiry “ run[s ] contrary to the fundamental principle of judicial restraint that courts should neither anticipate a question of constitutional law in advance of the necessity of deciding it nor formulate a rule of constitutional law broader than is required by the precise facts to which it is to be applied . ”
Washington State Grange , 552 U. S. , at 450 ( internal quotation marks omitted ) .
Scanting that principle “ threaten [s ] to short circuit the democratic process by preventing laws embodying the will of the people from being implemented in a manner consistent with the Constitution . ”
Id. , at 451 .
These concerns are heightened when judges overrule settled doctrine upon which the legislature has relied .
The Court operates with a sledge hammer rather than a scalpel when it strikes down one of Congress ’ most significant efforts to regulate the role that corporations and unions play in electoral politics .
It compounds the offense by implicitly striking down a great many state laws as well .
The problem goes still deeper , for the Court does all of this on the basis of pure speculation .
Had Citizens United maintained a facial challenge , and thus argued that there are virtually no circumstances in which BCRA § 203 can be applied constitutionally , the parties could have developed , through the normal process of litigation , a record about the actual effects of § 203 , its actual burdens and its actual benefits , on all manner of corporations and unions .
4 “ Claims of facial invalidity often rest on speculation , ” and consequently “ raise the risk of premature interpretation of statutes on the basis of factually barebones records . ”
Id. , at 450 ( internal quotation marks omitted ) .
In this case , the record is not simply incomplete or unsatisfactory ; it is nonexistent .
Congress crafted BCRA in response to a virtual mountain of research on the corruption that previous legislation had failed to avert .
The Court now negates Congress ’ efforts without a shred of evidence on how § 203 or its state - law counterparts have been affecting any entity other than Citizens United .
5
Faced with this gaping empirical hole , the majority throws up its hands .
Were we to confine our inquiry to Citizens United ’s as - applied challenge , it protests , we would commence an “ extended ” process of “ draw[ing ] , and then redraw[ing ] , constitutional lines based on the particular media or technology used to disseminate political speech from a particular speaker . ”
Ante , at 9 .
While tacitly acknowledging that some applications of § 203 might be found constitutional , the majority thus posits a future in which novel First Amendment standards must be devised on an ad hoc basis , and then leaps from this unfounded prediction to the unfounded conclusion that such complexity counsels the abandonment of all normal restraint .
Yet it is a pervasive feature of regulatory systems that unanticipated events , such as new technologies , may raise some unanticipated difficulties at the margins .
The fluid nature of electioneering communications does not make this case special .
The fact that a Court can hypothesize situations in which a statute might , at some point down the line , pose some unforeseen as - applied problems , does not come close to meeting the standard for a facial challenge .
6
The majority proposes several other justifications for the sweep of its ruling .
It suggests that a facial ruling is necessary because , if the Court were to continue on its normal course of resolving as - applied challenges as they present themselves , that process would itself run afoul of the First Amendment .
See , e.g. , ante , at 9 ( as - applied review process “ would raise questions as to the courts ’ own lawful authority ” ) ; ibid .
( “ Courts , too , are bound by the First Amendment ” ) .
This suggestion is perplexing .
Our colleagues elsewhere trumpet “ our duty ‘ to say what the law is , ’ ” even when our predecessors on the bench and our counterparts in Congress have interpreted the law differently .
Ante , at 49 ( quoting Marbury v. Madison , 1 Cranch 137 , 177 ( 1803 ) ) .
We do not typically say what the law is not as a hedge against future judicial error .
The possibility that later courts will misapply a constitutional provision does not give us a basis for pretermitting litigation relating to that provision .
7
The majority suggests that a facial ruling is necessary because anything less would chill too much protected speech .
See ante , at 9 –10 , 12 , 16 –20 .
In addition to begging the question what types of corporate spending are constitutionally protected and to what extent , this claim rests on the assertion that some significant number of corporations have been cowed into quiescence by FEC “ ‘ censor [ ship ] . ’ ” Ante , at 18 –19 .
That assertion is unsubstantiated , and it is hard to square with practical experience .
It is particularly hard to square with the legal landscape following WRTL , which held that a corporate communication could be regulated under § 203 only if it was “ susceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate . ”
551 U. S. , at 470 ( opinion of Roberts , C. J . ) ( emphasis added ) .
The whole point of this test was to make § 203 as simple and speech - protective as possible .
The Court does not explain how , in the span of a single election cycle , it has determined The Chief Justice ’s project to be a failure .
In this respect , too , the majority ’s critique of line - drawing collapses into a critique of the as - applied review method generally .
8
The majority suggests that , even though it expressly dismissed its facial challenge , Citizens United nevertheless preserved it — not as a freestanding “ claim , ” but as a potential argument in support of “ a claim that the FEC has violated its First Amendment right to free speech . ”
Ante , at 13 ; see also ante , at 4 ( Roberts , C. J . , concurring ) ( describing Citizens United ’s claim as : “ [ T ] he Act violates the First Amendment ” ) .
By this novel logic , virtually any submission could be reconceptualized as “ a claim that the Government has violated my rights , ” and it would then be available to the Court to entertain any conceivable issue that might be relevant to that claim ’s disposition .
Not only the as - applied / facial distinction , but the basic relationship between litigants and courts , would be upended if the latter had free rein to construe the former ’s claims at such high levels of generality .
There would be no need for plaintiffs to argue their case ; they could just cite the constitutional provisions they think relevant , and leave the rest to us .
9
Finally , the majority suggests that though the scope of Citizens United ’s claim may be narrow , a facial ruling is necessary as a matter of remedy .
Relying on a law review article , it asserts that Citizens United ’s dismissal of the facial challenge does not prevent us “ ‘ from making broader pronouncements of invalidity in properly “ as- applied ” cases . ’ ” Ante , at 14 ( quoting Fallon , As - Applied and Facial Challenges and Third - Party Standing , 113 Harv. L. Rev. 1321 , 1339 ( 2000 ) ( hereinafter Fallon ) ) ; accord , ante , at 5 ( opinion of Roberts , C. J . )
( “ Regardless whether we label Citizens United ’s claim a ‘ facial ’ or ‘ as - applied ’ challenge , the consequences of the Court ’s decision are the same ” ) .
The majority is on firmer conceptual ground here .
Yet even if one accepts this part of Professor Fallon ’s thesis , one must proceed to ask which as - applied challenges , if successful , will “ properly ” invite or entail invalidation of the underlying statute .
10 The paradigmatic case is a judicial determination that the legislature acted with an impermissible purpose in enacting a provision , as this carries the necessary implication that all future as - applied challenges to the provision must prevail .
See Fallon 1339 –1340 .
Citizens United ’s as - applied challenge was not of this sort .
Until this Court ordered reargument , its contention was that BCRA § 203 could not lawfully be applied to a feature - length video - on - demand film ( such as Hillary ) or to a nonprofit corporation exempt from taxation under 26 U. S. C. § 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) 11 and funded overwhelmingly by individuals ( such as itself ) .
See Brief for Appellant 16 – 41 .
Success on either of these claims would not necessarily carry any implications for the validity of § 203 as applied to other types of broadcasts , other types of corporations , or unions .
It certainly would not invalidate the statute as applied to a large for - profit corporation .
See Tr. of Oral Arg. 8 , 4 ( Mar. 24 , 2009 ) ( counsel for Citizens United emphasizing that appellant is “ a small , nonprofit organization , which is very much like [ an MCFL corporation ] , ” and affirming that its argument “ definitely would not be the same ” if Hillary were distributed by General Motors ) .
12 There is no legitimate basis for resurrecting a facial challenge that dropped out of this case 20 months ago .
Narrower Grounds
It is all the more distressing that our colleagues have manufactured a facial challenge , because the parties have advanced numerous ways to resolve the case that would facilitate electioneering by nonprofit advocacy corporations such as Citizens United , without toppling statutes and precedents .
Which is to say , the majority has transgressed yet another “ cardinal ” principle of the judicial process : “ [ I ] f it is not necessary to decide more , it is necessary not to decide more , ” PDK Labs. , Inc. v. Drug Enforcement Admin. , 362 F. 3d 786 , 799 ( CADC 2004 ) ( Roberts , J. , concurring in part and concurring in judgment ) .
Consider just three of the narrower grounds of decision that the majority has bypassed .
First , the Court could have ruled , on statutory grounds , that a feature - length film distributed through video - on - demand does not qualify as an “ electioneering communication ” under § 203 of BCRA , 2 U. S. C. § 441b .
BCRA defines that term to encompass certain communications transmitted by “ broadcast , cable , or satellite . ” § 434 ( f ) ( 3 ) ( A ) .
When Congress was developing BCRA , the video - on - demand medium was still in its infancy , and legislators were focused on a very different sort of programming : short advertisements run on television or radio .
See McConnell , 540 U. S. , at 207 .
The sponsors of BCRA acknowledge that the FEC ’s implementing regulations do not clearly apply to video - on - demand transmissions .
See Brief for Senator John McCain et al. as Amici Curiae 17 –19 .
In light of this ambiguity , the distinctive characteristics of video - on - demand , and “ [t ] he elementary rule … that every reasonable construction must be resorted to , in order to save a statute from unconstitutionality , ” Hooper v. California , 155 U. S. 648 , 657 ( 1895 ) , the Court could have reasonably ruled that § 203 does not apply to Hillary .
13
Second , the Court could have expanded the MCFL exemption to cover § 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) nonprofits that accept only a de minimis amount of money from for - profit corporations .
Citizens United professes to be such a group :
Its brief says it “ is funded predominantly by donations from individuals who support [ its ] ideological message . ”
Brief for Appellant 5 . Numerous Courts of Appeal have held that de minimis business support does not , in itself , remove an otherwise qualifying organization from the ambit of MCFL .
14 This Court could have simply followed their lead .
15
Finally , let us not forget Citizens United ’s as - applied constitutional challenge .
Precisely because Citizens United looks so much like the MCFL organizations we have exempted from regulation , while a feature - length video - on - demand film looks so unlike the types of electoral advocacy Congress has found deserving of regulation , this challenge is a substantial one .
As the appellant ’s own arguments show , the Court could have easily limited the breadth of its constitutional holding had it declined to adopt the novel notion that speakers and speech acts must always be treated identically — and always spared expenditures restrictions — in the political realm .
Yet the Court nonetheless turns its back on the as - applied review process that has been a staple of campaign finance litigation since Buckley v. Valeo , 424 U. S. 1 ( 1976 ) ( per curiam ) , and that was affirmed and expanded just two Terms ago in WRTL , 551 U. S. 449 .
This brief tour of alternative grounds on which the case could have been decided is not meant to show that any of these grounds is ideal , though each is perfectly “ valid , ” ante , at 12 ( majority opinion ) .
16
It is meant to show that there were principled , narrower paths that a Court that was serious about judicial restraint could have taken .
There was also the straightforward path : applying Austin and McConnell , just as the District Court did in holding that the funding of Citizens United ’s film can be regulated under them .
The only thing preventing the majority from affirming the District Court , or adopting a narrower ground that would retain Austin , is its disdain for Austin .
II
The final principle of judicial process that the majority violates is the most transparent : stare decisis .
I am not an absolutist when it comes to stare decisis , in the campaign finance area or in any other .
No one is .
But if this principle is to do any meaningful work in supporting the rule of law , it must at least demand a significant justification , beyond the preferences of five Justices , for overturning settled doctrine .
“ [ A ] decision to overrule should rest on some special reason over and above the belief that a prior case was wrongly decided . ”
Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey , 505 U. S. 833 , 864 ( 1992 ) .
No such justification exists in this case , and to the contrary there are powerful prudential reasons to keep faith with our precedents .
17
The Court ’s central argument for why stare decisis ought to be trumped is that it does not like Austin .
The opinion “ was not well reasoned , ” our colleagues assert , and it conflicts with First Amendment principles .
Ante , at 47 – 48 .
This , of course , is the Court ’s merits argument , the many defects in which we will soon consider .
I am perfectly willing to concede that if one of our precedents were dead wrong in its reasoning or irreconcilable with the rest of our doctrine , there would be a compelling basis for revisiting it .
But neither is true of Austin , as I explain at length in Parts III and IV , infra , at 23 – 89 , and restating a merits argument with additional vigor does not give it extra weight in the stare decisis calculus .
Perhaps in recognition of this point , the Court supplements its merits case with a smattering of assertions .
The Court proclaims that “ Austin is undermined by experience since its announcement . ”
Ante , at 48 .
This is a curious claim to make in a case that lacks a developed record .
The majority has no empirical evidence with which to substantiate the claim ; we just have its ipse dixit that the real world has not been kind to Austin .
Nor does the majority bother to specify in what sense Austin has been “ undermined . ”
Instead it treats the reader to a string of non sequiturs : “ Our Nation ’s speech dynamic is changing , ” ante , at 48 ; “ [ s ] peakers have become adept at presenting citizens with sound bites , talking points , and scripted messages , ” ibid . ; “ [ c] orporations … do not have monolithic views , ” ibid .
How any of these ruminations weakens the force of stare decisis , escapes my comprehension .
18
The majority also contends that the Government ’s hesitation to rely on Austin ’s antidistortion rationale “ diminishe[s ] ” “ the principle of adhering to that precedent . ”
Ante , at 48 ; see also ante , at 11 ( opinion of Roberts , C. J . )
( Government ’s litigating position is “ most importan[t ] ” factor undermining Austin ) .
Why it diminishes the value of stare decisis is left unexplained .
We have never thought fit to overrule a precedent because a litigant has taken any particular tack .
Nor should we .
Our decisions can often be defended on multiple grounds , and a litigant may have strategic or case - specific reasons for emphasizing only a subset of them .
Members of the public , moreover , often rely on our bottom - line holdings far more than our precise legal arguments ; surely this is true for the legislatures that have been regulating corporate electioneering since Austin .
The task of evaluating the continued viability of precedents falls to this Court , not to the parties .
19
Although the majority opinion spends several pages making these surprising arguments , it says almost nothing about the standard considerations we have used to determine stare decisis value , such as the antiquity of the precedent , the workability of its legal rule , and the reliance interests at stake .
It is also conspicuously silent about McConnell , even though the McConnell Court ’s decision to uphold BCRA § 203 relied not only on the antidistortion logic of Austin but also on the statute ’s historical pedigree , see , e.g. , 540 U. S. , at 115 –132 , 223–224 , and the need to preserve the integrity of federal campaigns , see id. , at 126–129 , 205–208 , and n. 88 .
We have recognized that “ [ s ] tare decisis has special force when legislators or citizens ‘ have acted in reliance on a previous decision , for in this instance overruling the decision would dislodge settled rights and expectations or require an extensive legislative response . ’ ” Hubbard v. United States , 514 U. S. 695 , 714 ( 1995 ) ( quoting Hilton v. South Carolina Public Railways Comm’n , 502 U. S. 197 , 202 ( 1991 ) ) .
Stare decisis protects not only personal rights involving property or contract but also the ability of the elected branches to shape their laws in an effective and coherent fashion .
Today ’s decision takes away a power that we have long permitted these branches to exercise .
State legislatures have relied on their authority to regulate corporate electioneering , confirmed in Austin , for more than a century .
20 The Federal Congress has relied on this authority for a comparable stretch of time , and it specifically relied on Austin throughout the years it spent developing and debating BCRA .
The total record it compiled was 100,000 pages long .
21 Pulling out the rug beneath Congress after affirming the constitutionality of § 203 six years ago shows great disrespect for a coequal branch .
By removing one of its central components , today ’s ruling makes a hash out of BCRA ’s “ delicate and interconnected regulatory scheme . ”
McConnell , 540 U. S. , at 172 .
Consider just one example of the distortions that will follow : Political parties are barred under BCRA from soliciting or spending “ soft money , ” funds that are not subject to the statute ’s disclosure requirements or its source and amount limitations .
2 U. S. C. § 441i ; McConnell , 540 U. S. , at 122–126 .
Going forward , corporations and unions will be free to spend as much general treasury money as they wish on ads that support or attack specific candidates , whereas national parties will not be able to spend a dime of soft money on ads of any kind .
The Court ’s ruling thus dramatically enhances the role of corporations and unions — and the narrow interests they represent — vis - À - vis the role of political parties — and the broad coalitions they represent — in determining who will hold public office .
22
Beyond the reliance interests at stake , the other stare decisis factors also cut against the Court .
Considerations of antiquity are significant for similar reasons .
McConnell is only six years old , but Austin has been on the books for two decades , and many of the statutes called into question by today ’s opinion have been on the books for a half - century or more .
The Court points to no intervening change in circumstances that warrants revisiting Austin .
Certainly nothing relevant has changed since we decided WRTL two Terms ago .
And the Court gives no reason to think that Austin and McConnell are unworkable .
In fact , no one has argued to us that Austin ’s rule has proved impracticable , and not a single for - profit corporation , union , or State has asked us to overrule it .
Quite to the contrary , leading groups representing the business community , 23 organized labor , 24 and the nonprofit sector , 25 together with more than half of the States , 26 urge that we preserve Austin .
As for McConnell , the portions of BCRA it upheld may be prolix , but all three branches of Government have worked to make § 203 as user - friendly as possible .
For instance , Congress established a special mechanism for expedited review of constitutional challenges , see note following 2 U. S. C. § 437 h ; the FEC has established a standardized process , with clearly defined safe harbors , for corporations to claim that a particular electioneering communication is permissible under WRTL , see 11 CFR § 114.15 ( 2009 ) ; 27 and , as noted above , The Chief Justice crafted his controlling opinion in WRTL with the express goal of maximizing clarity and administrability , 551 U. S. , at 469–470 , 473–474 .
The case for stare decisis may be bolstered , we have said , when subsequent rulings “ have reduced the impact ” of a precedent “ while reaffirming the decision ’s core ruling . ”
Dickerson v. United States , 530 U. S. 428 , 443 ( 2000 ) .
28
In the end , the Court ’s rejection of Austin and McConnell comes down to nothing more than its disagreement with their results .
Virtually every one of its arguments was made and rejected in those cases , and the majority opinion is essentially an amalgamation of resuscitated dissents .
The only relevant thing that has changed since Austin and McConnell is the composition of this Court .
Today ’s ruling thus strikes at the vitals of stare decisis , “ the means by which we ensure that the law will not merely change erratically , but will develop in a principled and intelligible fashion ” that “ permits society to presume that bedrock principles are founded in the law rather than in the proclivities of individuals . ”
Vasquez v. Hillery , 474 U. S. 254 , 265 ( 1986 ) .
III
The novelty of the Court ’s procedural dereliction and its approach to stare decisis is matched by the novelty of its ruling on the merits .
The ruling rests on several premises .
First , the Court claims that Austin and McConnell have “ banned ” corporate speech .
Second , it claims that the First Amendment precludes regulatory distinctions based on speaker identity , including the speaker ’s identity as a corporation .
Third , it claims that Austin and McConnell were radical outliers in our First Amendment tradition and our campaign finance jurisprudence .
Each of these claims is wrong .
The So - Called “ Ban ”
Pervading the Court ’s analysis is the ominous image of a “ categorical ba[n ] ” on corporate speech .
Ante , at 45 .
Indeed , the majority invokes the specter of a “ ban ” on nearly every page of its opinion .
Ante , at 1 , 4 , 7 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 16 , 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 , 26 , 27 , 28 , 29 , 30 , 31 , 33 , 35 , 38 , 40 , 42 , 45 , 46 , 47 , 49 , 54 , 56 .
This characterization is highly misleading , and needs to be corrected .
In fact it already has been .
Our cases have repeatedly pointed out that , “ [ c] ontrary to the [ majority ’s ] critical assumptions , ” the statutes upheld in Austin and McConnell do “ not impose an absolute ban on all forms of corporate political spending . ”
Austin , 494 U. S. , at 660 ; see also McConnell , 540 U. S. , at 203–204 ; Beaumont , 539 U. S. , at 162–163 .
For starters , both statutes provide exemptions for PACs , separate segregated funds established by a corporation for political purposes .
See 2 U. S. C. § 441 b( b ) ( 2 ) ( C ) ; Mich .
Comp . Laws Ann. § 169.255 ( West 2005 ) .
“ The ability to form and administer separate segregated funds , ” we observed in McConnell , “ has provided corporations and unions with a constitutionally sufficient opportunity to engage in express advocacy .
That has been this Court ’s unanimous view . ” 540 U. S. , at 203 .
Under BCRA , any corporation ’s “ stockholders and their families and its executive or administrative personnel and their families ” can pool their resources to finance electioneering communications .
2 U. S. C. § 441 b( b ) ( 4 ) ( A ) ( i ) .
A significant and growing number of corporations avail themselves of this option ; 29 during the most recent election cycle , corporate and union PACs raised nearly a billion dollars .
30 Administering a PAC entails some administrative burden , but so does complying with the disclaimer , disclosure , and reporting requirements that the Court today upholds , see ante , at 51 , and no one has suggested that the burden is severe for a sophisticated for - profit corporation .
To the extent the majority is worried about this issue , it is important to keep in mind that we have no record to show how substantial the burden really is , just the majority ’s own unsupported factfinding , see ante , at 21 – 22 .
Like all other natural persons , every shareholder of every corporation remains entirely free under Austin and McConnell to do however much electioneering she pleases outside of the corporate form .
The owners of a “ mom & pop ” store can simply place ads in their own names , rather than the store ’s .
If ideologically aligned individuals wish to make unlimited expenditures through the corporate form , they may utilize an MCFL organization that has policies in place to avoid becoming a conduit for business or union interests .
See MCFL , 479 U. S. , at 263 –264 .
The laws upheld in Austin and McConnell leave open many additional avenues for corporations ’ political speech .
Consider the statutory provision we are ostensibly evaluating in this case , BCRA §203 .
It has no application to genuine issue advertising — a category of corporate speech Congress found to be far more substantial than election - related advertising , see McConnell , 540 U. S. , at 207 — or to Internet , telephone , and print advocacy .
31 Like numerous statutes , it exempts media companies ’ news stories , commentaries , and editorials from its electioneering restrictions , in recognition of the unique role played by the institutional press in sustaining public debate .
32 See 2 U. S. C. § 434 ( f ) ( 3 ) ( B ) ( i ) ; McConnell , 540 U. S. , at 208–209 ; see also Austin , 494 U. S. , at 666–668 .
It also allows corporations to spend unlimited sums on political communications with their executives and shareholders , § 441 b ( b ) ( 2 ) ( A ) ; 11 CFR § 114.3 ( a ) ( 1 ) , to fund additional PAC activity through trade associations , 2 U. S. C. § 441 b ( b ) ( 4 ) ( D ) , to distribute voting guides and voting records , 11 CFR § § 114.4 ( c ) ( 4 ) – ( 5 ) , to underwrite voter registration and voter turnout activities , § 114.3 ( c ) ( 4 ) ; § 114.4 ( c ) ( 2 ) , to host fundraising events for candidates within certain limits , § 114.4 ( c ) ; § 114.2 ( f ) ( 2 ) , and to publicly endorse candidates through a press release and press conference , § 114.4 ( c ) ( 6 ) .
At the time Citizens United brought this lawsuit , the only types of speech that could be regulated under § 203 were : ( 1 ) broadcast , cable , or satellite communications ; 33 ( 2 ) capable of reaching at least 50,000 persons in the relevant electorate ; 34 ( 3 ) made within 30 days of a primary or 60 days of a general federal election ; 35 ( 4 ) by a labor union or a non- MCFL , nonmedia corporation ; 36 ( 5 ) paid for with general treasury funds ; 37 and ( 6 ) “ susceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate . ”
38 The category of communications meeting all of these criteria is not trivial , but the notion that corporate political speech has been “ suppress[ed ] … altogether , ” ante , at 2 , that corporations have been “ exclu[ded ] … from the general public dialogue , ” ante , at 25 , or that a work of fiction such as Mr. Smith Goes to Washington might be covered , ante , at 56 – 57 , is nonsense .
39 Even the plaintiffs in McConnell , who had every incentive to depict BCRA as negatively as possible , declined to argue that § 203 ’s prohibition on certain uses of general treasury funds amounts to a complete ban .
See 540 U. S. , at 204 .
In many ways , then , §203 functions as a source restriction or a time , place , and manner restriction .
It applies in a viewpoint - neutral fashion to a narrow subset of advocacy messages about clearly identified candidates for federal office , made during discrete time periods through discrete channels .
In the case at hand , all Citizens United needed to do to broadcast Hillary right before the primary was to abjure business contributions or use the funds in its PAC , which by its own account is “ one of the most active conservative PACs in America , ” Citizens United Political Victory Fund , http://www.cupvf.org/. 40
So let us be clear : Neither Austin nor McConnell held or implied that corporations may be silenced ; the FEC is not a “ censor ” ; and in the years since these cases were decided , corporations have continued to play a major role in the national dialogue .
Laws such as § 203 target a class of communications that is especially likely to corrupt the political process , that is at least one degree removed from the views of individual citizens , and that may not even reflect the views of those who pay for it .
Such laws burden political speech , and that is always a serious matter , demanding careful scrutiny .
But the majority ’s incessant talk of a “ ban ” aims at a straw man .
Identity - Based Distinctions
The second pillar of the Court ’s opinion is its assertion that “ the Government cannot restrict political speech based on the speaker ’s … identity . ”
Ante , at 30 ; accord , ante , at 1 , 24 , 26 , 30 , 31 , 32 , 33 , 34 , 49 , 50 .
The case on which it relies for this proposition is First Nat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti , 435 U. S. 765 ( 1978 ) .
As I shall explain , infra , at 52 – 55 , the holding in that case was far narrower than the Court implies .
Like its paeans to unfettered discourse , the Court ’s denunciation of identity - based distinctions may have rhetorical appeal but it obscures reality .
“ Our jurisprudence over the past 216 years has rejected an absolutist interpretation ” of the First Amendment .
WRTL , 551 U. S. , at 482 ( opinion of Roberts , C. J. ) .
The First Amendment provides that “ Congress shall make no law … abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press . ”
Apart perhaps from measures designed to protect the press , that text might seem to permit no distinctions of any kind .
Yet in a variety of contexts , we have held that speech can be regulated differentially on account of the speaker ’s identity , when identity is understood in categorical or institutional terms .
The Government routinely places special restrictions on the speech rights of students , 41 prisoners , 42 members of the Armed Forces , 43 foreigners , 44 and its own employees .
45 When such restrictions are justified by a legitimate governmental interest , they do not necessarily raise constitutional problems .
46
In contrast to the blanket rule that the majority espouses , our cases recognize that the Government ’s interests may be more or less compelling with respect to different classes of speakers , 47 cf. Minneapolis Star & Tribune Co. v. Minnesota Comm’r of Revenue , 460 U. S. 575 , 585 ( 1983 ) ( “ [ D]ifferential treatment ” is constitutionally suspect “ unless justified by some special characteristic ” of the regulated class of speakers ( emphasis added ) ) , and that the constitutional rights of certain categories of speakers , in certain contexts , “ ‘ are not automatically coextensive with the rights ’ ” that are normally accorded to members of our society , Morse v. Frederick , 551 U. S. 393 , 396–397 , 404 ( 2007 ) ( quoting Bethel School Dist .
No. 403 v. Fraser , 478 U. S. 675 , 682 ( 1986 ) ) .
The free speech guarantee thus does not render every other public interest an illegitimate basis for qualifying a speaker ’s autonomy ; society could scarcely function if it did .
It is fair to say that our First Amendment doctrine has “ frowned on ” certain identity - based distinctions , Los Angeles Police Dept. v. United Reporting Publishing Corp. , 528 U. S. 32 , n. 4 ( 1999 ) ( Stevens , J. , dissenting ) , particularly those that may reflect invidious discrimination or preferential treatment of a politically powerful group .
But it is simply incorrect to suggest that we have prohibited all legislative distinctions based on identity or content .
Not even close .
The election context is distinctive in many ways , and the Court , of course , is right that the First Amendment closely guards political speech .
But in this context , too , the authority of legislatures to enact viewpoint - neutral regulations based on content and identity is well settled .
We have , for example , allowed state - run broadcasters to exclude independent candidates from televised debates .
Arkansas Ed. Television Comm’n v. Forbes , 523 U. S. 666 ( 1998 ) .
48
We have upheld statutes that prohibit the distribution or display of campaign materials near a polling place .
Burson v. Freeman , 504 U. S. 191 ( 1992 ) .
49
Although we have not reviewed them directly , we have never cast doubt on laws that place special restrictions on campaign spending by foreign nationals .
See , e.g. , 2 U. S. C. § 441e ( a ) ( 1 ) .
And we have consistently approved laws that bar Government employees , but not others , from contributing to or participating in political activities .
See n. 45 , supra .
These statutes burden the political expression of one class of speakers , namely , civil servants .
Yet we have sustained them on the basis of longstanding practice and Congress ’ reasoned judgment that certain regulations which leave “ untouched full participation … in political decisions at the ballot box , ” Civil Service Comm’n v. Letter Carriers , 413 U. S. 548 , 556 ( 1973 ) ( internal quotation marks omitted ) , help ensure that public officials are “ sufficiently free from improper influences , ” id. , at 564 , and that “ confidence in the system of representative Government is not … eroded to a disastrous extent , ” id. , at 565 .
The same logic applies to this case with additional force because it is the identity of corporations , rather than individuals , that the Legislature has taken into account .
As we have unanimously observed , legislatures are entitled to decide “ that the special characteristics of the corporate structure require particularly careful regulation ” in an electoral context .
NRWC , 459 U. S. , at 209 –210 .
50 Not only has the distinctive potential of corporations to corrupt the electoral process long been recognized , but within the area of campaign finance , corporate spending is also “ furthest from the core of political expression , since corporations ’
First Amendment speech and association interests are derived largely from those of their members and of the public in receiving information , ” Beaumont , 539 U. S. , at 161 , n. 8 ( citation omitted ) .
Campaign finance distinctions based on corporate identity tend to be less worrisome , in other words , because the “ speakers ” are not natural persons , much less members of our political community , and the governmental interests are of the highest order .
Furthermore , when corporations , as a class , are distinguished from noncorporations , as a class , there is a lesser risk that regulatory distinctions will reflect invidious discrimination or political favoritism .
If taken seriously , our colleagues ’ assumption that the identity of a speaker has no relevance to the Government ’s ability to regulate political speech would lead to some remarkable conclusions .
Such an assumption would have accorded the propaganda broadcasts to our troops by “ Tokyo Rose ” during World War II the same protection as speech by Allied commanders .
More pertinently , it would appear to afford the same protection to multinational corporations controlled by foreigners as to individual Americans :
To do otherwise , after all , could “ ‘ enhance the relative voice ’ ” of some ( i.e. , humans ) over others ( i.e. , nonhumans ) .
Ante , at 33 ( quoting Buckley , 424 U. S. , at 49 ) .
51 Under the majority ’s view , I suppose it may be a First Amendment problem that corporations are not permitted to vote , given that voting is , among other things , a form of speech .
52
In short , the Court dramatically overstates its critique of identity - based distinctions , without ever explaining why corporate identity demands the same treatment as individual identity .
Only the most wooden approach to the First Amendment could justify the unprecedented line it seeks to draw .
Our First Amendment Tradition
A third fulcrum of the Court ’s opinion is the idea that Austin and McConnell are radical outliers , “ aberration [s ] , ” in our First Amendment tradition .
Ante , at 39 ; see also ante , at 45 , 56 ( professing fidelity to “ our law and our tradition ” ) .
The Court has it exactly backwards .
It is today ’s holding that is the radical departure from what had been settled First Amendment law .
To see why , it is useful to take a long view .
1. Original Understandings
Let us start from the beginning .
The Court invokes “ ancient First Amendment principles , ” ante , at 1 ( internal quotation marks omitted ) , and original understandings , ante , at 37 – 38 , to defend today ’s ruling , yet it makes only a perfunctory attempt to ground its analysis in the principles or understandings of those who drafted and ratified the Amendment .
Perhaps this is because there is not a scintilla of evidence to support the notion that anyone believed it would preclude regulatory distinctions based on the corporate form .
To the extent that the Framers ’ views are discernible and relevant to the disposition of this case , they would appear to cut strongly against the majority ’s position .
This is not only because the Framers and their contemporaries conceived of speech more narrowly than we now think of it , see Bork , Neutral Principles and Some First Amendment Problems , 47 Ind. L. J. 1 , 22 ( 1971 ) , but also because they held very different views about the nature of the First Amendment right and the role of corporations in society .
Those few corporations that existed at the founding were authorized by grant of a special legislative charter .
53 Corporate sponsors would petition the legislature , and the legislature , if amenable , would issue a charter that specified the corporation ’s powers and purposes and “ authoritatively fixed the scope and content of corporate organization , ” including “ the internal structure of the corporation . ”
J. Hurst , The Legitimacy of the Business Corporation in the Law of the United States 1780 – 1970 , pp. 15 –16 ( 1970 ) ( reprint 2004 ) .
Corporations were created , supervised , and conceptualized as quasi-public entities , “ designed to serve a social function for the state . ”
Handlin & Handlin , Origin of the American Business Corporation , 5 J. Econ. Hist. 1 , 22 ( 1945 ) .
It was “ assumed that [ they ] were legally privileged organizations that had to be closely scrutinized by the legislature because their purposes had to be made consistent with public welfare . ”
R. Seavoy , Origins of the American Business Corporation , 1784 – 1855 , p. 5 ( 1982 ) .
The individualized charter mode of incorporation reflected the “ cloud of disfavor under which corporations labored ” in the early years of this Nation .
1 W. Fletcher , Cyclopedia of the Law of Corporations § 2 , p. 8 ( rev. ed. 2006 ) ; see also Louis K. Liggett Co. v. Lee , 288 U. S. 517 , 548–549 ( 1933 ) ( Brandeis , J. , dissenting ) ( discussing fears of the “ evils ” of business corporations ) ; L. Friedman , A History of American Law 194 ( 2d ed. 1985 ) ( “ The word ‘ soulless ’ constantly recurs in debates over corporations … .
Corporations , it was feared , could concentrate the worst urges of whole groups of men ” ) .
Thomas Jefferson famously fretted that corporations would subvert the Republic .
54 General incorporation statutes , and widespread acceptance of business corporations as socially useful actors , did not emerge until the 1800’s .
See Hansmann & Kraakman , The End of History for Corporate Law , 89 Geo. L. J. 439 , 440 ( 2001 ) ( hereinafter Hansmann & Kraakman ) ( “ [ A]ll general business corporation statutes appear to date from well after 1800 ” ) .
The Framers thus took it as a given that corporations could be comprehensively regulated in the service of the public welfare .
Unlike our colleagues , they had little trouble distinguishing corporations from human beings , and when they constitutionalized the right to free speech in the First Amendment , it was the free speech of individual Americans that they had in mind .
55 While individuals might join together to exercise their speech rights , business corporations , at least , were plainly not seen as facilitating such associational or expressive ends .
Even “ the notion that business corporations could invoke the First Amendment would probably have been quite a novelty , ” given that “ at the time , the legitimacy of every corporate activity was thought to rest entirely in a concession of the sovereign . ”
Shelledy , Autonomy , Debate , and Corporate Speech , 18 Hastings Const .
L. Q. 541 , 578 ( 1991 ) ; cf. Trustees of Dartmouth College v. Woodward , 4 Wheat .
518 , 636 ( 1819 ) ( Marshall , C. J. )
( “ A corporation is an artificial being , invisible , intangible , and existing only in contemplation of law .
Being the mere creature of law , it possesses only those properties which the charter of its creation confers upon it ” ) ; Eule , Promoting Speaker Diversity : Austin and Metro Broadcasting , 1990 S. Ct. Rev. 105 , 129 ( “ The framers of the First Amendment could scarcely have anticipated its application to the corporation form .
That , of course , ought not to be dispositive .
What is compelling , however , is an understanding of who was supposed to be the beneficiary of the free speech guaranty — the individual ” ) .
In light of these background practices and understandings , it seems to me implausible that the Framers believed “ the freedom of speech ” would extend equally to all corporate speakers , much less that it would preclude legislatures from taking limited measures to guard against corporate capture of elections .
The Court observes that the Framers drew on diverse intellectual sources , communicated through newspapers , and aimed to provide greater freedom of speech than had existed in England .
Ante , at 37 .
From these ( accurate ) observations , the Court concludes that “ [ t ] he First Amendment was certainly not understood to condone the suppression of political speech in society ’s most salient media . ”
Ibid .
This conclusion is far from certain , given that many historians believe the Framers were focused on prior restraints on publication and did not understand the First Amendment to “ prevent the subsequent punishment of such [ publications ] as may be deemed contrary to the public welfare . ”
Near v. Minnesota ex rel .
Olson , 283 U. S. 697 , 714 ( 1931 ) .
Yet , even if the majority ’s conclusion were correct , it would tell us only that the First Amendment was understood to protect political speech in certain media .
It would tell us little about whether the Amendment was understood to protect general treasury electioneering expenditures by corporations , and to what extent .
As a matter of original expectations , then , it seems absurd to think that the First Amendment prohibits legislatures from taking into account the corporate identity of a sponsor of electoral advocacy .
As a matter of original meaning , it likewise seems baseless — unless one evaluates the First Amendment ’s “ principles , ” ante , at 1 , 48 , or its “ purpose , ” ante , at 5 ( opinion of Roberts , C. J . ) , at such a high level of generality that the historical understandings of the Amendment cease to be a meaningful constraint on the judicial task .
This case sheds a revelatory light on the assumption of some that an impartial judge ’s application of an originalist methodology is likely to yield more determinate answers , or to play a more decisive role in the decisional process , than his or her views about sound policy .
Justice Scalia criticizes the foregoing discussion for failing to adduce statements from the founding era showing that corporations were understood to be excluded from the First Amendment ’s free speech guarantee .
Ante , at 1 –2 , 9 .
Of course , Justice Scalia adduces no statements to suggest the contrary proposition , or even to suggest that the contrary proposition better reflects the kind of right that the drafters and ratifiers of the Free Speech Clause thought they were enshrining .
Although Justice Scalia makes a perfectly sensible argument that an individual ’s right to speak entails a right to speak with others for a common cause , cf. MCFL , 479 U. S. 238 , he does not explain why those two rights must be precisely identical , or why that principle applies to electioneering by corporations that serve no “ common cause . ”
Ante , at 8 .
Nothing in his account dislodges my basic point that members of the founding generation held a cautious view of corporate power and a narrow view of corporate rights ( not that they “ despised ” corporations , ante , at 2 ) , and that they conceptualized speech in individualistic terms .
If no prominent Framer bothered to articulate that corporate speech would have lesser status than individual speech , that may well be because the contrary proposition — if not also the very notion of “ corporate speech ” — was inconceivable .
56
Justice Scalia also emphasizes the unqualified nature of the First Amendment text .
Ante , at 2 , 8 . Yet he would seemingly read out the Free Press Clause :
How else could he claim that my purported views on newspapers must track my views on corporations generally ?
Ante , at 6 . 57 Like virtually all modern lawyers , Justice Scalia presumably believes that the First Amendment restricts the Executive , even though its language refers to Congress alone .
In any event , the text only leads us back to the questions who or what is guaranteed “ the freedom of speech , ” and , just as critically , what that freedom consists of and under what circumstances it may be limited .
Justice Scalia appears to believe that because corporations are created and utilized by individuals , it follows ( as night the day ) that their electioneering must be equally protected by the First Amendment and equally immunized from expenditure limits .
See ante , at 7 –8 .
That conclusion certainly does not follow as a logical matter , and Justice Scalia fails to explain why the original public meaning leads it to follow as a matter of interpretation .
The truth is we cannot be certain how a law such as BCRA § 203 meshes with the original meaning of the First Amendment .
58 I have given several reasons why I believe the Constitution would have been understood then , and ought to be understood now , to permit reasonable restrictions on corporate electioneering , and I will give many more reasons in the pages to come .
The Court enlists the Framers in its defense without seriously grappling with their understandings of corporations or the free speech right , or with the republican principles that underlay those understandings .
In fairness , our campaign finance jurisprudence has never attended very closely to the views of the Framers , see Randall v. Sorrell , 548 U. S. 230 , 280 ( 2006 ) ( Stevens , J. , dissenting ) , whose political universe differed profoundly from that of today .
We have long since held that corporations are covered by the First Amendment , and many legal scholars have long since rejected the concession theory of the corporation .
But “ historical context is usually relevant , ” ibid .
( internal quotation marks omitted ) , and in light of the Court ’s effort to cast itself as guardian of ancient values , it pays to remember that nothing in our constitutional history dictates today ’s outcome .
To the contrary , this history helps illuminate just how extraordinarily dissonant the decision is .
2. Legislative and Judicial Interpretation
A century of more recent history puts to rest any notion that today ’s ruling is faithful to our First Amendment tradition .
At the federal level , the express distinction between corporate and individual political spending on elections stretches back to 1907 , when Congress passed the Tillman Act , ch. 420 , 34 Stat. 864 , banning all corporate contributions to candidates .
The Senate Report on the legislation observed that “ [t ] he evils of the use of [ corporate ] money in connection with political elections are so generally recognized that the committee deems it unnecessary to make any argument in favor of the general purpose of this measure .
It is in the interest of good government and calculated to promote purity in the selection of public officials . ”
S. Rep. No. 3056 , 59th Cong. , 1st Sess. , 2 ( 1906 ) .
President Roosevelt , in his 1905 annual message to Congress , declared :
“ ‘ All contributions by corporations to any political committee or for any political purpose should be forbidden by law ; directors should not be permitted to use stockholders ’ money for such purposes ; and , moreover , a prohibition of this kind would be , as far as it went , an effective method of stopping the evils aimed at in corrupt practices acts . ’ ” United States v. Automobile Workers , 352 U. S. 567 , 572 ( 1957 ) ( quoting 40 Cong. Rec. 96 ) .
The Court has surveyed the history leading up to the Tillman Act several times , see WRTL , 551 U. S. , at 508 –510 ( Souter , J. , dissenting ) ; McConnell , 540 U. S. , at 115 ; Automobile Workers , 352 U. S. , at 570 –575 , and I will refrain from doing so again .
It is enough to say that the Act was primarily driven by two pressing concerns : first , the enormous power corporations had come to wield in federal elections , with the accompanying threat of both actual corruption and a public perception of corruption ; and second , a respect for the interest of shareholders and members in preventing the use of their money to support candidates they opposed .
See ibid. ; United States v. CIO , 335 U. S. 106 , 113 ( 1948 ) ; Winkler , “ Other People ’s Money ” : Corporations , Agency Costs , and Campaign Finance Law , 92 Geo. L. J. 871 ( 2004 ) .
Over the years , the limitations on corporate political spending have been modified in a number of ways , as Congress responded to changes in the American economy and political practices that threatened to displace the commonweal .
Justice Souter recently traced these developments at length .
59 WRTL , 551 U. S. , at 507–519 ( dissenting opinion ) ; see also McConnell , 540 U. S. , at 115 –133 ; McConnell , 251 F. Supp. 2d , at 188 –205 .
The Taft - Hartley Act of 1947 is of special significance for this case .
In that Act passed more than 60 years ago , Congress extended the prohibition on corporate support of candidates to cover not only direct contributions , but independent expenditures as well .
Labor Management Relations Act , 1947 , §304 , 61 Stat. 159 .
The bar on contributions “ was being so narrowly construed ” that corporations were easily able to defeat the purposes of the Act by supporting candidates through other means .
WRTL , 551 U. S. , at 511 ( Souter , J. , dissenting ) ( citing S. Rep. No. 1 , 80th Cong. , 1st Sess. , 38–39 ( 1947 ) ) .
Our colleagues emphasize that in two cases from the middle of the 20th century , several Justices wrote separately to criticize the expenditure restriction as applied to unions , even though the Court declined to pass on its constitutionality .
Ante , at 27 – 28 .
Two features of these cases are of far greater relevance .
First , those Justices were writing separately ; which is to say , their position failed to command a majority .
Prior to today , this was a fact we found significant in evaluating precedents .
Second , each case in this line expressed support for the principle that corporate and union political speech financed with PAC funds , collected voluntarily from the organization ’s stockholders or members , receives greater protection than speech financed with general treasury funds .
60
This principle was carried forward when Congress enacted comprehensive campaign finance reform in the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 ( FECA ) , 86 Stat. 3 , which retained the restriction on using general treasury funds for contributions and expenditures , 2 U. S. C. § 441 b ( a ) .
FECA codified the option for corporations and unions to create PACs to finance contributions and expenditures forbidden to the corporation or union itself .
§ 441 b ( b ) .
By the time Congress passed FECA in 1971 , the bar on corporate contributions and expenditures had become such an accepted part of federal campaign finance regulation that when a large number of plaintiffs , including several nonprofit corporations , challenged virtually every aspect of the Act in Buckley , 424 U. S. 1 , no one even bothered to argue that the bar as such was unconstitutional .
Buckley famously ( or infamously ) distinguished direct contributions from independent expenditures , id. , at 58 – 59 , but its silence on corporations only reinforced the understanding that corporate expenditures could be treated differently from individual expenditures .
“ Since our decision in Buckley , Congress ’ power to prohibit corporations and unions from using funds in their treasuries to finance advertisements expressly advocating the election or defeat of candidates in federal elections has been firmly embedded in our law . ”
McConnell , 540 U. S. , at 203 .
Thus , it was unremarkable , in a 1982 case holding that Congress could bar nonprofit corporations from soliciting nonmembers for PAC funds , that then - Justice Rehnquist wrote for a unanimous Court that Congress ’ “ careful legislative adjustment of the federal electoral laws , in a cautious advance , step by step , to account for the particular legal and economic attributes of corporations … warrants considerable deference , ” and “ reflects a permissible assessment of the dangers posed by those entities to the electoral process . ”
NRWC , 459 U. S. , at 209 ( internal quotation marks and citation omitted ) .
“ The governmental interest in preventing both actual corruption and the appearance of corruption of elected representatives has long been recognized , ” the unanimous Court observed , “ and there is no reason why it may not … be accomplished by treating … corporations … differently from individuals . ”
Id. , at 210 –211 .
The corporate / individual distinction was not questioned by the Court ’s disposition , in 1986 , of a challenge to the expenditure restriction as applied to a distinctive type of nonprofit corporation .
In MCFL , 479 U. S. 238 , we stated again “ that ‘ the special characteristics of the corporate structure require particularly careful regulation , ’ ” id. , at 256 ( quoting NRWC , 459 U. S. , at 209 –210 ) , and again we acknowledged that the Government has a legitimate interest in “ regulat[ing ] the substantial aggregations of wealth amassed by the special advantages which go with the corporate form , ” 479 U. S. , at 257 ( internal quotation marks omitted ) .
Those aggregations can distort the “ free trade in ideas ” crucial to candidate elections , ibid . , at the expense of members or shareholders who may disagree with the object of the expenditures , id. , at 260 ( internal quotation marks omitted ) .
What the Court held by a 5 - to - 4 vote was that a limited class of corporations must be allowed to use their general treasury funds for independent expenditures , because Congress ’ interests in protecting shareholders and “ restrict[ing ] ‘ the influence of political war chests funneled through the corporate form , ’ ” id. , at 257 ( quoting FEC v. National Conservative Political Action Comm. , 470 U. S. 480 , 501 ( 1985 ) ( NCPAC ) ) , did not apply to corporations that were structurally insulated from those concerns .
61
It is worth remembering for present purposes that the four MCFL dissenters , led by Chief Justice Rehnquist , thought the Court was carrying the First Amendment too far .
They would have recognized congressional authority to bar general treasury electioneering expenditures even by this class of nonprofits ; they acknowledged that “ the threat from corporate political activity will vary depending on the particular characteristics of a given corporation , ” but believed these “ distinctions among corporations ” were “ distinctions in degree , ” not “ in kind , ” and thus “ more properly drawn by the Legislature than by the Judiciary . ” 479 U. S. , at 268 ( opinion of Rehnquist , C. J. ) ( internal quotation marks omitted ) .
Not a single Justice suggested that regulation of corporate political speech could be no more stringent than of speech by an individual .
Four years later , in Austin , 494 U. S. 652 , we considered whether corporations falling outside the MCFL exception could be barred from using general treasury funds to make independent expenditures in support of , or in opposition to , candidates .
We held they could be .
Once again recognizing the importance of “ the integrity of the marketplace of political ideas ” in candidate elections , MCFL , 479 U. S. , at 257 , we noted that corporations have “ special advantages — such as limited liability , perpetual life , and favorable treatment of the accumulation and distribution of assets , ” 494 U. S. , at 658–659 — that allow them to spend prodigious general treasury sums on campaign messages that have “ little or no correlation ” with the beliefs held by actual persons , id. , at 660 .
In light of the corrupting effects such spending might have on the political process , ibid . , we permitted the State of Michigan to limit corporate expenditures on candidate elections to corporations ’
PACs , which rely on voluntary contributions and thus “ reflect actual public support for the political ideals espoused by corporations , ” ibid .
Notwithstanding our colleagues ’ insinuations that Austin deprived the public of general “ ideas , ” “ facts , ” and “ knowledge , ” ante , at 38 –39 , the decision addressed only candidate - focused expenditures and gave the State no license to regulate corporate spending on other matters .
In the 20 years since Austin , we have reaffirmed its holding and rationale a number of times , see , e.g. , Beaumont , 539 U. S. , at 153 –156 , most importantly in McConnell , 540 U. S. 93 , where we upheld the provision challenged here , § 203 of BCRA .
62 Congress crafted § 203 in response to a problem created by Buckley .
The Buckley Court had construed FECA ’s definition of prohibited “ expenditures ” narrowly to avoid any problems of constitutional vagueness , holding it applicable only to “ communications that expressly advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate , ” 424 U. S. , at 80 , i.e. , statements containing so - called “ magic words ” like “ ‘ vote for , ’ ‘ elect , ’ ‘ support , ’ ‘ cast your ballot for , ’ ‘ Smith for Congress , ’ ‘ vote against , ’ ‘ defeat , ’ [ or ] ‘ reject , ’ ” id. , at 43 – 44 , and n. 52 .
After Buckley , corporations and unions figured out how to circumvent the limits on express advocacy by using sham “ issue ads ” that “ eschewed the use of magic words ” but nonetheless “ advocate [d ] the election or defeat of clearly identified federal candidates . ”
McConnell , 540 U. S. , at 126 .
“ Corporations and unions spent hundreds of millions of dollars of their general funds to pay for these ads . ”
Id. , at 127 .
Congress passed § 203 to address this circumvention , prohibiting corporations and unions from using general treasury funds for electioneering communications that “ refe[r ] to a clearly identified candidate , ” whether or not those communications use the magic words .
2 U. S. C. § 434 ( f ) ( 3 ) ( A ) ( i ) ( I ) .
When we asked in McConnell “ whether a compelling governmental interest justifie [d ] ” § 203 , we found the question “ easily answered ” :
“ We have repeatedly sustained legislation aimed at ‘ the corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth that are accumulated with the help of the corporate form and that have little or no correlation to the public ’s support for the corporation ’s political ideas . ’ ” 540 U. S. , at 205 ( quoting Austin , 494 U. S. , at 660 ) .
These precedents “ represent respect for the legislative judgment that the special characteristics of the corporate structure require particularly careful regulation . ” 540 U. S. , at 205 ( internal quotation marks omitted ) .
“ Moreover , recent cases have recognized that certain restrictions on corporate electoral involvement permissibly hedge against ‘ “ circumvention of [ valid ] contribution limits . ” ’ ” Ibid . ( quoting Beaumont , 539 U. S. , at 155 , in turn quoting FEC v. Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Comm . , 533 U. S. 431 , and n. 18 ( 2001 ) ( Colorado II ) ; alteration in original ) .
BCRA , we found , is faithful to the compelling governmental interests in “ ‘ preserving the integrity of the electoral process , preventing corruption , … sustaining the active , alert responsibility of the individual citizen in a democracy for the wise conduct of the government , ’ ” and maintaining “ ‘ the individual citizen ’s confidence in government . ’ ” 540 U. S. , at 206–207 , n. 88 ( quoting Bellotti , 435 U. S. , at 788–789 ; some internal quotation marks and brackets omitted ) .
What made the answer even easier than it might have been otherwise was the option to form PACs , which give corporations , at the least , “ a constitutionally sufficient opportunity to engage in ” independent expenditures .
540 U. S. , at 203 .
3. Buckley and Bellotti
Against this extensive background of congressional regulation of corporate campaign spending , and our repeated affirmation of this regulation as constitutionally sound , the majority dismisses Austin as “ a significant departure from ancient First Amendment principles , ” ante , at 1 ( internal quotation marks omitted ) .
How does the majority attempt to justify this claim ?
Selected passages from two cases , Buckley , 424 U. S. 1 , and Bellotti , 435 U. S. 765 , do all of the work .
In the Court ’s view , Buckley and Bellotti decisively rejected the possibility of distinguishing corporations from natural persons in the 1970’s ; it just so happens that in every single case in which the Court has reviewed campaign finance legislation in the decades since , the majority failed to grasp this truth .
The Federal Congress and dozens of state legislatures , we now know , have been similarly deluded .
The majority emphasizes Buckley ’s statement that “ ‘ [t ] he concept that government may restrict the speech of some elements of our society in order to enhance the relative voice of others is wholly foreign to the First Amendment .’ ” Ante , at 33 ( quoting 424 U. S. , at 48 –49 ) ; ante , at 8 ( opinion of Roberts , C. J. ) .
But this elegant phrase cannot bear the weight that our colleagues have placed on it .
For one thing , the Constitution does , in fact , permit numerous “ restrictions on the speech of some in order to prevent a few from drowning out the many ” : for example , restrictions on ballot access and on legislators ’ floor time .
Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC , 528 U. S. 377 , 402 ( 2000 ) ( Breyer , J. , concurring ) .
For another , the Buckley Court used this line in evaluating “ the ancillary governmental interest in equalizing the relative ability of individuals and groups to influence the outcome of elections . ”
424 U. S. , at 48 .
It is not apparent why this is relevant to the case before us .
The majority suggests that Austin rests on the foreign concept of speech equalization , ante , at 34 ; ante , at 8 –10 ( opinion of Roberts , C. J. ) , but we made it clear in Austin ( as in several cases before and since ) that a restriction on the way corporations spend their money is no mere exercise in disfavoring the voice of some elements of our society in preference to others .
Indeed , we expressly ruled that the compelling interest supporting Michigan ’s statute was not one of “ ‘ equaliz[ing ] the relative influence of speakers on elections , ’ ” Austin , 494 U. S. , at 660 ( quoting id . , at 705 ( Kennedy , J. , dissenting ) ) , but rather the need to confront the distinctive corrupting potential of corporate electoral advocacy financed by general treasury dollars , id. , at 659–660 .
For that matter , it should go without saying that when we made this statement in Buckley , we could not have been casting doubt on the restriction on corporate expenditures in candidate elections , which had not been challenged as “ foreign to the First Amendment , ” ante , at 33 ( quoting Buckley , 424 U. S. , at 49 ) , or for any other reason .
Buckley ’s independent expenditure analysis was focused on a very different statutory provision , 18 U. S. C. § 608( e ) ( 1 ) ( 1970 ed. , Supp. V ) .
It is implausible to think , as the majority suggests , ante , at 29 –30 , that Buckley covertly invalidated FECA ’s separate corporate and union campaign expenditure restriction , § 610 ( now codified at 2 U. S. C. § 441b ) , even though that restriction had been on the books for decades before Buckley and would remain on the books , undisturbed , for decades after .
The case on which the majority places even greater weight than Buckley , however , is Bellotti , 435 U. S. 765 , claiming it “ could not have been clearer ” that Bellotti ’s holding forbade distinctions between corporate and individual expenditures like the one at issue here , ante , at 30 .
The Court ’s reliance is odd .
The only thing about Bellotti that could not be clearer is that it declined to adopt the majority ’s position .
Bellotti ruled , in an explicit limitation on the scope of its holding , that “ our consideration of a corporation ’s right to speak on issues of general public interest implies no comparable right in the quite different context of participation in a political campaign for election to public office . ”
435 U. S. , at 788 , n. 26 ; see also id. , at 787–788 ( acknowledging that the interests in preserving public confidence in Government and protecting dissenting shareholders may be “ weighty … in the context of partisan candidate elections ” ) .
Bellotti , in other words , did not touch the question presented in Austin and McConnell , and the opinion squarely disavowed the proposition for which the majority cites it .
The majority attempts to explain away the distinction Bellotti drew — between general corporate speech and campaign speech intended to promote or prevent the election of specific candidates for office — as inconsistent with the rest of the opinion and with Buckley .
Ante , at 31 , 42 – 44 .
Yet the basis for this distinction is perfectly coherent :
The anticorruption interests that animate regulations of corporate participation in candidate elections , the “ importance ” of which “ has never been doubted , ” 435 U. S. , at 788 , n. 26 , do not apply equally to regulations of corporate participation in referenda .
A referendum cannot owe a political debt to a corporation , seek to curry favor with a corporation , or fear the corporation ’s retaliation .
Cf. Austin , 494 U. S. , at 678 ( Stevens , J. , concurring ) ; Citizens Against Rent Control / Coalition for Fair Housing v. Berkeley , 454 U. S. 290 , 299 ( 1981 ) .
The majority likewise overlooks the fact that , over the past 30 years , our cases have repeatedly recognized the candidate / issue distinction .
See , e.g. , Austin , 494 U. S. , at 659 ; NCPAC , 470 U. S. , at 495–496 ; FCC v. League of Women Voters of Cal. , 468 U. S. 364 , n. 9 ( 1984 ) ; NRWC , 459 U. S. , at 210 , n. 7 . The Court ’s critique of Bellotti ’s footnote 26 puts it in the strange position of trying to elevate Bellotti to canonical status , while simultaneously disparaging a critical piece of its analysis as unsupported and irreconcilable with Buckley .
Bellotti , apparently , is both the font of all wisdom and internally incoherent .
The Bellotti Court confronted a dramatically different factual situation from the one that confronts us in this case : a state statute that barred business corporations ’ expenditures on some referenda but not others .
Specifically , the statute barred a business corporation “ from making contributions or expenditures ‘ for the purpose of … influencing or affecting the vote on any question submitted to the voters , other than one materially affecting any of the property , business or assets of the corporation , ’ ” 435 U. S. , at 768 ( quoting Mass .
Gen. Laws Ann. , ch. 55 , §8 ( West Supp. 1977 ) ; alteration in original ) , and it went so far as to provide that referenda related to income taxation would not “ ‘ be deemed materially to affect the property , business or assets of the corporation , ’ ” 435 U. S. , at 768 .
As might be guessed , the legislature had enacted this statute in order to limit corporate speech on a proposed state constitutional amendment to authorize a graduated income tax .
The statute was a transparent attempt to prevent corporations from spending money to defeat this amendment , which was favored by a majority of legislators but had been repeatedly rejected by the voters .
See id. , at 769 –770 , and n. 3 . We said that “ where , as here , the legislature ’s suppression of speech suggests an attempt to give one side of a debatable public question an advantage in expressing its views to the people , the First Amendment is plainly offended . ”
Id. , at 785 –786 ( footnote omitted ) .
Bellotti thus involved a viewpoint - discriminatory statute , created to effect a particular policy outcome .
Even Justice Rehnquist , in dissent , had to acknowledge that “ a very persuasive argument could be made that the [ Massachusetts Legislature ] , desiring to impose a personal income tax but more than once defeated in that desire by the combination of the Commonwealth ’s referendum provision and corporate expenditures in opposition to such a tax , simply decided to muzzle corporations on this sort of issue so that it could succeed in its desire . ”
Id. , at 827 , n. 6 .
To make matters worse , the law at issue did not make any allowance for corporations to spend money through PACs .
Id. , at 768 , n. 2 ( opinion of the Court ) .
This really was a complete ban on a specific , preidentified subject .
See MCFL , 479 U. S. , at 259 , n. 12 ( stating that 2 U. S. C. § 441 b ’s expenditure restriction “ is of course distinguishable from the complete foreclosure of any opportunity for political speech that we invalidated in the state referendum context in … Bellotti ” ( emphasis added ) ) .
The majority grasps a quotational straw from Bellotti , that speech does not fall entirely outside the protection of the First Amendment merely because it comes from a corporation .
Ante , at 30 – 31 .
Of course not , but no one suggests the contrary and neither Austin nor McConnell held otherwise .
They held that even though the expenditures at issue were subject to First Amendment scrutiny , the restrictions on those expenditures were justified by a compelling state interest .
See McConnell , 540 U. S. , at 205 ; Austin , 494 U. S. , at 658 , 660 .
We acknowledged in Bellotti that numerous “ interests of the highest importance ” can justify campaign finance regulation .
435 U. S. , at 788–789 .
But we found no evidence that these interests were served by the Massachusetts law .
Id. , at 789 .
We left open the possibility that our decision might have been different if there had been “ record or legislative findings that corporate advocacy threatened imminently to undermine democratic processes , thereby denigrating rather than serving First Amendment interests . ”
Ibid .
Austin and McConnell , then , sit perfectly well with Bellotti .
Indeed , all six Members of the Austin majority had been on the Court at the time of Bellotti , and none so much as hinted in Austin that they saw any tension between the decisions .
The difference between the cases is not that Austin and McConnell rejected First Amendment protection for corporations whereas Bellotti accepted it .
The difference is that the statute at issue in Bellotti smacked of viewpoint discrimination , targeted one class of corporations , and provided no PAC option ; and the State has a greater interest in regulating independent corporate expenditures on candidate elections than on referenda , because in a functioning democracy the public must have faith that its representatives owe their positions to the people , not to the corporations with the deepest pockets .
* * *
In sum , over the course of the past century Congress has demonstrated a recurrent need to regulate corporate participation in candidate elections to “ ‘ [ p]reserv[e ] the integrity of the electoral process , preven[ t ] corruption , … sustai [ n ] the active , alert responsibility of the individual citizen , ’ ” protect the expressive interests of shareholders , and “ ‘ [ p]reserv[e ] … the individual citizen ’s confidence in government . ’ ” McConnell , 540 U. S. , at 206–207 , n. 88 ( quoting Bellotti , 435 U. S. , at 788–789 ; first alteration in original ) .
These understandings provided the combined impetus behind the Tillman Act in 1907 , see Automobile Workers , 352 U. S. , at 570 –575 , the Taft - Hartley Act in 1947 , see WRTL , 551 U. S. , at 511 ( Souter , J. , dissenting ) , FECA in 1971 , see NRWC , 459 U. S. , at 209 –210 , and BCRA in 2002 , see McConnell , 540 U. S. , at 126–132 .
Continuously for over 100 years , this line of “ [ c ] ampaign finance reform has been a series of reactions to documented threats to electoral integrity obvious to any voter , posed by large sums of money from corporate or union treasuries . ”
WRTL , 551 U. S. , at 522 ( Souter , J. , dissenting ) .
Time and again , we have recognized these realities in approving measures that Congress and the States have taken .
None of the cases the majority cites is to the contrary .
The only thing new about Austin was the dissent , with its stunning failure to appreciate the legitimacy of interests recognized in the name of democratic integrity since the days of the Progressives .
IV
Having explained why this is not an appropriate case in which to revisit Austin and McConnell and why these decisions sit perfectly well with “ First Amendment principles , ” ante , at 1 , 48 , I come at last to the interests that are at stake .
The majority recognizes that Austin and McConnell may be defended on anticorruption , antidistortion , and shareholder protection rationales .
Ante , at 32 – 46 .
It badly errs both in explaining the nature of these rationales , which overlap and complement each other , and in applying them to the case at hand .
The Anticorruption Interest
Undergirding the majority ’s approach to the merits is the claim that the only “ sufficiently important governmental interest in preventing corruption or the appearance of corruption ” is one that is “ limited to quid pro quo corruption . ”
Ante , at 43 .
This is the same “ crabbed view of corruption ” that was espoused by Justice Kennedy in McConnell and squarely rejected by the Court in that case .
540 U. S. , at 152 .
While it is true that we have not always spoken about corruption in a clear or consistent voice , the approach taken by the majority cannot be right , in my judgment .
It disregards our constitutional history and the fundamental demands of a democratic society .
On numerous occasions we have recognized Congress ’ legitimate interest in preventing the money that is spent on elections from exerting an “ ‘ undue influence on an officeholder ’s judgment ’ ” and from creating “ ‘ the appearance of such influence , ’ ” beyond the sphere of quid pro quo relationships .
Id. , at 150 ; see also , e.g. , id. , at 143–144 , 152–154 ; Colorado II , 533 U. S. , at 441 ; Shrink Missouri , 528 U. S. , at 389 .
Corruption can take many forms .
Bribery may be the paradigm case .
But the difference between selling a vote and selling access is a matter of degree , not kind .
And selling access is not qualitatively different from giving special preference to those who spent money on one ’s behalf .
Corruption operates along a spectrum , and the majority ’s apparent belief that quid pro quo arrangements can be neatly demarcated from other improper influences does not accord with the theory or reality of politics .
It certainly does not accord with the record Congress developed in passing BCRA , a record that stands as a remarkable testament to the energy and ingenuity with which corporations , unions , lobbyists , and politicians may go about scratching each other ’s backs — and which amply supported Congress ’ determination to target a limited set of especially destructive practices .
The District Court that adjudicated the initial challenge to BCRA pored over this record .
In a careful analysis , Judge Kollar - Kotelly made numerous findings about the corrupting consequences of corporate and union independent expenditures in the years preceding BCRA ’s passage .
See McConnell , 251 F. Supp. 2d , at 555 –560 , 622–625 ; see also id. , at 804–805 , 813 , n. 143 ( Leon , J. ) ( indicating agreement ) .
As summarized in her own words :
“ The factual findings of the Court illustrate that corporations and labor unions routinely notify Members of Congress as soon as they air electioneering communications relevant to the Members ’ elections .
The record also indicates that Members express appreciation to organizations for the airing of these election - related advertisements .
Indeed , Members of Congress are particularly grateful when negative issue advertisements are run by these organizations , leaving the candidates free to run positive advertisements and be seen as ‘ above the fray . ’
Political consultants testify that campaigns are quite aware of who is running advertisements on the candidate ’s behalf , when they are being run , and where they are being run .
Likewise , a prominent lobbyist testifies that these organizations use issue advocacy as a means to influence various Members of Congress .
“ The Findings also demonstrate that Members of Congress seek to have corporations and unions run these advertisements on their behalf .
The Findings show that Members suggest that corporations or individuals make donations to interest groups with the understanding that the money contributed to these groups will assist the Member in a campaign .
After the election , these organizations often seek credit for their support … .
Finally , a large majority of Americans ( 80 % ) are of the view that corporations and other organizations that engage in electioneering communications , which benefit specific elected officials , receive special consideration from those officials when matters arise that affect these corporations and organizations . ”
Id. , at 623–624 ( citations and footnote omitted ) .
Many of the relationships of dependency found by Judge Kollar - Kotelly seemed to have a quid pro quo basis , but other arrangements were more subtle .
Her analysis shows the great difficulty in delimiting the precise scope of the quid pro quo category , as well as the adverse consequences that all such arrangements may have .
There are threats of corruption that are far more destructive to a democratic society than the odd bribe .
Yet the majority ’s understanding of corruption would leave lawmakers impotent to address all but the most discrete abuses .
Our “ undue influence ” cases have allowed the American people to cast a wider net through legislative experiments designed to ensure , to some minimal extent , “ that officeholders will decide issues … on the merits or the desires of their constituencies , ” and not “ according to the wishes of those who have made large financial contributions ” — or expenditures — “ valued by the officeholder . ”
McConnell , 540 U. S. , at 153 . 63
When private interests are seen to exert outsized control over officeholders solely on account of the money spent on ( or withheld from ) their campaigns , the result can depart so thoroughly “ from what is pure or correct ” in the conduct of Government , Webster ’s Third New International Dictionary 512 ( 1966 ) ( defining “ corruption ” ) , that it amounts to a “ subversion … of the electoral process , ” Automobile Workers , 352 U. S. , at 575 .
At stake in the legislative efforts to address this threat is therefore not only the legitimacy and quality of Government but also the public ’s faith therein , not only “ the capacity of this democracy to represent its constituents [ but also ] the confidence of its citizens in their capacity to govern themselves , ” WRTL , 551 U. S. , at 507 ( Souter , J. , dissenting ) .
“ Take away Congress ’ authority to regulate the appearance of undue influence and ‘ the cynical assumption that large donors call the tune could jeopardize the willingness of voters to take part in democratic governance . ’ ” McConnell , 540 U. S. , at 144 ( quoting Shrink Missouri , 528 U. S. , at 390 ) .
64
The cluster of interrelated interests threatened by such undue influence and its appearance has been well captured under the rubric of “ democratic integrity . ”
WRTL , 551 U. S. , at 522 ( Souter , J. , dissenting ) .
This value has underlined a century of state and federal efforts to regulate the role of corporations in the electoral process .
65
Unlike the majority ’s myopic focus on quid pro quo scenarios and the free - floating “ First Amendment principles ” on which it rests so much weight , ante , at 1 , 48 , this broader understanding of corruption has deep roots in the Nation ’s history .
“ During debates on the earliest [ campaign finance ] reform acts , the terms ‘ corruption ’ and ‘ undue influence ’ were used nearly interchangeably . ”
Pasquale , Reclaiming Egalitarianism in the Political Theory of Campaign Finance Reform , 2008 U. Ill. L. Rev. 599 , 601 .
Long before Buckley , we appreciated that “ [ t ] o say that Congress is without power to pass appropriate legislation to safeguard … an election from the improper use of money to influence the result is to deny to the nation in a vital particular the power of self protection . ”
Burroughs v. United States , 290 U. S. 534 , 545 ( 1934 ) .
And whereas we have no evidence to support the notion that the Framers would have wanted corporations to have the same rights as natural persons in the electoral context , we have ample evidence to suggest that they would have been appalled by the evidence of corruption that Congress unearthed in developing BCRA and that the Court today discounts to irrelevance .
It is fair to say that “ [ t ] he Framers were obsessed with corruption , ” Teachout 348 , which they understood to encompass the dependency of public officeholders on private interests , see id. , at 373–374 ; see also Randall , 548 U. S. , at 280 ( Stevens , J. , dissenting ) .
They discussed corruption “ more often in the Constitutional Convention than factions , violence , or instability . ”
Teachout 352 .
When they brought our constitutional order into being , the Framers had their minds trained on a threat to republican self - government that this Court has lost sight of .
Quid Pro Quo Corruption
There is no need to take my side in the debate over the scope of the anticorruption interest to see that the Court ’s merits holding is wrong .
Even under the majority ’s “ crabbed view of corruption , ” McConnell , 540 U. S. , at 152 , the Government should not lose this case .
“ The importance of the governmental interest in preventing [ corruption through the creation of political debts ] has never been doubted . ”
Bellotti , 435 U. S. , at 788 , n. 26 .
Even in the cases that have construed the anticorruption interest most narrowly , we have never suggested that such quid pro quo debts must take the form of outright vote buying or bribes , which have long been distinct crimes .
Rather , they encompass the myriad ways in which outside parties may induce an officeholder to confer a legislative benefit in direct response to , or anticipation of , some outlay of money the parties have made or will make on behalf of the officeholder .
See McConnell , 540 U. S. , at 143 ( “ We have not limited [ the anticorruption ] interest to the elimination of cash - for - votes exchanges .
In Buckley , we expressly rejected the argument that antibribery laws provided a less restrictive alternative to FECA ’s contribution limits , noting that such laws ‘ deal[t ] with only the most blatant and specific attempts of those with money to influence governmental action ’ ” ( quoting 424 U. S. , at 28 ; alteration in original ) ) .
It has likewise never been doubted that “ [ o ] f almost equal concern as the danger of actual quid pro quo arrangements is the impact of the appearance of corruption . ”
Id. , at 27 .
Congress may “ legitimately conclude that the avoidance of the appearance of improper influence is also critical … if confidence in the system of representative Government is not to be eroded to a disastrous extent . ”
Ibid .
( internal quotation marks omitted ; alteration in original ) .
A democracy cannot function effectively when its constituent members believe laws are being bought and sold .
In theory , our colleagues accept this much .
As applied to BCRA § 203 , however , they conclude “ [t ] he anticorruption interest is not sufficient to displace the speech here in question . ”
Ante , at 41 .
Although the Court suggests that Buckley compels its conclusion , ante , at 40 – 44 , Buckley cannot sustain this reading .
It is true that , in evaluating FECA ’s ceiling on independent expenditures by all persons , the Buckley Court found the governmental interest in preventing corruption “ inadequate . ” 424 U. S. , at 45 .
But Buckley did not evaluate corporate expenditures specifically , nor did it rule out the possibility that a future Court might find otherwise .
The opinion reasoned that an expenditure limitation covering only express advocacy ( i.e. , magic words ) would likely be ineffectual , ibid . , a problem that Congress tackled in BCRA , and it concluded that “ the independent advocacy restricted by [ FECA § 608 ( e ) ( 1 ) ] does not presently appear to pose dangers of real or apparent corruption comparable to those identified with large campaign contributions , ” id. , at 46 ( emphasis added ) .
Buckley expressly contemplated that an anticorruption rationale might justify restrictions on independent expenditures at a later date , “ because it may be that , in some circumstances , ‘ large independent expenditures pose the same dangers of actual or apparent quid pro quo arrangements as do large contributions . ’ ” WRTL , 551 U. S. , at 478 ( opinion of Roberts , C. J. ) ( quoting Buckley , 424 U. S. , at 45 ) .
Certainly Buckley did not foreclose this possibility with respect to electioneering communications made with corporate general treasury funds , an issue the Court had no occasion to consider .
The Austin Court did not rest its holding on quid pro quo corruption , as it found the broader corruption implicated by the antidistortion and shareholder protection rationales a sufficient basis for Michigan ’s restriction on corporate electioneering .
494 U. S. , at 658–660 .
Concurring in that opinion , I took the position that “ the danger of either the fact , or the appearance , of quid pro quo relationships [ also ] provides an adequate justification for state regulation ” of these independent expenditures .
Id. , at 678 .
I did not see this position as inconsistent with Buckley ’s analysis of individual expenditures .
Corporations , as a class , tend to be more attuned to the complexities of the legislative process and more directly affected by tax and appropriations measures that receive little public scrutiny ; they also have vastly more money with which to try to buy access and votes .
See Supp. Brief for Appellee 17 ( stating that the Fortune 100 companies earned revenues of $ 13.1 trillion during the last election cycle ) .
Business corporations must engage the political process in instrumental terms if they are to maximize shareholder value .
The unparalleled resources , professional lobbyists , and single - minded focus they bring to this effort , I believed , make quid pro quo corruption and its appearance inherently more likely when they ( or their conduits or trade groups ) spend unrestricted sums on elections .
It is with regret rather than satisfaction that I can now say that time has borne out my concerns .
The legislative and judicial proceedings relating to BCRA generated a substantial body of evidence suggesting that , as corporations grew more and more adept at crafting “ issue ads ” to help or harm a particular candidate , these nominally independent expenditures began to corrupt the political process in a very direct sense .
The sponsors of these ads were routinely granted special access after the campaign was over ; “ candidates and officials knew who their friends were , ” McConnell , 540 U. S. , at 129 .
Many corporate independent expenditures , it seemed , had become essentially interchangeable with direct contributions in their capacity to generate quid pro quo arrangements .
In an age in which money and television ads are the coin of the campaign realm , it is hardly surprising that corporations deployed these ads to curry favor with , and to gain influence over , public officials .
The majority appears to think it decisive that the BCRA record does not contain “ direct examples of votes being exchanged for … expenditures . ”
Ante , at 45 ( internal quotation marks omitted ) .
It would have been quite remarkable if Congress had created a record detailing such behavior by its own Members .
Proving that a specific vote was exchanged for a specific expenditure has always been next to impossible : Elected officials have diverse motivations , and no one will acknowledge that he sold a vote .
Yet , even if “ [ i] ngratiation and access … are not corruption ” themselves , ibid . , they are necessary prerequisites to it ; they can create both the opportunity for , and the appearance of , quid pro quo arrangements .
The influx of unlimited corporate money into the electoral realm also creates new opportunities for the mirror image of quid pro quo deals : threats , both explicit and implicit .
Starting today , corporations with large war chests to deploy on electioneering may find democratically elected bodies becoming much more attuned to their interests .
The majority both misreads the facts and draws the wrong conclusions when it suggests that the BCRA record provides “ only scant evidence that independent expenditures … ingratiate , ” and that , “ in any event , ” none of it matters .
Ibid .
In her analysis of the record , Judge Kollar - Kotelly documented the pervasiveness of this ingratiation and explained its significance under the majority ’s own touchstone for defining the scope of the anticorruption rationale , Buckley .
See McConnell , 251 F. Supp. 2d , at 555 –560 , 622–625 .
Witnesses explained how political parties and candidates used corporate independent expenditures to circumvent FECA ’s “ hard - money ” limitations .
See , e.g. , id. , at 478–479 .
One former Senator candidly admitted to the District Court that “ ‘ [ c] andidates whose campaigns benefit from [ phony “ issue ads ” ] greatly appreciate the help of these groups .
In fact , Members will also be favorably disposed to those who finance these groups when they later seek access to discuss pending legislation . ’ ” Id. , at 556 ( quoting declaration of Sen. Dale Bumpers ) .
One prominent lobbyist went so far as to state , in uncontroverted testimony , that “ ‘ unregulated expenditures — whether soft money donations to the parties or issue ad campaigns — can sometimes generate far more influence than direct campaign contributions . ’ ” Ibid . ( quoting declaration of Wright Andrews ; emphasis added ) .
In sum , Judge Kollar - Kotelly found , “ [t ] he record powerfully demonstrates that electioneering communications paid for with the general treasury funds of labor unions and corporations endears t

ALERT : This talk contains graphic sexual language .
At TED2009 , audience member Cindy Gallop gave a 4 - minute presentation that became one of the event ’s most talked about .
Speaking from her personal experience , she argued that hardcore pornography had distorted the way a generation of young men think about sex , and talked about how she was fighting back with the launch of a website to correct the myths being propagated .
Later , she expanded her brief presentation into a provocative and thought - provoking TED Book .
Her talk ’s graphic content means we can’t include it in the main run of full TED Talks , which go by default to subscribers , including children .
But we do think it ’s worth posting here .
Cindy is no prude , and not everyone will enjoy the graphic language on her website , MakeLoveNotPorn.com .
But she has courageously ( and wittily ) raised an important issue , which we think deserves wider attention .
Constructive comments welcome !

Science correspondent , BBC News
The bottlenose dolphin is a toothed whale that uses echolocation Scientists have found a striking similarity in the DNA that enables some bats and dolphins to echolocate .
A key gene that gives their ears the ability to detect high - frequency sound has produced the same amino acid changes over time in both creatures .
The researchers report their findings in the journal Current Biology .
It may be the first time that identical genetics has been shown to underpin the evolution of similar characteristics in very different organisms .
Nature is full of cases where the path taken by evolution has resulted in the same traits , or phenotypes , developing independently in diverse animal groups .
Examples would include the tusks displayed by elephants and walruses , or the bioluminescence seen in fireflies and jellyfish .
" It 's common on a morphological scale but it 's assumed not to occur at a DNA level because there are so many different ways to arrive at the same solution , " explained Dr Stephen Rossiter of Queen Mary 's School of Biological and Chemical Sciences .
" The fact that we 're able to link convergence of the DNA with a phenotype I think is unique , and in such a complex phenotype as hearing as well , " he told BBC News .
Animal and human
Many bats and toothed whales like dolphins have exceptional hearing , and are able to track down their prey by emitting high - frequency noises and then listening for the echoes that bounce back .
Critical to echolocation are tiny hairs in the inner ear that move in response to sound .
Their keen performance is driven by a particular protein known as prestin , which in turn is encoded by a gene , also known as prestin .
Those bats that echolocate use high - frequency sound to track small prey
Two studies published this week in Current Biology find that this gene in bats and dolphins has picked up the same mutations over time .
" We 've found a whole suite of amino acid changes that are common to these two groups that have evolved in parallel , convergently , " Dr Rossiter said .
Both research teams also have evidence showing that these changes to prestin were selected for , suggesting that they must be critical for the animals ' echolocation for reasons the researchers do not yet fully understand .
" The results imply that there are very limited ways , if not only one way , for a mammal to hear high - frequency sounds , " said Professor Jianzhi Zhang of the University of Michigan , US , who led the other study .
This type of research is a beneficiary of the immense and ongoing effort to understand human genetics , which finds interesting targets for biologists from many fields to follow up .
Mutations in the prestin gene in humans have been shown to be associated with the loss of high - frequency hearing .
It was this revelation that initiated the study of prestin's role in echolocation .

Pledge Not to Seek ' Emergency ' War Funds Gives Way to Another Request
When President Obama requested a $ 106 billion “ emergency ” was funding bill in early 2009 , it was promised that this would be the last time the administration would ever seek such a supplement , and that they would instead simply increase the size of their regular defense funding bill to cover the wars .
And indeed , the FY 2010 defense funding bill indeed included a massive bump in funding for the assorted ongoing wars , one that was shrugged off however as it was said to replace the annual “ emergency ” requests .
In spite of this , President Obama is now planning to ask for another $ 33 billion in “ emergency ” war funding to pay for his latest escalation of the war in Afghanistan , as well as to purchase yet more attack drones .
The president ’s initial projections for war costs , given shortly after he took office , seem remarkably low in retrospect , as they have n’t anticipated the continuation of the Iraq occupation at such a high level nor the multiple escalations of the Afghan War since he took office last year .
The idea of folding the war costs into the regular defense budget seemed reasonable , since the United States is pretty much perpetually at war nowadays .
The addition of a new “ emergency ” request on top of the increased defense budget has given Americans the worst of both worlds , and given Congress ample opportunity to pump billions in irrelevant projects into “ ca n’t miss ” war bills .
Washington ( CNN ) -- 2010 has opened on an unsettling note for Democrats in the U.S. Senate .
Connecticut 's Chris Dodd and North Dakota 's Byron Dorgan -- two longtime power players in the chamber -- have announced their intention to step down at the end of the year .
If history is any guide , the party now faces an uphill struggle to maintain its 60 - seat supermajority .
Failure to do so could have serious ramifications for President Obama as he tries to look past the health care debate and tackle global warming , ballooning budget deficits and a range of other politically contentious issues .
The fight over health care reform has clearly demonstrated that 60 votes is now the minimum threshold for passing major legislation through the Senate .
Anything less leaves the majority party at the mercy of a minority increasingly willing to employ the filibuster to grind the legislative gears of the Senate to a halt .
Democrats currently have exactly 60 members in their caucus ; Republicans have 40 .
The GOP knows that presidents typically lose House and Senate seats during midterm elections , and is banking on that fact to block much of Obama 's agenda .
" Midterm elections are usually low - turnout affairs , " noted CNN polling director Keating Holland .
" Conservative Republicans , however , have been energized by their strong opposition to Obama 's agenda .
They 're likely to vote this November .
Many liberals , on the other hand , do n't feel Obama has pushed strong enough on their issues .
It 's unclear at the moment if they 'll be as likely to show at the polls . "
This year , Democrats must defend 19 seats , including an opening that occurred when veteran Massachusetts Sen .
Ted Kennedy died .
A special election for Kennedy 's seat -- widely expected to be won by the Democrats -- will take place January 19 .
Republicans are defending 18 seats .
The GOP , according to many analysts , is now placing a high priority on picking up Democratic seats in Colorado , Delaware , Illinois , Nevada , North Dakota and Pennsylvania .
The Illinois and Delaware seats were once held by Obama and Vice President Joe Biden , respectively .
Obama 's replacement , Sen. Roland Burris , was immediately tainted after being tapped to fill Obama 's vacancy by Rod Blagojevich , the state 's scandal - plagued former governor .
Burris is not seeking election in his own right .
Biden 's replacement , Sen .
Ted Kaufman , is likely to step aside in favor of the vice president 's son , Delaware Attorney General Beau Biden , analysts believe .
Delaware 's longtime GOP congressman , Mike Castle , is being touted as the likely Republican nominee .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D - Nevada , is struggling to manage Obama 's more progressive agenda while also seeking a fifth term from his traditionally conservative state .
Republicans , however , are having a tough time unifying behind an opponent .
At the same time , five - term Pennsylvania Sen .
Arlen Specter remains a high - profile target for conservatives enraged by his decision to switch from the Republican Party to the Democratic Party last year .
Before he can get to the general election , Specter will face a tough primary challenge from Rep. Joe Sestak , a former admiral .
Also in the GOP 's crosshairs is two - term Arkansas Democrat Blanche Lincoln , who recently cast a tough political vote in favor of Reid 's health care bill .
Dodd 's decision to retire , however , is widely believed to be beneficial to Democratic chances in largely liberal Connecticut .
The state 's popular Democratic attorney general , Richard Blumenthal , declared his candidacy a few hours after Dodd announced he was stepping down .
Democratic leaders , for their part , are placing a high priority on picking up GOP seats in Kentucky , Missouri , New Hampshire , and Ohio .
Republicans have been stung by incumbents ' decisions to retire in all four states .
Louisiana , a more conservative state , has attracted the interest of Democratic strategists .
First - term GOP Sen .
David Vitter has been tarred by his 2007 admission that he had a relationship with a prostitute .
This year 's race in Florida has also become an increasingly high - profile contest , largely due to Republican infighting .
GOP Sen .
George LeMieux , who was appointed to the Senate after former Sen .
Mel Martinez unexpectedly stepped down last year , is not seeking a full term .
The state 's GOP governor , Charlie Crist , was widely expected to take the seat , but is now facing an unexpectedly strong conservative primary challenge from former Florida House Speaker Marco Rubio .
Republicans are still , however , favored to hold the seat .
CNN 's Mark Preston and Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report .
If you ’re one of the many admirers who discovered Sunn O ) ) ) through last year ’s galaxy - shaking Monoliths and Dimensions , then you understand the soothing effects of doom metal .
As the band ’s guitarist Greg Anderson told author and enthusiast John Wray in a 2006 New York Times Magazine profile , “ I think low - frequency sound , when played above a certain volume , is very conducive to a meditative state or a trance . ”
This is n’t metal for headbanging ; it ’s metal to meditate to .
Although Anderson and his partner Stephen O’Malley have honed their brand of focused distortion to a therapeutic science , they ’re far from the only metalheads employing extreme low - end rumblings for our metaphysical benefit .
To aid you on your spiritual journey , we present this collection of notable releases from metal groups working to bring us closer to enlightenment through the heaviest of sounds .
Namaste !
Jesu – Jesu Download : “ We All Faulter ”
When Justin K. Broadrick disbanded Godflesh , one of the earliest industrial - metal bands , no one expected the former guitar prodigy to turn around and invent another metal subgenre .
But that ’s just what he did with Jesu , the one - man recording project he started in 2003 and named after Godflesh ’s last recorded track .
Jesu have since grown to become a full , prolific band , releasing a bundle of EPs , splits , and albums each year .
But their self - titled debut is still the best example of their transcendent blend of shoegazey melody and brutally heavy doom .
Best moment : opener “ Your Path to Divinity ” features one of the greatest two - note riffs ever to sustain a nine - minute song .
Eagle Twin – The Unkindness of Crows Download : “ Murder Of … ”
The first thing that occurred to us upon hearing this two piece ’s 2009 debut was : rock needs more Tuvan - style throat singing .
But that ’s ignoring the album ’s other strengths .
The tempos lurch along as if caught in a primordial ooze , and the register stays low thanks to singer / guitarist Gentry Densley ’s gruff baritone .
But the songs twist and turn through passages of free - form improv , pounding riffs , and pitch - black psychedelia , each less predictable than the last .
It ’s no wonder that during their 2009 gig opening for dream lineup Pelican , Earth , and Sunn O ) ) ) , Eagle Twin more than held their own , almost blowing their stagemates out of the water .
Whisper Room – Birch White Download : “ 1 ”
Canadian guitarist and effects wizard Aidan Baker has already made a name for himself with his shimmery , fuzz - laden releases under the moniker Nadja , but in Whisper Room , a new instrumental trio with bassist Neil Wiernik and drummer Jakob Thiesen , he seems even more at home .
Freed by the live - band setting , his otherworldly guitar effects probe corners unexplored by Nadja ’s deliberately monotonous drones .
Hushed and ambiguous , Birch
White is the music you might hear in the back of your head upon reaching another plane of existence .
Grails – Doomsdayer ’s Holiday Download : “ Reincarnation Blues ”
Portland - based collective Grails have always resisted the tropes of their underground metal scene , forsaking the power chord , the blues - based riff , and vocals of any kind in favor of Middle Eastern scales , Asian instruments , and the atmosphere of a smoke - filled , subterranean chamber .
On 2008 ’s Doomsdayer ’s Holiday , they let comparatively loose .
Special honors go to “ Reincarnation Blues ” for the use of what sounds like a classical Chinese erhu in the name of rocking the hell out .
Who says musical meditation ca n’t be this invigorating ?
Boris – Flood
Boris are now well - known to American metal fans , thanks to their anthemic stoner - metal albums Akuma No Uta and Pink .
But they ’ve been plying their amp - worshiping trade since 1996 in their native Japan , where some of their most interesting records remain untouched by Western labels .
2000 ’s Flood is one of Boris ’ most patient albums , building over many long minutes from a lonely , delay - drenched guitar lick to the crushing depth of oceans .
Boris have always been sort of a schizophrenic act , part drone , part pyrotechnic stoner rock , part doom metal riff - masters .
All of their multiple identities are worth paying attention to .
Om – Pilgrimage Download : “ Unitive Knowledge of the Godhead ”
Om are what metalheads dance to .
Possessed with uncanny powers of rhythm , this guitarless two piece builds spiritually charged monuments to the almighty groove , shepherding eager followers along half - hour , three - note marathons .
Om ’s music may be minimalist , but simple it ai n’t .
This is rock pared of all its fat , without losing any of the power .
One of the best existing videos of Om ’s live prowess takes place in a city that matches their music ’s spiritual themes :
Earth – The Bees Made Honey in the Lion ’s Skull Download : “ Omens and Portents I : The Driver ”
What do you get when you take drone metal and strip away all the distortion ?
Earth , reborn .
One of the original drone - metal groups , they ’ve gone so far as to re-release some earlier work in their newly clean style .
The result resembles the soundtrack to a lost Sergio Leone film , if Ennio Morricone had contracted a four - piece rock band .
The Bees Made Honey in the Lion ’s Skull is proof that heaviness can be achieved through methods other than high volume .
Neurosis – The Eye of Every Storm Stream : “ No River to Take Me Home ”
Fans of these revered experimentalists hailed their last album , 2007 ’s Given to the Rising , as a return to form .
That ’s selling its predecessor short .
Though substantially more melodic than Neurosis ’ most popular albums — some of the heaviest music that exists — 2004 ’s The Eye of Every Storm strikes a near - perfect balance between loud and soft , menacing and melancholy .
Neurosis are one of those rare bands that showcases metal at both its darkest and its most beautiful .
So tell us what you think .
Did we miss anything ?
Which albums , metal or otherwise , bring you to that higher state ?

By spring of 2000 , Texas governor George W. Bush was wrapping up the Republican nomination for president , and he went on to dominate the rest of the decade .
If Dickens proclaimed of the 1790s revolutionary era in France that it was the best of times and the worst of times , the reactionary Bush era was just the worst of times .
I declare it the decade of the American oligarchs .
Just as the end of the Cold War and the fall of the Soviet Union allowed the emergence of a class of lawless ‘ Oligarchs ’ in Russia , so Neoliberal tax policies and deregulation produced American equivalents .
( For more on the analogy , see Michael Hudson . )
We have always had robber barons in American politics , but the Neoliberal moment created a new social class .
At about 1.3 million adults , it is not too large to have some cohesive interests , and its corporations , lobbyists , and other institutions allow it to intervene systematically in politics .
It owns 45 percent of the privately held wealth and is heading toward 50 , i.e. toward a Banana Republic .
Thus , we have a gutted fairness doctrine and the end of anti-trust concerns in ownership of mass media , allowing a multi- billionaire like Rupert Murdoch to buy up major media properties and to establish a cable television channel which is nothing but oligarch propaganda .
They established ‘ think tanks ’ like the American Enterprise Institute , which hires only staff that are useful agents of the interests of the very wealthy , and which produce studies denying global climate change or lying about the situation in Iraq .
Bush - Cheney were not simply purveyors of wrong - headed ideas .
They were the agents of the one percent , and their policies make perfect sense if seen as attempts to advance the interests of this narrow class of persons .
It is the class that owns our mass media , that pays for the political campaigns of ‘ our ’ ( their ) representatives , that gives us the Bushes and Cheneys and Palins because they are useful to them , and that blocks progressive reform and legislation with the vast war chest funneled to them by deep tax cuts that allow them to use essential public resources , infrastructure and facilities gratis while making the middle class pay for them .
Here are my picks for the top ten worst things about the wretched period , which , however , will continue to follow us until the economy is re-regulated , anti-trust concerns again pursued , a new , tweaked fairness doctrine is implemented , and we return to a more normal distribution of wealth ( surely a quarter of the privately held wealth is enough for the one percent ? )
It is n’t about which party is in power ; parties can always be bought .
It is about how broadly shared resources are in a society .
Egalitarianism is unworkable , but over - concentration of wealth is also impractical .
The latter produced a lot of our problems in the past decade , and as long as such massive inequality persists , our politics will be lopsided .
10 . Stagnating worker wages and the emergence of a new monied aristocracy .
Of all the income growth of the entire country of the United States in the Bush years , the richest 1 percent of the working population , about 1.3 million persons , grabbed up over two - thirds of it .
The Reagan and Bush cuts in tax rates on the wealthy have created a dangerous little alien inside our supposedly democratic society , of the super - rich , with their legions of camp followers ( sometimes referred to as ‘ analysts ’ or ‘ economists ’ or ‘ journalists ’ ) .
The new lords and ladies are the Dick and Liz Cheneys and the people for whom they shill .
They are the Rupert Murdochs and the Richard Mellon Scaifes , and they are guaranteed to own more and more of the country as long as more progressive taxation ( i.e. pre-Reagan , not pre-Bush ) is not restored .
They are the ones who did n’t want a public universal health option , did not want the wars abroad to end abruptly , did not want the Copenhagen Climate convention to succeed .
They are driven by pure greed and narrow profit - seeking for themselves .
They always get their way , and they always will as long as you poor stupid bastards buy the line that when the government raises their taxes , it is taking something away from you .
It is the alliance of the Neoliberal super - rich with the new lower middle class populists led by W. and now by Sarah Palin that produces clown politics in the US unmatched in most advanced industrial countries with the possible exception of Italy .
9. Health and food insecurity increased for ordinary Americans .
Health care costs skyrocketed .
Most Americans in the work force who have health care are covered via their employers .
‘ From 1999 to 2009 health insurance premiums increased 132 % ” for the companies paying most of the costs of coverage to their employees .
Euromonitor adds , “ Average private health insurance premiums for a family of four in 1999 were US $ 5,485 per annum or 7.2 % of household disposable income .
2008 premiums were estimated at US $ 12,973 per annum or 14.8 % of average household disposable income . ”
By Bush ’s last year in office , food insecurity among American families was at a 14 - year high .
About 49 million Americans , one in six of us , worried about having enough food to eat at some points in that year , and resorted to soup lines , food stamps , or dietary shortcuts .
Some 16 million , according to the NYT , suffered from ‘ “ very low food security , ” meaning lack of money forced members to skip meals , cut portions or otherwise forgo food at some point in the year . ’
Hundreds of thousands of children are going hungry in the richest country in the world .
From being a proud , wealthy people , our social superiors reduced us to the estate of third - world peasants , so as to make sure their bonuses were bigger .
8 . The environment became more polluted .
The Bush administration was the worst on record on environmental issues .
Carbon emissions grew unchecked , and the threat of climate change accelerated .
In fact , Bush muzzled government climate scientists and had their reports rewritten by lawyers from Big Oil .
7 . The imperial presidency was ensconced in ways it will be difficult to pare back .
But note that its powers were never used against the oligarchs ( unlike the case in Putin ’s Russia ) , but rather deployed to ensure the continued destruction of the labor movement and the political bargaining power of workers and the middle class , and to harass and disrupt peace , rights and environmental movements .
A part of this process was the abrogation of fourth amendment protections against arbitrary search , seizure and snooping into people ’s mail and effects , and of other key constitutional rights under vague and unconstitutional rubrics such as ‘ providing material aid to terrorists , '( rights which seem unlikely ever to be restored ) .
6 . The Katrina flood and the destruction of much of historic African - American New Orleans , and the massive failure of the Bush administration to come to the aid of one of America ’s great cities .
The administration ’s unconcern about the unsound dam infrastructure , about climate change , and about the fate of the victims are all a wake - up call for what all of us have in store from the small social class that Bush served .
5 . The Bush administration ’s post -2002 mishandling of Afghanistan , where the Taliban had been overthrown successfully in 2001 and were universally despised .
The Bush administration ’s attempt to assert itself with a big troop presence in the Pashtun provinces , its use of search and destroy tactics and missile strikes , its neglect of civilian reconstruction , and its failure to finish off al - Qaeda , allowed an insurgency gradually to grow .
It should have been nipped in the bud , but was not .
Once an insurgency becomes well established , it is defeated militarily only about 20 percent of the time .
Eight years later , the Neoconservative thrust into Central Asia ( in search of hydrocarbon leverage , or in a geopolitical pissing match with Russia and China ? ) of the early years of this decade has bequeathed us yet another war , this time one that could destabilize neighboring Pakistan– the world ’s sole Muslim nuclear power .
4 . The Iraq War , in which the US illegally launched a war of aggression that killed hundreds of thousands of Iraqis , displaced 4 million ( over a million abroad ) , destroyed entire cities such as Fallujah , set off a Sunni - Shiite civil war , allowed Baghdad to be ethnically cleansed of its Sunnis , practiced systematic and widespread torture before the eyes of the Muslim Middle East and the world , and immeasurably strengthened Iran ’s hand in the Middle East .
All this on false pretexts such as ‘ weapons of mass destruction ’ or ‘ democratization , ’ for the sake of opening the Iraqi oil markets to US hydrocarbon firms — a significant faction of the oligarchic class .
Cost to the US in American military life : 4,373 dead as of Dec 15 and 31,603 wounded in combat .
The true totals of war - related dead and injured are higher , since 30,000 troops who were only diagnosed with brain injuries on their return to the US are not counted in the statistics , according to Michael Munk .
The cost of the Iraq War when everything is taken into account will likely be $ 3 trillion .
3 . The great $ 12 trillion Bank Robberry , in which unscrupulous bankers and financiers were deregulated and given free rein to create worthless derivatives , sell impossible mortgages to uninformed marks who could not understand their complicated terms , and then to roll this garbage up into securities re-sold like the
Cheshire cat , with a big visible smile of asserted value hanging in the air even as their actual worth disappeared into thin air .
Having allowed the one - percent oligarchs to capture most of the increase of the country ’s wealth in recent decades , Bush and Paulsen now initiated the surrender to them of nearly a further entire year ’s gross domestic product of the US , stealing it from the rest of us by deficit budget financing that will have the effect of deflating our savings and property values and relative value of our currency against other world currencies .
That is , we are to be further beggared for sake of the super - rich .
And while the banks and bankers are held harmless , the hardworking Americans who have lost and will lose their homes are extended virtually no help .
While 500,000 American children will go hungry at least some of the time this year , the Oligarchs at Goldman , Sachs , will get millions in bonuses , on the backs of the ordinary taxpayers .
It seems likely to me that the creation of a pool of vast excess liquidity for the super - rich by the Reagan - Cheney tax cuts was what impelled them to develop the derivatives , since they had too much capital for ordinary investment purposes and were restlessly seeking new gaming tables .
The conclusion is that until we get our gini coefficient back into some sort of synch , we are likely at risk for further such meltdowns .
2 . The September 11 attacks on New York and Washington by al - Qaeda , an organization that stemmed from the Reagan administration ’s anti-Soviet jihad in the 1980s and which decided that , having defeated one superpower , it could take down the other .
Al - Qaeda ’s largely Arab volunteer fighters had confronted the Soviets over their occupation of a major Muslim country , Afghanistan .
Bin Laden was himself a Neoliberal Oligarch , but he broke with the Gulf consensus of seeking a US security umbrella , thus creating a fissure within his powerful social class .
Al - Qaeda viewed the US as only a slightly less objectionable occupier , though they were willing to make an alliance of convenience in the 1980s .
But they were increasingly enraged and galvanized to strike , they said , by the post - Gulf - War sanctions on Iraq that killed 500,000 children , the debilitating Israeli occupation of the Palestinians , and the establishment of US bases in the holy Arabian Peninsula ( with its oil riches that Bin Laden believed were being looted for pennies by the West , aided by a supine and corrupt Saudi dynasty ) .
Al - Qaeda was a small fringe crackpot group of murderous conspiracy theorists , since most of what they considered an American ‘ occupation ’ of Muslims was no such thing .
The leasing of Prince Sultan Air Base in Saudi Arabia was comparable to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan ?
They intended to make themselves look like a world - historical force , and the US new Oligarchs , who no longer had the international Communist conspiracy with which to scare the American public into letting them have their way , were happy to buy in to the hyping of al - Qaeda , as well .
But the catastrophe was not only the attacks , deadly and horrific though they were , but the alacrity with which Americans surrendered their birthright of yeoman liberties to a Bonapartist regime that ran roughshod over law , the constitution , the Congress , and anyone , such as Ambassador Joe Wilson , who dared oppose it .
1 . The constitutional coup of 2000 , in which Bush was declared the winner of an election he had lost , with the deployment of the most ugly racial and other low tricks in the ballot counting and the intervention of a partisan and far right - wing Supreme Court ( itself drawn from or serving the oligarchs ) , and which gave us the worst president in the history of the union , who proceeded to drive the country off a cliff for the succeeding 8 years .
And that is because he was not our president , but theirs .

Vatican City ( CNN ) -- Pope Benedict XVI championed the environment in the Vatican 's annual World Day of Peace message .
In his address , called " If You Want to Cultivate Peace , Protect Creation , " the pope said peace with the natural environment is the beginning of peace with all of God 's creation , including people .
" Respect for creation is of immense consequence , not least because creation is the beginning and the foundation of all God 's works , and its preservation has now become essential for the pacific coexistence of mankind , " the pope said .
The papal message of peace comes a week after the traditional Christmas address known as " Urbi et Orbi " -- Latin for " To the City and the World " -- a message of hope for the world 's afflicted .
During the Christmas Eve Mass the night before , Benedict was dragged to the ground after a woman jumped a barrier and grabbed his robes .
The pope appeared uninjured .
In his homily , the 82 - year - old pontiff asked parishioners to consider the possible effect of an ecological crisis on the stability and peace of the world -- a world in which there is increasing competition for the " fruitfulness of the Earth . "
" Can we remain impassive in the face of actual and potential conflicts involving access to natural resources ? " the pope asked Friday .
" All these are issues with a profound impact on the exercise of human rights , such as the right to life , food , health and development . "
" Technologically advanced societies must be prepared to encourage more sober lifestyles , while reducing their energy consumption and improving its efficiency , " while preparing " sustainable strategies to satisfy the energy needs of the present and future generations , " he said .
Pope Benedict XVI challenged the faithful to be good stewards of what " God has given us , " suggesting that peace with the Earth will lead to peace on Earth .
" For this reason , it is imperative that mankind renew and strengthen that covenant between human beings and the environment , which should mirror the creative love of God , from whom we come and toward whom we are journeying , " he said .
Upon landing in New York on Thursday , Ma’an News Agency ’s Jared Malsin , a US citizen , said Interior Ministry staff pressured him into dropping a legal challenge against his deportation order just two hours after his lawyer left for the day .
After signing a hand - written letter that Malsin said he believed was a “ formality , ” ministry staff sent the paper to District Judge Kobi Vardi , who had presided over Malsin ’s case , and the judge decided to lift the stay of deportation order .
A motion from Ma’an attorney Castro Daoud , requesting that his client ’s hearing continue in his absence , was filed and pending decision as the ruling to expel the journalist was made .
Malsin was subsequently placed onto an El Al flight to New York .
“ None of this was my decision , ” he emphasized in a phone interview minutes after arriving at John F. Kennedy International Airport early Thursday morning local time , rejecting reports that he left Israel voluntarily .
“ There ’s no such thing as a voluntary deportation .
I was deported , period . ”
Hours earlier , in an armored car en route to the plane , Malsin said he was unaware there were legal implications to the paper .
“ I had no idea I was waving anything , no clue , ” he said , explaining how Interior Ministry officials coerced him into creating a legal document to withdraw his case without an attorney present , and offered a misleading explanation over what he was signing .
The document apparently indicated Malsin was leaving the facility “ without personal coercion . ”
But Malsin said he was under the impression that the papers he signed would allow him to simply leave the airport while his case continued in Israel .
Indeed , Daoud had filed such a motion in Tel Aviv shortly before Malsin was instructed to sign the papers .
Justice Vardi had called for a hearing on Malsin ’s case on Tuesday , and when no date was set for the proceedings by the afternoon , Malsin and Daoud decided to seek permission for him to leave the detention center as the hearing went forward .
Daoud had previously indicated concern that Malsin ’s case was being dragged out , putting pressure on the journalist to leave before a legal decision was made .
In an e-mail from Malsin to Ma’an staff sent upon his arrival to his parents ’ home in New Hampshire , he said , about the paper , “ I thought it was a formality .
In retrospect I wish I had n’t signed it .
I believe the prison guards were extremely manipulative , misleading , mendacious in the way they dealt with me , ” he said , but “ I ’m just so relieved to be out . ”
Israel ’s explanation
Malsin ’s deportation was met with mixed reactions from Israeli officials .
Interior Ministry spokeswoman Sabine Hadad told The Associated Press that Malsin raised security suspicions during an investigation upon his arrival .
Hadad told the AP it was for these reasons that Malsin was being deported .
Then she told Israel ’s Hebrew - language Yedioth Ahronoth that he had voluntarily left Israel , adding , “ I guess he did n’t like it [ detention ] and chose to leave the country . ”
Allegations of Malsin being a security risk were made even at the start of the deportation process , with documents alleging Malsin ’s failure to cooperate with Israeli intelligence officers constituting such a threat .
The same day Hadad told the AP Malsin was a security threat , however , she was quoted by Reuters and the Washington Post as denying Malsin was refused a visa for political or security reasons .
Both rationales fit with some of the allegations in the court documents filed by the attorney general , but neither explanation took the full range of charges into account .
Among the Interior Ministry ’s complaints were that Malsin had authored articles “ inside the [ Palestinian ] territories , ” including some “ criticizing the State of Israel . ”
Early in Malsin ’s detention , Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ’s spokesman , Mark Regev , told the BBC that the allegations Malsin was being held because of his status as a journalist were “ absurd . ”
Caltech Pedestrian Detection Benchmark
Description
The Caltech Pedestrian Dataset consists of approximately 10 hours of 640x480 30 Hz video taken from a vehicle driving through regular traffic in an urban environment .
About 250,000 frames ( in 137 approximately minute long segments ) with a total of 350,000 bounding boxes and 2300 unique pedestrians were annotated .
The annotation includes temporal correspondence between bounding boxes and detailed occlusion labels .
More information can be found in our PAMI 2012 and CVPR 2009 benchmarking papers .

Benchmark Results
For details on the evaluation scheme please see our PAMI 2012 paper .
Note :
The evaluation scheme has evolved since our CVPR 2009 paper .
Note :
We render at most 15 top results per plot ( but always include the VJ and HOG baselines ) .
Caltech Pedestrian Testing Dataset :
We give two set of results : on 50 - pixel or taller , unoccluded or partially occluded pedestrians ( reasonable ) , and a more detailed breakdown of performance as in the paper ( detailed ) .
Caltech Pedestrian Training Dataset : Results on the Caltech training data : reasonable , detailed .
Caltech Pedestrian Japan Dataset : Similar to the Caltech Pedestrian Dataset ( both in magnitude and annotation ) , except video was collected in Japan .
We cannot release this data , however , we will benchmark results to give a secondary evaluation of various detectors .
Results : reasonable , detailed .
INRIA Pedestrian Test Dataset : Full image results on the INRIA Pedestrian dataset ( evaluation details ) .
ETH Pedestrian Dataset : Results on the ETH Pedestrian dataset ( evaluation details ) .
TUD - Brussels Pedestrian Dataset : Results on the TUD - Brussels Pedestrian dataset ( evaluation details ) .
Daimler Pedestrian Dataset : Results on the Daimler Pedestrian dataset ( evaluation details ) .
Submitting Results
Please contact us to include your detector results on this site .
We perform the evaluation on every 30th frame , starting with the 30th frame .
For each video , the results for each frame should be a text file , with naming as follows : " I00029.txt , I00059.txt , ... " .
Each text file should contain 1 row per detected bounding box , in the format " [ left , top , width , height , score ] " .
If no detections are found the text file should be empty ( but must still be present ) .
The directory structure should mimic the directory structure containing the videos : " set00/V000 , set00/V001 ... " .
Please see the output files for the evaluated algorithms ( available in the download section ) if the above description is unclear .
Note that during evaluation all detections for a given video are concatenated into a single text file , thus avoiding having tens of thousands of text files per detector ( see provided detector files for details ) .

New York Times Chairman Arthur Sulzberger Jr. appears close to announcing that the paper will begin charging for access to its website , according to people familiar with internal deliberations .
After a year of sometimes fraught debate inside the paper , the choice for some time has been between a Wall Street Journal - type pay wall and the metered system adopted by the Financial Times , in which readers can sample a certain number of free articles before being asked to subscribe .
The Times seems to have settled on the metered system .
One personal friend of Sulzberger said a final decision could come within days , and a senior newsroom source agreed , adding that the plan could be announced in a matter of weeks .
( Apple ’s tablet computer is rumored to launch on January 27 , and sources speculate that Sulzberger will strike a content partnership for the new device , which could dovetail with the paid strategy . )
It will likely be months before the Times actually begins to charge for content , perhaps sometime this spring .
Executive Editor Bill Keller declined to comment .
Times spokesperson Diane McNulty said : “ We ’ll announce a decision when we believe that we have crafted the best possible business approach .
No details till then . ”
The Times has considered three types of pay strategies .
One option was a more traditional pay wall along the lines of The Wall Street Journal , in which some parts of the site are free and some subscription - only .
For example , editors and business - side executives discussed a premium version of Andrew Ross Sorkin ’s DealBook section .
Another option was the metered system .
The third choice , an NPR - style membership model , was abandoned last fall , two sources explained .
The thinking was that it would be too expensive and cumbersome to maintain because subscribers would have to receive privileges ( think WNYC tote bags and travel mugs , access to Times events and seminars ) .
The Times has also decided against partnering with Journalism Online , the start - up run by Steve Brill and former Journal publisher L. Gordon Crovitz .
It has rejected entreaties by News Corp. chief digital officer Jon Miller , who is leading Rupert Murdoch ’s efforts to get rival publishers onboard to demand more favorable terms from Google and other web aggregators .
This fall , Miller met with Times digital chief Martin Nisenholtz , but nothing came of the talks .
The decision to go paid is monumental for the Times , and culminates a yearlong debate that grew contentious , people close to the talks say .
In favor of a paid model were Keller and managing editor Jill Abramson .
Nisenholtz and former deputy managing editor Jon Landman , who was until recently in charge of nytimes.com , advocated for a free site .
The argument for remaining free was based on the belief that nytimes.com is growing into an English - language global newspaper of record , with a vast audience — 20 million unique readers — that , Nisenholtz and others believed , would prove lucrative as web advertising matured .
( The nytimes.com homepage , for example , has sold out on numerous occasions in the past year . )
As other papers failed to survive the massive migration to the web , the Times would be the last man standing and emerge with even more readers .
Going paid would capture more circulation revenue , but risk losing significant traffic and with it ad dollars .
At an investor conference this fall , Nisenholtz alluded to this tension : “ At the end of the day , if we do n’t get this right , a lot of money falls out of the system . ”
But with the painful declines in advertising brought on by last year ’s financial crisis , the argument pushed by Keller and others — that online advertising might never grow big enough to sustain the paper ’s high - cost , ambitious journalism — gained more weight .
The view was that the Times needed to make the leap to some form of paid content and it needed to do it now .
The trick would be to build a source of real revenue through online subscriptions while still being able to sell significant online advertising .
The appeal of the metered model is that it charges high - volume readers while allowing casual browsers to sample articles for free , thus preserving some of the Times ’ online reach .
Landman disputes the notion of competing factions .
“ The idea of two camps is just wrong .
There ’s many shades to this , ” he told me .
Inside the newsroom , the protracted talks have frustrated staffers who want clarity on where the paper is headed .
“ It ’s a real problem , ” one staffer explained .
“ It ’s embarrassing and reflects badly on the Times that they ca n’t make a decision .
They ’re fighting among themselves . ”
What makes the decision so agonizing for Sulzberger is that it involves not just business considerations , but ultimately a self - assessment of just what Times journalism is worth to the world .
This fall , Keller told the Observer that at some point , the decision is a “ gut call about what we think the audience will accept . ”
Hanging over the deliberations is the fact that the Times ’ last experience with pay walls , TimesSelect , was deeply unsatisfying and exposed a rift between Sulzberger and his roster of A - list columnists , particularly Tom Friedman and Maureen Dowd , who grew frustrated at their dramatic fall - off in online readership .
Not long before the Times ultimately pulled the plug on TimesSelect , Friedman wrote Sulzberger a long memo explaining that , while he was initially supportive of TimesSelect , he ’d been alarmed that he had lost most of his readers in India and China and the Middle East .
“ As we got into it , it was clear to me I was getting cut off from a lot of my readers in India and China where 50 dollars per year would be equal to a quarter of college tuition , ” Friedman recently told me by phone .
“ What was coming to me anecdotally from my travels was the five worst words that as a columnist you ever want to hear : ‘ I used to read you before you went behind the wall . ’ ”
Friedman is now “ pro some kind of pay model , ” he says .
“ My own feeling is , we have to do anything we can to raise money , ” he told me .
“ At some point we gotta charge for our product . ”
I asked Friedman whether any of the technologists he meets during his globe - trotting had presented any groundbreaking ideas for how to save the Times and journalism .
While he ’s optimistic about the coming crop of tablets and e-readers , the answer is no .
“ We ’re in a megatransition .
It has n’t ever felt like anyone has the answer , ” he said .
“ My macro feeling is that I ’m glad I had this job at this time .
It was great working at the paper when it was on dead trees and could pay for itself . ”
In 1934 , four years before the superhero finally found a home at National Allied Publications , Jerry Siegel desperately needed an artist to work on his as - yet - unsuccessful Superman strip as a result of Joe Shuster ‘s temporary departure .
In an effort to secure his services , Siegel wrote the following letter to Buck Rogers artist Russell Keaton .
Ultimately he turned the offer down , but what ’s fascinating about this letter is the tantalising glimpse of a Superman that could ’ve been had Keaton agreed , as Siegel detailed an origin story unlike the extra- terrestrial version we actually grew to know .
The Man of Tomorrow indeed .

Dear Mr. Keaton :
You will find enclosed the first week ’s script for the cartoon strip , SUPERMAN .
While the idea is a trifle fantastic — a man with “ infinite strength ” —
I think it will follow the lines you like .
We begin with “ Superman ” as a child and follow his history all the way up to maturity when the real story begins : of his adventures in helping those in need .
Since Clark Kent possesses incredible strength there are great possibilities for humor and adventure in his experiences as a child and youth .
The story of his youth will run a great length before we detail his adventures as an adult .
Early , he will find that his great strength , instead of making friends for him , cause people to fear him .
Mothers will not permit their children to associate with him , he will be hated in school sports because he never loses , etc .
We can weave a very human story about him .
Here is the script for a possible sunday strip .
It will acquaint you with the secret of Clark Kent ’s origin .
1 . In his laboratory , the last man on earth worked furiously .
He had only a few moments left .
2. Giant cataclysms were shaking the reeling planet , destroying mankind .
It was in its last days , dying …
3 . The last man placed his infant babe within a small time - machine he had completed , launching it as —
4. — the laboratory walls caved - in upon him .
5 . The time - vehicle flashed back thru the centuries , alighting in the primitive year , 1935 A. D. A passing motorist sighted the metal cylinder …
6. … and upon investigating discovered the sleeping babe within .
7 . The infant was placed in an orphanage .
The first day , it playfully bent its metal bed out of shape .
The astounded attendants , of course , did not realize they were caring for a child whose physical structure was millions of years advanced from their own .
8 . The babe , named Clark Kent , was a physical wonder .
At the age of five , when an older boy sought to bully him , Clark sent him flying thru the air .
9 . Clark ’s colossal strength was a source of wonder and pleasure to him .
He found , at twelve , that he could easily shatter the world ’s high jump and dash records .
10 .
His powers increased unbelievably .
When maturity had been attained , Kent discovered he could leap over a ten story building , raise unheard - of weights , run as fast as an express train , and that nothing less than a bursting shell could penetrate his tough skin .
11 . & 12 .
Early , Kent decided he must turn his titanic strength into channels that would benefit mankind .
And so was created SUPERMAN , champion of the oppressed , the physical marvel who had sworn to devote his existence to helping those in need !
Let me know if you would care to work with me upon this strip .
I ’ll be glad to receive suggestions .
The idea , incidently , is liked by the General Manager of Bell Syndicate .
Awaiting your reply ….
Sincerely ,
( Signed , ‘ Jerome Siegel ’ )
From a longtime political operative …
I can expand on this thought if you want , but something roiling underneath in Democratic politics right now .
In nearly two decades in politics , I do n’t think I ’ve ever seen people who have spend their professionals lives electing Democrats to office as angry at the people they elect as they are right now .
We took him up on his offer and he expands on his comment after the jump …
Ok … .
Since 1992 , I ’ve been a Dem political operative specializing in opposition research , so I ’m pretty familiar with the back and forth negative attacks .
The sense of anger has been building for a while …. but here ’s what I sense is going on from friends and colleagues who I have talked to .
First , the politics :
Whether we pass HCR or not , and whether a D voted for It or not , they are going to be attacked on the negatives of HCR .
So if they pass something at all , at least they have an accomplishment they can argue about .
If not , what are they gonna say ?
Sorry , we ’ve wasted a year of your time and abandoned our top domestic priority .
2 . Our problem is not that we are liberal – it ’s that we are weak .
And abandoning HCR feeds that perception
3 . What other big thing will be able to do I we ca n’t do this – we will have smaller majorities , and less flexbility .
So the point is that all the politics say pass something so we can have a public fight about it .
The anger is stoked by the fact that the people we elect seem not to get the obvious ( to us ) point that not doing anything gives us no argument for the election .
And what is even more annoying is that its nadler , frank , weiner , maloney , grijalva hammering this right now .
They are all gonna get reelected – but they are gonna serve in the minority if we ca n’t get stuff accomplished .
The bottom line ..
The people I ’m talking too are wondering why in the hell we ’ve spent the last two decades trying to elect Democrats to office , when they abandon their public policy priorities because Martha Coakley runs the most incompetent campaign in history of the world … .
UPDATE , JAN 31 : Facebook released the following statement to Xtra :
“ The removal of Mr Scaia ’s photos was in no way intended to target him personally .
Instead , it resulted from the fact that monitoring content and responding to user reports across a user base of over 350 million people is a complex process that requires the work of a large team of reviewers .
While every effort is made to ensure consistency in reviews , there may be instances when this does not happen and we attempt to resolve those issues as quickly as possible .
We apologize for any inconvenience caused and are taking steps to try and ensure that this does not happen to Mr Scaia again . ”
***
JAN 30 :
In the battle that never seems to end , Facebook has once again censored a post - op photo of Dominic Scaia ’s bare chest — the same photo that got him banned from Facebook in December , for which he later received an apology .
Earlier this month , Facebook said it re-evaluated its policy concerning graphic imagery after Scaia ’s top surgery photos were censored .
Scaia is a female - to - male ( FTM ) transsexual .
In what was considered a victory for transgendered rights , a spokesperson for Facebook told Xtra on Jan 15 that Scaia could re-upload his photos , citing the importance of raising awareness about trans issues .
Five days later , Scaia received a personal apology from Facebook , admitting the company ’s “ errors . ”
But on Jan 29 , Scaia noticed that one of the photos he had posted to the Facebook group , “ Stop Transphobia on Facebook – Un- ban Dominic Scaia ” was missing .
The photo was also missing from his profile .
Scaia then received a message from Facebook telling him the photo violates the site ’s terms .
“ Are you kidding me ? ” says Scaia .
“ We just went through this whole thing , and I thought it was over .
I thought this was n’t going to happen again and obviously it ’s because someone reported the photo . ”
Facebook users are encouraged to monitor their friends ’ photos and to report pics that violate the terms of use .
According to Facebook ’s Help Centre , the company reviews all items reported by its users .
Scaia thinks Facebook needs to re-evaluate how it monitors photos and that Facebook employees should be educated about transgendered issues , including what an FTM post - op chest looks like .
“ This is n’t just about me , ” says Scaia .
“ I do n’t want this to happen to another guy , and it could very well happen if it ’s happening to me again . ”
Scaia says he felt happy and relieved when he was told two weeks ago that he could re-upload his photos .
Now , he ’s just frustrated .
“ It ’s definitely not over — not if this is going to continue to happen , ” says Scaia .
“ This is ridiculous . ”
Scaia has sent Facebook a message demanding to know why his photo was removed , but he has yet to hear back .
Xtra also contacted Facebook , and a spokesperson said they were looking into the matter .
Winter vomiting bug hits 500,000 a week as swamped NHS cancels operations and shuts wards
Spreading : Hospitals are suffering staff shortages as doctors and nurses fall to the virus ( file photo )
A stomach bug that has claimed up to 500,000 victims is putting the NHS under massive strain .
Hospitals closed more than 140 wards over the weekend in a bid to contain norovirus , the winter vomiting bug .
NHS trusts , already struggling with the aftermath of the Big Freeze , have had to cancel operations and ban visitors .
Some parts of Britain have seen record outbreaks of norovirus - a deeply unpleasant infection that causes violent stomach upsets .
Scientists fear cases will rise further over the next few weeks as normal life resumes after the freeze .
Dr Steve Field , chairman of the Royal College of GPs , said : ' It seems incredibly serious .
We know it peaks twice a year and it looks like we are in the middle of a second serious peak in a few months that could be affecting up to half a million people .
' We can only estimate the figures because most cases go unreported . '
Experts say that for every case in hospital there are hundreds more in the community .
Hugh Pennington , emeritus professor of microbiology at Aberdeen University , said : ' It does seem a very bad year .
' For most people it 's a short illness that lasts for two to four days .
' Although it 's very unpleasant , the vast majority will get better without any treatment .
The worry is for the elderly and those with pre-existing health problems . '
Unpleasant :
The norovirus is characterised by a number of symptoms - the first is nausea , followed by uncontrollable projectile vomiting
He added : ' The difference between norovirus and other viruses is that it hangs around and it's very difficult to get rid of .
You have to deep - clean wards before you can let patients back .
It is definitely putting a strain on the NHS . '
The outbreaks are forcing hospitals to delay discretionary operations such as hip and knee surgery .
There were already backlogs in many places after postponements caused by the icy weather .
Hospitals are also suffering staff shortages as doctors and nurses catch the virus .
When a ward is closed , it means no patients can be transferred from or into it and visitors are banned .
A marked rise in norovirus cases was seen in November and there now appears to be a second surge .
In the whole of January 2009 there were just 46 ward closures in England for the bug .
But at least 141 have been shut in the last two days alone - more than in the whole of last month .
Worry : Professor Hugh Pennington said that it seemed like ' a very bad year ' for the virus
London has seen record levels of the disease , with 58 confirmed outbreaks this month against 35 in the same period last year .
King 's College Hospital had four adult wards and one paediatric ward closed over the weekend .
Spokesman Mark Graver said : ' We are doing everything we can , but it 's very difficult to contain because its highly infectious .
As soon as someone vomits the spores go everywhere and they live for months .
' We do n't reopen a ward until it has been given a deep clean and until the very last person has been given the all - clear from the bug for 72 hours . '
Barking , Havering and Redbridge University Hospitals NHS
Trust has five wards closed at two hospitals .
' It 's particularly virulent this year , ' said a spokesman .
' It 's not just hospitals but also schools and nursing homes . '
The largest number of ward closures , ten , was at the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital .
Hospitals across the country are shutting their doors to visitors to limit the spread of the virus .
Family members are allowed on - site only to collect patients or if they can prove exceptional circumstances .
Professor Giuseppe Cornaglia , former president of the European Society of Clinical Microbiologists and Infectious Diseases , stressed the importance of infection control .
He said : ' It is extremely important to educate clinicians .
Many think infection control only concerns bacterial infections such as MRSA .
In fact , viral infections can be far more dangerous . '
But the Department of Health played down the problem , saying : ' Norovirus is not new , it is not a " superbug " and the vast majority of people recover with no long - term effects .
' The NHS deals effectively with norovirus outbreaks all year round and this year is no different . '
The Health Protection Agency said it was too soon to confirm a sharp rise in cases in January .
New York ( CNN ) -- Prosecutors in Brooklyn have charged a 38 - year - old woman with tricking a pregnant woman into taking an abortion - inducing drug because the suspect thought her husband had fathered the child with the other woman .
And after the baby was born two months premature , but survived , someone tried unsuccessfully to slip a toxic substance through hospital security to the infant in the guise of milk for the baby , according to prosecutors .
The suspect , Kisha Jones , allegedly went to great lengths to end the pregnancy of 25 - year - old Monique Hunter , according to a complaint filed by the Brooklyn district attorney 's office in an ongoing investigation that began over a month ago .
Jones is in jail facing multiple charges , including attempted abortion and assault , according to authorities .
The baby is in a hospital 's intensive care unit , according to the criminal complaint .
The complaint did not elaborate on Hunter 's condition but described her as providing information to investigators .
The complaint alleges that Jones in October used a doctor 's prescription pad to forge a prescription for Hunter for a drug that can induce labor , telling the pharmacist that the drug was needed for a " procedure . "
The complaint said it is not clear how Jones got a prescription notepad from a licensed doctor , but the doctor was not treating Hunter and said the prescription was not written by anyone in his office .
Authorities said that , after obtaining the drug , Jones called Hunter numerous times claiming to be the pregnant woman 's doctor 's office and telling Hunter that her doctor had sent a prescription for her to pick up and take immediately .
Hunter immediately took the drug after receiving the phone calls , thinking it was a legitimate prescription from her doctor , authorities said .
Soon after , she was rushed to a hospital with severe abdominal pain , and gave birth to a boy .
A source at the Brooklyn district attorney 's office confirmed to CNN that following the child 's birth , an unidentified man went to the hospital with what he claimed was breast milk for Hunter 's baby , but the liquid was later determined to be toxic .
Hospital staffers alerted police .
New York police say they are still investigating that incident and looking for the man involved .
According to authorities , in addition to attempted abortion and assault , Jones has been charged with reckless endangerment , forgery of a medical prescription , possession of a forged instrument and criminal impersonation .
An unidentified male at the Hunter residence responded to a phone call from CNN by saying that " nobody has any remarks about that situation . "
Jones was arraigned on Saturday and is being held without bail .
She is expected to appear again at a court hearing on Wednesday .

A strike by British Airways cabin crew planned for Christmas has been declared illegal in a High Court ruling .
The judge agreed with BA that the cabin crew 's union , Unite , had not correctly balloted its members on the strike .
The injunction means the 12 - day strike , in protest over job losses and a pay freeze , can not now go ahead .
Unite called it " a disgraceful day for democracy " and vowed to hold a fresh ballot of cabin crew if the dispute with BA was not resolved .
" There is something wrong with the law , " said Unite joint general secretary Derek Simpson .
He admitted that while there would be " great euphoria " among the travelling public , the union would immediately put in place plans for a fresh ballot alongside its continuing negotiations with BA .
" We 'll see at the end of the day who wins this , we will see at the end of the day proper democracy , proper justice , " added Mr Simpson .
If Unite does go ahead with another ballot , industrial relations laws would mean that fresh industrial action could not be announced until well into the new year .
Opportunity to reflect
The judge in the case , Mrs Justice Cox , agreed with BA that Unite 's ballot was invalid because it included workers that had already accepted voluntary redundancy .
The court injunction against the Christmas strike is temporary relief , not proper recovery : BA still needs to resolve its dispute with cabin crew over staffing levels and pay
Robert Peston , BBC business editor
Read Robert 's blog Q&A : What 's the dispute about ?
She also poured scorn on the timing of the planned strike .
" A strike of this kind over the 12 days of Christmas is fundamentally more damaging to BA and the wider public than a strike taking place at almost any other time of the year , " she said .
Mrs Justice
Cox also refused the union permission to appeal , but the union could apply directly to the Court of Appeal .
British Airways said the decision would be welcomed by " hundreds of thousands of families in the UK and around the world " .
" There was never any need for a strike and we hope that Unite will take this opportunity to reflect before deciding its next steps , " a statement from the company said .
" In recent days , we believe Unite has formed a better understanding of our position and of the ways in which we could move forward .
" It has also become very clear that our customers do not believe that old - style trade union militancy is relevant to our efforts to move British Airways back toward profitability . "
Dispute ' not settled '
Mr Simpson and Unite 's other joint general secretary , Tony Woodley , said the dispute was " far from settled " .
I 'm delighted it 's been stopped , we have the upmost respect and regard for our customers and I 'm glad we have the opportunity to show this over the festive season
BA cabin crew member
Send us your comments " While we have never wanted this dispute , it is a disgraceful day for democracy when a court can overrule such an overwhelming decision by employees taken in a secret ballot , " they said .
The original ballot saw 92.5 % of those balloted vote in favour of industrial action .
Bob Atkinson of travel website travelsupermarket.com said the one million passengers booked to travel with BA over Christmas and the new year " can now breathe a sigh of relief and carry on with their travel plans " .
" BA should now contact customers as soon as possible to confirm flights will be going ahead and normality has returned to the market , " he added .
" The threat of strike action has been hugely damaging for the British Airways brand and customer loyalty has been tested . "
One BA cabin crew worker contacted the BBC to say she was " delighted " the strike had been stopped .
" I voted for the strike but never dreamt it would be for 12 days over Christmas , " she said .
" I 'm delighted it 's been stopped , we have the upmost respect and regard for our customers and I 'm glad we have the opportunity to show this over the festive season . "

RAF fighter pilot Andy Green intends to get behind the wheel of a car that is capable of reaching 1,000 mph ( 1,610 km / h ) .
Powered by a rocket bolted to a Eurofighter - Typhoon jet engine , the Bloodhound car will mount an assault on the land speed record .
Wing Cmdr Green is writing a diary for the BBC News Website about his experiences working on the Bloodhound project and the team 's efforts to inspire national interest in science and engineering .
AVOIDING THE BIG ROLL I 've just seen the latest figures for participation in the Bloodhound education programme - over 3,300 schools , over 200 Further Education colleges and 35 universities .
Air pressure at Mach 1.3 on different shapes of rear suspension fairing
That 's over 10 % of all the schools in the UK , which is just incredible .
Perhaps the rest of the project team ought to feel under pressure from the education team - they seem to be outstripping our fund - raising and engineering efforts by a huge margin .
Still , our main aim is to create interest in science and engineering , so this is the way that it should be - the education team is out in front and the rest of us are under pressure to keep up !
The design office is certainly doing its best to keep up , with the " aerodynamic optimisation " ( or " getting the back end exactly right " ) programme tearing along .
The team ran 56 parametric models in four weeks , using the huge computing power available through our IT partner Intel .
Rumour has it that the Met Office is now feeling under pressure , as we 're using more computing power than they are ... and , in terms of aerodynamics , we 're forecasting sunshine !
A great effort from Mark Chapman , Bjorn Rodde and Ben Evans , who gave the rest of us the perfect Christmas present with these results .
While the aerodynamics will keep the car on the ground , it also needs to be dynamically safe as a car .
This includes putting the rear wheels wide enough apart to make sure that the car cannot roll over .
But how wide is that ?
Anyone want to put their name on the tail fin of Bloodhound SSC ?
Looking back at the Thrust SSC data , we saw a peak sideways ' G ' force of almost 1G - yikes !
That is huge ( about the same as the maximum cornering force that the average road car will produce ) .
If we put Bloodhound SSC 's rear wheels far enough apart to resist that , then the drag will prevent the car from reaching 1,000 mph .
Fortunately , Ron Ayers , our performance expert ( and one of the cleverest people I know ) has pointed out that Thrust SSC's wheels would not have generated 1G side loads by themselves - there just is n't that much grip on the desert .
Instead , it appears that the car developed a couple of degrees of yaw and this created a large aerodynamic side force , which pushed the car sideways but did not risk rolling it over .
We can leave the rear wheels where they are , without any danger of Bloodhound SSC rolling over .
Suddenly , I feel much happier .
Thanks , Ron .
We 've just had some really exciting news of a plan to include recycled materials in the car , which will reduce the carbon footprint for the car 's build .
This will also give us a great way to include recycling technology in our education programme .
We 're just working out the details now - more to follow shortly .
Finally , the chance to put your name on the fin of Bloodhound SSC is proving hugely popular .
The Union Flag on the fin will be made up of thousands of tiny coloured names , which is a great way for us to get children ( of all ages ! ) more involved in this astonishing piece of engineering .
Let 's hope that the " aerodynamic optimisation " does n't make the fin too much smaller ... 2009 was an amazing year and I can't wait to see what 's going to happen during 2010 .

By Augustus Melmotte , who lives and works in Hedgistan .
The administration is examining strategies for encouraging the ownership of fluffy kittens .
“ I think we can all agree , ” the president said , “ that in troubled times stroking a fluffy kitten can really help a struggling family to stay on course . ”
The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office has calculated that a tax break of approximately $ 750 for first - time kitten ownership would cost the government less than $ 400 per kitten in administrative overhead , for a total cost per kitten ( CPK ) of $ 1150 .
Larry Summers , who ( according to some eminent economists who used to run large universities in Massachusetts ) should have been named Treasury Secretary instead of that pasty - faced sycophant Geithner , because god damn it Summers has paid his dues and got tenure when he was really , really young , said , “ Beneficiaries of this stimulus measure would include not only America ’s hard - working families but also veterinarians , pet - food companies , cat - nip farmers , and makers of heart - shaped kitty beds , catnip - scented mouse and gopher - shaped rubber chew toys , scratch pads , scent - free non-comedogenic coat - conditioning kitty shampoos , and teaser rods with dangling lures .
And while some of these important products are made overseas , the services of America ’s hard - working veterinarians simply cannot be outsourced . ”
The administration is also considering a tax break to encourage trichotillomania .
Trichotillomania , a mental disorder characterized by an uncontrollable impulse to pull out one ’s hair , may affect as many as eleven million Americans , 91 % of them women , according to a survey conducted by the Mayo Clinic .
Trichophagia , a related disorder , involves the habit of eating hair .
“ These conditions , as painful and inconvenient as they might seem , play a vital role in maintaining a healthy economy , ” said the administration ’s new undersecretary of Health and Human Services for grooming and personal hygiene .
“ Trichotillomanes purchase scarves , ascots , fedoras , cloches , derbies , Neosporin , berets , beanies , false eyelashes , and paste - on eyebrows at a significantly higher rate than the general population .
A decline in trichotillomania could have a devastating effect on many important industries . ”
The administration is considering incentives to encourage trichotillomanes to pluck faster and more thoroughly .
Nobel Prize - winning Princeton economist and New York Times columnist Paul Krugman favors a stimulus package for trichotillomanes .
“ I am disappointed , ” said Krugman in his blog , “ that the administration has not acted in a swifter and more decisive manner .
In fact , I recommend that the administration mail every citizen a pair of tweezers and a DVD of Oprah ’s trichotillomania episode . ”
“ I think there is bipartisan agreement that a trichotillomania subsidy is an urgent national priority , ” said former senator and presidential candidate Phil Gramm , who now heads the K Street - based National Association of Manufacturers of False Eyelashes , Clown Noses , and Squeeze Toy Stress Relievers .
[ Photo : Senator Gramm squeezing a Barky the Dog squeeze toy stress reliever and sucking on the neck of a limp kitten ]
In related news , in a sudden and uncharacteristic burst of courage , Connecticut Senator Chris Dodd has proposed a federal subsidy for vampire hunting .
“ Nothing brings a community together like a vampire hunt , ” commented Senator Dodd .
“ Moreover , a vampire hunt requires serious tools .
You do n’t want to break into that crypt with a cheap stake that might snap or a hammer with a fragile plastic handle .
Before you go after that inhumanly powerful undead creature with glowing red eyes , you are going to head down to the Home Depot or your neighborhood hardware store and load up on heavy - duty , top - of - the - line equipment . ”
Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner , though , has doubts about Dodd ’s proposal .
“ One problem is that it can be difficult to determine which blood - sucking supernatural parasites are in fact vampires and which are duly authorized and well - regulated components of the financial system , such as investment banks .
If we allow uninformed middle - class citizens to go after Angelo Mozilo or Phil Gramm , next thing you know someone will be trying to put a stake through the heart of a selfless public servant like Hank Paulson .
Also , giving the public visibility into the interiors of systemically important crypts would interfere with our ability to do our job and regulate the flow of blood .
Letting the public see which crypts contain vampires could destroy confidence in institutions that play a vital role in the extraction and distribution of taxpayer blood and organs . ”
When asked for comment , Goldman Sachs CFO Daniel Viniar said that Goldman Sachs had extracted twelve billion pints of blood in accordance with a legally binding contract ; the Transylvanian International Group had agreed to deliver the blood in the event of a zombie bank contagion , and the Treasury Department graciously chose to take over the obligation .
“ Moreover , we would have gotten that blood one way or another , ” said Viniar .
“ We had a contingency plan in place . ”
Congressman Barney Frank also indignantly dismissed Senator Dodd ’s proposal .
“ Any attempt to restrain vampires would be disastrous for hard - working American families and their hard - working kittens , ” Frank sputtered .
“ To keep the undead economy growing , we have to encourage vampirism , just as we have to encourage Citibank to shamble down the street looking for more taxpayer brains to eat . ”
* U.S. strip mall vacancy hits 18 - year high
* U.S. mall vacancy rate highest in at least 10 years
NEW YORK , Jan 6 ( Reuters ) - Vacancies at U.S. strip malls hit an 18 - year high in the fourth quarter and the vacancy rate for large regional malls reached the highest in at least 10 years , according to real estate research firm Reis Inc .
Strip malls -- neighborhood and community shopping centers typically anchored by grocery or drug stores -- had a vacancy rate of 10.6 percent in the fourth quarter , surpassing the high set in 1991 , Reis economist Ryan Severino said in a report released on Wednesday .
The early 1990s is a period often referred to as the commercial real estate depression .
“ Our outlook for retail properties as a whole is bleak , ” Severino said in a statement .
“ Until we see stabilization and recovery take root in both consumer spending and business spending and employment , we do not foresee a recovery in the retail sector until late 2012 at the earliest . ”
Reis said that continuing high unemployment and inconsistent consumer spending will weigh heavily on retail properties for at least another 18 to 24 months .
It expects the vacancy rate at neighborhood and community centers to keep rising , and rents to continue falling through 2011 .
The deteriorating fundamentals could inflict strong headwinds for real estate companies such as Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust PEI.N , Macerich Co MAC.N , Kite Realty Group Trust KRG.N , Glimcher Realty Trust GRT.N , General Growth Properties Inc GGWPQ.PK and Equity One Inc EQY.N .
At the same time , it also could provide buying opportunities for cash rich companies , such as Simon Property Group Inc SPG.N and Kimco Realty Corp KIM.N .
Asking rent at U.S. strip malls fell 0.5 percent from the third quarter to $ 19.12 per square foot in the fourth quarter , or down 2.05 percent for the year .
Factoring in months of free rent and the landlord ’s portion of the cost for interiors , effective rent fell 0.8 percent to $ 16.75 per square foot , wiping out rent gains over the past nearly four years .
For the first time in Reis ’ 29 years of tracking the fundamentals of strip malls , effective rent in all of the 77 markets it covers declined .
“ It is daunting to observe this acceleration in decline in what has traditionally been regarded as a stable property type , ” Severino said .
The vacancy rate at large regional malls rose to 8.8 percent from 8.6 percent the third quarter .
It was the highest vacancy rate for U.S. malls since Reis began tracking mall performance .
Asking rent fell 0.4 percent to $ 39.03 per square foot , the lowest since the second quarter 2006 .
“ This is the first time in almost 10 years of quarterly history that Reis has observed rent declines for five straight quarters , and the year - over - year decline of negative 3.6 percent is the largest magnitude of deterioration over a 12 - month period on record as well , ” Severino said .
Southwest of Sri Lanka in the Laccadive Sea lies a paradise like no other , the island country of the Maldives .
The Republic of the Maldives consists of twenty - six atolls in an area spanning 90,000 square kilometers ( 34,749 square miles ) .
The Maldives are popular for their picture - perfect lush islands ringed by gorgeous white sand beaches .
The tiny country is the smallest in Asia both in land mass and population ( 309,000 people ) .
It also has the lowest high point of any country in the world at 2.3 meters ( 7 feet 7 inches ) and because of this the rising sea level threatens its very existence .
All total , the Maldives consists of roughly 1,190 coral islands , only 185 of which are inhabited .
The islands were discovered as a tourist destination in the 1970s and today tourism accounts for just under 30 % of the country ’s GDP .
A range of accommodation for any budget can be found on the Maldives , and the country ’s capital city of Male is home to an international airport .
Olivia Hansen * will nur schnell ein paar Lebensmittel einkaufen .
Süßkartoffeln und Karotten für ihre sieben Monate alte Tochter Lola .
Der nächste Supermarkt befindet sich schräg gegenüber ihrer Wohnung , in den „ Schönhauser Allee Arcaden “ in Prenzlauer Berg .
Genauer : Im Untergeschoss des Einkaufscenters .
Um dorthin zu gelangen hat Hansen bislang die Rolltreppe benutzt .
„ Das ist einfach die schnellste Verbindung – auf die Aufzüge muss man ewig warten “ , sagt sie .
Dieser
Weg soll ihr nun verwehrt bleiben .
Denn seit dem 1 . Januar gilt eine neue EU - Norm .
Demnach ist die Mitnahme von Kinderwagen auf Rolltreppen untersagt .
Eltern sind nun auf Aufzüge angewiesen .
Oder auf die Hilfe anderer .
Die EU - Regelung gelte zum Schutz der Kinder , heißt es offiziell .
Um Haftungsansprüche von Versicherungen auszuschließen , wie einige Betroffene mutmaßen .
Denn bei der neuen
Norm handelt es sich nicht um ein Gesetz .
Mit einer Strafe ist bei Verstößen nicht zu rechnen .
Von dem Rollentreppenverbot hat Olivia Hansen , 33 , bislang nichts gewusst .
„ Das muss irgendwie an mir vorbeigegangen sein “ , sagt sie .
So wie offenbar auch an anderen Müttern , die an diesem Vormittag die „ Schönhauser Allee Arcaden “ besuchen .
Die meisten von ihnen benutzen die Rolltreppen im vorderen und hinteren Bereich des Gebäudes .
Trotz der schon seit langem vorhandenen Piktogramme , die eine durchgestrichene Frau mit einem Kinderwagen zeigen .
Sie schieben ihre Wagen vorsichtig auf die Stufen und konzentrieren sich darauf , sie auszubalancieren .
Das erfordert Augenmaß und gutes Koordinationsvermögen .
Olivia Hansen sagt , sie habe damit nie Probleme gehabt .
Zwei Aufzüge befinden sich am hinteren Ende des Einkaufszentrums .
Für sie sei das ein Umweg , denn der Supermarkt , in den sie will , ist vorn .
Olivia Hansen bugsiert ihren Wagen auf die Rolltreppe .
Eine Frau mittleren
Alters fragt , ob sie beim Festhalten helfen soll .
Eine Ausnahme .
Meistens halten einem Passanten noch nicht mal die Tür auf , sagt Hansen .
Oder ignorieren einen , etwa wenn man am Bahnhof an der Treppe steht .
„ In der Regel muss man die Leute gezielt ansprechen , damit sie einem behilflich sind . “
Dabei ist Hansen am U - und S - Bahnhof Schönhauser
Allee noch in einer komfortablen Situation .
Hier gibt es nicht nur eine Rolltreppe , an der sich übrigens kein Verbotshinweis befindet , sondern auch einen Aufzug .
Das ist in Berlin bei gerade 69 von 173 BVG - Stationen der Fall .
Eine Erleichterung ist das trotzdem nicht immer .
Am Alexanderplatz zum Beispiel hält der Lift in einem Zwischengeschoss .
Um auf den U - Bahnsteig zu gelangen , muss man erst umsteigen .
Ein zeitaufwändiges Unterfangen .
Bisher war Olivia Hansen glücklich über die Existenz von Rolltreppen – aber das merkt sie erst jetzt , wo ihr die Benutzung untersagt ist .
„ Ich hatte immer das Gefühl , dass das Fahren auf einer Rolltreppe mit einem Kinderwagen der sicherste Weg nach unten oder oben ist . “
Sie hat ihren Einkauf erledigt und sitzt jetzt in einem Café , der Kinderwagen steht neben ihr , Lola schläft .
„ Was kommt als Nächstes ? “ , fragt Olivia Hansen .
„ Ein Rolltreppenverbot für Menschen ab 80 ? “
Olivia Hansen lächelt .
Das Lächeln einer Mutter , die versucht , den Alltag in Berlin zu meistern , so gut es eben geht .
Zur Not ab jetzt auch ohne Rolltreppen .

Homeopathy , as a cultural phenomenon , remains an enigma .
In the two centuries since its invention it has failed to garner significant scientific support .
In fact , developments in physics , chemistry , biology , and medicine have shown the underlying concepts of homeopathy to be wrong – guesswork and speculation that lept in the wrong direction .
It turns out , like does not cure like .
This is nothing more than sympathetic magic – popular at the time but now considered nothing more than superstition without any scientific basis .
It also turns out that diluting a substance does not make it more potent – this nonsensical idea ( ridiculed even in the 19th century ) violates the laws of thermodynamics , and the chemical principle of mass action .
This is especially true when you dilute a substance beyond the point where chance would have even a single molecule of active ingredient left behind .
The background noise of chemicals in homeopathic water is orders of magnitude greater than the signal of whatever had previously been diluted in it .
I also understand that water does not have a magical memory of the vibrations of what was diluted in it .
Transient interactions of water molecules does not , by any stretch of the imagination , confer upon water the ability to store and transmit complex chemical information from a solution to a tablet to a biological system .
It is therefore demonstrably true , even with simple high school level science , that the plausibility of homeopathy , for all practical purposes , and to the extent that it is possible to make such statements within the methodology of science – is zero .
If this were not enough , putting aside the non-existent plausibility of homeopathy and the staggering failure of two centuries to validate any of its principles , clinical trials of homeopathic remedies have failed to reliably detect any effect above and beyond placebo effects .
Therefore , in the eyes of science , homeopathy = total fail .
It should be laid to rest and relegated to a footnote in the history of science – a pre-scientific idea that survived into modern times as pseudoscience .
We can squeeze it in somewhere after healing crystals and before humoral theory and iridology .
But here comes the enigma – why does homeopathy persist at all ?
It seems that after the rise of science - based medicine in the early 20th century homeopathy was marginalized , but was able to survive because it had already entrenched itself sufficiently in politics and society .
It then flew under the radar until the recent rise of CAM – the successful re-branding of fraudulent and unscientific modalities as “ natural ” and “ alternative ” .
So successful was this re-branding that the scientific community was partly cowed by the incessant demands for being “ open- minded ” and for “ academic freedom . ”
This caused many scientists who should have known better to forget themselves , to look the other way while advocates slowly inserted nonsense into the health care structure and academic institutions .
We are beginning to see a push back in the scientific community .
Michael Baum and Edzard Ernst have recently published a commentary in The American Journal of Medicine which reflects the new found “ permission ” within the medical community to once again call nonsense nonsense , and close the door on failed therapies .
Should we keep an open mind about astrology , perpetual motion , alchemy , alien abduction , and sightings of Elvis Presley ?
No , and we are happy to confess that our minds have closed down on homeopathy in the same way .
They then give a detailed justification for this attitude – a sufficient record of basic science and clinical failure to justify the conclusion that homeopathy cannot and does not work .
There has been criticism from other avenues as well .
The World Health Organization ( WHO ) has traditionally taken a very permissive approach to unscientific medical modalities , motivated by a desire to be “ open ” to indigenous medicine .
The WHO is a political organization , after all , and sometimes politics gets in the way of science .
But they are also advocates for world health , especially for vulnerable populations .
It was brought to their attention by an organization called Sense About Science that homeopaths were pushing ineffective homeopathic treatments for malaria , TB , and HIV / AIDS .
This forced the WHO to make the following clarifications ( among others ) regarding their position :
Dr Mukund Uplekar : TB Strategy and Health Systems , WHO : “ WHO ’s evidence - based guidelines on treatment of tuberculosis … have no place for homeopathic medicines . ”
Dr Teguest Guerma , Director Ad Interim , HIV / AIDS Department , WHO : “ The WHO Dept. of HIV / AIDS invests considerable human and financial resources [ … ] to ensure access to evidence - based medical information and to clinically proven , efficacious , and safe treatment for HIV …
Let me end by congratulating the young clinicians and researchers of Sense About Science for their efforts to ensure evidence - based approaches to treating and caring for people living with HIV . ”
Dr Sergio Spinaci , Associate Director , Global Malaria Programme , WHO : “ Thanks for the amazing documentation and for whistle blowing on this issue …
The Global Malaria programme recommends that malaria is treated following the WHO Guidelines for the Treatment of Malaria ” .
( These guidelines do not include any use of homeopathy . )
Homeopathy is no longer flying under the radar .
While pushing worthless nostrums for the worried well may be tolerated , they can no longer hide the fact that symptomatic treatment of self - limiting conditions is simply the foot in the door for hardcore quackery – the treatment of serious and even life - threatening illnesses with worthless remedies .
The WHO has recently run up against homeopathy again , this time with respect to the H1N1 pandemic and vaccine .
While the WHO is trying to stem a pandemic with a vaccination program , homeopaths seem to be doing everything they can to frustrate this public health measure .
The Swiss Society of Homoeopathic Physicians was recently warning pregnant women not to get vaccinated against H1N1 .
This forced WHO vaccines chief Marie - Paule Kieny to make the following statements :
“ This ( advice ) may result in putting pregnant women and their fetuses at risk of severe consequences in case of pandemic influenza virus infection .
“ We … regret that the recommendation of the Swiss Society of Homoeopathic Physicians does not take WHO recommendations in this matter into consideration , ” she said .
This is also not an isolated incident of homeopaths warning against the vaccine , claiming that homeopathy can treat the flu and prevent the pandemic .
A Google search of “ flu ” and “ homeopathy ” leads to numerous homeopaths and homeopathic groups making similar claims .
The National Center for Homeopathy writes :
Homeopathy has a long and impressive track record in epidemics of all kinds , including influenza , and we are confident of its potential now .
Homeopaths argue that homeopathy was effective in treating the 1918 H1N1 pandemic .
Their reliance upon historical records , however , is demonstrably absurd .
Such data is uncontrolled and highly unreliable .
It reflects their preference for reliance upon low quality data rather than higher quality controlled data .
While the current generation of scientists and regulators are beginning to wake up to the fact that homeopathy is dangerous quackery , the public is still largely uninformed .
Homeopathic products are often marketed simply as “ natural ” leading to widespread confusion in the public as to what , exactly , homeopathy is .
Most people believe it is a synonym for herbal or natural remedies .
I encounter many patients and people with these false assumptions , and they are often shocked to learn the truth about homeopathy .
We need to have an open and transparent discussion in our society about homeopathy .
The science has spoken – homeopathy is a failed belief system that has no place in modern health care .
It is also a great example of the dangers of allowing a system of medicine that is based upon pseudoscience to flourish .
Such systems will never limit themselves to “ harmless ” symptomatic treatments .
Given the evidence and the state of the science , the only responsible position is to completely dismantle homeopathy and close the door on this pseudoscience once and for all .
It 's still hard to believe a Republican could win in deep - blue Massachusetts , but if you 're interested in healthcare reform you must pay attention to the election that will take place on January 19th .
A new poll from PPP has GOP candidate Scott Brown leading Democrat Martha Coakley by 1 point .
How could a Republican win in a state that Obama carried by more than 20 points ?
It 's simple .
Republicans are motivated by the chance to pull a gigantic upset and torpedo healthcare reform .
Democrats are n't so motivated , so the conventional wisdom is that the makeup of the electorate will be way different than it was last election day .

Subject : Temporary Protection Status for Undocumented Haitians in US ( Announcement by Secretary Napolitano )
Please find a press statement below from Secretary of Homeland Security , Janet Napolitano , regarding the situation in Haiti and Haitian nationals in the United States .
As part of the Department ’s ongoing efforts to assist Haiti following Tuesday ’s devastating earthquake , I am announcing the designation of Temporary Protected Status ( TPS ) for Haitian nationals who were in the United States as of January 12 , 2010 .
This is a disaster of historic proportions and this designation will allow eligible Haitian nationals in the United States to continue living and working in our country for the next 18 months .
Providing a temporary refuge for Haitian nationals who are currently in the United States and whose personal safety would be endangered by returning to Haiti is part of this Administration ’s continuing efforts to support Haiti ’s recovery .
At this moment of tragedy in Haiti it is tempting for people suffering in the aftermath of the earthquake to seek refuge elsewhere .
But attempting to leave Haiti now will only bring more hardship to the Haitian people and nation .
The international community has rallied to deliver relief to Haiti .
Much has already arrived and much more is on its way .
The Haitians are resilient and determined and their role in addressing this crisis in their homeland will be essential to Haiti ’s future .
It is important to note that TPS will apply only to those individuals who were in the United States as of January 12 , 2010 .
Those who attempt to travel to the United States after January 12 , 2010 will not be eligible for TPS and will be repatriated .
The Department of Homeland Security continues to extend sympathy to our Haitian neighbors and support the worldwide relief effort underway in every way we can .
Four Coast Guard cutters have arrived in Haiti , in addition to a variety of Coast Guard assets that were already in the area to support military air traffic control , conduct damage assessments and rescue people in need of assistance .
The Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) continues to work closely with the U.S. Agency for International Development ( USAID ) and the State Department — the lead U.S. federal agencies in the response — while coordinating the deployment of state and local Urban Search and Rescue Teams from across the country to Haiti and standing by to provide food , water and other resources as requested .
U.S. Customs and Border Protection ( CBP ) has provided aircraft to support response efforts .
Haitians in the U.S. who are eligible to apply for TPS should go to www.uscis.gov or call the toll - free USCIS Forms Hotline ( 800 ) 870-3676 .

The defeat , which followed a stirring , tearful and at times very personal debate , all but ensures that the issue is dead in New York until at least 2011 , when a new Legislature will be installed .
Since 2003 , seven states , including three that border New York , have legalized same - sex marriage .
But in two of the seven — California last year and Maine last month — statewide referendums have restricted marriage to straight couples , prohibiting gay nuptials .
Pollsters say that while support generally is building for same - sex marriage , especially as the electorate ages , voters resist when they fear the issue is being pushed too fast .
In Albany on Wednesday , proponents had believed going into the vote that they could attract as many as 35 supporters to the measure ; at their most pessimistic , they said they would draw at least 26 .
They had the support of Gov. David A. Paterson , who had publicly championed the bill , along with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg , Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and the Senate Democratic leadership .
The defeat revealed stark divides : All 30 of the Republican senators opposed the bill , as did most of the members from upstate New York and Long Island .
Support was heaviest among members from New York City and Westchester County and among the Senate ’s 10 black members .
Seven of the Senate ’s 10 women voted for it .
“ I ’m a woman and a Jew and so I know about discrimination , ” said Senator Liz Krueger of Manhattan .
Senators who are considered politically vulnerable also voted almost uniformly against the bill , including four first - term Democrats .
All but one of those whose districts border or lie within the 23rd Congressional District , where the marriage issue erupted in a recent special election , opposed it .
In that race , a Republican who supported gay marriage withdrew after an uproar from conservatives in her district .

Climate skeptics like to say that there ’s still plenty of room for debate over the science of global warming .
When it comes to the phenomenon itself , they ’re wrong : Scientific consensus solidly affirms the fact that the planet is warming , largely thanks to human activity .
We know that the glaciers are still melting and that the last decade was warmest on record .
But it ’s true that there are still some major holes in the science .
The latest issue of Nature identifies four key areas where much more research is needed :
Regional climate forecasts :
Most climate modeling is geared toward assessing global effects of rising temperatures , and are n’t as well suited for looking at local and regional variability and impacts .
Planning for climate adaptation requires better understanding of those local differences , making it crucial to develop better tools for assessing them .
Precipitation forecasts : Rising global temperatures are expected to increase evaporation and speed up the global hydrological cycle , which will increase droughts in subtropical areas and precipitation in areas of higher latitudes .
But models are bad at predicting much more than that , and they do n’t do a very good job of even accounting for how much precipitation patterns have already changed .
Aerosols :
Another major uncertainty in climate science are airborne liquid and solid particles–things like sulphates , black carbon , sea salt and dust .
It ’s not clear how and to what extent they influence temperature and rainfall , in large part because there ’s not that much data about what exactly is floating around in our atmosphere .
The general understanding is that the aerosols cool the climate by blocking sunlight , but some aerosols like black carbon actually absorb sunlight and increase warming .
Thus , the net effect is unclear .
Palaeoclimate data :
There are n’t reliable thermometer records prior to 1850 , so scientists must look to other sources of evidence on historical temperatures , like tree rings , sediment in lakes , stalagmites , and glacial movement .
While the preponderance of the evidence across those data sources shows clear warming trends , there remains a lively debate about the appropriate use and interpretation of proxies .
The Nature paper notes that it is extremely difficult for scientists to discuss these areas when they do n’t yet have the right tools .
The climate change denial machine — which takes any level of uncertainty as an excuse to dismiss climate change entirely — has made it nearly impossible for scientists to discuss uncertainties in what is already a complex and highly technical field .
And that machine is actively undermining scientists ’ ability to address these holes in the research .
“ This climate of suspicion we ’re working in is insane , ” said Gavin Schmidt , a climate modeler at NASA ’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York .
“ It ’s drowning our ability to soberly communicate gaps in our science . ”
8:24 a.m. : Judge and lawyers assemble
The Proposition 8 trial is getting ready to start rolling , although cameras will not roll with the proceedings .
The U.S. Supreme Court this morning issued an order blocking Chief U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker ’s move to post the trial on a delayed basis on YouTube , at least for the first few days , while the justices consider the issue .
Proposition 8 backers have been vigorously trying to block broadcast of the trial , pushing the matter all the way to the nation ’s high court .
Meanwhile , hundreds of people have been gathered outside the San Francisco federal building , many of them participating in a rally in support of gay marriage .
And everyone is now lining up outside Walker ’s courtroom , readying for the start of trial , which is set to begin about 9 a.m .
9:06 a.m. : Opening arguments to begin
The Proposition 8 trial is about to get under way .
Walker ’s courtroom does n’t have a spare inch .
It ’s jammed with spectators , lawyers and media .
Theodore Olson , the former U.S. solicitor general during the George W. Bush administration , is preparing to give the opening statement for the plaintiffs , who are challenging the constitutionality of California ’s ban on same - sex marriage .
Olson and Charles Cooper , the lead attorney for the Proposition 8 defense , exchanged an embrace outside the courtroom , not surprising given the two men are members of the conservative legal establishment who now find themselves on the opposite sides of the controversial trial .
A little Hollywood flavor is in the courtroom with director Rob Reiner .
9:21 a.m. : Judge takes the bench
Walker has just taken the bench .
The first five minutes is spent with all the lawyers introducing themselves .
Walker is beginning the proceedings by discussing his effort to broadcast the trial by posting it on the court ’s Web site by using the YouTube platform .
He just noted the court has received more than 138,000 responses to the proposed court rule change that allows broadcast , most in favor .
The judge informed the court that only 32 people opposed it , prompting chuckles when he said “ the returns are in . ”
The U.S. Supreme Court nevertheless has put the broadcast on hold until Wednesday to consider the issue .
9:45 a.m. : Judge peppers attorney with questions
Just a few minutes into Olson ’s opening statement , it ’s clear Walker is not going to be a bystander content to just listen during the trial .
He ’s already peppered Olson with questions , including wondering whether a state needs to remain in the business of issuing marriage licenses and why domestic partnership provisions confer lesser legal rights and meaning than marriage .
When Olson said Californians would never get “ out of the marriage business , ” the judge was persistent .
“ Why wo n’t they get out of the marriage business ?
It would solve this problem , ” Walker said .
It is likely the judge will raise every possible question during the next two weeks , his style in even routine cases .
Olson revealed the first four witnesses to take the stand in the trial will be the plaintiff couples , including a lesbian couple from Berkeley .
He opened his remarks by saying : “ This case is about marriage and equality .
The plaintiffs are being denied both the right to marry and equality under the law . ”
10:18 a.m. : Obama ’s parents mentioned
Olson is now on a roll with fewer interruptions from the judge .
He pointed out that under laws that existed in various states until the 1960s , when the U.S. Supreme Court finally declared bans on interracial marriage unconstitutional , President Barack Obama ’s parents would have been unable to marry , underscoring what he argued is the discriminatory impact of selective marriage laws .
He called the argument that domestic partnership laws are sufficient protection for same - sex couples “ a cruel fiction ” and a “ badge of inferiority ” for gay couples .
Walker did ask Olson why the courts should n’t just stay out of the gay marriage debate for now and allow the political process to continue to resolve the conflict .
“ That is why we have courts , ” Olson replied .
“ That ’s why we have a constitution . ”
Olson just completed his opening argument , and now Therese Stewart , San Francisco ’s chief deputy city attorney , is making her argument about how denying marriage rights to same - sex couples can impact local governments .
Stewart is a veteran of the gay marriage legal battles .
She argued the issue in both cases that reached the California Supreme Court .
10:31 a.m. : Defense attorney begins presentation
After Stewart ’s brief argument , Charles Cooper , the lead attorney for the Proposition 8 defense , has begun his presentation .
But that was only after Walker lobbed a tough question to California Attorney General Jerry Brown ’s lawyer .
Brown has taken the position that Proposition 8 is unconstitutional , refusing to defend the law .
The judge asked why Brown did not take that position when Proposition 8 was on the ballot , given its importance .
When Brown ’s deputy , Tamara Pachter , responded that the AG does n’t take that step in the state ’s initiative process , Walker was incredulous .
Cooper , meanwhile , is hitting the main points in the defense : that the voters have spoken on the issue , and gay couples in California enjoy strong legal protections under domestic partnership laws .
Walker ’s first question to Cooper was on the example of President Obama ’s mixed - race parents and the evolution of marriage in the country , raised earlier by Olson .
Cooper argues that the restrictions on interracial marriage were distinct , and were n’t based on efforts to preserve traditional marriage , as is the case in the same - sex marriage case .
The judge wants to know what evidence in the trial will show that difference .
11:03 a.m. : Opening statements conclude
The lawyers are done for now in the Proposition 8 trial .
Charles Cooper finished his opening statement , defending the need for society to preserve the traditional definition of marriage and limit it to heterosexual couples for its procreative purposes .
He told the judge that marriage must be “ pro child , ” and that would be at risk if same - sex couples were allowed to marry .
Cooper insisted that the courts should stay out of the issue and allow the voters to decide whether they want to allow same - sex marriage , but the judge questioned that thesis .
“ There are certainly lots of issues taken out of the body politic .
Why is n’t this one of them ? ” the judge asked at one point .
The court is now taking a break until 11:10 , at which time Jeff Zarrillo , one of the plaintiffs seeking the right to marry , will take the stand .
11:41 a.m. : Emotional testimony from plaintiff
The Proposition 8 trial may eventually be laden with expert testimony from academics and others , but it is starting off on the emotional side with the testimony of Jeff Zarrillo , one of the plaintiffs seeking the right to marry his partner , Paul Katami .
Zarrillo choked up when asked by lawyer David Boies about the difficulty of coming out as a gay man years ago , recalling small details from his youth , including his fear of going out for his high school football team .
Asked about his partner of nine years , he said : “ He ’s the love of my life .
I love him probably more than I love myself . ”
Zarrillo , a 36 - year - old Burbank man , told the judge he wants to be married so he can “ experience the same joy and happiness ” as his parents and his brother , who is married .
As for domestic partnership , Zarrillo testified it is not equal .
“ That ’s not enough , ” he told the packed courtroom .
“ It ’s giving me part of the pie , but not the whole thing . ”
After less than 15 minutes , he finished up his testimony .
The lawyers defending Proposition 8 chose not to cross -examine him , a bit of a surprise .
12:14 p.m. : Partner testifies
Plaintiff Paul Katami , like his partner , Jeff Zarrillo , has spent some emotional time on the stand , describing both the difficulty of coming out as a gay man and the impact on him of not being able to marry .
“ Unless you have to deal with that , unless you have to go through this constant validation of self , there is no way to describe how it feels , ” he said of being denied the right to wed .
At another point , he grew visibly upset when asked about the Proposition 8 campaign and its reliance on the slogan , “ Protect our Children . ”
He called the campaign insulting .
“ If you put my nieces and nephews on the stand right now , I ’d be the cool uncle , ” he said , chuckling .
Then , growing serious , he continued by choking up at the thought that gay marriage would harm children .
“ There is no recovering from that , ” he testified .
Lawyer David Boies played some of the campaign videos that focused on harm to children by the Yes on Proposition 8 backers .
How did you feel seeing that video ?
Boies asked .
“ I ’d be lying if I did n’t say my heart was racing and I was angry watching it , ” Katami said after the video ended .
12:30 p.m. : Judge recesses for lunch break Paul Katami has finished up his testimony under questioning from lawyer David Boies , and will be cross - examined after lunch .
The judge just recessed until 1:30 .
Kristin Perry and Sandra Stier , a Berkeley couple and the other plaintiffs in the case , are expected to testify this afternoon .
1:55 p.m. : Defense cross-examines one of the plaintiffs
The afternoon session in the Proposition 8 trial is under way with Katami taking the stand under questioning from Brian Raum , lawyer for the Alliance Defense Fund , one of the conservative groups aligned against gay marriage .
Looks like the gloves will now come off .
Raum started by playing a video from the Proposition 8 campaign featuring a Massachusetts heterosexual couple decrying how their second - grader was exposed to teachings about homosexuality at school .
Raum is asking Katami about whether he believes it is acceptable for sexuality and homosexuality to be taught to first - and second - graders ; Katami is taking a measured approach , pointing out that without children , it is hard to fully evaluate what is appropriate to teach young children about such issues at certain ages .
“ For me , Proposition 8 had nothing to do with children , ” Katami replied under cross-examination .
“ It was a diversion “… a tactic which does not sit at the core of the issue . ” 2:29 p.m. : Berkeley woman describes relationship with partner Kristin Perry , a Berkeley woman , has taken the witness stand , describing her relationship with her partner , Sandy Stier , and why she wants the right to marry .
Under questioning from her lawyer , Theodore Olson , she was asked why she became a plaintiff in the groundbreaking legal fight .
“ I want to marry Sandy , ” she said simply .
Perry drew a few chuckles when Olson tossed a question about whether she could envision changing so that she ’d be able to have a relationship with men ( plaintiff lawyers have been asking that question throughout the day , a clear attempt to rebut the argument of gay marriage foes that being gay is a choice , not part of their natural makeup ) .
“ I ’m 45 years old , ” she said of changing her sexual preferences .
“ I do n’t think so . ”
Perry also walked the judge through her long effort to marry Stier , dating back to 2003 , when she proposed in the Berkeley hills .
She testified how they were one of the couples to marry at San Francisco City Hall in 2004 , getting a license that was later invalidated by the courts .
When she lost the right to marry through Proposition 8 , her reaction was : “ I ’m not good enough to marry . ”
3:01 p.m. : Growing up gay in Bakersfield
Perry just completed her testimony , a bare - bones description of what it ’s been like for her to grow up a lesbian in conservative Bakersfield and now find herself fighting for the right to marry .
Perhaps her most emotional moment came when she described attending football games with Stier at the high school where two of their four boys go , and going into the stands with the other parents .
Perry scrunched up her face and said when she looks around , all she thinks is , “ They ’re all married “… and I ’m not . ”
She dismissed the idea that her domestic partnership with Stier is enough .
She also recounted going to the Alameda County clerk ’s office last May in an attempt to get a marriage license , only to get turned away by a “ nervous ” supervisor who told the couple Proposition 8 prevented them from marrying .
“ There ’s something so humiliating about everybody knowing you want to make some decision , and you do n’t get to , ” she testified .
Proposition 8 lawyers did not question Perry .
Stier has just taken the stand , going through her background , including one failed heterosexual marriage before her relationship with Perry .
3:12 p.m. : Judge asks :
What if state got out of marriage business ?
Judge Walker , largely silent since the four plaintiffs started testifying , broke out with a tough question for Stier as she discussed the distinction between domestic partnership and marriage .
The judge was clearly intrigued by the fact that Stier has been in both worlds , having been married to a husband for 12 years , and now in a domestic partnership with Perry for more than nine years .
After Stier testified that “ it ’s not the same ” without the marriage license , Walker broke in and asked how she ’d react if the state got out of the marriage business for everyone , including heterosexual couples .
Would she still feel the same about the term “ marriage ” ?
the judge asked .
Would that put her “ on the same plane ” with heterosexual couples ?
he asked .
Stier pondered the question for a moment .
“ I believe it would , ” she replied , “ because there would n’t be anything different ” in how the state treats her relationship .
The trial day is drawing to a close in less than an hour .
3:24 p.m. : Plaintiffs end testimony ; first expert witness called
It ’s on to the experts in the Proposition 8 trial .
Stier just completed her stay on the stand .
The plaintiffs have called their first academic , Nancy Cott , a Harvard University historian and expert on American marriage history and issues involving women and families .
4:11 p.m. : Court adjourns for the day
The Prop 8 trial has adjourned for its first day .
Cott is still on the stand , testifying about the history and cultural significance of marriage in American society .
The testimony is often dry , but appears designed to back up the plaintiffs argument that same - sex couples are being denied a crucial equal right .
Cott rejected the notion that domestic partnership protections , no matter how strong , equate with marriage .
“ There is no comparison in my historical view , ” she told the judge .
“ There is nothing like marriage except marriage . ”
Cott returns to the stand Tuesday morning at 8:30 a.m .

Encrypting USB
Flash memory from Kingston , SanDisk and Verbatim Kingston , SanDisk and Verbatim all sell quite similar USB Flash drives with AES 256 - bit hardware encryption that supposedly meet the highest security standards .
This is emphasised by the FIPS 140 - 2 Level 2 certificate issued by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST ) , which validates the USB drives for use with sensitive government data .
Security firm SySS , however , has found that despite this it is relatively easy to access the unencrypted data , even without the required password .
The USB drives in question encrypt the stored data via the practically uncrackable AES 256 - bit hardware encryption system .
Therefore , the main point of attack for accessing the plain text data stored on the drive is the password entry mechanism .
When analysing the relevant Windows program , the SySS security experts found a rather blatant flaw that has quite obviously slipped through testers ' nets .
During a successful authorisation procedure the program will , irrespective of the password , always send the same character string to the drive after performing various crypto operations – and this is the case for all USB Flash drives of this type .
Cracking the drives is therefore quite simple .
The SySS experts wrote a small tool for the active password entry program 's RAM which always made sure that the appropriate string was sent to the drive , irrespective of the password entered and as a result gained immediate access to all the data on the drive .
The vulnerable devices include the Kingston DataTraveler BlackBox , the SanDisk Cruzer Enterprise FIPS Edition and the Verbatim Corporate Secure FIPS Edition .
When notified by SySS about this worst case security scenario , the respective vendors responded quite differently .
Kingston started a recall of the affected products ; SanDisk and Verbatim issued woolly security bulletins about a " potential vulnerability in the access control application " and provided a software update .
When asked by heise Security , Verbatim Europe said that none of the affected drives have been sold in Europe – and that none will be shipped before the hole has been closed .
The real question , however , remains unanswered – how could USB Flash drives that exhibit such a serious security hole be given one of the highest certificates for crypto devices ?
Even more importantly , perhaps – what is the value of a certification that fails to detect such holes ?

2009 airline revenue : Worst drop ever
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The airline industry suffered its largest drop ever in passenger revenue last year as a weak economy grounded many would - be travelers , an industry group said Wednesday .
The Air Transport Association of America said total passenger revenue for the major U.S. carriers fell 18 % in 2009 versus the year before .
It was the largest drop on record , exceeding the 14 % decline in 2001 .
The revenue decline was due to a 6 % drop in passenger volume , and a 13 % plunge in the average price paid to fly one mile , the ATA said .
" The global recession , accompanied by high levels of unemployment , hit air travel demand especially hard in 2009 , " said James May , ATA chief executive and president , in a statement .
But the outlook for the current year is a bit brighter .
" Anecdotal evidence suggests a positive revenue trajectory in 2010 , " May added .
Still , he warned that the airline industry remains vulnerable .
" We are seeing higher fuel prices as well , which could hinder recovery efforts , " May said .
For December , passenger revenue was down 4 % versus the month before .
It was the 14th consecutive month of declining sales , as traffic fell 3 % in the month .
( CNN ) -- Mega churches across the United States are becoming increasingly popular which is not only bringing thousands of worshippers together , but also billions of dollars in profit .
From self - help books to CDs and DVDs , mega churches are becoming big money makers for the pastors and ministries they are a part of .
Mega churches are extra-large churches that can accommodate upwards of 15,000 people and are common among members of the evangelical Christian faith .
Scott Thumma , professor of sociology and religion at Hartford Seminary told CNN that " the mega church on average has about $ 6.5 million in income a year . "
" If you put together all the mega churches in the United States , that 's easily several billion dollars . "
Many ministers in the evangelical faith have become superstars in their own right -- Joel Osteen is one in particular .
Osteen is a pastor at the Lakewood Church in Houston , Texas and his televised service reaches over seven million people each week across the United States and around the world .
The Lakewood Church which Osteen is in charge of has a yearly budget of more than $ 80 million , but church officials deny that it 's about money .
" We hear the criticism a bit , but we do n't hear it as much as you think we would , " Donald Iloff Junior , advisor for Lakewood Church said .
" One thing you find very absent is the asking of money and never once have we asked for money or donations on television . "
However , some critics argue that it's hard to be both a pastor and someone in charge of a yearly budget in the tens of millions .
" When you have pastors thinking of themselves as CEOs , it 's hard to tell the difference between a pastor and P - Diddy , " Jonathan Walton , Assistant Professor of religious studies at the University of California Riverside told CNN .
The way the sermon is told at these mega churches has also completely changed .
" The plasma screen TVs have replaced crosses , Power Point - like presentations of the words of songs and liturgical practices have replaced the hymnals , " Walton said .
" This really resonates with a younger generation . "
The average age of a mega church worshipper is 40 years old -- 13 years younger than at a traditional church .
Mega church worshippers tend to not only be younger , but also more diverse .
" One thinks of them as a homogeneous group of white suburban American , but in fact when you go to most of the mega churches , you 're going to find diversity of age , income and education levels , " Thumma said .
" You can also find racial diversity because in almost 30 percent of these mega churches across the country , you have 20 percent or more integration of ethnic groups so it really is quite staggering . "
This is the second article of our series , Anatomy of Colors in Web Design .
Over the next few months , we ’ll be covering a spectrum of colors .
And one color at a time , we will be featuring web design from around the world .
If you missed the first of this series , you may want to catch up and read our article Green and Environmental Concept .
Today ’s article will explore the use of the color Blue in Web design .
Please remember to continue watching this space , as we take a closer look at other colors in upcoming months .
Subscribe to our RSS feed or Follow us on Twitter so that you wo n’t miss the full series .
Although it is often overlooked and often unappreciated , colors play a very big part in our life .
There are infinite numbers of colors in the world .
Sadly , not all colors can be seen by our naked eye .
Color affects and influences everyone in their work , whether you are an artist , designer or engineer .
The ability to mix and blend colors creates new possibilities in today ’s already colorful world .
Today we discuss the color Blue and take a look at how it has benefited us .
Blue is the only color which maintains its own character in all its tones … it will always stay blue ; whereas yellow is blackened in its shades , and fades away when lightened ; red when darkened becomes brown , and diluted with white is no longer red , but another color – pink .
— Raoul Dufy , French Fauvist Painter , 1877 - 1953
Definition of Blue
Blue is a color , the perception of which is evoked by light having a spectrum dominated by energy with a wavelength of roughly 440 –490 nm .
It is considered one of the additive primary colors .
On the HSV Color Wheel , the complement of blue is yellow ; that is , a color corresponding to an equal mixture of red and green light .
On a color wheel based on traditional color theory ( RYB ) , the complementary color to blue is considered to be orange ( based on the Munsell color wheel ) .
The English language commonly uses “ blue ” to refer to any color from navy blue to cyan .
The word itself is derived from the Old French word bleu .

Why Choose Blue ?
One of the most common colors chosen as their favourite is the color blue .
It is favoured by both men and women of all ages .
However , traditionally , men have a much stronger preference for blue than women .
It may be the calming effect of the color that makes it popular to both sexes .
However , it could also be the association of some shades of blue with authority figures , as well as the correlation we place between intelligence , and stability with the color blue .
Blue conveys a subtle connotation of importance and confidence , without being overly serious , sombre or sinister .
As such , blue power suits are popular with important corporate players and the color most used for police uniforms .
Blue ’s long standing as a corporate color , especially darker shades of blue , is associated with intelligence , stability , unity , and conservatism .
Interestingly , some believe that blue slows a person ’s metabolism rate and suppresses one ’s appetite .
As it does not require much effort of the eye to focus , images and objects recede in blue backgrounds .
However , if overused , the color blue can create a sense of detachment and coldness .
Although very popular with women as well , blue is the predominant favourite of males .
As such the color blue is well suited to be used for web sites involving and promoting technology , medical products , cleanliness , air , sky , water , sea and automotives .
Another interesting point is that Blue is the favourite color of more than half of the world ’s population , and the least disliked color by most cultures .
The Benefit of Blue
Blue is an overwhelmingly “ Popular Color ” .
The color of the sea and sky , blue is seen as trustworthy , dependable and committed .
We are surrounded by the color blue , from the blue skies above to the deep blue of the oceans .
As such , blue is a constant in our lives every day .
The color blue also symbolizes qualities such as depth , stability , trust , loyalty , wisdom , confidence , intelligence , faith , truth , heaven , tranquillity , calmness , and sincerity .
Despite blue being a color preferred by men , it is still the least “ gender specific ” color , with its equal appeal to both men and women .
Blue can be used across a large variety of websites .
It is also one of the preferred colors for corporate designs , as such you ’ll find it used quite often on big company websites .
The communications and web industries use medium shades of blue because it can appear to be sleek and high - tech , especially when combined with shades of grey .
In general , lighter shades of blue are often used to promote health and wellness , travel , and relaxation , while darker shades are often used by political and patriotic organisations , legal firms , and sports teams .
As a collective color , it invokes rest and can cause the body to produce chemicals that sooth and calm the senses ; however not all blues are serene and sedate .
Electric or brilliant blues are dynamic and dramatic , and engaging colors that express exhilaration .
Save for such blue shades , in most cases , blue causes the opposite reaction as red .
Peaceful , tranquil , blue causes the body to produce calming chemicals , so it is often used in bedrooms .
Blue can also be cold and depressing .
Fashion consultants recommend wearing blue to job interviews because it symbolises loyalty .
People are also said to be more productive in rooms with blue as its main color scheme .
Interestingly , studies show weightlifters are able to handle heavier weights in blue gyms .
Different Type of Blue in Web Design
Let ’s take a look at how different types of the color blue apply to Web design , and also when it is used alongside other colors .
Dark Blue
Dark blue is often used for websites that want to be seen as powerful and safe .
It also symbolises knowledge , integrity , seriousness , masculinity , and expertise .
Huddle
Light Blue
Light blue symbolizes health , healing , tranquillity , understanding , and softness .
Feed Stitch
Pale Blue
Pale blue gives an ethereal sense to the website and often symbolises delicate , calming , health , healing , tranquillity and understanding .
Squared Eye
Royal Blue
Royal blue like its name gives a regal and superior feel to websites that use the color .
It also symbolises richness and sometimes cool aloofness .
Dark blue on the other hand often represents depth , expertise , stability , credibility ( especially with gold ) , intellect , wisdom , corporate color , warmth , knowledge , power , integrity , seriousness , knowledge , health , decisiveness , law , order , logic , dependability and serenity .

There have been various reports from the community of Amazon EC2 users , that their instances are suffering poor performance , as the result of high internal network latency .
This has led to speculations that Amazon 's Cloud might be getting oversubscribed .
Alan Williamson from aw2.0 Ltd , has written a report about his experiences with Amazon EC2 , where he claims that Amazon , as every Cloud provider his company has tried out , seems to scale well at the beggining but there is a tipping point :
Amazon in the early days was fantastic .
Instances started up within a couple of minutes , they rarely had any problems and even their SMALL INSTANCE was strong enough to power even the moderately used MySQL database .
For a good 20 months , all was well in the Amazon world , with really no need for concern or complaint .
...
However , in the last 8 or so months , the chinks in their armour have begun to show .
The first signs of weakness came from the performance of the newly spun up Amazon SMALL instances .
According to our monitoring , the newly spun up machines in the server farm , were under performing compared to the original ones .
At first we thought these freaks - of - nature , just happened to beside a " noisy neighbor " .
A quick termination and a new spin up would usually , through the laws of randomness , have us in a quiet neighborhood where we could do what we needed .
...
However , in the last month of two , we 've even noticed that these " High - CPU Medium Instance " have been suffering a similar fate of the Small instances , in that , new instances coming up do n't seem to be performing anywhere near what they should be .
After some investigation , we discovered a new problem that has crept into Amazon 's world : Internal Network Latency .
Similarly cloudkick has reported high network latency for its instances :
A couple of weeks ago we noticed that our ping latency graphs on Cloudkick looked very odd .
... ... our monitoring node on EC2 is pinging four different servers on Slicehost .
The average ping latency is all over the place .
...
The conclusion ?
Alan Williamson 's post on EC2 oversubscription seems to make a lot of sense .
The network behind EC2 appears to be experiencing very sporadic latency issues .
There have even been posts on AWS discussion forums from EC2 clients that have been experiencing networking issues :
We have an instance which started to become EXTREMELY unresponsive at 9:15 AM CST today .
You could sometimes log into it , sometimes not .
While the situation did not resolve itself , another instance was started ( assuming there was a hardware problem on that instance ) which has the same issue .
I 'm thinking there may be a network issue .
I 've been able to log in once or twice , and once everything was normal for a bit and then it became unresponsive again .
Any clue ?
Instance IDs are i-c4921 fad and i-a0e3d7c8 .
I am seeing the same network issues when attempting to connect to our machines from machines in other EC2 zones .
Alan reports that during an emergency he tried to cope by rapidly deploying new instances , but it did n't work for him :
In one particular " fire fighting mode " , we spent an hour literally spinning up new instances and terminating them until we found ourselves on a node that actually responded to our network traffic .
In virtualized environments and specifically in the case of “ Noisy Neighbors ” , where you happen to be on a node where a neighboring instance is computationally heavy , this does n't seem to be a good practise since there is a " tendency for EC2 to assign fresh instances to the same small set of machines " [ PDF ] .

I 've learned something this week about the joy of being average .
If there is one thing I 've always considered an important virtue , it is excellence .
The ideal , of course , is to achieve excellence in all that we do .
Failing that , we strive to achieve excellence in the most important things .
Of course , having excellence as a goal does n't mean that we always achieve it .
It can be difficult to achieve excellence in all major areas of your life simultaneously .
Most of us have a few areas of life where we try especially hard to do our best .
Others necessarily receive less attention .
Some areas where I think it 's important to excel -- I try really hard to excel , even though I do n't always achieve it : Parenting .
My work as an attorney .
Comforting someone who is going through very hard times .
Giving a speech .
My writing .
Some areas where I 'd love to excel , but I do n't consider it important to do so : Crafts .
Cooking .
Skiing .
Having perfect vacations .
In which parts of your life do you strive for excellence , and in what areas of your life are you satisfied to just get it done at all ?
I 've been reading a book by Patricia Ryan Madson , " improv wisdom : do n't prepare , just show up . "
It 's about applying some of the same skills used in improv to everyday life .
It 's a fine read so far , and I particularly enjoyed the fifth chapter , " be average . "
Here 's an excerpt :
Giving it all you 've got commonly backfires .
There is a paradox that when we are trying hard the result is often disappointing .
A healthier climate is one in which we tell ourselves to just be average .
Take the pressure off .
Avoid the mind - set that says " This one better be good ! " or " Be original . "
Madson urges her readers to look for the obvious solution first -- the natural , easy way to approach a problem .
And you do n't always have to think " outside the box . "
Try thinking " inside the box . "
Madson says :
Do it naturally .
If there is something important that you need to do , approach the problem as though you did n't need to do your best .
What is the most obvious way of solving it ?
How would you proceed if finding a solution was " nothing special ? "
Barbara
Sher , whose mission in life is to help people discover their gifts and find ways to do what they love , urges people to start by creating something bad .
If you want to be an artist , start by making five really bad drawings of a cat , she urges .
It helps overcome pointless paralysis and resistance .
Author and writing teacher Natalie Goldberg has a similar notion .
One of her rules for free writing is to remind yourself that you have permission to write " the worst junk in the world " ( or the worst junk in the universe , or the worst junk in any particular town ) .
Both Barbara Sher and Natalie Goldberg are uniquely talented , and their advice is golden , but I really like Madson 's paean to " being average . "
For me , the concept of " being average " has one advantage over the " lousy first draft " idea .
The " lousy first draft " implicitly is just a first draft -- eventually to be turned into a brilliant piece of writing -- or , in the case of free writing , eventually to be mined for a few nuggets that can be used in future polished work .
This expectation that my work is just a " first draft " has a hidden trap , for me at least : Perfectionism is not necessarily avoided -- just postponed .
Madson 's challenge to " just be average " is liberating .
She stresses that is not necessary that our work -- even our important work -- always be excellent .
Often , just showing up is 99 % of what we need to do .
I read Madson 's chapter on daring to be average a couple of days ago and have applied it to my life this week , with happy results .
I have been jumping quickly and enthusiastically into projects that would have given me pause in the past -- an important letter to a contractor , another important letter for a client , a legal memorandum -- and I 've finished each project rapidly in " average " form .
The best part is that average is working just fine .
First of all , my " average " is probably better than average anyway , when it comes to legal work , at least .
( Do n't ask about my " average " cooking . )
Secondly , time was of the essence in each of these cases .
The fact that the work product had to produced quickly and seemingly had to be good made acceptance of " average " work product incredibly liberating .
So I produced " average " results very quickly -- which is just what my clients wanted and needed .
In the back of my mind , I know that I can always turn my " average " into " excellent " when the occasion demands it .
But thinking that way can be a trap , too .
If we insist on making everything excellent before we let go of it , we are often holding onto our work beyond the point of diminishing returns .
I 'm finding that " fast and average " is often just as good as " excellent in due course . "
In fact , sometimes it 's better .
And is n't that true in so many areas of life ?
When I am at a restaurant , I occasionally run into the waiter who provides impeccable service , but at a frustratingly slow pace .
It can take 90 minutes or more to get through a meal , most of it spent waiting for the waiter to take an order or bring the check .
If I 'm just relaxing over a dinner , that 's fine , but if I have my two young children in tow , it 's less charming .
I 'd rather have quick and average .
Let 's face it .
McDonald 's has made billions out of quick and average .
And the same is true of many other careers , businesses , and professions .
Quick and average is usually all we really want and need .
I can certainly think of professions where nothing short of excellence will do -- the classic examples are open heart surgery or building an office tower -- but even in those professions , there is virtue in being average .
I really would n't want my heart surgeon to " think outside the box " unless he or she needed to .
An average , uneventful surgery is just fine .
Let surgeons save their energy for the days when they really do need to achieve excellence to save a life .
With any luck , that wo n't be every day .
Humans can't be excellent every day .
Everybody is just average some days .
There are days when we 're under the weather , we 're distracted by troubling events , or circumstances just conspire to make the day tougher .
And , to be honest , some days we are even worse than average .
It 's unavoidable .
It 's the law of averages -- double meaning intended .
And speaking of average , perhaps you 've noticed that this is an odd sort of post for this blog .
I usually do n't write this sort of thing here -- pondering life in general and strategies for getting through the day .
This blog has mostly been about news of the day and opinion and commentary and the war on terror .
It 's an average thing to do , do n't you think -- writing a blog post that does n't really mesh with my other posts and just posting it anyway ?
Normally that would give me pause .
Do I really want to publish something that does n't really fit with the rest of my blog ?
Does that mean I have to produce a whole bunch of additional posts like this one in order to keep my blog well rounded ?
Must .
Not. Have .
Asymmetry .
In. My. Blog .
But I like this average bit of writing .
I want to share it with you .
I 'm pleased with being average .
And if my blog will fall prey to being more " average " because I 've included a post that is a little different from the rest , with no particular expectation that I will necessarily rework my entire blog to make this fit -- then that 's OK .
Frankly , some of you will probably find it refreshing .
I hope you like my " improv . "
If you do , I 'll probably be encouraged to do more of it .
I suppose that if you 're doing something really risky and really new to you , something you do n't do every day -- say , you 're the new guy on the bomb squad -- then perhaps you 'll want to take this advice with a grain of salt .
Do n't just plunge in and cut the red wire .
But if you 're like most people , and you 're faced with a whole lot of things to do , some of them perhaps stressful or challenging , then let me be the first to wish you a very happy , average week .
Go do something important in an average way .
Let me know how it works out .
Oakland
A's outfield prospect Grant Desme is reportedly turning in his baseball cap for a priest 's collar .
Fox Sports ' Jon Paul Morosi has confirmation from an A's official that the 23 - year - old Desme is retiring and is " serious " about a career change .
This kind of decision must have been made with a great deal of thought .
So go ahead and take Desme off your draft lists in keeper and dynasty leagues .
Desme was the only minor leaguer with at least 30 home runs and 30 stolen bases last season when he hit a combined .288 with 31 homers and 40 steals for Class A Kane County and High - A Stockton .
He was also the Most Valuable Player in the 2009 Arizona Fall League ( I even specifically mentioned him in a Windup post while I was there in Phoenix ) when he hit .315 and led the league with 11 homers .
Baseball America had him ranked as the A's 8th - best prospect entering the 2010 season .
Meanwhile , the line of the day came on Twitter from Kevin Goldstein of Baseball Prospectus : " Well , somebody 's church softball team is gonna get WAY WAY better soon . "
Itching to get your hands on the wheel and feet on the pedals of a Chevy Volt ?
You still have some time to wait -- but things are getting closer to reality at least .
The car was introduced three full years ago , amazingly , and we 're still about a year away from the things rolling off the production line en masse .
The batteries , though , those are in production .
The first line - produced cell rolled off the line in the repetitively named Brownstown Township , MI .
Well , the first official battery , as surely the units in the 80 - odd test Volts had to come from somewhere .
In the coming months before the Volt itself hits production , cells from this line will be put through their paces , both on test benches and in those early , hand - built vehicles .
Eventually , production - line batteries will be mated with production - line Volts , birds will sing , squirrels will dance , and rainbows will fly .
Until then , we 'll keep playing with the demo OnStar app

Mikaila
Tyhurst says she enjoyed her time in The Priory " I am just so happy that I can sleep normally , it 's such a relief to fall asleep without passing out because of drugs or alcohol . "
Mikaila Tyhurst from Crumpsall in Manchester has been ravaged by the chemical gamma- butyrolactane ( GBL ) , which is used as a party drug .
Her once pretty blonde looks are gone - instead what stares back is a gaunt face , puffy eyes and a toothless grimace .
She started taking GBL when she was just 18 .
Now she is trying to repair her life after losing four years to the drug .
She has been receiving treatment in The Priory , a rehabilitation clinic .
As she recovers , the 22 - year - old says : " I am never going back there again . "
At 18 she had dreams of becoming an air stewardess , but now she is simply happy to get a sleep not induced by drugs .
If I ever think about having some GBL or some drink , I just have to think , how is that going to help ?
Mikaila Tyhurst " I was scared of the withdrawal symptoms , I was terrified that the shakes were going to start .
And when the shakes start then the hallucinations follow .
" When I first arrived in the Priory I was quiet and I was a bit nervous , but after that I started to love it .
" It was nice in there and I enjoyed being in there at the same time I was getting help , but it 's going to be a difficult road . "
The mother - of - one went to workshops about the effects of alcohol and talked about her experiences with former addicts .
" I used to just pass out after I had drank too much or taken too many drugs .
I used to sleep anywhere .
" Now I put my pyjamas on and go to bed . "
Mikaila
Tyhurst lost her front teeth in a drug - induced fall
Her front teeth were knocked out in a drug - induced fall , she has liver damage and four months ago she nearly died of an overdose .
She took the drug almost every day for four years .
GBL is an industrial solvent and there is no law against possessing it .
However , when swallowed it behaves like the banned drug GHB .
It can make user feel euphoric , but it highly addictive and can also cause unpleasant effects including unconsciousness , muscle spasms and vomiting .
Beating the habit is not easy , with extreme anxiety , nausea and hallucinations all possible .
Despite this , she is determined to conquer her addiction .
" If I ever think about having some GBL or some drink , I just have to think , ' What 's another bottle ?
How is that going to help ?
I 'll drink that and then I 'll be back in the same place ' .
" I want to spend time with my little girl . "
Following campaigns by people who have lost loved ones to GBL , Home Secretary Alan Johnson has said he wants to tackle the problems around such chemicals .
He said : " There is a perception that many of the so - called legal highs are harmless .
" However , in some cases people can be ingesting dangerous industrial fluids or smoking chemicals that can be even more harmful than cannabis . "

A few weeks ago we heard rumors that the Motorola Shadow could earn the distinction of Nexus Two .
Today Motorola confirmed that they are working with Google on a new phone to be sold directly to consumers .

There 's no telling if the Droidesque Shadow is the device in question , or if Motorola 's will even be Google 's next flagship device , but during an earnings call today Motorola CEO Sanjay Jha confirmed that the company is working on a " direct to consumer device with Google . "

Jha did n't offer any details on the forthcoming phone , but his statement serves as confirmation of two things : Google 's Nexus
One was n't a one - off experiment and Motorola is involved in one of its successors .

Bugfixes
Another summer has passed - a summer which has been quite busy for the whole Amarok team , implementing new features , fixing bugs and making Amarok better every single day .
The team never stopped developing , be this on the beach , in a train station , waiting at the airport , in a cabin in the woods .
So we are now able to present you with a first glimpse of Amarok 2.2 in it 's beta 1 flavor , codenamed Crystal Clear .
All elements of your preferred music player have been worked on .
The changelog is indeed quite huge and impressive .
Amarok is now available with its new and improved browser layout on the left and the brand new videoclip applet providing you with music videos for your favorite songs from various websites .
A new photo applet shows pictures related to the current artist to get you in the right mood .
Many of the other context applets have also received huge updates .
Left , right , middle ... how boring .
Well , you can now change the layout of the different elements and place those where * you * want to have them !
You can even place elements on top of each other and switch between them using tabs .
Is the toolbar too big for your taste ?
Then just try out the brand new toolbarNG .
Of course we did n't stop at the visual enhancements .
We also improved the collection scanner and eliminated some errors there .
You can now rate your music in the collection view , the current track applet and also in the playlist .
Do you have a media device ?
Plug it in and it will show up in the collection browser .
Want to play a CD ?
Just put it in your drive and it will appear in the collection browser , allowing you to either play it directly or copy the tracks to your harddrive .
The playlist also has a ton of new features to offer .
It now offers advanced multi level sorting with an intuitive interface , full or partial shuffling and the option to change the way tracks are grouped together .
All these different playlist settings can be stored together as a bookmark and easily applied again later , so for instance if grouping tracks by composer , you can also apply a playlist layout that shows composer and not album related information in the group header .
Speaking of bookmarks , both the content browser and the playlist now have a very simple interface to store and recall bookmarks ; and for editing , grouping and deleting bookmarks , the bookmark manager has been greatly improved and is now accessible from the tools menu .
In the " Saved Playlists " category you will find imported playlist files discovered in the collection folders during scanning .
When you change these in Amarok 2.2 the files on disk will now also change .
You can find the full changelog below .
Please download , test , enjoy and make sure to report all bugs you find at bugs .
kde.org so we can release a rocking Amarok 2.2 in about a month .
A recently filed federal lawsuit documents how a veteran intelligence officer with the Defense Intelligence Agency ( DIA ) was accused of espionage and summarily fired after failing a series of polygraph “ tests ” ( a procedure roundly rejected by scientists as being without scientific basis ) .
The following is an excerpt from the statement of complaint ( 160 kb PDF ) filed on 7 January 2010 by attorney Mark S. Zaid in behalf of Lieutenant Colonel John Dullahan , United States Army ( retired ) against the DIA and others :
19 . Dullahan retired from the Army in 1992 as a Lieutenant Colonel after more than two decades of distinguished military service , including airborne and Ranger training , with the 82ndAirborne Division , and combat in Vietnam as an artillery forward observer .
During his career , Dullahan learned German , French , and Arabic , became both a European and Middle Eastern Foreign Area Officer , and served in various capacities for the U.S. government in Europe and the Middle East .
20 . In September 1997 , Dullahan returned to DIA as a civilian employee .
In the course of his work for DIA , he successfully completed a polygraph examination during which no issues surfaced .
21 . In early 2008 two FBI agents asked Dullahan if he would participate in a special program , subject to approval by then - Director of DIA LTG Michael Maples .
In or around February 2008 , Dullahan willingly participated in an FBI polygraph as a condition of his participation in the special program .
22 . During the polygraph examination , the FBI examiner alleged that Dullahan ’s participation in Ranger , Airborne training , and combat duty ( as well as his enjoyment of hang - gliding ) demonstrated “ risk - taking ” behavior which made him more likely to seek contact with a foreign intelligence service .
The polygraph examiner accused Dullahan of meeting “ Soviet handlers ” when he had visited — twenty years earlier — East Germany in the early 1980s , during his U.N. assignment in Syria , and on his numerous official trips to Europe while on the Joint Staff , including trips with General Powell .
23 .
The polygraph examiner also alleged Dullahan had adopted the Communist beliefs of his liaison counterparts merely by associating with them .
The polygraph examiner ’s supervisor likewise accused Dullahan of spying for the Soviets .
After the exam was complete , FBI officials informed Dullahan he had “ failed ” the polygraph and was “ in big trouble . ”
At no time did Dullahan make any unfavorable admissions during the course of the polygraph examination that would justify such conclusions .
Upon information and belief , the only “ evidence ” that allegedly existed to support the FBI ’s apparent conclusions was , if anything , the technical results of the polygraph examination .
24 . Both Dullahan and his wife , who was then and still remains at the time of filing a senior DIA employee , immediately reported the alleged FBI polygraph results to their respective DIA chains of command .
Dullahan further requested that DIA conduct an extensive background investigation to clear his name .
25 . Shortly thereafter , two FBI officials , Alexis LNU and Carlos LNU , showed Dullahan an outdated 1985 report that contained adverse accusations about his activities and informed him that they understood his probable anxiety about the incident , had no concerns with his foreign contacts , and that a second polygraph would likely resolve the issue .
They opined the alleged FBI polygraph failure was unlikely to present an obstacle to Dullahan ’s participation in the special program .
26 . In or around February 2008 , the FBI administered a second polygraph examination to Dullahan and again claimed that he “ failed ” .
At no time before , during or after the examination did Dullahan make any admissions that could be construed as adverse to his interests .
27 . Dullahan then sent separate letters to DIA Director LTG Maples and the FBI protesting what he believed was an unfair process and that the polygraph results were inaccurate .
He reiterated his willingness to participate in the special program as the FBI had requested .
No written responses were ever received .
28 . Shortly thereafter , FBI Special Agents Alexis LNU and Carlos LNU again interviewed Dullahan .
During this second meeting , the two Special Agents asked Dullahan why he had not previously reported an unspecified foreign intelligence service “ offer . ”
Apparently , Dullahan had mistakenly typed in one of the letters referenced above the sentence “ I went to the home of the Soviet offer [ sic ] . ”
The word “ offer ” should have been “ officer ” and the error was being misinterpreted as if he had gone to a Soviet home and received some form of recruitment “ pitch ” or “ offer ” .
Special Agents Alexis LNU and Carlos LNU now accused Dullahan of trying to conceal and / or lie about this nonexistent foreign intelligence overture .
In fact , Dullahan had received no such pitch or overture but his explanation , however , appeared to fall on deaf ears .
29 . On October 1 , 2008 , Dullahan wrote another letter to the FBI .
In it , he once again protested what he believed was an unfair process and that the polygraph results were inaccurate .
He again reiterated his willingness to participate in the special program as the FBI had requested .
Dullahan requested a personal meeting with the deciding authority and offered to re-take another polygraph examination .
No written response was ever received .
30 .
In November 2008 , Dullahan applied for another DIA position on the Joint Intelligence Task Force Combating Terrorism .
A DIA counterintelligence official informed him that the two “ failed ” FBI polygraphs would have to be resolved before Dullahan could receive another position within DIA .
31 . On or about December 18 , 2008 , Scott C. and Cassie LNU , two DIA counterintelligence officers , interviewed Dullahan .
They initially appeared satisfied with Dullahan ’s explanations and stated that resolving the issue was likely to be a relatively simple matter of administrative action .
Furthermore , they also noted that Dullahan was not the first DIA person to experience difficulties with the FBI ’s polygraph examinations .
They stated that the alleged FBI polygraph failures were unlikely to present a further obstacle to Dullahan ’s career and expressed their belief that a DIA polygraph , which was reputedly “ fairer , ” was likely to clear the matter up .
Dullahan willingly agreed to undertake whatever examination DIA deemed necessary to resolve the issue .
32 . On February 3 , 2009 , Dullahan underwent a third polygraph but this time performed by a DIA polygraph examiner .
The polygraph examiner informed Dullahan he detected deception .
No details were provided to Dullahan to explain the polygraph results , and absolutely no adverse admissions were made by him during the course of the examination .
33 . On February 17 , 2009 , Dullahan was placed on administrative leave and his clearance was suspended without explanation .
Upon information and belief , DIA took this action based solely , or at least predominantly , as a result of the technical results of the polygraph examinations .
34 . On March 17 , 2009 , DIA Director LTG
Maples personally issued two letters stating that Dullahan ’s employment with DIA was terminated and his SCI access was permanently revoked .
No substantive or detailed reason was given for Dullahan ’s termination or clearance revocation .

I 'm not going to go around flashing pictures of myself and I 'm not trying to shut anyone up .
I mean , if they thought that I was another not tough little bitch then the least they could have done was give a fair test of physical aptitude .
If someone came in there and obviously did n't have the gall to do the job than I agree , they should n't have gotten the job .
But the way that they went about it was completely inappropriate .
In any case , if it 's any consolation from the picture , the job I got right after that was unloading trucks .
On average the freight from the trucks was heavier than 50 lbs .
I was one of the only girls in the history of the store to unload trucks by myself , and when timed I did it faster than anyone else there .
I enjoyed timing myself because there was a sense of pride in accomplishing something like that .

You could take consolation in the fact that you do n't work with a bunch of jerks ?
Had you gotten the job , assuming the secretary job they advertised was actually available , you likely would not have liked it .

Ugh , I came across a lot of the same crap when I worked in a hardware store in high school .
I was hired as a cashier , but when I saw boys with tons less experience than myself getting moved from cashier to sales floor or stock room after mere weeks of employment , I started making some noise .
First , they moved me to housewares ( yeah , cleaning supplies and kitchen equipment ) where I was promptly bored to tears since that department never gets any action .
When they finally did open their eyes and put me in charge of the paint desk and let me work in the plumbing / electrical / hardware departments , it 's pretty much what you 'd expect : most customers would walk right by me , look confused , or straight up ask if there was a man around who could help them .
It was n't very long before I knew enough about the departments to help out with most of the questions our customers had .
Oh and you should have SEEN the looks on their faces when newbie boys would redirect customers to ME for questions .
The best part was when I was deemed scrappy enough ( at 5 ' 5 " , 110lbs ) to kick back and pretend to lift heavy stuff / break shit / assemble shit with the big boys in the back yard XD
Sometimes , the only way to do it is to prove them wrong .

If there are physical requirements for the job then there should be a test to judge whether or not an applicant meets the qualifications .
That 's the law .
Ditto for mental requirements .
You can't just decide you wo n't hire someone for the position because they do n't look smart anymore than you can refuse to hire someone because you do n't believe they are strong enough .
The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is where you file a complaint in a case like this or a state discrimination board ( or city ) if one exists .
Federal law states , you may not discriminate on the basis of sex , race , creed , color , national origin , religion , disability unrelated to the job , veteran status or vietnam era veteran status .
However , obnoxious , sexist know - it - all is NOT a protected class .
Troll take note .
You come back into the civilian workforce with that chip on your shoulder and you 'll be going nowhere fast .
Lots of good hardworking people looking for jobs .
No employer is going to hire someone who is going to be a PITA .

When I went through a rough spot and could n't find a job , I did some temp work through some local agencies .
I used to do plenty of warehousing , a bit of construction , etc .
When I went through another rough patch some years later , my hair was longer and I wore a bit more make - up but that was about it .
All of a sudden though half of these agencies wo n't send me out on most of the jobs , because the jobs want only guys .
I guess that 's how they passed the buck of responsibility though , technically it 's not them doing the discriminating .
It 's the companies hiring temps .
I much prefer physical jobs to office - based ones , but now due to an injury I pretty much stick to the latter . :(
An injury at a job with little to no lifting at all .

I know what you mean about that type of crap that women can't lift heavy things .
I worked in retail for several years , including a lot of lifting boxes off the truck and bringing heavy items to the registers .
I lift weights and 50 pounds is nothing , I could probably lift that much easily and 100 pounds if I took a while .
However I used to hear wonderful things from my co-workers like " It 's heavy , are any one of the guys here ? "
" You really should n't be lifting that box , you should get one of the guys to do that " or even " You should NEVER lift things that big , have a man do it . "
Every time I heard something like that , immediately I was going back to pick it up or getting a moving dollie if it was too big to carry in hand .
It was a big invitation and gradually people shut up about it .

Around Christmas
I went to visit my folks on the East Coast .
I like to workout regularly and do a fair amount of powerlifting .
So I went to the local gym , near my folks , and paid the $ 20 day pass fee ( yea , it was freakin ' expensive , but I really need the stress relief ) .
The staff kept attempting to direct me to the " women 's gym . "
I asked them if they had a squat cage and a couple Olympic bars in the women 's gym .
They looked at me like I had just grown a third eye .
I looked in the women 's gym and saw some sad exercise machines and a couple treadmills .
Nope .
Wo n't do .
So I went upstairs to the freeweight area .
I did my sets of deadlifts , squats , etc .
And got in a decent workout .
I lift more than any of the guys I work with .
Yet , I still hear the same thing as you whenever anything needs to be moved .
People at Sam's Club seem shocked that I can move a bag of dog food all by my little ol ' self .
Women are n't delicate little flowers .
We have power .
The frustrating this is that we 're expected not to use it and are rarely , if ever , given the chance .
End of rant .

You should probably mention the name of the law if you 're going to try to prove it exists .

What to do now That is definitely illegal .
Title VII made it illegal to discriminate based on race , gender , color , religion , and national origin .
However , they also recognized that differences in gender would effect one 's employability .
The courts ruled that businesses must decide based on qualification , not on gender .
For example , in your case , they can subject all applicants to a strength test and if it just so happens that all the female applicants fail the test and cannot be hired , this would not be illegal .
However , if the manager told you upfront that he did not want to hire any females , then you have the right to sue for gender discrimination .
I suggest you go over to the office again ( I doubt they still remember what you look like ) and pretend to be an applicant again and try to talk with the manager .
Be friendly and get his name .
Report him to the company 's human resources department and if they still do n't do anything about it , you should report the company to the federal labor relations board for not doing anything about your complaint .

As some one stated , Culligan is n't ' local ' at all .
I 've no idea what made you think that .
And , I do n't blame the guy .
Your a woman .
Men are stronger than women on average .
Its just the way it is .
Men are better at lifting 50 lbs over and over all day long .
Also , your a woman , so you might end up pregnant on him .
If you are pregnant you wont be able to preform your job at all .
Anyway , from all you posted , you do n't even know what the job entailed .
Annd there are also laws stating that you have to hire a variety of races , and sexes .
What if he already has 10 girls , and he cant hire all girls , because its illegal ?

1 ) Do n't advertise for a " secretarial " job if you 're looking for someone to lift 50 pounds all day
2 ) Do n't treat women like persona non grata , ever .
If , OMFG , a WOMAN dares to apply for a job advertised as SECRETARIAL , do n't yell back to the boss that " we 've got one of THOSE again . "
How would you feel if someone said that in front of you ?
How about if you were black ?

Is now not the right time to tell the story of a friend I had in my college days who was a 90 - pound woman with an um , nice figure ( 32C-ish ) who used to deshelve 100 - pound boxes at Home Depot by pulling them down onto her chest , turning and loading them on the skid - cart , lather rinse repeat about 100 boxes or so a day ?
I still fail to see how that did n't ache by day 's end , but she dealt pretty well .

The Icelandic president , Olafur Ragnar Grimsson has refused to sign into law a bill designed to reimburse money lost by savers when the Icesave bank collapsed .
Mr Grimsson called for a referendum on the bill to be held .
The country 's parliament approved the plans to repay 3.8 bn euros ( £ 3.4bn ) to savers in the UK and the Netherlands in December .
The money would have gone to the British and Dutch governments , who partially compensated savers when the Icesave online bank failed .
More than 320,000 savers lost out when the bank collapsed in 2008 .
Three weeks in the United States I was recently lucky enough to spend three weeks in Harrisonburg VA .
The first thing I noticed when I stepped off the plane is that cigarettes are $ 3.20 per packet rather than the $ 15.70 they are in Australia .
This was enough to initiate a real resentment of my home country .
After eating at Waffle House , my resentment was complete .

Half & Half
Finnigans Bar

United Airlines
Sydney Airport Sydney Airport incorporates an astonishingly clever luggage trolley system called Smartecarte .
Basically , you pay $ 4 and load up the trolley then enter the terminal .
At this stage you have to go up an escalator that does not fit trolleys .
Luckily , after removing your luggage and journeying to the top of the escalator , there is another set of trolleys you can pay $ 4 to use .
You can then use the trolly for a few minutes until you reach the international terminal transfer train that does not allow trolleys onboard .
Once the train reaches the international terminal , you pay $ 4 for a trolley which will enable you to take your luggage around a corner where there is an escalator that does not fit trolleys but has further trolleys at the top for $ 4 so that you can transport your luggage around two corners before reaching an escalator that does not fit trolleys .
Having exhausted both your budget and patience , you carry your bags the rest of the way .
Luckily the crowds part for you , due partly to you dripping in sweat , but mainly due to your ' I will stab you ' expression , so that you can arrive at the check in counter and pay $ 230 in excess baggage weight fees .
United Airlines
Many years ago , during a traditional family Christmas gathering , the family dog , named Gus , gained access to and consumed a 1Kg tub of butter that had been left out of the refrigerator .
He then proceded to vomit the entire 1Kg up under the table ( along with his prior meal of dog food and pieces of Christmas turkey ) .
The similarity to the gelatine egg porridge I was served on board the United Airlines flight from Sydney to San Francisco was disturbing .
Thankfully , my meal included a plastic cup of water so using the power of imagination and a plastic spork , I pretended it was a thin soup and made it last for over an hour .
Although hungry and bored , I was lucky enough to have an overweight American girl sitting in front of me with her seat reclined for the entire fourteen hours , thus allowing close inspection of her dandruff .
As her hair was very dark , by blurring my eyes I was able to pretend I was looking out of the window at a star filled night and at one point made out the Big Dipper .
Travelex
The Travelex lady is smiling due to the fact that my eight hundred Australian dollars just became around sixteen dollars American .
When I questioned her as to the small amount , she replied " No speak English . "
Waffle House Famished after spending a total of thirty six hours on flying buses and waiting in flying bus stations , salvation presented itself in the form of what is , without question , America 's finest restaurant chain .
If I were a food critic being asked to write about the meal and experience at Waffle House , I would provide a drawing of two happy fat people giving each other a high five .
The only negative aspect of the meal was that our waitress , Shauna , hung around and kept going on about her dying child and the cost of cancer medicine in the hope of a large tip but seeing through this ploy , we snuck out without paying and stole a Waffle House coffee mug in the process .
Snow I had never seen snow before visiting the US and while those around me complained about their vehicles sliding off the road and not being able to get out the front door , I secretly hoped the snow fall would reach several feet and trap me there for months .
My first snowball throw ever was a head shot and , taking into account the excellent degree of distance and trajectory analysis , I would have thought my girlfriend Holly would be impressed rather than driving off .
Faced with the prospect of spending the night outdoors many miles from civilisation , I built a snowman to ward off wolves while I started work on an igloo .
After two hours of work resulting in a pile of snow with a hollowed out cave large enough only for my head , I had to hide my relief when Holly came back , proclaiming to her that I would have been fine due to having read the novel My Side of the Mountain and that I was not crying , it was just a bug or dust or something in my eye .
Walmart
The first time I went to Walmart , I showered , shaved , dressed nicely and did my hair to the bemusement of those with me .
The second time , I went unwashed , in my pyjamas , at 3 am to buy a gun .
In Australia , we have a nationwide ban on anything even remotely gun shaped .
When I was about ten years old , there was an elderly man living across the road named Mr Anderson , that I ( innocently ) drove insane through a sequence of events over twelve months which included painting his windows black believing he would wake up and think it was still night time , tying his lawnmower to the back of his car so he drove off with it and putting several packets of raspberry Jello crystals in his fish pond .
The day I dipped tennis balls in paint and threw them at his house broke him and he came out screaming and waving a rifle before being arrested .
I did not see Mr Anderson after that but I am sure everything turned out fine and that he looks back on those times with fond memories .
Guns Having purchased a heavy gauge shotgun and armour piercing rounds from Walmart for the equivalent price of a carton of cigarettes in Australia , I befriended a local farm boy named Chuck by making up aboriginal words and telling lies about Australian fauna ( it is now a fact in Virginia that Koalas , known as Boogawigs in the native aboriginal language , communicate with each other through song and weave themselves jackets from gum leaves during winter ) .
Chuck drove us in his red pickup to George Washington Forest to drink beer and kill something .
Four drink bottles and a cinder block lost their lives that afternoon before a deer walked into the clearing and was shot in the leg .
As the humane thing to do is never leave an animal wounded , and having run out of ammunition , we clubbed it to death with the butt of our rifles , which took about an hour , then tied it to the bonnet of the pickup truck and drove home listening to John Denver while yelling ' Whooo ' at pedestrians .
Chuck wanted to ritualise my first kill by dipping his finger in the blood and wiping it on my face but as he had done a poo in the forest , without access to hand washing facilities , I told him that as a vegetarian this would not be appropriate .
Philadelphia
Made the long journey from Harrisonburg to Philadelphia for the sole purpose of visiting the famous Love Park .
My girlfriend and I fought just hours before due to me stating that I would rather go see the Space Shuttle than visit her family but apparently there is no Pissed Off At David Park .
We then drove home during a blizzard using a TomTom GPS system stuck on bicycle mode .
George Washington Forest
Shown here with her favourite piece of wood , Holly stated that it looked like both the letter U and a smile , " The two best things in the world . "
The Space Shuttle Prior to this trip , the only reason I had ever considered visiting the US was because it has the Space Shuttle .
Like a priest carrying home their first computer after hearing about child pornography on the internet , I was practically foaming at the mouth in anticipation during the drive to the Smithsonian Air & Space Museum .
I have stood in front of masterpieces in art museums that did not raise an inkling of the emotion I felt at seeing the Space Shuttle .
It was at that moment I realised the high horse on which I had laughed at Trekkies from had sidled away in shame .
On the way out , after spending the rest of our trip allowance at the museum shop buying plastic products made in China , I pulled my pants high up around my waist , gave my lunch money to a bigger boy and considered going over to Windows ® .
The flight back to Australia During the flight back to Australia , a small Jewish man , with a hat similar to those given out at Disneyland minus the ears , sat in front of me .
There is no noticeable Jewish community in Adelaide and this was the first Jewish man I had ever seen .
I had also never met a black man before visiting the US and the first was a baggage handler at San Francisco airport who I asked to pose for photos with me to mark the occasion but was told that he was very busy and to stop blocking the aisle .
Having little time for religions and assuming , like a clown and a clown carrying an umbrella , they are all pretty much the same thing , I watched carefully as the Jewish man collected his bag , went to the toilet and emerged a lengthy time later covered in sweat and breathing heavily .
Thinking that if I stopped him from setting off a bomb I would be on the news for being brave , I was vaguely disappointed when I noticed through the crack between the seats , a copy of Hustler peeking out the top of his bag .
Following research upon returning to Australia , it would seem that Jewish people are not generally known for blowing up planes as they are too busy slashing cows throats , dancing badly and not buying each other Christmas gifts .
Although the initial investment was costly , totaling $ 550 , it took only a few months to recoup the money .
Back in the olden days of cable we were forced to shell out a relatively standard $ 140 a month , for television service alone .
This cost gave us access to a digital video recorder and hundreds of unwatched TV channels .
Contrast this with today , where our only expense is $ 9 a month to stream Netflix videos from the Web and the $ 30 a month that we always spent on an Internet connection .
O.K. , maybe that ’s not completely accurate .
When the wireless keyboard died a few weeks ago I was forced to spend another $ 4 for two new AA batteries .
We ’ve not yet recovered from that financial loss .
We still come home from work and watch any number of shows , just like the people who continue to pay for cable .
We just do it a little differently , starting the computer and then using services like Hulu , Boxee , iTunes and Joost .
Another interesting twist to this experience is that we ’re no longer limited to consuming traditional programming .
With these applications we can spend an entire evening flicking through videos from YouTube , CollegeHumor or Web - only programs .
Here are a few of the applications on our home setup :
Boxee is probably the most clicked icon on our television .
You can download this free open - source application from Boxee.tv .
It ’s important to note that it ’s still in test phase and a little rough around the pixels , but over all it allows you to access almost any type of video content online .
You can easily stream CNN , Current TV , PBS and more .
Most important for us , Boxee easily allows access to the Netflix streaming service , which offers up thousands of movies and television shows ( just not always the most popular options ) .
Next there is Hulu Desktop , the joint venture among Fox , NBC , ABC and many other mainstream programming outlets .
This service allows you to watch more than 1,700 television shows , including traditional favorites like “ 30 Rock , ” “ The Daily Show With Jon Stewart ” and “ The Office . ”
Hulu ’s downloadable desktop application , as opposed to hulu.com , works extremely well with large screens .
Apple ’s iTunes application replicates all the features of Apple TV , allowing you to buy or rent movies and listen to your music collection .
Today ’s guest strip comes from Ryan Estrada .
If you ’re not familiar with Ryan ’s work , you need to make yourself familiar .
Because this guy is gooooood …
How good ?
He references a complete throw away detail ( The Ha- Ha Hut from this comic ) in the first line of his guest strip .
Attention to detail like that is the kind of professionalism that intimidates me from ever doing a guest strip for anyone else ever again .
I ’ll just refer all inquiries to Ryan .
Because , clearly , he has his bases covered .
I also gotta give it up to Ryan for the joke he came up with for his comic .
The career arc he developed for comedians was right on the money and probably applies to more comedians than not .
Eddie Murphy was the first one to spring to my mind .
Maybe Adam Sandler or a touch of Mike Myers .
Who else do you think Ryan ’s formula applies to ?
Mull that over for a while , leave some comments and then go check out Ryan ’s web site .
Thanks again to Ryan for providing an excellent guest strip .
I loved it !
Switching gears …
A quick Kickstarter update .
You guys have been doing great pledging to the Kickstarter fund raising campaign for Theater Hopper : Year Three .
We ’re now 52 % funded and roughly $ 1,500 away from goal .
But we have 20 days left to meet that goal – less than 3 weeks – so I ’m still on pins and needles !
When you think about the holidays coming up and the distraction that causes , we really have LESS than 3 weeks to meet our goal !
Please pledge to the fund raising campaign today .
As of this posting , we ’re $ 74 away from $ 2,000 .
I think if we could top $ 2,000 today , that would be excellent .
I am trying to push us toward “ the tipping point ” – that moment where people look at the campaign and say to themselves “ Hey , this is really happening !
I think I ’m going to make a pledge myself ” and the whole thing takes off .
I watched it happen with Gordon ’s fund raising campaign for the first Multiplex book .
He pushed and pushed for weeks .
Then , one day , I think he was 70 % to goal and I told him “ That was the tipping point , man .
You ’re going to fund this thing no problem . ”
Within 3 days , the rest of the campaign was funded .
It was pretty cool to watch .
Help us get to the tipping point .
Pledge today .
Last bit of news …
You ’ve probably seen it already , but Iron Man 2 released another poster .
This time featuring Mikey Rourke as the villain Whiplash .
Please keep in mind that this guy is 57 years - old .
Looks pretty good for his age , if you ask me .
Well , you know , except the face that looks like hamburger .
By the way , does anyone else think that it ’s AWESOME that we have a superhero movie where the lead actor is 44 years - old and going toe - to - toe with a 57 year - old ?
I love Iron Man for several reasons .
But I think the filmmakers rejection of youth culture is in my Top 10 “ Reasons to love Iron Man ” list .
Just awesome .
That ’s it for today !
Thanks for stopping by and have a great weekend !
The squatters of Chiawelo share the District 9 limelight with another group on the bottom rung of society .
Nigerian immigrants play a large part in the film – taking the roles of gangsters , prostitutes or witch - doctors .
They are depicted eating alien flesh or having sex with the creatures .
Many Nigerians are furious .
An internet backlash is under way with an online petition and a Facebook group , " District 9 Hates Nigerians " , accusing the film of xenophobia .
One blogger , Nicole Stamp , wrote : " That 's Hollywood 's Africa , is n't it .
Black Africans shown as degenerate savages who'll have sex with non-humans and are pretty damn eager to eat people .
Disgusting . "
There was further criticism yesterday from the Nigerian - born British actor Hakeem Kae-Kazim , who appeared in the films Hotel Rwanda and Wolverine .
He told South Africa 's Beeld newspaper that many Nigerians were upset about the film .
" I have lived in South Africa , " he said .
" The country has so many beautiful things to offer … its problems can't be ascribed only to a small group of people . "
On Facebook , he wrote : " If the African continent truly wants to be liberated , we can not sit back and allow this depiction of a ' few rotten apples ' to be spread across the world . "
He expressed concern that District 9 would reinforce negative stereotypes of all Africans .
" The idea that it 's not only Nigerians , but all Africans who behave in that way , will be spread across the world .
I find that to be a painful thought .
The manner in which the Nigerians are depicted cannot be justified . "
Detecting dark matter : this Hubble Space Telescope ( HST ) data shows the distribution of invisible dark matter across a cluster of galaxies .
Update 12 February 2010 : The results have now been published in Science ( DOI : 10.1126/science.1186112 ) .
Deep inside an abandoned iron mine in northern Minnesota , physicists may have spotted the clearest signal yet of dark matter , the mysterious stuff that is thought to make up 90 per cent of the mass of the universe .
The Cryogenic Dark Matter Search ( CDMS ) collaboration has announced that its experiment has seen tantalising glimpses of what could be dark matter .
The CDMS - II experiment operates nearly three - quarters of a kilometre underground in the Soudan mine .
It is looking for so - called weakly interacting massive particles ( WIMPs ) , which are thought to make up dark matter .

The experiment consists of five stacks of detectors .
Each stack contains six ultra - pure crystals of germanium or silicon at a temperature of 40 millikelvin , a touch above absolute zero .
These are designed to detect dark matter particles by looking at the energy released when a particle smashes into a nucleus of germanium or silicon .
The problem is that many other particles – including cosmic rays and those emitted by the radioactivity of surrounding rock – can create signals in the detector that look like dark matter .
So the experiment has been carefully designed to shield the crystals from such background “ noise ” .
The idea is that when the detector works for a long time without seeing any background particles , then if it does see something , it ’s most likely to be a dark matter particle .
Signal or noise ?
When the CDMS - II team looked at the analysis of their latest run – after accounting for all possible background particles and any faulty detectors in their stacks – they were in for a surprise .
Their statistical models predicted that they would see 0.8 events during a run between 2007 and 2008 , but instead they saw two .
The team is not claiming discovery of dark matter , because the result is not statistically significant .
There is a 1 - in - 4 chance that it is merely due to fluctuations in the background noise .
Had the experiment seen five events above the expected background , the claim for having detected dark matter would have been a lot stronger .
Nonetheless , the team cannot dismiss the possibility that the two events are because of dark matter .
The two events have characteristics consistent with those expected from WIMPs ( PDF ) .
The CDMS - II team is planning to refine the analysis of their data in the next few months .
In addition , they have begun building new detectors in the mine , which will be three times as sensitive as the existing setup .
These “ SuperCDMS ” detectors are expected be in place by middle of next year .
Signs from space
Despite the reservations , there is a palpable sense that an incontrovertible detection of dark matter is imminent .
Space - based telescopes like PAMELA have seen particles that could be coming from the annihilation of dark matter in our galaxy .
Similar sightings have been made by a balloon - based experiment called ATIC .
Soon , the Large Hadron Collider will be starting to smash protons together in the hopes of creating dark matter .
Dan Tovey at the University of Sheffield , UK , who works on the LHC ’s ATLAS detector , says that while the CDMS results are not statistically significant , they are bound to generate excitement at the LHC .
“ I ’m sure that people will be looking at [ these results ] with a lot of interest , ” he says .
He points out that even if direct detection experiments like CDMS find evidence of dark matter , the LHC will have to create them in order for us to understand the underlying physics .
For instance , the theory of supersymmetry predicts a kind of dark matter that will be the target of searches at the LHC .
“ The really exciting aspect of all this is that if you see a signal in a direct - detection dark matter experiment and a signal for supersymmetry at the LHC , you can compare those two observations and investigate whether they are compatible with each other , ” says Tovey .

Considered by some to be the greatest philosopher of the 20th century , Ludwig Wittgenstein played a central , if controversial , role in 20th - century analytic philosophy .
He continues to influence current philosophical thought in topics as diverse as logic and language , perception and intention , ethics and religion , aesthetics and culture .
Originally , there were two commonly recognized stages of Wittgenstein ’s thought — the early and the later — both of which were taken to be pivotal in their respective periods .
In more recent scholarship , this division has been questioned : some interpreters have claimed a unity between all stages of his thought , while others talk of a more nuanced division , adding stages such as the middle Wittgenstein and the third Wittgenstein .
Still , it is commonly acknowledged that the early Wittgenstein is epitomized in his Tractatus Logico - Philosophicus .
By showing the application of modern logic to metaphysics , via language , he provided new insights into the relations between world , thought and language and thereby into the nature of philosophy .
It is the later Wittgenstein , mostly recognized in the Philosophical Investigations , who took the more revolutionary step in critiquing all of traditional philosophy including its climax in his own early work .
The nature of his new philosophy is heralded as anti-systematic through and through , yet still conducive to genuine philosophical understanding of traditional problems .
1. Biographical Sketch
Wittgenstein was born on April 26 , 1889 in Vienna , Austria , to a wealthy industrial family , well - situated in intellectual and cultural Viennese circles .
In 1908 he began his studies in aeronautical engineering at Manchester University where his interest in the philosophy of pure mathematics led him to Frege .
Upon Frege ’s advice , in 1911 he went to Cambridge to study with Bertrand Russell .
Russell wrote , upon meeting Wittgenstein : “ An unknown German appeared … obstinate and perverse , but I think not stupid ” ( quoted by Monk 1990 : 38f ) .
Within one year , Russell was committed : “ I shall certainly encourage him .
Perhaps he will do great things …
I love him and feel he will solve the problems I am too old to solve ” ( quoted by Monk 1990 : 41 ) .
Russell ’s insight was accurate .
Wittgenstein was idiosyncratic in his habits and way of life , yet profoundly acute in his philosophical sensitivity .
During his years in Cambridge , from 1911 to 1913 , Wittgenstein conducted several conversations on philosophy and the foundations of logic with Russell , with whom he had an emotional and intense relationship , as well as with Moore and Keynes .
He retreated to isolation in Norway , for months at a time , in order to ponder these philosophical problems and to work out their solutions .
In 1913 he returned to Austria and in 1914 , at the start of World War I ( 1914 –1918 ) , joined the Austrian army .
He was taken captive in 1918 and spent the remaining months of the war at a prison camp .
It was during the war that he wrote the notes and drafts of his first important work , Tractatus Logico - Philosophicus .
After the war the book was published in German and translated into English .
In 1920 Wittgenstein , now divorced from philosophy ( having , to his mind , solved all philosophical problems in the Tractatus ) , gave away his part of his family ’s fortune and pursued several ‘ professions ’ ( gardener , teacher , architect , etc. ) in and around Vienna .
It was only in 1929 that he returned to Cambridge to resume his philosophical vocation , after having been exposed to discussions on the philosophy of mathematics and science with members of the Vienna Circle , whose conception of logical empiricism was indebted to his Tractatus account of logic as tautologous , and his philosophy as concerned with logical syntax .
During these first years in Cambridge his conception of philosophy and its problems underwent dramatic changes that are recorded in several volumes of conversations , lecture notes , and letters ( e.g. , Ludwig Wittgenstein and the Vienna Circle , The Blue and Brown Books , Philosophical Grammar ) .
Sometimes termed the ‘ middle Wittgenstein ’ , this period heralds a rejection of dogmatic philosophy , including both traditional works and the Tractatus itself .
In the 1930s and 1940s Wittgenstein conducted seminars at Cambridge , developing most of the ideas that he intended to publish in his second book , Philosophical Investigations .
These included the turn from formal logic to ordinary language , novel reflections on psychology and mathematics , and a general skepticism concerning philosophy ’s pretensions .
In 1945 he prepared the final manuscript of the Philosophical Investigations , but , at the last minute , withdrew it from publication ( and only authorized its posthumous publication ) .
For a few more years he continued his philosophical work , but this is marked by a rich development of , rather than a turn away from , his second phase .
He traveled during this period to the United States and Ireland , and returned to Cambridge , where he was diagnosed with cancer .
Legend has it that , at his death in 1951 , his last words were “ Tell them I ’ve had a wonderful life ” ( Monk : 579 ) .
2. The Early Wittgenstein
2.1 Tractatus Logico- Philosophicus
Tractatus Logico- Philosophicus was first published in German in 1921 and then translated — by C.K. Ogden , with F. P. Ramsey ’s help — and published in English in 1922 .
It was later re-translated by D. F. Pears and B. F. McGuinness .
Coming out of Wittgenstein ’s Notes on Logic ( 1913 ) , “ Notes Dictated to G. E. Moore ” ( 1914 ) , his Notebooks , written in 1914 – 16 , and further correspondence with Russell , Moore and Keynes , and showing Schopenhauerian and other cultural influences , it evolved as a continuation of and reaction to Russell and Frege ’s conceptions of logic and language .
Russell supplied an introduction to the book claiming that it “ certainly deserves … to be considered an important event in the philosophical world . ”
It is fascinating to note that Wittgenstein thought little of Russell ’s introduction , claiming that it was riddled with misunderstandings .
Later interpretations have attempted to unearth the surprising tensions between the introduction and the rest of the book ( or between Russell ’s reading of Wittgenstein and Wittgenstein ’s own self - assessment ) — usually harping on Russell ’s appropriation of Wittgenstein for his own agenda .
The Tractatus ’s structure purports to be representative of its internal essence .
It is constructed around seven basic propositions , numbered by the natural numbers 1 –7 , with all other paragraphs in the text numbered by decimal expansions so that , e.g. , paragraph 1.1 is ( supposed to be ) a further elaboration on proposition 1 , 1.22 is an elaboration of 1.2 , and so on .
The seven basic propositions are :
Ogden translation Pears / McGuinness translation 1 . The world is everything that is the case .
The world is all that is the case .
2 . What is the case , the fact , is the existence of atomic facts .
What is the case — a fact — is the existence of states of affairs .
3 . The logical picture of the facts is the thought .
A logical picture of facts is a thought .
4 . The thought is the significant proposition .
A thought is a proposition with sense .
5 . Propositions are truth - functions of elementary propositions .
A proposition is a truth - function of elementary propositions .
( An elementary proposition is a truth function of itself . )
( An elementary proposition is a truth function of itself . )
6 . The general form of truth - function is \ ( [ \bar{p} , \ bar{\xi} , N( \bar{\xi} ) ] \ ) .
The general form of a truth - function is \ ( [ \bar{p} , \ bar{\xi} , N( \bar{\xi} ) ] \ ) .
This is the general form of proposition .
This is the general form of a proposition .
7 . Whereof one cannot speak , thereof one must be silent .
What we can not speak about we must pass over in silence .
Clearly , the book addresses the central problems of philosophy which deal with the world , thought and language , and presents a ‘ solution ’ ( as Wittgenstein terms it ) of these problems that is grounded in logic and in the nature of representation .
The world is represented by thought , which is a proposition with sense , since they all — world , thought , and proposition — share the same logical form .
Hence , the thought and the proposition can be pictures of the facts .
Starting with a seeming metaphysics , Wittgenstein sees the world as consisting of facts ( 1 ) , rather than the traditional , atomistic conception of a world made up of objects .
Facts are existent states of affairs ( 2 ) and states of affairs , in turn , are combinations of objects .
“ Objects are simple ” ( TLP 2.02 ) but objects can fit together in various determinate ways .
They may have various properties and may hold diverse relations to one another .
Objects combine with one another according to their logical , internal properties .
That is to say , an object ’s internal properties determine the possibilities of its combination with other objects ; this is its logical form .
Thus , states of affairs , being comprised of objects in combination , are inherently complex .
The states of affairs which do exist could have been otherwise .
This means that states of affairs are either actual ( existent ) or possible .
It is the totality of states of affairs — actual and possible — that makes up the whole of reality .
The world is precisely those states of affairs which do exist .
The move to thought , and thereafter to language , is perpetrated with the use of Wittgenstein ’s famous idea that thoughts , and propositions , are pictures — “ the picture is a model of reality ” ( TLP 2.12 ) .
Pictures are made up of elements that together constitute the picture .
Each element represents an object , and the combination of elements in the picture represents the combination of objects in a state of affairs .
The logical structure of the picture , whether in thought or in language , is isomorphic with the logical structure of the state of affairs which it pictures .
More subtle is Wittgenstein ’s insight that the possibility of this structure being shared by the picture ( the thought , the proposition ) and the state of affairs is the pictorial form .
“ That is how a picture is attached to reality ; it reaches right out to it ” ( TLP 2.1511 ) .
This leads to an understanding of what the picture can picture ; but also what it cannot — its own pictorial form .
While “ the logical picture of the facts is the thought ” ( 3 ) , in the move to language Wittgenstein continues to investigate the possibilities of significance for propositions ( 4 ) .
Logical analysis , in the spirit of Frege and Russell , guides the work , with Wittgenstein using logical calculus to carry out the construction of his system .
Explaining that “ Only the proposition has sense ; only in the context of a proposition has a name meaning ” ( TLP 3.3 ) , he provides the reader with the two conditions for sensical language .
First , the structure of the proposition must conform to the constraints of logical form , and second , the elements of the proposition must have reference ( bedeutung ) .
These conditions have far - reaching implications .
The analysis must culminate with a name being a primitive symbol for a ( simple ) object .
Moreover , logic itself gives us the structure and limits of what can be said at all .
“ The general form of a proposition is : This is how things stand ” ( TLP 4.5 ) and every proposition is either true or false .
This bi-polarity of propositions enables the composition of more complex propositions from atomic ones by using truth - functional operators ( 5 ) .
Wittgenstein supplies , in the Tractatus , a vivid presentation of Frege ’s logic in the form of what has become known as ‘ truth - tables ’ .
This provides the means to go back and analyze all propositions into their atomic parts , since “ every statement about complexes can be analyzed into a statement about their constituent parts , and into those propositions which completely describe the complexes ” ( TLP 2.0201 ) .
He delves even deeper by then providing the general form of a truth - function ( 6 ) .
This form , \ ( [ \bar{p} , \ bar{\xi} , N( \bar{\xi} ) ] \ ) , makes use of one formal operation \ ( ( N ( \bar{\xi} ) ) \ ) and one propositional variable \ ( ( \bar{p} ) \ ) to represent Wittgenstein ’s claim that any proposition “ is the result of successive applications ” of logical operations to elementary propositions .
Having developed this analysis of world - thought - language , and relying on the one general form of the proposition , Wittgenstein can now assert that all meaningful propositions are of equal value .
Subsequently , he ends the journey with the admonition concerning what can ( or cannot ) and what should ( or should not ) be said ( 7 ) , leaving outside the realm of the sayable propositions of ethics , aesthetics , and metaphysics .
2.2 Sense and Nonsense
In the Tractatus Wittgenstein ’s logical construction of a philosophical system has a purpose — to find the limits of world , thought and language ; in other words , to distinguish between sense and nonsense .
“ The book will … draw a limit to thinking , or rather — not to thinking , but to the expression of thoughts ….
The limit can … only be drawn in language and what lies on the other side of the limit will be simply nonsense ” ( TLP Preface ) .
The conditions for a proposition ’s having sense have been explored and seen to rest on the possibility of representation or picturing .
Names must have a bedeutung ( reference / meaning ) , but they can only do so in the context of a proposition which is held together by logical form .
It follows that only factual states of affairs which can be pictured can be represented by meaningful propositions .
This means that what can be said are only propositions of natural science and leaves out of the realm of sense a daunting number of statements which are made and used in language .
There are , first , the propositions of logic itself .
These do not represent states of affairs , and the logical constants do not stand for objects .
“ My fundamental thought is that the logical constants do not represent .
That the logic of the facts cannot be represented ” ( TLP 4.0312 ) .
This is not a happenstance thought ; it is fundamental precisely because the limits of sense rest on logic .
Tautologies and contradictions , the propositions of logic , are the limits of language and thought , and thereby the limits of the world .
Obviously , then , they do not picture anything and do not , therefore , have sense .
They are , in Wittgenstein ’s terms , senseless ( sinnlos ) .
Propositions which do have sense are bipolar ; they range within the truth - conditions drawn by the truth - tables .
But the propositions of logic themselves are “ not pictures of the reality … for the one allows every possible state of affairs , the other none ” ( TLP 4.462 ) .
Indeed , tautologies ( and contradictions ) , being senseless , are recognized as true ( or false ) “ in the symbol alone … and this fact contains in itself the whole philosophy of logic ” ( TLP 6.113 ) .
The characteristic of being senseless applies not only to the propositions of logic but also to mathematics or the pictorial form itself of the pictures that do represent .
These are , like tautologies and contradictions , literally sense - less , they have no sense .
Beyond , or aside from , senseless propositions Wittgenstein identifies another group of statements which cannot carry sense : the nonsensical ( unsinnig ) propositions .
Nonsense , as opposed to senselessness , is encountered when a proposition is even more radically devoid of meaning , when it transcends the bounds of sense .
Under the label of unsinnig can be found various propositions : “ Socrates is identical ” , but also “ 1 is a number ” and “ there are objects ” .
While some nonsensical propositions are blatantly so , others seem to be meaningful — and only analysis carried out in accordance with the picture theory can expose their nonsensicality .
Since only what is “ in ” the world can be described , anything that is “ higher ” is excluded , including the notion of limit and the limit points themselves .
Traditional metaphysics , and the propositions of ethics and aesthetics , which try to capture the world as a whole , are also excluded , as is the truth in solipsism , the very notion of a subject , for it is also not “ in ” the world but at its limit .
Wittgenstein does not , however , relegate all that is not inside the bounds of sense to oblivion .
He makes a distinction between saying and showing which is made to do additional crucial work .
“ What can be shown can not be said , ” that is , what can not be formulated in sayable ( sensical ) propositions can only be shown .
This applies , for example , to the logical form of the world , the pictorial form , etc. , which show themselves in the form of ( contingent ) propositions , in the symbolism , and in logical propositions .
Even the unsayable ( metaphysical , ethical , aesthetic ) propositions of philosophy belong in this group — which Wittgenstein finally describes as “ things that can not be put into words .
They make themselves manifest .
They are what is mystical ” ( TLP 6.522 ) .
2.3 The Nature of Philosophy
Accordingly , “ the word ‘ philosophy ’ must mean something which stands above or below , but not beside the natural sciences ” ( TLP 4.111 ) .
Not surprisingly , then , “ most of the propositions and questions to be found in philosophical works are not false but nonsensical ” ( TLP 4.003 ) .
Is , then , philosophy doomed to be nonsense ( unsinnig ) , or , at best , senseless ( sinnlos ) when it does logic , but , in any case , meaningless ?
What is left for the philosopher to do , if traditional , or even revolutionary , propositions of metaphysics , epistemology , aesthetics , and ethics cannot be formulated in a sensical manner ?
The reply to these two questions is found in Wittgenstein ’s characterization of philosophy : philosophy is not a theory , or a doctrine , but rather an activity .
It is an activity of clarification ( of thoughts ) , and more so , of critique ( of language ) .
Described by Wittgenstein , it should be the philosopher ’s routine activity : to react or respond to the traditional philosophers ’ musings by showing them where they go wrong , using the tools provided by logical analysis .
In other words , by showing them that ( some of ) their propositions are nonsense .
“ All propositions are of equal value ” ( TLP 6.4 ) — that could also be the fundamental thought of the book .
For it employs a measure of the value of propositions that is done by logic and the notion of limits .
It is here , however , with the constraints on the value of propositions , that the tension in the Tractatus is most strongly felt .
It becomes clear that the notions used by the Tractatus — the logical - philosophical notions — do not belong to the world and hence cannot be used to express anything meaningful .
Since language , thought and the world , are all isomorphic , any attempt to say in logic ( i.e. , in language ) “ this and this there is in the world , that there is not ” is doomed to be a failure , since it would mean that logic has got outside the limits of the world , i.e. of itself .
That is to say , the Tractatus has gone over its own limits , and stands in danger of being nonsensical .
The “ solution ” to this tension is found in Wittgenstein ’s final remarks , where he uses the metaphor of the ladder to express the function of the Tractatus .
It is to be used in order to climb on it , in order to “ see the world rightly ” ; but thereafter it must be recognized as nonsense and be thrown away .
Hence : “ whereof one cannot speak , thereof one must be silent ” ( 7 ) .
2.4 Interpretative Problems
The Tractatus is notorious for its interpretative difficulties .
In the decades that have passed since its publication it has gone through several waves of general interpretations .
Beyond exegetical and hermeneutical issues that revolve around particular sections ( such as the world / reality distinction , the difference between representing and presenting , the Frege / Russell connection to Wittgenstein , or the influence on Wittgenstein by existentialist philosophy ) there are a few fundamental , not unrelated , disagreements that inform the map of interpretation .
These revolve around the realism of the Tractatus , the notion of nonsense and its role in reading the Tractatus itself , and the reading of the Tractatus as an ethical tract .
There are interpretations that see the Tractatus as espousing realism , i.e. , as positing the independent existence of objects , states of affairs , and facts .
That this realism is achieved via a linguistic turn is recognized by all ( or most ) interpreters , but this linguistic perspective does no damage to the basic realism that is seen to start off the Tractatus ( “ The world is all that is the case ” ) and to run throughout the text ( “ Objects form the substance of the world ” ( TLP 2.021 ) ) .
Such realism is also taken to be manifested in the essential bi-polarity of propositions ; likewise , a straightforward reading of the picturing relation posits objects there to be represented by signs .
As against these readings , more linguistically oriented interpretations give conceptual priority to the symbolism .
When “ reality is compared with propositions ” ( TLP 4.05 ) , it is the form of propositions which determines the shape of reality ( and not the other way round ) .
In any case , the issue of realism ( vs. anti-realism ) in the Tractatus must address the question of the limits of language and the more particular question of what there is ( or is not ) beyond language .
Subsequently , interpreters of the Tractatus have moved on to questioning the very presence of metaphysics within the book and the status of the propositions of the book themselves .
‘ Nonsense ’ became the hinge of Wittgensteinian interpretative discussion during the last decade of the 20th century .
Beyond the bounds of language lies nonsense — propositions which cannot picture anything — and Wittgenstein bans traditional metaphysics to that area .
The quandary arises concerning the question of what it is that inhabits that realm of nonsense , since Wittgenstein does seem to be saying that there is something there to be shown ( rather than said ) and does , indeed , characterize it as the ‘ mystical ’ .
The traditional readings of the Tractatus accepted , with varying degrees of discomfort , the existence of that which is unsayable , that which cannot be put into words , the nonsensical .
More recent readings tend to take nonsense more seriously as exactly that — nonsense .
This also entails taking seriously Wittgenstein ’s words in 6.54 — his famous ladder metaphor — and throwing out the Tractatus itself , including the distinction between what can be said and what can only be shown .
The Tractatus , on this stance , does not point at ineffable truths ( of , e.g. , metaphysics , ethics , aesthetics , etc. ) , but should lead us away from such temptations .
An accompanying discussion must then also deal with how this can be recognized , what this can possibly mean , and how it should be used , if at all .
This discussion is closely related to what has come to be called the ethical reading of the Tractatus .
Such a reading is based , first , on the supposed discrepancy between Wittgenstein ’s construction of a world - language system , which takes up the bulk of the Tractatus , and several comments that are made about this construction in the Preface to the book , in its closing remarks , and in a letter he sent to his publisher , Ludwig von Ficker , before publication .
In these places , all of which can be viewed as external to the content of the Tractatus , Wittgenstein preaches silence as regards anything that is of importance , including the ‘ internal ’ parts of the book which contain , in his own words , “ the final solution of the problems [ of philosophy ] . ”
It is the importance given to the ineffable that can be viewed as an ethical position .
“ My work consists of two parts , the one presented here plus all that I have not written .
And it is precisely this second part that is the important point .
For the ethical gets its limit drawn from the inside , as it were , by my book ; … I ’ve managed in my book to put everything firmly into place by being silent about it ….
For now I would recommend you to read the preface and the conclusion , because they contain the most direct expression of the point ” ( ProtoTractatus , p.16 ) .
Obviously , such seemingly contradictory tensions within and about a text — written by its author — give rise to interpretative conundrums .
There is another issue often debated by interpreters of Wittgenstein , which arises out of the questions above .
This has to do with the continuity between the thought of the early and later Wittgenstein .
Again , the ‘ standard ’ interpretations were originally united in perceiving a clear break between the two distinct stages of Wittgenstein ’s thought , even when ascertaining some developmental continuity between them .
And again , the more recent interpretations challenge this standard , emphasizing that the fundamental therapeutic motivation clearly found in the later Wittgenstein should also be attributed to the early .
3. The Later Wittgenstein
3.1 Transition and Critique of Tractatus
The idea that philosophy is not a doctrine , and hence should not be approached dogmatically , is one of the most important insights of the Tractatus .
Yet , as early as 1931 , Wittgenstein referred to his own early work as ‘ dogmatic ’ ( “ On Dogmatism ” in VC , p. 182 ) .
Wittgenstein used this term to designate any conception which allows for a gap between question and answer , such that the answer to the question could be found at a later date .
The complex edifice of the Tractatus is built on the assumption that the task of logical analysis was to discover the elementary propositions , whose form was not yet known .
What marks the transition from early to later Wittgenstein can be summed up as the total rejection of dogmatism , i.e. , as the working out of all the consequences of this rejection .
The move from the realm of logic to that of ordinary language as the center of the philosopher ’s attention ; from an emphasis on definition and analysis to ‘ family resemblance ’ and ‘ language - games ’ ; and from systematic philosophical writing to an aphoristic style — all have to do with this transition towards anti-dogmatism in its extreme .
It is in the Philosophical Investigations that the working out of the transitions comes to culmination .
Other writings of the same period , though , manifest the same anti-dogmatic stance , as it is applied , e.g. , to the philosophy of mathematics or to philosophical psychology .
3.2 Philosophical Investigations
Philosophical Investigations was published posthumously in 1953 .
It was edited by G. E. M. Anscombe and Rush Rhees and translated by Anscombe .
It comprised two parts .
Part I , consisting of 693 numbered paragraphs , was ready for printing in 1946 , but rescinded from the publisher by Wittgenstein .
Part II was added on by the editors , trustees of his Nachlass .
In 2009 a new edited translation , by P. M. S. Hacker and Joachim Schulte , was published ; Part II of the earlier translation was here labeled “ Philosophy of Psychology – A Fragment ” ( PPF ) .
In the Preface to PI , Wittgenstein states that his new thoughts would be better understood by contrast with and against the background of his old thoughts , those in the Tractatus ; and indeed , most of Part I of PI is essentially critical .
Its new insights can be understood as primarily exposing fallacies in the traditional way of thinking about language , truth , thought , intentionality , and , perhaps mainly , philosophy .
In this sense , it is conceived of as a therapeutic work , viewing philosophy itself as therapy .
( Part II ( PPF ) , focusing on philosophical psychology , perception etc. , was not as critical .
Rather , it pointed to new perspectives ( which , undoubtedly , are not disconnected from the earlier critique ) in addressing specific philosophical issues .
It is , therefore , more easily read alongside Wittgenstein ’s other writings of the later period . )
PI begins with a quote from Augustine ’s Confessions which “ give us a particular picture of the essence of human language , ” based on the idea that “ the words in language name objects , ” and that “ sentences are combinations of such names ” ( PI 1 ) .
This picture of language cannot be relied on as a basis for metaphysical , epistemic or linguistic speculation .
Despite its plausibility , this reduction of language to representation cannot do justice to the whole of human language ; and even if it is to be considered a picture of only the representative function of human language , it is , as such , a poor picture .
Furthermore , this picture of language is at the base of the whole of traditional philosophy , but , for Wittgenstein , it is to be shunned in favor of a new way of looking at both language and philosophy .
The Philosophical Investigations proceeds to offer the new way of looking at language , which will yield the view of philosophy as therapy .
3.3 Meaning as Use
“ For a large class of cases of the employment of the word ‘ meaning ’ — though not for all — this word can be explained in this way : the meaning of a word is its use in the language ” ( PI 43 ) .
This basic statement is what underlies the change of perspective most typical of the later phase of Wittgenstein ’s thought : a change from a conception of meaning as representation to a view which looks to use as the crux of the investigation .
Traditional theories of meaning in the history of philosophy were intent on pointing to something exterior to the proposition which endows it with sense .
This ‘ something ’ could generally be located either in an objective space , or inside the mind as mental representation .
As early as 1933 ( The Blue Book ) Wittgenstein took pains to challenge these conceptions , arriving at the insight that “ if we had to name anything which is the life of the sign , we should have to say that it was its use ” ( BB 4 ) .
Ascertainment of the use ( of a word , of a proposition ) , however , is not given to any sort of constructive theory building , as in the Tractatus .
Rather , when investigating meaning , the philosopher must “ look and see ” the variety of uses to which the word is put .
An analogy with tools sheds light on the nature of words .
When we think of tools in a toolbox , we do not fail to see their variety ; but the “ functions of words are as diverse as the functions of these objects ” ( PI 11 ) .
We are misled by the uniform appearance of our words into theorizing upon meaning : “ Especially when we are doing philosophy ! ” ( PI 12 )
So different is this new perspective that Wittgenstein repeats : “ Do n’t think , but look ! ” ( PI 66 ) ; and such looking is done vis a vis particular cases , not generalizations .
In giving the meaning of a word , any explanatory generalization should be replaced by a description of use .
The traditional idea that a proposition houses a content and has a restricted number of Fregean forces ( such as assertion , question and command ) , gives way to an emphasis on the diversity of uses .
In order to address the countless multiplicity of uses , their un-fixedness , and their being part of an activity , Wittgenstein introduces the key concept of ‘ language - game ’ .
He never explicitly defines it since , as opposed to the earlier ‘ picture ’ , for instance , this new concept is made to do work for a more fluid , more diversified , and more activity - oriented perspective on language .
3.4 Language - games and Family Resemblance
Throughout the Philosophical Investigations , Wittgenstein returns , again and again , to the concept of language - games to make clear his lines of thought concerning language .
Primitive language - games are scrutinized for the insights they afford on this or that characteristic of language .
Thus , the builders ’ language - game ( PI 2 ) , in which a builder and his assistant use exactly four terms ( block , pillar , slab , beam ) , is utilized to illustrate that part of the Augustinian picture of language which might be correct but which is , nevertheless , strictly limited .
‘ Regular ’ language - games , such as the astonishing list provided in PI 23 ( which includes , e.g. , reporting an event , speculating about an event , forming and testing a hypothesis , making up a story , reading it , play - acting , singing catches , guessing riddles , making a joke , translating , asking , thanking , and so on ) , bring out the openness of our possibilities in using language and in describing it .
Language - games are , first , a part of a broader context termed by Wittgenstein a form of life ( see below ) .
Secondly , the concept of language - games points at the rule - governed character of language .
This does not entail strict and definite systems of rules for each and every language - game , but points to the conventional nature of this sort of human activity .
Still , just as we cannot give a final , essential definition of ‘ game ’ , so we cannot find “ what is common to all these activities and what makes them into language or parts of language ” ( PI 65 ) .
It is here that Wittgenstein ’s rejection of general explanations , and definitions based on sufficient and necessary conditions , is best pronounced .
Instead of these symptoms of the philosopher ’s “ craving for generality ” , he points to ‘ family resemblance ’ as the more suitable analogy for the means of connecting particular uses of the same word .
There is no reason to look , as we have done traditionally — and dogmatically — for one , essential core in which the meaning of a word is located and which is , therefore , common to all uses of that word .
We should , instead , travel with the word ’s uses through “ a complicated network of similarities overlapping and criss - crossing ” ( PI 66 ) .
Family resemblance also serves to exhibit the lack of boundaries and the distance from exactness that characterize different uses of the same concept .
Such boundaries and exactness are the definitive traits of form — be it Platonic form , Aristotelian form , or the general form of a proposition adumbrated in the Tractatus .
It is from such forms that applications of concepts can be deduced , but this is precisely what Wittgenstein now eschews in favor of appeal to similarity of a kind with family resemblance .
3.5 Rule - following and Private Language
One of the issues most associated with the later Wittgenstein is that of rule - following .
Rising out of the considerations above , it becomes another central point of discussion in the question of what it is that can apply to all the uses of a word .
The same dogmatic stance as before has it that a rule is an abstract entity — transcending all of its particular applications ; knowing the rule involves grasping that abstract entity and thereby knowing how to use it .
Wittgenstein begins his exposition by introducing an example : “… we get [ a ] pupil to continue a series ( say ‘+ 2 ’ ) beyond 1000 — and he writes 1000 , 1004 , 1008 , 1012 ( PI 185 ) ” .
What do we do , and what does it mean , when the student , upon being corrected , answers “ But I did go on in the same way ” ?
Wittgenstein proceeds ( mainly in PI 185 –243 , but also elsewhere ) to dismantle the cluster of attendant questions :
How do we learn rules ?
How do we follow them ?
Wherefrom the standards which decide if a rule is followed correctly ?
Are they in the mind , along with a mental representation of the rule ?
Do we appeal to intuition in their application ?
Are they socially and publicly taught and enforced ?
In typical Wittgensteinian fashion , the answers are not pursued positively ; rather , the very formulation of the questions as legitimate questions with coherent content is put to the test .
For indeed , it is both the Platonistic and mentalistic pictures which underlie asking questions of this type , and Wittgenstein is intent on freeing us from these assumptions .
Such liberation involves elimination of the need to posit any sort of external or internal authority beyond the actual applications of the rule .
These considerations lead to PI 201 , often considered the climax of the issue : “ This was our paradox : no course of action could be determined by a rule , because every course of action can be made out to accord with the rule .
The answer was : if everything can be made out to accord with the rule , then it can also be made out to conflict with it .
And so there would be neither accord nor conflict here . ”
Wittgenstein ’s formulation of the problem , now at the point of being a “ paradox ” , has given rise to a wealth of interpretation and debate since it is clear to all that this is the crux of the general issue of meaning , and of understanding and using a language .
One of the influential readings of the problem of following a rule ( introduced by Fogelin 1976 and Kripke 1982 ) has been the interpretation , according to which Wittgenstein is here voicing a skeptical paradox and offering a skeptical solution .
That is to say , there are no facts that determine what counts as following a rule , no real grounds for saying that someone is indeed following a rule , and Wittgenstein accepts this skeptical challenge ( by suggesting other conditions that might warrant our asserting that someone is following a rule ) .
This reading has been challenged , in turn , by several interpretations ( such as Baker and Hacker 1984 , McGinn1984 , and Cavell 1990 ) , while others have provided additional , fresh perspectives ( e.g. , Diamond , “ Rules : Looking in the Right Place ” in Phillips and Winch 1989 , and several in Miller and Wright 2002 ) .
Directly following the rule - following sections in PI , and therefore easily thought to be the upshot of the discussion , are those sections called by interpreters “ the private - language argument ” .
Whether it be a veritable argument or not ( and Wittgenstein never labeled it as such ) , these sections point out that for an utterance to be meaningful it must be possible in principle to subject it to public standards and criteria of correctness .
For this reason , a private - language , in which “ words … are to refer to what only the speaker can know — to his immediate private sensations … ” ( PI 243 ) , is not a genuine , meaningful , rule - governed language .
The signs in language can only function when there is a possibility of judging the correctness of their use , “ so the use of [ a ] word stands in need of a justification which everybody understands ” ( PI 261 ) .
3.6 Grammar and Form of Life
Grammar , usually taken to consist of the rules of correct syntactic and semantic usage , becomes , in Wittgenstein ’s hands , the wider — and more elusive — network of rules which determine what linguistic move is allowed as making sense , and what is n’t .
This notion replaces the stricter and purer logic , which played such an essential role in the Tractatus in providing a scaffolding for language and the world .
Indeed , “ Essence is expressed in grammar … Grammar tells what kind of object anything is .
( Theology as grammar ) ” ( PI 371 , 373 ) .
The “ rules ” of grammar are not mere technical instructions from on - high for correct usage ; rather , they express the norms for meaningful language .
Contrary to empirical statements , rules of grammar describe how we use words in order to both justify and criticize our particular utterances .
But as opposed to grammar - book rules , they are not idealized as an external system to be conformed to .
Moreover , they are not appealed to explicitly in any formulation , but are used in cases of philosophical perplexity to clarify where language misleads us into false illusions .
Thus , “ I can know what someone else is thinking , not what I am thinking .
It is correct to say ‘ I know what you are thinking ’ , and wrong to say ‘ I know what I am thinking . ’
( A whole cloud of philosophy condensed into a drop of grammar . ) ” ( Philosophical Investigations 1953 , p.222 ) .
Grammar is not abstract , it is situated within the regular activity with which language - games are interwoven : “… the word ‘ language - game ’ is used here to emphasize the fact that the speaking of language is part of an activity , or of a form of life ” ( PI 23 ) .
What enables language to function and therefore must be accepted as “ given ” are precisely forms of life .
In Wittgenstein ’s terms , “ It is not only agreement in definitions but also ( odd as it may sound ) in judgments that is required ” ( PI 242 ) , and this is “ agreement not in opinions , but rather in form of life ” ( PI 241 ) .
Used by Wittgenstein sparingly — five times in the Investigations — this concept has given rise to interpretative quandaries and subsequent contradictory readings .
Forms of life can be understood as changing and contingent , dependent on culture , context , history , etc ; this appeal to forms of life grounds a relativistic reading of Wittgenstein .
On the other hand , it is the form of life common to humankind , “ shared human behavior ” which is “ the system of reference by means of which we interpret an unknown language ” ( PI 206 ) .
This might be seen as a universalistic turn , recognizing that the use of language is made possible by the human form of life .
3.7 The Nature of Philosophy
In his later writings Wittgenstein holds , as he did in the Tractatus , that philosophers do not — or should not — supply a theory , neither do they provide explanations .
“ Philosophy just puts everything before us , and neither explains nor deduces anything .
—Since everything lies open to view there is nothing to explain ” ( PI 126 ) .
The anti-theoretical stance is reminiscent of the early Wittgenstein , but there are manifest differences .
Although the Tractatus precludes philosophical theories , it does construct a systematic edifice which results in the general form of the proposition , all the while relying on strict formal logic ; the Investigations points out the therapeutic non-dogmatic nature of philosophy , verily instructing philosophers in the ways of therapy .
“ The work of the philosopher consists in marshalling reminders for a particular purpose ” ( PI 127 ) .
Working with reminders and series of examples , different problems are solved .
Unlike the Tractatus which advanced one philosophical method , in the Investigations “ there is not a single philosophical method , though there are indeed methods , different therapies , as it were ” ( PI 133d ) .
This is directly related to Wittgenstein ’s eschewal of the logical form or of any a -priori generalization that can be discovered or made in philosophy .
Trying to advance such general theses is a temptation which lures philosophers ; but the real task of philosophy is both to make us aware of the temptation and to show us how to overcome it .
Consequently “ a philosophical problem has the form : ‘ I do n’t know my way about . ’ ” ( PI 123 ) , and hence the aim of philosophy is “ to show the fly the way out of the fly - bottle ” ( PI 309 ) .
The style of the Investigations is strikingly different from that of the Tractatus .
Instead of strictly numbered sections which are organized hierarchically in programmatic order , the Investigations fragmentarily voices aphorisms about language - games , family resemblance , forms of life , “ sometimes jumping , in a sudden change , from one area to another ” ( PI Preface ) .
This variation in style is of course essential and is “ connected with the very nature of the investigation ” ( PI Preface ) .
As a matter of fact , Wittgenstein was acutely aware of the contrast between the two stages of his thought , suggesting publication of both texts together in order to make the contrast obvious and clear .
Still , it is precisely via the subject of the nature of philosophy that the fundamental continuity between these two stages , rather than the discrepancy between them , is to be found .
In both cases philosophy serves , first , as critique of language .
It is through analyzing language ’s illusive power that the philosopher can expose the traps of meaningless philosophical formulations .
This means that what was formerly thought of as a philosophical problem may now dissolve “ and this simply means that the philosophical problems should completely disappear ” ( PI 133 ) .
Two implications of this diagnosis , easily traced back in the Tractatus , are to be recognized .
One is the inherent dialogical character of philosophy , which is a responsive activity : difficulties and torments are encountered which are then to be dissipated by philosophical therapy .
In the Tractatus , this took the shape of advice : “ The correct method in philosophy would really be the following : to say nothing except what can be said , i.e. propositions of natural science … and then whenever someone else wanted to say something metaphysical , to demonstrate to him that he had failed to give a meaning to certain signs in his propositions ” ( TLP 6.53 ) The second , more far - reaching , “ discovery ” in the Investigations “ is the one that enables me to break off philosophizing when I want to ” ( PI 133 ) .
This has been taken to revert back to the ladder metaphor and the injunction to silence in the Tractatus .
3.8 After the Investigations
It has been submitted that the writings of the period from 1946 until his death ( 1951 ) constitute a distinctive phase of Wittgenstein ’s thought .
These writings include , in addition to the second part of the first edition of the Philosophical Investigations , texts edited and collected in volumes such as Remarks on Colour , Remarks on the Philosophy of Psychology , Zettel , On Certainty , and parts of The Foundations of Mathematics .
Besides dealing with mathematics and psychology , this is the stage at which Wittgenstein most seriously pursued questions traditionally recognized as epistemological .
On Certainty tackles skeptical doubts and foundational solutions but is , in typical Wittgensteinian fashion , a work of therapy which discounts presuppositions common to both .
This is intimately related to another of On Certainty ’s themes — the primacy of the deed to the word , or , in Wittgenstein ’s PI terminology , of form of life to grammar .
The general tenor of all the writings of this last period can thence be viewed as , on the one hand , a move away from the critical ( some would say destructive ) positions of the Investigations to a more positive perspective on the same problems that had been facing him since his early writings ; on the other hand , this move does not constitute a break from the later period but is more properly viewed as its continuation , in a new light .
LONDON ( Reuters ) - Jonathan Littell , who won France ’s prestigious Prix Goncourt in 2006 for “ The Kindly Ones , ” has picked up another prize for the same work -- the Literary Review Bad Sex in Fiction Award .
The annual prize was contested this year by literary heavyweights Philip Roth for “ The Humbling , ” John Banville for “ The Infinites ” and Paul Theroux for “ A Dead Hand . ”
The judges praised what they called Littell ’s “ ambitious and impressive ” novel , which was originally published in French .
“ It is in part a work of genius , ” they said .
“ However , a mythologically inspired passage and lines such as ‘ I came suddenly , a jolt that emptied my head like a spoon scraping the inside of a soft - boiled egg ’ clinched the award for The Kindly Ones .
“ We hope he takes it in good humor . ”
Littell was not expected to attend the prize ceremony in London .
The award was established by Auberon Waugh in 1993 .
It is designed to draw attention to the “ crude , tasteless , and often perfunctory use of redundant passages of sexual description in contemporary novels , and to discourage it . ”
ORLANDO , Fla . -- Stan Van Gundy has a request for the NBA : no more games on Christmas .
" I actually feel sorry for people who have nothing to do on Christmas Day other than watch an NBA game , " the Orlando Magic coach said .
The Magic were playing Boston on Friday , one of five NBA games on Christmas .
Van Gundy said he understands the high - priced TV contracts generate money for the league and it would be difficult to stop such games .
He said he wishes the league at the very least had fewer games on the holidays .
The Magic play games on Thanksgiving , Christmas and New Year 's Day this season .
" I think we get a little carried away with ourselves with sports thinking we 're more important than everything else , " Van Gundy said before the game .
" But that 's the way it is .
There 's nothing more important than the NBA on Christmas Day . "
Van Gundy believes the day is best spent with family .
He woke up early but managed to spend only about 15 minutes with his wife and four children .
They went to church services the day before .
Van Gundy said he had n't even had a chance to open his family 's gifts before the 2:30 p.m. ET tipoff .
The only time he could recall watching a Christmas Day game was when his brother , Jeff , was coaching one of them .
Van Gundy also said he does n't watch NFL games on Thanksgiving .
" Christmas to me , obviously basketball is very important to me , but there are some days of the year where it 's got to take a back seat to something , " he said .
Celtics coach Doc Rivers was n't quite as adamant , but he did n't disagree .
Rivers said it 's tough for players to be away from family , but he realizes the league is not going to stop playing on the holidays .
Rivers lives in the Orlando area and was able to wake up Christmas morning in his own bed .
He said he always watched Christmas Day games growing up because the league features the marquee teams .
" As a kid , you wanted to be on [ Christmas ] , " Rivers said .
" Then when you get to the league , you do n't want to be on any more .
You 're like , ' No , I changed my mind . '
But it 's going to happen , so why try to fight it ?
I tend to look at it as a reward . "
Van Gundy is doing what he can to give his team a break .
He gave the players consecutive days off for the first time this season for the upcoming weekend .
The Magic 's schedule -- with travel days and all -- has n't allowed for a break , he said .
" The league has been good to all of us in terms of what we get out of all these TV contracts and everything , so it would be a little disingenuous to complain too much , " Van Gundy said .
" But if I had my way , we 'd take a five - day break at Christmas .
I mean it . "

The long - distance scientific recordings of the blast wave from the first hydrogen bomb test have been rediscovered in a formerly classified safe at Columbia University .
On November 1 , 1952 , physicists created the second fusion explosion the solar system has ever known .
The first occurred around 4.5 billion years ago and ignited the ongoing fusion reaction in the sun .
The second , the Ivy Mike experiment , was shorter lived and detonated on an atoll in the South Pacific .
This 10 - megaton blast was five times more powerful than all the explosives used in World War II combined , including the nuclear - fission bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki .
The blast set off a low - frequency sound wave beneath the human hearing range , which was recorded halfway around the world at special listening stations designed by the Lamont Geological Observatory in Palisades , New York , for monitoring just such an event .
The microbarographs measured changes in atmospheric pressure , and were particularly well - suited to detecting a nuclear explosion .
As the wave passed , the ink - filled needles of the instruments scribbled on paper rolling around a drum .
It was the first time a nuclear explosion had been detected from such a long distance and it marked the beginning of international test monitoring , a key element of nuclear non-proliferation plans .
The recordings were swiftly marked " classified " and stuffed in a vault at Lamont .
And there they sat for more than 50 years .
Then , in preparation for retirement in 2008 , Lamont 's former security director Ray Long began cleaning out the safe .
Recognizing there might be something to the recordings , he contacted Paul Richards , a seismologist and specialist in nuclear - test tracking .
Richards immediately knew the measurements " were of historic importance . "
If they could n't be declassified , they would have to be sent to the U.S. Air Force , which originally classified them , or destroyed .
So , Richards tracked down the right people in the Air Force and asked them to declassify the documents so that they could by preserved for posterity .
" They had the bureaucratic problem that there was no obvious indication on how to do it , " Richards said .
" They were very helpful , but it took a while . "
Now , finally , more than 57 years after the ink was first laid on the paper , the recordings can be seen by all .
At first , the Lamont scientists working on the problem of remote nuclear - detonation detection thought they might need to get measurements from high in the atmosphere .
So they sent balloons up with recording equipment .
As an odd historical footnote , this research program may have launched the long - standing rumors of something strange going on near Roswell , New Mexico , when one of its stations crashed in the area .
" The program was called Project Mogul , and its goal , set by a postwar America wary of losing its atomic monopoly , was to search high in the atmosphere for weak reverberations from nuclear - test blasts half a world away , " journalist William Broad explained in a 1994 New York Times article .
" The debris , found near Roswell , New Mexico , was a smashed part of the program 's balloons , sensors and , of most consequence to the growth of spaceship theories , radar reflectors made of thin metal foil .
At the time , the Air Force said the wreckage was that of a weather balloon , a white lie . "
Over the years , scientists realized that they could use ground - based stations and did n't need high - flying balloons .
For years , microbarographs were used to measure nuclear weapons tests as they grew ever bigger , up to the largest test ever by the Soviet Union , which topped 50 megatons , a thousand times more powerful than the bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki .
Satellites largely took over weapons - test monitoring in the 1960s within the United States and Soviet Union .
However , with the signing of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in 1994 , cheap , easy - to - deploy microbarograph stations were deployed at dozens of locations across the world from Piñon Flats in California to Antananarivo , Madagascar .

Obesity is now just as much of a drag on health as smoking
In case anyone needs a reminder to stick to that New Year ’s resolution to slim down or kick the cigarette habit , researchers have confirmed that obesity and smoking are still the country ’s leading contributors to preventable deaths and illnesses .
In fact , the new findings , from a 16 - year survey of more than 3.5 million adults , reveal that being overweight has taken the lead as contributing the most to preventable poor health in the U.S .
The results , tabulated from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control ’s ( CDC ) Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System and published online Tuesday ahead of print in the February issue of American Journal of Preventive Medicine , document what public health officials have long predicted , that with the country ’s expanding waistlines , widespread health consequences have become increasingly common .
“ The total health burden of obesity surpassed the total health impact of smoking , ” concluded the authors , who are based at the Department of Biostatistics at the Mailman School of Public Health and School of Nursing at Columbia University in New York City and the Department of Community Health and Social Medicine at the Sophie Davis School of Biomedical Education at The City College of New York .
They ascribe this shift in large part to the drop in the number of U.S. adults who smoke ( from 22.7 percent in 1993 to 18.5 percent in 2008 ) and the increase in the proportion of people who are obese ( from 14.5 percent to 26.7 percent ) .
When the survey started , in 1993 , smoking was by far the leading cause of preventable death and disease .
But by the study ’s conclusion , in 2008 , obesity had tipped the scales — increasing in prevalence by 85 percent — to become the primary cause of preventable illnesses and poor health - related quality of life .
Smoking , however , still causes more cumulative years to be lost due to premature death .
A CDC - sponsored study , published last April in PLoS Medicine , found that as of 2005 smoking was the most frequent killer ( causing about one in five deaths ) , with high blood pressure following up close behind ( causing one in six deaths ) .
Obesity came in third at that point , being responsible for almost a quarter of a million deaths — or one in 10 .
And although total life expectancy in the U.S. rose by about 3.5 percent between 1993 and 2008 , the authors caution that morbidity and mortality from obesity eventually “ may result in a decline in future life expectancy . ”
By analyzing the data in terms of health - related quality of life , the researchers found that this metric is already on the decline ( it dropped about 2.2 percent during the study period ) .
Obesity alone contributed to a 127 percent drop in a measurement of quality - adjusted life years over the course of the study , the authors report .
The large dataset was based on telephone surveys of 3,590,540 individuals who reported their recent physical and mental health levels , so no direct medical examination or follow - up took place .
( The survey information was matched with the National Death Index to collect mortality figures . )
The authors note that , if anything , “ these calculations would likely undervalue the total health impact of smoking and obesity . ”
And reporting bias might also have played a role in understating the numbers : “ Data shows that participants tend to under - report both smoking and weight and , therefore , the burden of disease due to both smoking and obesity might actually be higher . ”

Scientists today unveiled rare video of the deepest underwater volcanic eruption ever seen , at a site where scorching 2,500 - degree lava explodes into cold seawater nearly a mile below the ocean surface .
" It was very exciting .
We 've never seen anything like that on the ocean floor , " said Bob Embley , a marine geologist at NOAA 's Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory in Newport , Oregon .
The West Mata volcano was discovered below the Pacific Ocean in an area between Samoa , Fiji and Tonga .
It is six miles long and four miles wide , rising one mile from the sea floor .
The top of the volcano sits 4,000 feet below the surface of the water .
Last May , scientists on board the research ship Thomas Thompson deployed a remote - controlled vehicle called Jason to get close to the rumbling volcano as it ejected molten bubbles of lava three feet across .
Embley described the scene as " an underwater Fourth of July . "
Samples collected near the volcano showed the seawater to be highly acidic , similar to battery or stomach acid , researchers said .
Despite the harsh conditions , scientists found and photographed a species of shrimp apparently thriving near the volcanic vents .
" Nobody would have predicted that things would have survived long enough in water that acidic .
It seems like it's too harsh a condition , " said University of Washington chemical oceanographer Joseph Resing .
The volcano is spewing a type of lava known as Boninite , which until now had only been seen in extinct volcanoes more than a million years old .
' A Very Rare Thing '
" Most of the eruptions on Earth happen underwater , and you would think by now we would have seen one .
It 's a very rare thing that we 've never seen flowing molten lava until now , " said Resing , the mission 's chief scientist .
Scientists hope deep - ocean eruptions can tell them more about how the planet recycles heat and matter at the friction points where Earth 's tectonic plates meet .
They also hope to learn more about how carbon dioxide and sulfur gases cycle through the ocean .
Volcano a Mile Beneath the Pacific
The National Science Foundation and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration paid for the research , which is being presented at the American Geophysical Union 's annual science meeting in San Francisco .
West Mata lies within the Pacific " Ring of Fire " , where volcanoes are common .
In the Philippines , authorities are moving 30,000 people away from the danger zone near the erupting Mayon volcano .
A New Zealand teen was forced to marry her boyfriend 's father and consummate the marriage after the groom gave her parents a pig and some mats as a dowry , according to a report on Sunday .
The girl 's mother and a man understood to be her stepfather have been charged with detaining her , " allegedly to force her to be the groom 's wife and to force her to have sex with him " , the Sunday Star - Times said .
The mother is also charged with assaulting her daughter twice over the marriage issue .
The report said the girl , of Tongan descent and believed to be about 17 years old , did not want to marry the man but an agreement was reached between the two families and she was obliged to honour it .
Her family was given a dowry of a large pig and expensive mats .
On her wedding night , the girl ran away to her boyfriend , understood to be the groom 's son .
It was then that she was allegedly assaulted , abducted and taken back to the matrimonial home to perform her duties as a wife , the report said .
Neither the girl nor her husband could be reached for comment but her mother told the newspaper : " My family 's problems are gone ... I do n't want to say anything . "
The mother and her husband are due to reappear in court later this month facing six charges , the most serious of which carries a maximum sentence of 14 years ' jail .

War crime case against Tony Blair now rock - solid
Neil Clark : A trial would be warmly welcomed by millions – so what happens next ?
By Neil Clark – December 14 , 2009
Tony Blair ’s extraordinary admission on Sunday to the BBC’s Fern Britton – that he would have gone to war to topple Saddam Hussein regardless of the issue of Iraq ’s alleged WMDs – is sure to give fresh impetus to moves to prosecute our former prime minister for war crimes .
The case against Blair , strong enough before this latest comment , now appears rock solid .
Going to war to change another country ’s regime is prohibited by international law , while the Nuremburg judgment of 1946 laid down that “ to initiate a war of aggression ” , as Blair and Bush clearly did against Iraq , “ is the supreme international crime , differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole ” .
Blair ’s admission , that he “ would still have thought it right to remove him [ Saddam ] ” regardless of the WMD issue , is also an acknowledgement that he lied to the House of Commons on February 25 , 2003 , when he told MPs : “ I detest his [ Saddam ’s ] regime .
But even now he [ Saddam ] can save it by complying with the UN ’s demand .
Even now , we are prepared to go the extra step to achieve disarmament peacefully .
I do not want war …
But disarmament peacefully can only happen with Saddam ’s active co-operation . ”
The view that Blair is a war criminal is now mainstream : when comedian Sandi Toksvig , host of Radio Four ’s News Quiz , called him one on air , the BBC , according to the Mail on Sunday , did not receive a single complaint .
But while it is easy to label Blair a war criminal , what are the chances of him actually standing trial – and how could it be achieved ?
Various initiatives have already been launched .
The Blair War Crimes Foundation , set up by retired orthopaedic surgeon David Halpin , has organised an online petition , addressed to the President of the UN General Assembly and the UK Attorney General , which lists 14 specific complaints relating to the Iraq war , including “ deceit and conspiracy for war , and providing false news to incite passions for war ” and violations of the Geneva Conventions by the occupying powers .
The campaigning journalist George Monbiot , who attempted a citizen ’s arrest of the former US Ambassador to the UN , John Bolton , for his role in the Iraq war , said at the Hay Literary festival in 2008 that he would put up the first £ 100 of a bounty payable to the first person to attempt a non-violent citizen ’s arrest of Blair .
Monbiot has also called for the setting up of national arrest committees in countries which , unlike Britain , have incorporated the ‘ Crime .

Seriously , with a title like that I do n’t need to add any hype to get you to read this post .
It can hardly get any better than flying a brand new plane with the latest avionics in one of the most beautiful parts of the world .
Well , actually , it does if you fly with a great instructor like Max Trescott .
He literally wrote the book on the G1000 / Perspective and he ’s great fun to fly with .
I flew for two afternoons with him .
We met at the Sky Kitchen at San Carlos airport .
It ’s a classic American diner with an airport out of the window .
The airport ICAO code is KSQL , presumably named for the Oracle database company which has its headquarters nearby .
On the first day , during lunch Max and I had a great chat about aviation and blogging .
We were so absorbed in the conversation that the waitress threw us out because we were hogging the table but we had n’t noticed that we ’d finished eating .
( If I had noticed , I assure you I would have carried on eating .
An empty plate is a challenge for me . )
After lunch , though , the work began .
We went to the West Valley Flying Club where Max briefed me on the basics of the Perspective cockpit .
Then we went out to the aircraft – a beautiful , almost - new Cirrus SR - 22 Turbo with Perspective avionics and all the toys .
It was in its own hangar and so it was spotless and shiny ; unlike the planes I fly here which live outside .
There ’s a little electric tow truck so you do n’t have to break a sweat getting it in and out .
To get fuel , you just radio the fuel company and in minutes a nice chap comes and fills the tanks .
I think the US is aviation heaven .
We flew east towards Stockton where we did some auto - coupled and hand - flown approaches using the GPS and ILS .
The weather was perfect – good visibility above cloud but a nice thick cloud layer from about 2,000 feet down to about 300 feet .
Perfect for actual IMC practice .
Since I had n’t flown for six weeks and there was a lot of new stuff to deal with , I felt very rusty .
But Max was very patient and the whole thing felt relaxed and unstressful .
Certainly , the Perspective makes it very easy to fly providing you get it set up properly .
The highway in the sky indicators make it very simple to fly an approach and the autopilot will fly holds and other complex stuff that the Avidyne system I normally use wo n’t do .
I also like the ability to climb at a given airspeed on the autopilot ; this is going to help people avoid autopilot - induced stalls and improve engine cooling on hot days .
Other cool features include : satellite weather , XM radio for long trips , Jeppesen charts and the range circle which adjusts in real time as you lean the engine .
With the keypad on the centre console , it looks , feels and works pretty much like an airliner FMS .
I had two concerns , which may resolve themselves with more familiarity .
The first is that there is a lot to learn .
I had a few “ why is it doing that ” moments .
It ’s all very logical but you need to understand how it thinks .
For example , you can set the autopilot to fly an approach and it will descend with the procedure or glideslope automatically .
Except if you have a higher altitude commanded on the altitude bug .
The logic is that it does n’t want to descend lower than the higher of the two settings .
But if you do n’t know that you can find yourself levelled off when you were expecting to keep going down .
The second concern is a more minor one , but I like the way I can switch the Avidyne MFD between north up and track up .
With north up , I can make position reports and estimate distances easily – this is important with airspace restrictions and intensive ATC around London – and then I can switch to track up for terrain , TCAS etc .
While the Perspective will switch , it requires major hackage in the system settings and so we flew with track up all the time .
The second day felt more comfortable .
I was beginning to get the feeling for the basic features of the system so that I could concentrate on the details , the approaches and my checks .
This time we headed southwest towards Salinas and Monterey .
We did a bunch of different WAAS and GPS approaches , some with the full procedure using the autopilot .
I love the way it can just fly itself into the hold and then sit there all day until you tell it where to go next .
The view out over the Pacific was fantastic and it was a real treat to be flying into Monterey .
Max says that you can see whales sometimes .
Heading back towards the Bay Area , the low cloud looked great over the peninsula .
As a special treat , we also flew an approach into Moffett Field for a close look at the airship hangars .
I wo n’t say that the best bit of the trip was putting the plane back in the hangar .
It was n’t .
I was sad to be done with my flying on this trip .
But getting to drive the electric tow tractor was a big compensation .
The spectacle of a US President receiving the Nobel " Peace " Prize just as he ’s announced the escalation of the war in Afghanistan – and , since his inauguration , doubled the number of US troops occupying that country – should forever confirm the thesis , which I ’ve argued in this space since the 9/11 attacks , that we ’ve been pushed into an alien dimension .
According to my theory – which I think has since been proved many times over – the sheer force of those planes ploughing into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon knocked the very structure of the space - time continuum off - kilter .
This momentous shift plunged us into an alternate universe – Bizarro World – where up is down , war is peace , and soldiers deployed in the service of " regional peacekeeping " – such as Obama ’s Afghan escalation – are " wagers of peace , " as the President put it in his Nobel speech .
" Wagers of peace " – my eye !
It ’s fitting that the inheritor of the Russian attempt to subjugate Afghanistan should speak in terms that can only be described as Soviet .
For all you post - cold war types , who reached political consciousness after the fall of the Evil Empire , the leaders of the Kremlin were fond of describing their efforts at conquering subject peoples as campaigns for " democracy . "
Occupied Afghanistan , when the Red Army was in charge , was officially known as " the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan , " in spite of – or , perhaps , because of – the fact that it was neither democratic , nor a republic , but a Leninist dictatorship that had zero support from the Afghan people .
The Red Army , the Soviets averred , was bringing not only democracy but " peace " to Afghanistan : one could say , in this context , that they , too , were " wagers of peace " in the same sense as NATO forces are today .
After deconstructing Obama ’s let ’s - escalate speech , practically line by line , I do n’t have the stomach to perform a similar operation on his Nobel peroration , aside from noting Stephen M. Walt ’s sage advice on the subject :
" How about we just ignore Obama ’s Nobel Prize speech ?
Instead of spending a lot of time parsing Obama ’s latest speech — to no one ’s surprise , it was thoughtful , self - effacing , nuanced , balanced , eloquent , lucid , well - delivered , etc. etc. ( yawn ) — I suggest we focus our attention henceforth on what he actually does . "
Good idea .
Along those lines , therefore , let ’s look at what is going on in Afghanistan at this very moment , where " President " Hamid Karzai is declaring it ’ll be " 15 to 20 years " before Afghanistan can stand on its own militarily , Kabul ’s mayor is continuing to run Afghanistan ’s capital city " despite being sentenced to four years in jail on corruption charges , " and the US is ramping up its counter - terrorist " special operations , " which have been quite active in the region – see the Nation ‘s revealing look at the secret war in Pakistan , whose sovereignty is apparently just a myth .
In regard to the " special operations " angle , General David Petraeus told Congress the other day " the strategy also includes development of ‘ community defense ’ forces , tapping local leaders to defend their territory in conjunction with coalition and Afghan forces .
That effort has long been pushed by the U.S. Special Forces Command , which has argued that the extremely localized nature of Afghan culture should be matched by a localized U.S. approach .
‘ It ’s a village - by - village , valley - by - valley effort , ’ Petraeus said , ‘ and we ’re using some of our best Special Forces teams right now to really experiment with this . ’ "
Yes , it takes a village to win the war , but what about that troublesome " localized " Afghan culture , an attachment to place , religion , and family that is part and parcel of their stubborn refusal to embrace " modernity " ?
How will we navigate the shoals of such savagery ?
As part of this effort , we ’re sending in nearly a thousand civilians , in part to carry out the political side of this war – a major aspect of the new counterinsurgency strategy in vogue at the Pentagon these days .
Some of these civilians will be anthropologists – and , yes , you read that right .
Indeed , the anthropologists have already arrived – with at least three such specialists among the US casualties .
To my knowledge , 36 - year old Paula Loyd , anthropologist and US Army reservist , is the third social scientist to be killed in Afghanistan , where she was working with the so - called Human Terrain System ( HTS ) , one of the US military ’s more Orwellian projects .
As someone posted on Metafilter at the beginning of this year :
" The circumstances of her death were gruesome .
Her death was then brutally avenged by a fellow HTS worker and military contractor , Don Ayala , now awaiting trial for murder .
" HTS , has been controversial from the start ( NY Times ) .
The American Anthropological Association has opposed the project in no uncertain terms , recognizing a long history of anthropologists ’ complicity with military and colonial power .
Loyd herself had been critical of the role of US military contractors in Afghanistan . "
Loyd was accompanied by Ayala and several US soldiers as she went out to a remote Afghan village to " interview " the inhabitants .
The US convoy came upon one villager , who was filling up his vehicle with petrol , and Loyd began chatting with him about the price of fuel .
In the middle of this tete - a - tete , her subject suddenly doused her with the petrol — and lit a match .
Reading this piece about the heinous attack , and the revenge killing by Ayala , we come across this statement by a sociologist - warrior presumably employed by the HTS :
" ’ In a counterinsurgency , your level of success is inversely proportional to the amount of lethal force that you expend , ’ lead social scientist Montgomery McFate told me earlier this year . "
The irony here is that an effort that aims at minimizing violence in this instance provoked violence — and horrific counter - violence , as Ayala shot the captured and subdued perpetrator in the head .
This effort to create a kinder , gentler form of colonialism , to make a military occupation a true labor of love , is part and parcel of the loony faux - Maoist " COIN " strategy championed by the Center for a New American Security ( CNAS ) , whose policy wonks have captured the civilian leadership of the Pentagon .
Their efforts to construct a " smart " version of George W. Bush ’s " war on terrorism " on the Af - Pak front are imbued with just the sort of pseudo - scientific claptrap that allows liberals to think they can similarly " experiment " – as Gen .
Petraeus puts it – on the American people as well .
This is where Republican critics of Obama ’s war , such as Utah Republican Jason Chaffetz , are absolutely correct in rejecting the idea that the US military is anything other than a very efficient killing machine .
As Chaffetz puts it :
" Our military is not a defensive force for rough neighborhoods around the world .
They are trained to be an offensive , mission - driven military force to protect the United States of America .
They are not trained to be nation builders or policemen .
They are trained to be an aggressive machine that destroys and eliminates the enemy . "
That ’s what a real war is all about , period , full stop , but we are engaged in much more than that , in spite of the President ’s protestations that he ’s not interested in " nation - building . "
We have launched a massive social engineering project in the wilds of Central Asia and it ’s only natural , therefore , that we should deploy platoons of sociologists " to place the expertise and experience of social scientists and regional experts , coupled with reach - back , open - source research , directly in support of deployed units engaging in full - spectrum operations , " as the HTS web site puts it .
Armed with the mantle of " science , " as well as rhetorical tropes of " realism " and self - described " pragmatism , " the legions of Goodness are fighting the " good war " whilst conducting a vast " experiment , " in Petraues - talk , on the Afghan people .
I ’m veering awfully close to violating Godwin ’s law , here , but I ca n’t help but think of the infamous Dr. Mengele , in this connection , as well as innumerable mad scientist movies in which the scientist - villain invariably wants to conquer the world .
Of the many conceits of " modernity , " this has got to be the most pretentiously laughable .
The idea that we can amass enough knowledge of the various Afghan subcultures to be able to manipulate them into supporting the military occupation of their country by a foreign power would be funny if the results were n’t so tragic .
But what else can we expect from our smug Washington elites , whose narcissistic fixations are devoid of either prudence or respect for historical experience ?
You do n’t have to have a degree in the social sciences to understand why the Afghan people will never submit to occupation , but , assuming the HTS is part of the Obama administration ’s jobs program , I would n’t want to contribute to the unemployment figures by letting them in on what everyone else knows : that their " anthropological " strategy is bound to fail , no matter how " scientific " it may be .
It is typical of Washington ’s smarty - pants liberals , who think they are the apex of " modernity , " to think they have a formidable weapon – one costing $ 90.6 million – in the HTS .
" Science " cannot defeat the natural human desire for freedom from foreign domination , and in the Afghans this universal trait is unusually pronounced .
Just ask the former Soviet leaders – those ill - starred advocates of " scientific " socialism – whose hubris was humbled and brought down by the mujahideen .
We emulate their example at our peril .
Green , Boudreau react to suspension
When Mike Green limped off the ice after a light skate this morning , he did not look like he could play 24 hours from now .
As it turns out , the NHL took the decision out of his hands .
Green was suspended this morning for three games without pay for his elbow to the head of Michael Frolik on Friday night .
The NHL 's leading scorer among defenseman will forfeit $ 81,606.21 .
Green referred all questions about the league 's decision to Coach Bruce Boudreau .
But the defenseman said he did n't think he deserved a penalty .
" No , I did n't at all , " Green said .
" I 've thrown that body check where you kind of come across - I did n't come across too aggressive .
I 'll let Bruce talk about the rest . "
Green got a two minute minor penalty for the infraction ; Frolik was shaken up but finished the game .
Boudreau , who was involved in the telephone hearing , did not agree with Mike Murphy 's decision .
( Murphy made the ruling because Colin Campbell 's son , Gregory , plays for the Panthers . )
" I do n't know how to react anymore , " he said .
" Obviously I 'm very upset about it .
But what can you do ?
It 's like fighting a ticket [ when ] you know you 're not doing something wrong , from the police .
You can't argue with them .
I better not say nothing .
I 'm just livid about whole thing anyway . "
Asked again , Boudreau shot back : " I 'm using ' livid ' right now , and I 'm not going any further with it .
Do n't try to put something in my mouth where I end up saying something stupid .
So let 's talk about something else , okay . "
When Boudreau was told that Green referred all questions to him , the coach chuckled and said : " Is he going to lend me the money ? "
Boudreau was referring to the possibility of being fined for being critical of the league .
Forward Brooks Laich , the team 's NHLPA rep , had a different take .
" Obviously we do n't want to lose Greenie , " he said .
" I do n't know if he was going play anyway after that knee on knee collision .
But at some point you have to take control of the game and protect the players .
You see what happened in junior hockey [ the Patrice Cormier incident ] .
At some point you have to make a statement where there 's not a gray area .
You can't hit to the head .
It 's black or white .
You hit to the head you 're going to get suspended . "
Veteran Mike Knuble added : " I did n't see the replay .
I was on the ice .
But out of the corner of my eye it looked like an elbow .
The guy was n't hurt , right ?
He finished the game .
He got him in the head .
[ The league ] is trying to send a message , especially in the wake of that Quebec league thing .
It 's protecting the players .
I 'm sorry it happened to Mike .
But guys know , an elbow to someone 's head is going to cost you one way or another . "
With Green out , Boudreau said he 'll turn to seldom - used D-man Tyler Sloan for tomorrow 's game against the Lightning .
" We 'll go with Tyler tomorrow and then make a decision after the game on what we 're doing , " Boudreau said .
As for Green , he might not have been able to play for a few days anyway .
He skated lightly on his own , but the knee contusion he suffered late in the second period limited him significantly .
" Just get better here , " he said .
" Lot of bumps and bruises anyway .
Just take care of my body here and make sure I 'm ready for when I come back . "
Let 's face it :
The iPhone 's " Genius " recommendation tool for finding apps is mediocre at best .
Fortunately a startup cooked up something better .
It 's called Appsaurus .
You " train " Appsaurus into understanding you better by tapping apps on a list that you like ; you swipe to remove those you dislike .
Every time you tap an app you might like , a new list pops up with possible recommendations .
You keep tapping and deleting apps until Appsaurus grows familiar with your preferences .
The app breaks its learning process into " Evolution Stages " ; the final one is " All - Knowing . "
It does n't end there , either :
It keeps learning with each app you select or ban .
I had some time to test drive Appsaurus and found a few gems after tapping through .
To me , an even more useful feature is the ability to perform a custom search for a type of app you 're looking for based on a search term and category .
From there on , Appsaurus narrows down the lists based on your criteria , and you find recommendations the same way — tap apps you like and swipe those you would n't consider .
Appsaurus is a slick - looking app , and it's better than Genius .
The App Store 's Genius tool makes recommendations based only on the apps currently installed on your iPhone , and it spits out a pretty bland list of recommendations , from my experience .
Appsaurus ' approval can be considered a triumph .
In November , Wired.com published a story documenting a major risk of developing for mobile platforms controlled by larger corporations :
You can be easily squashed if you inadvertently compete with the giant .
Software development house Hello , Chair was an example .
The team of three was working hard on an App Store recommendation tool called Appsaurus , but Apple beat them to the idea by releasing App Store Genius in September .
Put yourself in Hello , Chair 's shoes , and you 'll face some tough questions .
Do you keep moving forward with Appsaurus ?
Is Apple going to reject the app since it does something similar to a built - in iPhone feature ( as the company has done with apps that " duplicate functionality " of the iPhone ) ?
Ultimately , is it wise to continue competing with a giant ?
Hello , Chair opted to finish Appsaurus and submit it .
Apple did , in fact , reject the app a number of times :
The initial submission of Appsaurus pulled information from star ratings and user reviews to help make recommendations , but Apple is extremely protective of that data and would n't allow it to be used in the app .
Finally , after a series of confusing phone calls with Apple and tweaks to Appsaurus , the app showed up in the App Store on Monday .
And , albeit a compromise , the end result is still pretty sweet .
It 's available in the App Store for $ 1 .

The president 's plan to freeze non-military discretionary spending is n't good .
The new projections for this year 's economy from the CBO are much worse .
They project a $ 1.3 trillion deficit for fiscal year 2010 , the second largest as a share of GDP since WWII .
They project unemployment over 10 percent until mid-year , and still in the high 9s when the spending freeze bites .
In short , we 're trapped .
Unemployment is so high that it 's costing us billions in government revenues , but the instinct to rein in spending could potentially cost even more .
Obama wants to demonstrate -- to voters , to moderate Republicans , to international investors -- that he 's serious about tackling the deficit .
Ironically , the way he 's chosen to do that is by freezing all spending except the parts that impact security and entitlements .
But the main drivers of our deficit are , well , military spending and entitlements .
He 's demonstrating his dragon - slaying potential by fighting a dragonfly .
A spokesman for House Minority Leader John Boehner likened the freeze to " announcing you 're going on a diet after winning a pie-eating contest . "
Well , that does n't make a lot of sense .
If you 're a fat person who 's just won a pie-eating contest , you should start dieting eventually !
No , this freeze is more like a pie-eating champion announcing that his weight - loss plan is to stop drinking cafe lattes .
The gesture is only marginally related to his weight gain ( he 's a pie-eating champ , after all ) , and it might even backfire by making him more sluggish .
We have heard a lot from those furious that Obama has not solved all our problems overnight , how they feel that this country has somehow been taken away from them , how they feel a disconnect from the president .
But maybe it 's time for a different kind of rage , the kind this reader feels and I want to second :
The past year has been a very difficult one for me , personally and professionally .
I 've been up a lot more than I 've been down , and I 've been angry and frustrated with life , as we all are at times .
But I can't remember the last time I felt such overwhelming rage toward a group of people as I have felt toward the Republican Party and the conservative movement since President Obama 's election .
I simply cannot grasp what motivates these people , what compels them to thwart even the smallest attempts to clean up the enormous destruction they wrought under Bush and Cheney .
Irresponsible , hateful , mendacious , sleazy , destructive - these words do not even begin to describe them .
I am unemployed and have not found a new job after almost a year of searching .
I have a mortgage .
I also have a preexisting medical condition , thanks to emergency surgery I had to undergo nearly 18 months ago .
My unemployment benefits expire in five months , my COBRA not long after .
Like untold millions of Americans , I am preparing for the worst as the economy slogs through its agonizing turnaround .
I voted for Obama with proud but open eyes , knowing full well not just the magnitude of the tasks he faced , but the pure , unrestrained malevolence of his opposition .
Health care reform will unquestionably help people like me .
And now some low - rent hairdo , whose sole claim to fame is posing naked for some ladies ' magazine way back when , may happily destroy whatever chance this country has at moving in a more just , humane , and morally and fiscally responsible direction .
As you stated , the Republican Party of this new century is shot through with nihilists .
Unabashed nihilists .
But what leaves me shaking with anger damn near every day since President Obama 's inauguration is the pure smugness and nonchalance of their nihilism .
1. The Emperor You are the ruler of a medieval empire and you are about to have a celebration tomorrow .
The celebration is the most important party you have ever hosted .
You 've got 1000 bottles of wine you were planning to open for the celebration , but you find out that one of them is poisoned .
The poison exhibits no symptoms until death .
Death occurs within ten to twenty hours after consuming even the minutest amount of poison .
You have over a thousand slaves at your disposal and just under 24 hours to determine which single bottle is poisoned .
You have a handful of prisoners about to be executed , and it would mar your celebration to have anyone else killed .
What is the smallest number of prisoners you must have to drink from the bottles to be absolutely sure to find the poisoned bottle within 24 hours ?
Guess | Show Hint Show Solution Guess : Hint :
It is much smaller than you first might think .
Try to solve the problem first with one poisoned bottle out of eight total bottles of wine .
Solution : 10 prisoners must sample the wine .
Bonus points if you worked out a way to ensure than no more than 8 prisoners die .
Number all bottles using binary digits .
Assign each prisoner to one of the binary flags .
Prisoners must take a sip from each bottle where their binary flag is set .
Here is how you would find one poisoned bottle out of eight total bottles of wine .
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Prisoner A X X X X Prisoner B X X X X Prisoner C X X X X
In the above example , if all prisoners die , bottle 8 is bad .
If none die , bottle 1 is bad .
If A & B dies , bottle 4 is bad .
With ten people there are 1024 unique combinations so you could test up to 1024 bottles of wine .
Each of the ten prisoners will take a small sip from about 500 bottles .
Each sip should take no longer than 15 seconds and should be a very small amount .
Small sips not only leave more wine for guests .
Small sips also avoid death by alcohol poisoning .
As long as each prisoner is administered about a millilitre from each bottle , they will only consume the equivalent of about one bottle of wine each .
Each prisoner will have at least a fifty percent chance of living .
There is only one binary combination where all prisoners must sip from the wine .
If there are ten prisoners then there are ten more combinations where all but one prisoner must sip from the wine .
By avoiding these two types of combinations you can ensure no more than 8 prisoners die .
One viewer felt that this solution was in flagrant contempt of restaurant etiquette .
The emperor paid for this wine , so there should be no need to prove to the guests that wine is the same as the label .
I am not even sure if ancient wine even came with labels affixed .
However , it is true that after leaving the wine open for a day , that this medieval wine will taste more like vinegar than it ever did .
C'est la vie .
2. The Stark Raving Mad King
A stark raving mad king tells his 100 wisest men he is about to line them up and that he will place either a red or blue hat on each of their heads .
Once lined up , they must not communicate amongst themselves .
Nor may they attempt to look behind them or remove their own hat .
The king tells the wise men that they will be able to see all the hats in front of them .
They will not be able to see the color of their own hat or the hats behind them , although they will be able to hear the answers from all those behind them .
The king will then start with the wise man in the back and ask " what color is your hat ? "
The wise man will only be allowed to answer " red " or " blue , " nothing more .
If the answer is incorrect then the wise man will be silently killed .
If the answer is correct then the wise man may live but must remain absolutely silent .
The king will then move on to the next wise man and repeat the question .
The king makes it clear that if anyone breaks the rules then all the wise men will die , then allows the wise men to consult before lining them up .
The king listens in while the wise men consult each other to make sure they do n't devise a plan to cheat .
To communicate anything more than their guess of red or blue by coughing or shuffling would be breaking the rules .
What is the maximum number of men they can be guaranteed to save ?
Guess | Show Hint Show Solution Guess : Hint :
To solve this problem , you need to presume that each wise man can count the total number of red hats in front of them without error , that all the wise men have great attention to detail and that all the wise men care about the greater good .
Solution : 99 .
You can save about 50 % by having everyone guess randomly .
You can save 50 % or more if every even person agrees to call out the color of the hat in front of them .
That way the person in front knows what color their hat is , and if the person behind also has the same colored hat then both will survive .
So how can 99 people be saved ?
The first wise man counts all the red hats he can see ( Q ) and then answers " blue " if the number is odd or " red " if the number is even .
Each subsequent wise man keeps track of the number of red hats known to have been saved from behind ( X ) , and counts the number of red hats in front ( Y ) .
If Q was even , and if X&Y are either both even or are both odd , then the wise man would answer blue .
Otherwise the wise man would answer red .
If Q was odd , and if X&Y are either both even or are both odd , then the wise man would answer red .
Otherwise the wise man would answer blue .
There can be any number of red hats , as the following examples show ...
Prisoner
Hat he wears Number of red hats he sees ( Y ) Red hats saved for sure ( X ) He says 1 red 6 even ( Q ) N / A red 2 blue 6 even 0 even blue 3 red 5 odd 0 even red 4 blue 5 odd 1 odd blue 5 blue 5 odd 1 odd blue 6 red 4 even 1 odd red 7 red 3 odd 2 even red 8 red 2 even 3 odd red 9 red 1 odd 4 even red 10 red 0 even 5 odd red Another example might also help , as this puzzle seems to trip up most people ...
Prisoner
Hat he wears Number of red hats he sees ( Y ) Red hats saved for sure ( X ) He says 1 blue 5 odd ( Q ) N/ A blue 2 blue 5 odd 0 even blue 3 red 4 even 0 even red 4 blue 4 even 1 odd blue 5 blue 4 even 1 odd blue 6 red 3 odd 1 odd red 7 blue 3 odd 2 even blue 8 red 2 even 2 even red 9 red 1 odd 3 odd red 10 red 0 even 3 odd red
3. The Fake Coin
You have twelve coins .
You know that one is fake .
The only thing that distinguishes the fake coin from the real coins is that its weight is imperceptibly different .
You have a perfectly balanced scale .
The scale only tells you which side weighs more than the other side .
What is the smallest number of times you must use the scale in order to always find the fake coin ?
Use only the twelve coins themselves and no others , no other weights , no cutting coins , no pencil marks on the scale .
etc .
These are modern coins , so the fake coin is not necessarily lighter .
Presume the worst case scenario , and do n't hope that you will pick the right coin on the first attempt .
Guess | Show Hint Show Solution Guess : Hint :
The balance tells you which side is heavier and which side is lighter .
You can move coins around and get more information this way .
Solution : 3 . If you knew the fake coin was lighter , then the solution would have an easy explanation .
But you do not .
So .... Number the coins 1 through 12 .
1 . Weigh coins 1,2,3,4 against coins 5,6,7,8 .
1.1 .
If they balance , then weigh coins 9 and 10 against coins 11 and 8 ( we know from the first weighing that 8 is a good coin ) .
1.1.1 . If the second weighing also balances , we know coin 12 ( the only one not yet weighed ) is the counterfeit .
The third weighing indicates whether it is heavy or light .
1.1.2 . If ( at the second weighing ) coins 11 and 8 are heavier than coins 9 and 10 , either 11 is heavy or 9 is light or 10 is light .
Weigh 9 against 10 .
If they balance , 11 is heavy .
If they do n't balance , you know that either 9 or 10 is light , so the top coin is the fake .
1.1.3 If ( at the second weighing ) coins 11 and 8 are lighter than coins 9 and 10 , either 11 is light or 9 is heavy or 10 is heavy .
Weigh 9 against 10 .
If they balance , 11 is light .
If they do n't balance , you know that either 9 or 10 is heavy , so the bottom coin is the fake .
1.2 . Now if ( at first weighing ) the side with coins 5,6,7,8 are heavier than the side with coins 1,2,3,4 .
This means that either 1,2,3,4 is light or 5,6,7,8 is heavy .
Weigh 1,2 , and 5 against 3,6 , and 9 . 1.2.1 . If ( when we weigh 1,2 , and 5 against 3,6 and 9 ) they balance , it means that either 7 or 8 is heavy or 4 is light .
By weighing 7 and 8 we obtain the answer , because if they balance , then 4 has to be light .
If 7 and 8 do not balance , then the heavier coin is the counterfeit .
1.2.2 . If ( when we weigh 1,2 , and 5 against 3,6 and 9 ) the right side is heavier , then either 6 is heavy or 1 is light or 2 is light .
By weighing 1 against 2 the solution is obtained .
1.2.3 . If ( when we weigh 1,2 , and 5 against 3 , 6 and 9 ) the right side is lighter , then either 3 is light or 5 is heavy .
By weighing 3 against a good coin the solution is easily arrived at .
1.3 If ( at the first weighing ) coins 1,2,3,4 are heavier than coins 5,6,7,8 then repeat the previous steps 1.2 through 1.2.3 but switch the numbers of coins 1,2,3,4 with 5,6,7,8 .
4 . The Trainee Technician A 120 wire cable has been laid firmly underground between two telephone exchanges located 10 km apart .
Unfortunately after the cable was laid it was discovered to be the wrong type , the problem is the individual wires are not labeled .
There is no visual way of knowing which wire is which and thus connections at either end is not immediately possible .
You are a trainee technician and your boss has asked you to identify and label the wires at both ends without ripping it all up .
You have no transport and only a battery and light bulb to test continuity .
You do have tape and pen for labeling the wires .
What is the shortest distance in kilometers you will need to walk to correctly identify and label each wire ?
Guess | Show Hint Show Solution Guess : Hint : Creating a single loop will only help you identify all the wires by walking 40 km .
You need to group them in a rather odd matrix .
Solution : 20 .
At one end label a wire " A " .
Then join two wire and label them both " B ' , then tie three ( not already joined ) wires together and call them each " C " .... continue until all the wires are joined together in groups of 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , etc .... for a 120 strand cable .
NOTES that the largest group will have 15 wires .
Now walk to the other end .
Using a ( battery and light bulb ) it is now possible , for example , to find the wire that was n't joined to any of the others .
It is similarly possible to find which wires are in a pair , which is joined in a group of 3 , etc .
Each time a group is found the technician should label it with the letter for the group , so the single wire is labeled ' a ' , the pair are each labeled " A " , etc . ... this now matches the other end ..... the letters will go up to " O " .
Now take " A " , " B " , up to " O " and join them together in a group and label each one with " 15 " , so we have cable " A15 " , " B15 ' , " C15 " , up to " O15 " .
Take the second and last " B '" wire and
join it with a remaining " C " , " D " , up to " O " and label these each " 14 ' so we have " B14 " , " C14 " , up to " O14 " .
Repeat this until at the end there will be a single " O " cabled labeled " O1 " .
Now walk to the other end .
Now untie all the old connections and identify the group labeled " 1 " , " 2 " , " 3 " ... " 15 " at which point each wire at each end has a unique classification .
Alternative solution from citrog : First , tie the 120 wires together randomly in 60 pairs .
Next , go to the far end , randomly label any wire 1 , and connect the battery to it .
Test which other wire is tied to it at the starting end , and label that wire 2 .
Then pick another wire other than 1 or 2 , label it 3 , and tie it to 2 , so now the battery is connected to 1 , which is tied to 2 at the other end , which is tied to 3 at the end you 're at .
Now test which wire is tied to 3 at the other end , and label that 4 , etc .
What you will wind up with is all 120 wires tied to each other in a continuous sequence .
Then go back to the end you started at , leaving the battery behind , connected to wire 1 .
Before you untie all the wires at the starting point , label each wire so that you know which wire was paired with which .
Now with all the wires untied at the starting point , test which wire is connected to the battery , and label that 1 .
Whichever wire was in the same pair as 1 , label that 2 , and then tie 1 and 2 back together .
Now you can find 3 , because it 's tied to 2 on the far end .
Once you find 3 , label the wire it was tied to 4 , etc .
This assumes that the resistance of the wire is small enough that the battery will still light the bulb across 12,000 km of wire .
5 . The Card Trick I ask Alex to pick any 5 cards out of a deck with no Jokers .
He can inspect then shuffle the deck before picking any five cards .
He picks out 5 cards then hands them to me ( Peter ca n't see any of this ) .
I look at the cards and I pick 1 card out and give it back to Alex .
I then arrange the other four cards in a special way , and give those 4 cards all face down , and in a neat pile , to Peter .
Peter looks at the 4 cards i gave him , and says out loud which card Alex is holding ( suit and number ) .
How ?
The solution uses pure logic , not sleight of hand .
All Peter needs to know is the order of the cards and what is on their face , nothing more .
Show Hint Show Solution Hint :
There are only 4 suits , so there will be at least two cards of one suit , one higher and another lower .
By careful selection and placement the cards can be used to encode the exact number and suit of the selected card .
Solution : Pick out two cards of the same suit .
Select a card for Alex where adding a number no greater than six will result in the number of the other card of the same suit .
Adding one to the Ace would cycle to the beginning again and result in a Two .
E.g. if you have a King and a Six of Diamonds , hand the King to Alex .
The other three cards will be used to encode a number from 1 through 6 .
Devise a system with Peter to rank all cards uniquely from 1 to 52 ( e.g. the two of hearts is 1 , the two of diamonds is fourteen etc ... ) .
That will allow you to choose from six combinations , depending on where you put the lowest and highest cards .
6 . The Warden
The warden meets with 23 new prisoners when they arrive .
He tells them , " You may meet today and plan a strategy .
But after today , you will be in isolated cells and will have no communication with one another .
" In the prison is a switch room , which contains two light switches labeled 1 and 2 , each of which can be in either up or the down position .
I am not telling you their present positions .
The switches are not connected to anything .
" After today , from time to time whenever I feel so inclined , I will select one prisoner at random and escort him to the switch room .
This prisoner will select one of the two switches and reverse its position .
He must flip one switch when he visits the switch room , and may only flip one of the switches .
Then he 'll be led back to his cell .
" No one else will be allowed to alter the switches until I lead the next prisoner into the switch room .
I 'm going to choose prisoners at random .
I may choose the same guy three times in a row , or I may jump around and come back .
I will not touch the switches , if I wanted you dead you would already be dead .
" Given enough time , everyone will eventually visit the switch room the same number of times as everyone else .
At any time , anyone may declare to me , ' We have all visited the switch room . '
" If it is true , then you will all be set free .
If it is false , and somebody has not yet visited the switch room , you will all die horribly .
You will be carefully monitored , and any attempt to break any of these rules will result in instant death to all of you "
What is the strategy they come up with so that they can be free ?
Show Hint Show Solution Hint :
Take a long - term perspective .
Solve the puzzler for three prisoners .
Solution :
The team nominates a leader .
The group agrees upon the following rules :
The leader is the only person who will announce that everyone has visited the switch room .
All the prisoners ( except for the leader ) will flip the first switch up at their very first opportunity , and again on the second opportunity .
If the first switch is already up , or they have already flipped the first switch up two times , they will then flip the second switch .
Only the leader may flip the first switch down , if the first switch is already down , then the leader will flip the second switch .
The leader remembers how many times he has flipped the first switch down .
Once the leader has flipped the first switch down 44 times , he announces that all have visited the room .
It does not matter how many times a prisoner has visited the room , in which order the prisoners were sent or even if the first switch was initially up .
Once the leader has flipped the switch down 44 times then the leader knows everyone has visited the room .
If the switch was initially down , then all 22 prisoners will flip the switch up twice .
If the switch was initially up , then there will be one prisoner who only flips the switch up once and the rest will flip it up twice .
The prisoners can not be certain that all have visited the room after the leader flips the switch down 23 times , as the first 12 prisoners plus the leader might be taken to the room 24 times before anyone else is allowed into the room .
Because the initial state of the switch might be up , the prisoners must flip the first switch up twice .
If they decide to flip it up only once , the leader will not know if he should count to 22 or 23 .
In the example of three prisoners , the leader must flip the first switch down three times to be sure all prisoners have visited the room , twice for the two other prisoners and once more in case the switch was initially up .
7.a. Solomon Grundy
You randomly ask people if they have two children .
After a few people say no , you find Fred Grundy who says yes .
You ask Fred to pick one child randomly , and tell you their gender and the day they were born on .
Fred says his first child is a boy named Solomon Grundy who was born on a Monday .
What is the chance the other child is also a boy ?
Guess the probability as a number out of 108 e.g. 1/3rd is 36 out of 108 .
Guess | Show Hint Show Solution Guess : Hint :
This one is easy , it is what you think .
Solution :
The answer is 54 out of 108 , or one out of two or a 50 % probability .
Because you did n't know the gender or the day of either child before selecting your participant , the facts discovered after selecting your participant are irrelevant to the probabilities .
