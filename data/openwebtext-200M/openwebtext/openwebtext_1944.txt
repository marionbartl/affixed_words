Rugged American individualism could hinder our ability to understand other peoples ' point of view , a new study suggests .
And in contrast , the researchers found that Chinese are more skilled at understanding other people 's perspectives , possibly because they live in a more " collectivist " society .
" This cultural difference affects the way we communicate , " said study co-author and cognitive psychologist Boaz Keysar of the University of Chicago .
Simple study
The study , though oversimplified compared to real life , was instructive .
Keysar and his colleagues arranged two blocks on a table so participants could see both .
However , a piece of cardboard obstructed the view of one block so a " director , " sitting across from the participant , could only see one block .
When the director asked 20 American participants ( none of Asian descent ) to move a block , most were confused as to which block to move and did not take into account the director 's perspective .
Even though they could have deduced that , from the director 's seat , only one block was on the table .
Most of the 20 Chinese participants , however , were not confused by the hidden block and knew exactly which block the director was referring to .
While following directions was relatively simple for the Chinese , it took Americans twice as long to move a block .
" That strong , egocentric communication of Westerners was nonexistent when we looked at Chinese , " Keysar said .
" The Chinese were very much able to put themselves in the shoes of another when they were communicating . "
The results are detailed in the July issue of the journal Psychological Science .
Collectivist societies , such as the Chinese , place more value on the needs of the group and less on the autonomy of the individual .
In these societies , understanding other peoples ' experiences is a more critical social skill than it is among typically more individualist Americans .
Gross oversimplification
" Of course , these are very gross oversimplifications , " said Keysar .
" Even in America , you can find collectivist societies .
For example , working class people tend to be much more collective . "
Culture appears to direct our eyes to read others ' emotions , too .
Psychologists at Hokkaido University in Japan have found that Japanese gaze at the shape of a person 's eyes , while Americans focus on the mouth .
When people from the two cultures interact , these crisscrossed sightlines can lead to miscommunication .
" We all know people from different cultures are different .
This is not new .
But what research is now showing is how they 're different and what are the implications , " Keysar told LiveScience .
" If we are aware of how we think differently , this can go a long way toward not allowing these differences to get in the way of reaching mutual understanding . "
Rocketing into HIPerSpace :
New Visualization System at UC San Diego
August 21 , 2007
By Doug Ramsey
HIPerSpace OptIPortal at UC San Diego provides 220 million pixels of display space across 55 high - resolution tiled screens .
Engineers at the University of California , San Diego have constructed the highest - resolution computer display in the world – with a screen resolution up to 220 million pixels .
The system located at the UCSD division of the California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology ( Calit2 ) is also linked via optical fiber to Calit2 ’s building at UC Irvine , which boasts the previous record holder .
The combination – known as the Highly Interactive Parallelized Display Space ( HIPerSpace ) – can deliver real - time rendered graphics simultaneously across 420 million pixels to audiences in Irvine and San Diego .
“ We do n’t intend to stop there , ” said Falko Kuester , Calit2 professor for visualization and virtual reality and associate professor of structural engineering in UCSD ’s Jacobs School of Engineering .
“ HIPerSpace provides a unique environment for visual analytics and cyberinfrastructure research and we are now seeking funding to double the size of the system at UC San Diego alone to reach half a billion pixels with a one gigapixel distributed display in sight . ”
Kuester is the chief architect of the systems deployed in both Calit2 buildings .
Until last week , UC Irvine ’s Highly Interactive Parallelized Display Wall ( HIPerWall ) – built in 2005 with funding from the National Science Foundation ( NSF ) – held the record of 200 million pixels for a tiled display system .
It is located in the Calit2 Center of Graphics , Visualization and Imaging Technology ( GRAVITY ) , which Kuester directs .
When Kuester ’s group moved to UCSD in 2006 they began work on the next generation of massively tiled display walls , which now serve as a prototype for ultra-high resolution OptIPortal tiled displays developed by the NSF - funded OptIPuter project ( led by Calit2 director Larry Smarr ) .
The new HIPerSpace system between Irvine and San Diego is joined together via high - performance , dedicated optical networking that clocks in at up to two gigabits per second ( 2 Gbps ) .
The systems use the same type of graphics rendering technology , from industry partner NVIDIA .
The “ graphics super cluster ” being developed at UCSD consists of 80 NVIDIA Quadro FX 5600 graphics processing units ( GPUs ) .
“ The graphics and computational performance of these cards is quite astounding , ” said Kuester .
“ Putting the theoretical computational performance of the cluster at almost 40 teraflops .
To put that into context , the top-rated supercomputer in the world five years ago was operating at that same speed .
While these are purely theoretical numbers , the comparison clearly hints at capabilities of this new cluster that go far beyond generating impressive visual information . ”
The processing power will come in handy for the kinds of large - scale applications that are likely to make use of the HIPerSpace system .
Calit2 will make the displays available to teams of scientists or engineers dealing with very large data sets , from multiple gigabytes to terabytes , notably in the Earth sciences , climate prediction , biomedical engineering , genomics , and brain imaging .
“ The higher - resolution displays allow researchers to take in both the broad view of the data and the minutest details , all at the same time , ” said Kuester .
“ HIPerSpace also allows us to experiment on the two campuses with distributed teams that can collaborate and share insights derived from a better understanding of complex results .
This capability will allow researchers at two UC campuses to collaborate more intensively with each other , and eventually with other campuses , thanks to the rapid rollout of OptIPortals outside of California . ”
In San Diego , the OptIPortal is deployed on the second floor of Atkinson Hall , next to the offices of the NEES Cyberinfrastructure Center ( NEESit ) , which supports the NSF - funded George E. Brown , Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation ( NEES ) and its 15 sites around the country .
“ Structural engineering simulations require a massive amount of data processing and visualization , especially if you need to crunch data coming in from all of the NEES participating sites , ” said Kuester .
“ We are also using the system for a large - scale , global seismicity visualization using data collected over the past thirty years . ”
“ I am excited that UC Irvine ’s HIPerWall is now networked to its larger sibling , ” said Stephen Jenks , professor of electrical engineering and computer science at UC Irvine and a participant in Calit2 at UCI .
“ With the high - speed OptIPuter network between the two Calit2 buildings , we will be able to virtually join the display walls at a distance of nearly 100 miles , so they can work together to show different parts of a huge data set or each can replicate parts of the other .
We look forward to exploring remote collaboration technology and how the two systems can help researchers understand data better than ever before . ”
UCSD ’s HIPerSpace OptIPortal is similar to the HIPerWall because both are tiled display systems , but with different hardware .
Irvine ’s version is constructed with 50 Apple 30 - inch Cinema Displays , powered by 25 Power Mac G5s running the Mac OS X operating system .
UCSD ’s Linux - based OptIPortal consists of 55 Dell displays driven by 18 Dell XPS personal computers .
The system at UCSD uses the San Diego Supercomputer Center ’s new 64 - bit version of grid- computing middleware known as ROCKS released in early August and Calit2 ’s Cluster GL for heterogeneous systems ( CGLX ) framework , which is capable of supporting both systems concurrently .
" The usability of high - performance visualization clusters such as HiPerSpace is bound tightly to the accessibility of its resources , so cumbersome script configuration and specially - written software are no longer viable , ” said Calit2 postdoctoral researcher Kai - Uwe Doerr .
“ The visualization software developed here at Cailt2 was designed to provide an efficient and transparent mechanism to grant access to available graphics resources and make the transition of a desktop application to a cluster seamless and uncomplicated – with minimal or no changes to the original code . "
Doerr and Kuester are part of a large team making HIPerSpace a reality .
Others at UC San Diego include So Yamaoka ; Daniel Knoblauch ; Jason Kimball ; Kevin Ponto ; Tung - Ju Hsieh ; Andres Fernandez Munuera ; Tom DeFanti ; Greg Dawe ; Stephen Jenks ; and Duy - Quoc Lai , who will start graduate school at UC Irvine this fall .
Other UCI researchers on the HIPerWall end of the project include Harry Mangalam , Frank Wessel , Charlie Zender , Soroosh Sorooshian , Jean - Luc Gaudiot and Sung - Jin Kim .

My father used to stripe parking lots as a side business , and while still with us , he will nonetheless find a grave , hop in it , and roll over after learning that his beloved lines are now being taped over with advertisements .
Parking Stripe Advertising , a three years young agency from Colorado , is responsible for this scheme that covers those long yellow and white lines with a heavy - duty tape bearing promotional ads .
The advertisements themselves cost about $ 40 per stripe and are made using a heavy - duty tape that 's recyclable with adhesive that breaks down over time .
A current promotion advertising the return of ABC's Desperate Housewives is running concurrently in California and New York , and it appears to be a hit with the parking crowd , though store owners have reported a few complaints .
Otherwise , consumers and advertising analysts alike think the idea is brilliant for the way it captures one 's attention in a new and unique way .
[ Source : Daily News via Kickingtires.com
Being a second generation parking lot striper , I find the idea of parking stripe ads appalling and an insult to the art form .
Yeah , I said it .
Striping involves both muscle and a fair amount of brain power , as well as the ability to run after absent minded drivers swinging an orange cone and screaming " Watch the paint , @ $ $ # % ( ) !!! "
To cover up all that work with nothing more than fancy colored duct tape so I 'll watch Eva Longoria on Sunday nights , which I do anyway ... well , it 's just not right .

In marketing the most effective way to introduce new products is the free sample .
In 1978 Lever Brothers spent $ 15 million ( $ 47.55 million in today 's currency ) delivering a free sample of Signal Mouthwash to two - thirds of all US households .
The strategy was a success and the product remained on the market well into the 1990s .
The significance of the free sample is product trial ; it gets the product into consumers ' hands .
If consumers use the sample and like it , they may go on to buy the product and buy it again and again , that is , become repeat purchasers ; they may even spread the good word to others .
When repeat purchasing and favorable word of mouth kick in , the product 's sales will experience a shift from slow to rapid growth and management will consider the product a success .
Free sampling is the best method of introducing new products , but it is also the most expensive .
Not surprisingly , then , Forbes ASAP magazine [ 1 ] reports this alternative way to practice free sampling :
One security manager for a major manufacturer , who asked not to be identified , says she is sure some companies actually view being counterfeited as a boon to their efforts to build brand awareness .
After all , she says , if some companies give away merchandise to expand market share , what 's not to like about having someone else take on the expense of manufacturing and distributing the goods , as long as they 're high - quality copies ?
Imitation is a universal trait of human behavior , ranging from the use of phrases and mannerisms of admired others to the reuse of hummable themes in music , recognizable images in paintings and well - known plots in literature and Disney movies .
Imitation is a normal part of the competitive process in growth markets .
As the sales of an innovative new product takes off , competitors enter the market with their own , often cheaper , versions .
If the innovative product is patented , competitors make minor design or functional changes to secure their own patents .
Knock - offs are unauthorized , usually cheaper copies .
And , of course , the innovative marketer often produces its own cheap version , sometimes called a fighting brand , to fend off the competition .
Over time real prices in the product category decline and quality improves .
Knock - offs are pirated products .
Because they are usually cheaper than the original , knock - offs tend to appeal to a more price - conscious segment of the market ; that is , the buyers of pirated products are probably not legitimate prospects for the innovative new product , either because they cannot afford , or do not want to pay , the higher price .
Message to the innovative marketer ?
Either drop the price of the new product or produce a cheaper version — or be the first to exploit a new technology , something the movie and recording industries chose not to do .
[ 2 ]
Many , including these two industries , would rather sue than practice good marketing .
One study found that users of pirated software sufficiently influenced — by word - of - mouth communication — eighty percent of the software 's prospects to buy the legal product and another described several scenarios in which piracy can help increase the sales of legal products .
[ 3 ]
The pirated product functions as a free sample that the innovator does not have to fund .
So what about free copies ?
How do you compete with free , to state the battle cry of the new Luddites who fear digital technology ?
It 's done all the time .
One of the most dramatic recent instances of this was the strategy of science fiction writer Cory Doctorow who , over the course of three years , gave away 700,000 electronic copies of Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom .
Sales of the hard copy went through six printings and surpassed his publisher 's expectations .
Many of the downloaders , Doctorow said , did not buy the hard copy and probably would not have regardless , but the giveaway created considerable buzz and a significant minority did buy the hard copy .
Compare this to the experience of the Mises Institute with Omnipotent Government .
Free — no matter where it comes from — can help sell .

by
Ben Horowitz , CEO of Opsware , offers an interesting essay on why so many bigshot CEOs seem to be in legal trouble .
Why , he asks , would a rich and powerful executive risk going to prison ?
The easy answer , greed , is too simple because many of these guys were already tremendously rich and stood to gain little or nothing personally from the illegal acts .
There must have been something else driving them .
One answer is pride .
Exhibit A is WorldCom CEO Bernie Ebbers ( now doing 25 years for fraud and conspiracy ) .
As WorldCom grew at a rapid pace , Bernie set expectations high .
This led investors to give him advance credit , thus boosting his stock , which was the currency he used to build his company .
When Bernie saw that WorldCom was n’t going to meet those high expectations , and that thousands of shareholders to whom he had promised great performance would lose their money , and thousands of employees who he had hired would lose their jobs , he was willing to do anything to make things right .
Even if it meant doing things that were wrong .
Like a killer committing his second murder , the decisions to commit fraud must have come easier as Bernie gained experience .
In addition , the stakes continued to get higher .
He continued to commit fraud , because if he had n’t , there was a 100 % chance that he would let everyone down who mattered to him and he would no longer be the person that he had worked so hard to become .
He would n’t be Bernie Ebbers # 11 in Time Magazine ’s Cyber Elite ; he ’d be Bernie Ebbers , former milkman , bouncer , and disgraced CEO .
If this is right , Ebbers defined himself by the success of WorldCom .
If the company failed , then his work – his contribution to society – would evaporate .
Even beyond pride , some executives see themselves as great benefactors , bringing happiness to employees , wealth to investors , and great products at low low prices to customers .
If WorldCom ’s growth was good for humanity , then it was worth taking risks to defend .
And when the time came to take risks , the Great Man stepped forward .
While working on the Microsoft antitrust trial , I read Titan , Ron Chernow ’s biography of John D. Rockefeller .
Rockefeller saw most things clearly , but he had one blind spot : he honestly saw little distinction between the growth of Standard Oil and the advancement of humanity .
Cheap , high quality oil would transform American life , and Standard Oil would be the agent of that transformation .
America needed Standard Oil .
Rockefeller had an uncommonly strong drive to do good in the world , a drive that was channeled into an intense need to win every business skirmish .
His opponents , who were only trying to make money or run a business , were no match for a guy trying to save the world .
One gets the sense that WorldCom grew as big as it did , and the house of cards stood up for as long as it did , because Bernie Ebbers had a Rockefeller - like drive to make it so .
He would do almost anything to keep WorldCom afloat , which is what made him dangerous to his employees and investors .
He was a danger , too , to his competitors .
Once WorldCom started committing accounting fraud to prop up their numbers , all of the other telecoms had to either ( a ) commit accounting fraud to keep pace with WorldCom ’s blistering growth rate , or ( b ) be viewed as losers with severe consequences .
How severe were the consequences for not breaking the law ?
Well , like a baseball player who refuses to take steroids , CEO Mike Armstrong of AT&T did not keep pace with the cheaters .
As a reward for his honesty and integrity , he was widely ridiculed in the press prior to being fired and AT&T , perhaps America ’s most valuable brand , was acquired for cheap .
Now you see why Barry Bonds needed something to help him keep pace with Mark McGwire .
The steroids analogy helps explain why corporate criminals must face serious punishment .
It ’s not enough for the average performer to know that the leaders probably are n’t cheating .
Given the choice between believing that the other guy is cheating , and believing that he is honestly outperforming you , most people will go for the cheating theory .
People need to know that nobody in their right mind would cheat – a lesson that Bernie Ebbers will be teaching us for the next twenty years or so .
' Pakistan is the most dangerous country in the world '
October 22 , 2007 08:41 IST
Related Articles  How Osama has survived for six years
Pakistan , which recently witnessed a series of suicide attacks by pro-Taliban and al Qaeda militants , is the most dangerous country in the world and has become a safe haven for terrorists , says a recent media report .
" Unlike countries such as Afghanistan and Iraq , Pakistan has everything al - Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden could ask for : political instability , a trusted network of radical Islamists , an abundance of angry anti-Western recruits , secluded training areas and security services that do n't always do what they 're supposed to do , " says Newsweek in an investigative report in its upcoming issue .
Then there 's the country 's large and growing nuclear programme , it adds ominously .
The conventional story about Pakistan , the report says , has been that it is an unstable nuclear power , with distant tribal areas in terrorist hands .
" What is new , and more frightening , is the extent to which Taliban and al - Qaeda elements have now turned much of the country , including some cities , into a base that gives militants more room to maneuver , both in Pakistan and beyond , " it adds .
Taliban militants , the magazine reports , now " pretty much come and go as they please inside Pakistan .
Their sick and injured get patched up in private hospitals there . "
" Until I return to fight , I 'll feel safe and relaxed here , " Abdul Majadd , a Taliban commander who was badly wounded this summer during a fire fight against British troops in Afghanistan , told Newsweek after he was evacuated to Karachi for emergency care .
Guns and supplies are readily available , and in winter , when the fighting dies down in Afghanistan , thousands retire to the country 's thriving madrassas to study the Koran , it says .
" Some of the brainier operatives attend courses in computer technology , video production and even English , " the Newsweek says .
The magazine emphasises that far from keeping a low profile , the visiting militants attend services at local mosques , where after prayers they speak to the congregation , soliciting donations to support the war against the West .
The contrast to 2002 is striking , the report points out .
" Back then , in the first flush of President Pervez Musharraf 's [ Images ] crackdown on extremists , a Newsweek reporter met Agha Jan , a former senior Taliban Defence Ministry official , in an orchard outside Quetta .
A nervous Jan recounted how he had to change homes every two nights for fear of capture , and he fled when some local villagers approached .
Jan now has a house outside Quetta , where he lives when he is not fighting with Taliban forces across the border in his native Zabul province , " says the report
Reporters in Peshawar , a strategic Pakistani border city , say it 's not unusual these days to receive phone calls from visiting Taliban commanders offering interviews , or asking where to find a cheap hotel , a good restaurant or a new cell phone .
Armed militants , the Newsweek says , have also effectively seized control in places like the picturesque Swat Valley , where a militant leader named Mullah Fazlullah commands hundreds of men under the noses of a nearby Pakistani Army division that seldom leaves its barracks .
Peshawar is perhaps the most important production and distribution center for Taliban and other Islamist material , Newsweek adds .
" The ones who plan the operations , are not necessarily in the boonies or in the sticks , they 're in cities like Quetta .
Can President Pervez Musharraf pick them up ?
Easily , " asks Samina Ahmed , the South Asia director of the International Crisis Group in Islamabad .
Bruce Riedel , the former senior director for South Asia on the American National Security Council , points out that Pakistan 's large and growing nuclear programme is another cause for concern .
" If you were to look around the world for where al Qaeda is going to find its bomb , it is right in their backyard , " he told Newsweek .
Despite the US government 's assertion that Musharraf 's government has tight control over its nuclear - weapons programme , radicals will not need to steal a whole bomb in order to create havoc .
Pervez Hoodbhoy , a noted nuclear physicist at Quaid - I - Azam University in Islamabad , told the news magazine that outside experts do n't really know how much highly enriched uranium Pakistan has produced in the past and how much remains in existing stocks .
" No one has a real idea about that , " he says .
" That means that stuff could have gotten out .
Little bits here or there .
But we really do n't know . "
From the start , Ms. Long said ; “ There was no question in my mind .
I was going to have a mastectomy on both sides .
I wanted to maximize my survivability , and I did n’t want to ever think that I had n’t done everything that I possibly could to prevent this from coming back . ”

The study ’s lead author , Dr. Todd M. Tuttle , chief of surgical oncology at the University of Minnesota Medical School , started the study because so many patients were requesting the procedure .
Still , Dr. Tuttle said , he was surprised by the increase in contralateral prophylactic mastectomies , an upward trend that shows no sign of leveling off and is occurring even as the practice of breast - conserving surgery expands .
“ The comment patients make is , ‘ I just want to be done with it , ’ ” he said .
“ They never want to have another mammogram again ; they never want to have another biopsy again . ”
He and other experts emphasized that though the removal of the healthy breast sharply reduced the risk of a new cancer developing in that breast — the risk is not zero because some tissue can remain — it was the cancer that had already been diagnosed that posed the greatest threat to a patient ’s life .
“ For the vast majority of our patients , this does not impact the chances of dying of breast cancer , and that ’s the key thing here , ” said Dr. Julie R. Gralow , the chairwoman of the communications committee of the American Society of Clinical Oncology and an associate professor of medical oncology at the University of Washington and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle .

As a certified teacher myself , I can't tell you how angry NCLB makes me .
High performance on standardized tests are an indication of the wealth and whiteness of a school district , and are NO indication of student learning .
And the states continue to push the lie : certain Fairbanks , Alaska teachers were given $ 2500.00 bonuses by the state not for teaching , but for increasing standardized test scores at their school .
They refused the bonuses and donated the money to other schools or to non-profits .
When Microsoft made what appeared to be a minor announcement last week that it would expand its Canadian operations with the creation of the Microsoft Canada Development Centre for software development based in the greater Vancouver , British Columbia area , it went mostly unnoticed in the U.S .
What no one in the lower 48 states realized at the time was how significant this move north might be and how the Canadian immigration policy makes it all possible .
Nevertheless , Canadian Katarina Onuschak , a licensed immigration consultant and owner of T&CS Canada , a consultancy for Canadian immigration , says she immediately recognized the significance of the centre when she read the news .
“ It will be a beginning of new era , ” said Onuschak .
There are two pieces to the puzzle that , when brought together , may indeed represent a new era for Canada ’s high tech industry and for U.S. companies who prefer near - shoring as opposed to offshoring .
Canada ’s far more liberal immigration policy for temporary high tech workers combined with Microsoft ’s stated intentions of opening the software development center to house developers “ from around the world ” makes it clear why Onuschak responded as she did .
This makes it possible for Microsoft and others to have their cake and eat it too .
Near - shoring gives companies better time zone management and allows companies to hire programmers based on whatever parameters they choose , which may be skills or pay scale , while not having to face the limitations of green card and H - 1B regulations .
Of course , it will also kick start a mostly slow - growing software development industry in Canada .
As the Microsoft announcement plainly stated , “ The Vancouver area is a global gateway with a diverse population , is close to Microsoft ’s corporate offices in Redmond , and allows the company to recruit and retain highly skilled people affected by immigration issues in the U.S. ”
Many companies may follow Microsoft ’s lead say the experts .
The liberal Canadian policy comes from a project targeted specifically at information technology workers , who are considered a special category by Canada ’s immigration agency .
The special category created by the Canadian government for information technology workers and the six categories under which workers must qualify was actually created back in 1997 as a pilot project to make sure Canada had enough programmers to deal with Y2K .
As interpreted by the National Labour Market , any software developers falling into the six major developer categories do not have to go to Service Canada to apply for a work permit .
Workers can go straight to a Canadian visa office to apply .
This speeds up the visa process .
The ruling states that “ under this process , no confirmation letter from Human Resources and Skills Development Canada ( HRSDC ) is necessary for specific jobs for which finding a foreign worker will not have a negative impact on Canadian or permanent - resident job seekers and workers . ”
The six categories of software developers include the following :
Senior Animation Effects Editor , Embedded Systems Software Designer , MIS Software Designer , Multimedia Software Developer , Software Developer — Services , Software Products Developer , and Telecommunications Software Designer .
The policy from Citizenship and Immigration Canada goes on to state , “ This means that if you are coming to Canada to work in one of the jobs listed … you do not need a letter from HRSDC , and your work permit application may be processed more quickly . ”
“ There is little doubt that the Microsoft Development Centre will be home to software developers from around the world , ” as Microsoft says in its press release .
Even critics who believe current U.S. immigration policy for high tech workers is too liberal agree on what this Centre will represent .
“ Make no mistake about it .
That programming group Microsoft will set up in Vancouver wo n’t be staffed with many Canadians … you ’ll find that the programmers in that group will be mainly people on work visas , not Canadian citizens or permanent residents , ” said Norm Matloff , a professor of computer science at University of California at Davis .
In the meantime , immigration lawyers on both sides of the border say that the leveraging of liberal Canadian immigration law by Microsoft has the potential to jump start a major move north for software development .
Greg Siskind , a partner at Siskind Susser Bland and an immigration attorney in the States says that he ’s been warning lots of people who agree with CNN ’s Lou Dobbs when he rails against outsourcing at the same time that he complains about the H - 1B visa program that they can’t have it both ways .
“ I would say I am surprised it is taking this long .
Companies have few choices .
They can either make do without or move operations or steal workers from other companies , ” said Siskind .
Sergio Karas , an immigration attorney based in Canada , also believes Microsoft ’s move to Canada is in reaction to U.S. immigration policy .
“ This move by Microsoft is H - 1B driven .
There is no cap in Canada .
Depending on the country of origin , we usually prepare an application , and in three weeks , a person can be working here , ” said Karas .
However , Karas believes the pilot program needs updating to better reflect current needs for software development —
Karas wants to see revisions in the six original software development categories — as well as revisions in pay scales .
“ The pay scales required have not been revised for some time . ”
Even at lower pay rates , however , Microsoft and others may very well be able to attract skilled workers to software development centers like Microsoft’s .
The fact is the U.S. and Canada are still both highly prized working environments whose standard of living and pay scales , even when low by national standards , are typically higher than what a worker can earn in his home country .
Karas says it is still too early to tell if the Microsoft move will create a wave of similar centers .
Siskind says he is surprised it took so long to happen .
And Onuschak says , “ If that ’s Bill Gates intention , it would be great if it happens . ”

Australian authorities have announced that they have arrested a man believed to be responsible for leaking The Simpsons Movie to the ' Net .
A Sydney - area man is alleged to have used a mobile phone to record the film in a theater on the day of its release , which he then uploaded hours later , beating the street date for the movie throughout much of the world .
The low - quality copy , which hit the wires a few hours before the movie 's official release in the United States , was widely reported in the media as a threat to the much - anticipated Simpsons release .
Despite the gloom and doom , the movie 's opening weekend smashed expectations , much to the chagrin of elements in the industry who would have liked to point to a poor debut as a sign of the evil effects of piracy .
There were fears that the Simpsons were played out , but the movie did far better than expected .
Quick , but not quick enough
The raid was the result of joint teamwork between the Australian Federal Police ( AFP ) , the Australian Federation Against Copyright Theft ( AFACT ) and Twentieth Century Fox ( Fox ) .
The three had also worked together to track the source of the film leak back in July , but found that by the time they could do anything about it , it was too late .
" Within 72 hours of making and uploading this unauthorized recording , AFACT had tracked it to other streaming sites and P2P systems where it had been illegally downloaded in excess of 110,000 times and in all probability , copied and sold as a pirate DVD all over the world , " said Adrianne Pecotic , the executive director of AFACT , in a statement .
As it turns out , AFACT got a heads - up from Fox , which was monitoring P2P networks in search of the first Simpsons movie uploads .
Yet even with this monitoring , it was too late to stop the leaks .
AFACT said that in the short time it took to identify the leak , it had rapidly spread to other sites , and investigators even learned that it was rapidly re-edited into a French language version and also transcoded into other formats and distributed via BitTorrent sites by two " organized release groups which facilitate file - sharing . "
Hence , the " speedy removal " of the movie " within 72 hours of it being posted on the internet " was no removal at all , for the movie spread too fast .
Once the cat 's out of the bag , there 's no putting it back in .
Once copied , it cannot be " removed " from the Internet .
The identity of the man accused of recording and uploading the film has not been released , but he is expected to appear in court in early October .
There is no word on how AFACT tracked the upload to the man in question , but given that the group believes it has found the source web site , it was likely a simple IP address - based identification .

One of the most interesting questions in the online world is who is LonelyGirl15 ?
We think we know who she is .
Late last week it was revealed that LonelyGirl15 , aka " Bree " was not a real 16 year old videoblogger , and her appearances on YouTube were scripted and produced by a professional team .
The creators of LonelyGirl15 published a letter " To Our Incredible Fans . "
In it they say :
We are amazed by the overwhelmingly positive response to our videos ; it has exceeded our wildest expectations .
With your help we believe we are witnessing the birth of a new art form .
It goes on to say :
Right now , the biggest mystery of Lonelygirl15 is “ who is she ? ”
We think this is an oversimplification .
Lonelygirl15 is a reflection of everyone .
She is no more real or fictitious than the portions of our personalities that we choose to show ( or hide ) when we interact with the people around us .
While we know she is a fake , who the actress is has stayed a secret .
However , after some online searching and thanks to Google 's cache of online sites , Silicon Valley Watcher believes it has found the identity of the actress that played " Bree . "
She is Jessica Rose , a 19 - year old actress from Mount Maunganui , New Zealand .
She recently moved to Los Angeles / Hollywood area to find work .
You be the judge :
Here is LonelyGirl15 from her vidblogs :
Here are a few images of Jessica Rose :

FLORENCE , Ariz . --
In May 2002 , Las Vegas resident Adam Gregory went on a business trip to Phoenix .
He stayed at the Ritz - Carlton and charged the $ 1,082 bill to his American Express card -- or so financial records show .
In fact , Mr. Gregory did n't live in Las Vegas , never held a job and was n't even a real person .
Rather , Mr. Gregory was a ...
The T programming language is a dialect of Scheme developed during the 1980 ’s at Yale university .
In it ’s manual , it says :
T is a dialect of Lisp derived from Scheme .
It is comparable in power and expressivness to other recent Lisp dialects such as Lisp Machine Lisp , Common Lisp , and NIL , but fundamentally more similar in spirit to Scheme than these other Lisp dialects .
T is an attempt to create a powerful and expressive language which is portable , efficient , and suitable for a broad variety of applications , including symbolic , numerical , and systems programming .
T draws from many sources in its attempt to provide a complete yet simple and unified system .
For the most part , the language ’s designers are collators , not originators .
Common Lisp , NIL , and Scheme have been the strongest influences .
The manual contains a lot of interesting stuff , the one I found most interesting however is T’s object - system .
This object system is so easy ( one could say trivial ) , but still so powerful and flexible that you just need to admire it .
Basically , there are two procedures to implement the T object - system , OBJECT and OPERATION .
OBJECT takes two parameters , a value proc that gets called if the object itself gets called ( I leave that out in the Ruby version , since it only makes sense with Lisp - 1s and rarely has an use anyway ) , and a list of handlers , each element consisting of an symbol and an lambda .
OBJECT returns a new object that responds to the handlers given .
In my Ruby re-implementation , we would write :
# An object responding to `op ' obj = TObject.new ( : op => lambda { |s| 34 } ) obj.op # => 34
The first parameter of the lambda is used to pass self , but you can pass several arguments , of course :
# An object responding to `op ' obj2 = TObject.new ( : op => lambda { |s , x| x } ) ob j2.op ( 55 ) # => 55
As you can see , we already have polymorphism .
So far , this is not very spectacular , though .
The really interesting things about the T object - system are operations and joins .
T operations are like methods of Object in Ruby .
They are used as a default everywhere except you did override them ( In my Ruby reimplementation , operations are only defined for TObject s , not for every datatype as in T ) :
# An operation to do `op ' TObject.operation ( : op ) { |s| : zebu #
By default , return :zebu } TObject.new ( : op => lambda { |s| : quagga } ) .op # => : quagga TObject.new ( {} ) .op # => : zebu
So far , the object - system is rather boring , there is no real instantiation , no mixins , no singleton classes , all the cool stuff from Ruby is lacking . :-)
Enter JOIN , it takes an unlimited number of objects and combines their behavior :
foo = TObject.new ( : foo => lambda { |s| : foo } ) bar = TObject.new ( : bar => lambda { |s| : bar } ) joined = TObject.join ( foo , bar ) joined .foo # => : foo joined .bar # => : bar
Now , I ca n’t think of anything ( except method_missing , which easily could be handled as a special - case ) that ’s possible in Ruby ’s object - system , but not T’s .
( You may argue that the T object - system lacks instance variables , but those can easily be replaced with accessable closures , which both T and Ruby have . )
Another nice thing about the T object - system is that it ’s soo easy to implement ( 20 lines of Ruby ) , that you could quickly write it in low - level lanuages as C as a foundation for a future programming language .
By the way , here is the T object - system in Ruby :
class TObject attr_reader : handlers @@operations = {} def self.operation ( name , &block ) @@operations [ name ] = block end def self.join( * args ) TObject.new(args.inject ( {} ) { |a , e| a.merge e.handlers }) end def initialize ( handlers ) @handlers = handlers end def method_missing ( name , * args ) ( @handlers [ name ] or @@operations [ name ] ) .
call self , * args end end
Ahh , another beautiful photograph captured by the Hubble Space Telescope .
This time we ’re looking at two big , beautiful spiral galaxies … tearing each other apart .
The large , face - on spiral is NGC 3808 , while its dueling partner is the smaller , edge - on NGC 3808A .
And between the two is a long today tail of stars , gas and dust , transferring from one to the other .
The two galaxies are collectively known as Arp 87 ; just one of the hundreds of interacting galaxies seen by astronomers .
It was cataloged by the famous Halton Arp in the 1960 ’s , who maintained his Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies .
And this collision is plenty peculiar , thanks to Hubble ’s optics and resolution of fine details .
A stream of gas , stars and dust is flowing from NGC 3808 to its companion , enveloping it in a starry embrace .
Because the NGC 3808A is seen nearly edge - on , you can make out the twisting trail of stars wrapping around it .
Both galaxies have been distorted by their gravitational interaction .
When galaxies interact , stars are born .
And this is the case for Arp 87 .
The colour of the stars and the intensity of heated interstellar dust show that both galaxies are undergoing furious rates of star formation .

I ’ve never been “ cool ” or “ popular . ”
In certain situations with certain people , I can fake it for short periods of time , but the truth always comes out soon enough .
Thankfully , I managed to get over this complex at the relatively young age of 16 and I ’ve been benefiting from it ever since .
In addition to all of the psychological benefits that come with not pretending to be someone you are n’t or trying to meet others ’ expectations all the time , I ’ve also found that being uncool can save you a whole lot of money .
As an uncool person , here are a few of the many things you wo n’t have to spend your money on .
A fancy car , or anything nicer than a functional junk bucket
Other people may laugh at my car behind my back , but I ’m laughing all the way to the bank .
My car does exactly what a car needs to do : it gets me to where I need to go .
While it may not look pretty , it ’s dependable and gets good gas mileage .
Not only did I save on the purchase price , I also save on insurance year after year .
The latest cell phone
I must look like a total loser to everyone in the “ cool ” crowd that has the iPhone , but my cell phone works just fine , I did n’t have to pay hundreds of dollars for it , and I ’m not hooked into any long term service contract .
If my cell phone ever quits working , I ’ll get a new ( to me ) one on eBay for pennies on the dollar .
I may not be cool since I do n’t have the latest and greatest toy that ’s full of fun but unnecessary gadgets that I ’ve successfully lived without for years ( how many people use their phone ’s built - in camera regularly ? ) , but I do have a growing retirement account .
Anything at full price
While a lot of people are too cool to be buying things from the sale rack , eBay , Craigslist , garage sales , or thrift stores , this has never been a problem for me .
Just because an item is on sale or has been used before does n’t mean there is anything wrong with it , at least for those of us that are uncool .
Thrift stores , even places like Goodwill and Salvation Army , are generally fairly picky about the quality of merchandise they ’ll actually put on the sales floor ( try donating a slightly broken desk to them and you ’ll see what I mean ) .
Most of their merchandise comes from nice upper and middle class homes and has been well cared for , but the original owner has simply gotten tired of their item , upgraded to something nicer , or had to get rid of non-essentials when they moved .
An overpriced luxury apartment or an expensive home in a prestigious zip code
I once lived in the “ cool ” expensive area of town , but after a year of paying overpriced rent , I decided to move to an average neighborhood where I get more bang for my buck .
By doing so , I save lots of money , which I will one day be able to use for a down payment on a home .
With every overpriced rent check you hand over , you ’re putting yourself further and further away from owning a nice home instead of owning just a mediocre one or having to keep renting .
If you ’ve bought a home in a hip area , appreciation may make your home a great investment over the years , but that high mortgage payment may also be standing in the way of your other goals , like socking away plenty of money in your 401k or simply living comfortably instead of living paycheck to paycheck and praying you do n’t get laid off .
Bottled water
While the “ cool ” people walk around with with their $ 1 + bottles of water , I know most of it is just purified tap water .
Plain old tap water is fine for me in restaurants , and at home l use a water filter .
I save a ton of money over buying bottled water , and it ’s much better for the environment than manufacturing and throwing away ( or even recycling ) all those bottles .
There ’s no point in bragging about owning a hybrid car if you ’re still drinking bottled water .
That being said , I do like to have a couple of water bottles on hand that I re-use over and over again .
Taking my own water to sporting events and carrying an empty bottle with me through airport security saves me lots of money on the other side of the gates .
Vacation homes
Vacation homes come with great bragging rights for those who are “ cool , ” but they ’re not a good use of your money if they ’re sitting empty when you ’re not there .
I stay with the uncool , less expensive option of renting my vacation lodging .
Owning a vacation home is n’t necessarily a bad use of your money , however , if you make lots of rental income off of it while you are n’t using it , but it would also be uncool letting strangers who are too poor to buy their own vacation homes live in your house …eew !
Name brand clothes , shoes , and accessories
When I walk down the street , it ’s rarely in brand name clothing that would make the “ cool ” people turn their heads in admiration .
There are times when a name brand gets you a higher quality product , and in these cases I will certainly buy brand names .
However , I do n’t buy them just to impress other people .
Why spend $ 300 to carry around free , unlimited advertising for Louis Vuitton ?
Fashionably up - to - date clothes , shoes , and accessories
While the “ cool ” people are making sure their clothing color matches the latest trends , I have no idea if my pants are in style this season or not .
All I know is that they fit well , and I got them for 75 % off on eBay .
While I do n’t wear the latest styles or the hottest brands , my clothes cost a lot less initially and I ’m able to wear them for longer .
Name brand groceries
Yes , I know I may look uncool purchasing the store brand instead of the ones advertised on TV , but I ’m not really attached to the slight difference in the flavor of Oreos over store - brand chocolate sandwich cookies .
I save a bundle while still getting perfectly good food by avoiding the brand hype .
Many times , even if I have a coupon ( being uncool again ) to purchase a national brand , the regular price of the store brand will still be a
better deal .
Expensive cosmetics
When you look into my purse , you are n’t going to see the “ cool ” expensive brands .
The same companies often make both an expensive and an inexpensive line of cosmetics , with virtually no difference in quality between the two , so I buy my makeup at the drugstore .
For cosmetics that are best tested before I buy ( like lipstick ) , I go for the less expensive lines at Sephora or hit the Clinique counter because they ’re the least expensive of the department store brands .
Also , I take advantage of the companies that will give or sell you samples ( like Mary Kay or Paula ’s Choice ) .
Frequent haircuts and / or stylish hairstyles
I ’m not advocating that getting one of those $ 15 haircuts is the way to save money – that ’s a good way to get a hack job done on your hair and have to spend more money to get it fixed than you would have had to spend to
get it done right the first time .
“ Cool ” women know from hairdressers and magazines that they need to get their hair cut every six to eight weeks .
Maybe that ’s true if you want to have perfect - looking hair all the time , but I find that I can stretch out the time between haircuts a lot by being a bit uncool and simply wearing my hair up or curling the ends under when my hair is getting scraggly .
I also avoid the “ cool ” highlights , salon dye jobs , and complicated haircuts that require lots of styling products to save even more money .
Besides , most people look better with their natural hair color , and if you really must dye it , the chemicals in the drugstore dyes are exactly the same ones that go onto your hair at the salon , so you might as well do it yourself for $ 10 .
Dry cleaning
Sure , I know that “ cool ” people do n’t do their own laundry or ironing , but at several dollars per garment , I ’d rather remain uncool since dry cleaning is an incredible waste of money .
I shop carefully to avoid buying dry clean only clothing , and I do n’t let myself be too busy or important to do my own laundry .
If I ever got super - busy , hiring someone to do my laundry for me in my home once every two weeks would probably be cheaper and faster than dropping off , picking up , and spending all that money on dry cleaning .
Constant home upgrades
When I buy a house , I know I wo n’t be keeping up with the “ cool ” people because my home wo n’t get a brand - new kitchen or a fountain in the front yard .
I spend a lot of time in an upscale residential neighborhood , and I ’m stunned by how much construction goes on there .
By choosing a home in an uncool neighborhood where competing with your neighbors is not the norm , I plan to save a lot of money and avoid all that construction noise .
Going out
While all the “ cool ” people are dining at the latest trendy restaurant , bar , or club , I save a ton of money by being uncool and eating at my favorite local Thai hole - in - the - wall .
This allows me to enjoy the pleasures of eating out while spending far less money .
To maximize my uncoolness , I always take my leftovers with me in a doggie bag .
Alcoholic drinks
I know I do n’t meet the definition of “ cool ” since I ’m willing to fulfill my craving for a drink at home instead of blowing $ 10 a pop on bar drinks at the trendy clubs .
My well - stocked home bar was purchased for the cost of several bar drinks , and it will last a lot longer .
The truth is that most financially successful people are very modest in their spending habits and do n’t flaunt their wealth , according to Thomas J. Stanley ’s excellent book ( and audiobook ) , The Millionaire Mind .
Their money is largely socked away , providing them with security and peace of mind , instead of being spent on showy things that will make them look cool to other people .
If you make your purchasing decisions based on what really fulfills your needs and wants instead of based on what you ’re told to purchase because it will make you cooler , you ’ll not only save money , but get more personal satisfaction per dollar spent .
Arkansas GOP head :
We need more ' attacks on American soil ' so people appreciate Bush Josh Catone

In his first interview as the chairman of the Arkansas Republican Party , Dennis Milligan told a reporter that America needs to be attacked by terrorists so that people will appreciate the work that President Bush has done to protect the country .
" At the end of the day , I believe fully the president is doing the right thing , and I think all we need is some attacks on American soil like we had on [ Sept. 11 , 2001 ] , " Milligan said to the Arkansas Democrat - Gazette , " and the naysayers will come around very quickly to appreciate not only the commitment for President Bush , but the sacrifice that has been made by men and women to protect this country . "
Milligan , who was elected as the new chair of the Arkansas Republican Party just two weeks ago , also told the newspaper that he is " 150 percent " behind Bush in the war in Iraq .
In his acceptance speech on May 19th , Milligan told his fellow Republicans that it was " time for a rediscovery of our values and our common sense . "
The owner of a water treatment company , Milligan was a relative unknown in Arkansas politics until being elected the party chairman .
He had previously served as the party 's treasurer and the Saline County Republican chair .

The Vietnam War -era slogan “ Make love , not war ” has been taken to its logical extreme by an Israeli pornographic website , which is engaged in a sort of cultural exchange of bodily fluids with the Arab world .
According to a recent report in Daily Variety , when executives at Ratuv installed software that could track where their users were logging in , they found that the site was getting thousands of hits a week from such countries as Syria , Saudi Arabia , Iran and Iraq , even though some of these governments block the " .il ” domain address on Israeli websites .
So Ratuv responded by translating the entire site into Arabic , and traffic quickly skyrocketed .
What makes this more than a tale of clever entrepreneurs making a buck off Middle Eastern sexual repression is that Ratuv is n’t an ordinary porn site .
It ’s a clearinghouse of political parody porn , making fun of Israeli affairs such as sex scandals and often featuring Mossad agents or army soldiers getting out of uniform , thus providing a view of the Israeli military seldom seen in the Arab world .
The next step , says Ratuv ’s manager , is to make movies with Israelis and Arabs performing together , in order to foster more intimate relations between the two peoples .
This may not be as wacky as it sounds .
Author Salman Rushdie , in his 2004 essay “ The East is Blue , ” pointed out that even though pornography is ruthlessly suppressed in many Muslim countries , it is still ubiquitous .
What ’s more , it can have political ramifications .
“ Pornography exists everywhere , of course , but when it comes into societies in which it ’s difficult for young men and women to get together and do what young men and women often like doing , it satisfies a more general need ; and , while doing so , it sometimes becomes a kind of standard - bearer for freedom , even for civilization , ” Rushdie wrote .
Expecting Arab men to be swayed by Ratuv ’s political content might be a little like expecting American men to read the articles in Playboy , but the site ca n’t be any less effective in changing public opinion than U.S. media efforts to date .
After pouring millions into the Al Iraqiya TV station to create an unbiased news outlet in Iraq , the U.S. handed the channel to the Iraqi government , and it soon became a Shiite propaganda arm for blasting Sunnis and coalition forces .
Our Arabic - language satellite TV network , Al Hurra , is thought to attract only a fraction of the viewers of Al Jazeera .
A U.S. porn invasion might not do as much to change hearts and minds in the Middle East as , say , toning down President Bush ’s bullying rhetoric toward the region or putting more pressure on Israelis and Palestinians to settle their differences .
But it ’s a lot more likely to happen .

A giant panda gave birth to a cub in an Austrian zoo , Europe 's first such event in 25 years , officials said .
The cub was born in Vienna 's Tiergarten Schoenbrunn zoo , 127 days after mother Yang Yang mated with male Long Hui , both on extended loan to Austria from China .
Caretakers spied the tiny cub , weighing just 100 grams and measuring 10 cm , on a surveillance camera after hearing tiny whimpering sounds in Yang Yang 's den .
Scroll down for more ...
" The panda was born without artificial insemination and that is extremely rare .
We 're incredibly happy , " zoo director Dagmar Schratter told a crowded news conference .
" In the next hours we 'll keep our fingers crossed that the cub is healthy .
But the first hurdle has been overcome -- the mother has accepted her baby , " she said .
Scroll down for more ...
Giant pandas , one of the world 's rarest and most endangered species , live in the wild only in China and are notoriously loathe to breed in captivity .
Females typically ovulate just once a year for a few days .
Schratter said around 40 percent of baby pandas did not live beyond a year .
The last panda born in a zoo in Europe was in 1982 in Madrid , she said .
The zoo released a photograph showing Yang Yang holding the hairless cub gently in her mouth .
The cub 's sex can only be determined after three months .
Yang Yang and Long Hui were loaned to Austria in 2003 and are expected to remain there for about 10 years .
An estimated 1,600 wild giant pandas live in nature reserves in China 's Sichuan , Gansu and Shaanxi provinces .
When I was younger , I wanted one day to have a Bat Cave just like Bruce Wayne .
Then , Batman Begins came out a few years ago and I wanted a cave to call my own all over again .
There are some obvious problems with finding such a perfect geological feature to compliment any home — so I ’ve lately downgraded my dreams to building the perfect eco hideout instead ; the type of place I can wander through backyard woods or across a field in the middle of nowhere to get to .
The type of place where you can hunker down for a few weeks at a time and not worry about looking like Tom Hanks halfway through Castaway .
Modern , earth - friendly , and cozy — with all the high - tech renewable energy systems and gizmos I can cram into it .
Think Thoreau ’s cabin at Walden Pond but with an Xbox360 , skylights , and solar panels .
Below are four “ Eco Spaces ” that are unique and perfectly designed to give you the privacy you need without losing any of the comforts .
Some are easier — and less expensive — than others , but the end results for all are striking .
Choice One : The EcoHab
Quite possible the ugliest of the our choices here , the EcoHab makes up for looks with beautiful internal lighting , creative use of space , and nice features like underfloor heating , shower , rainwater collection , toilet , and efficient washer / dryer .
Besides having kids believe you live inside a spaceship , you can also wow ( or bore ) them with your Hab ’s eco characteristics .
The home is composted of cement mixed with fly ash which is then covered with thick polyurethane for superior insulation .
Additionally , the outside can be covered in tiles made from from recycled tires .
Solar and all the other fixings can be incorporated as well .
Prices currently suck for the average consumer at about $ 90,000 US .
Choice Two : The miniHome
This particular eco space is more suited for a second home than a small retreat .
Still , if you ’ve got deep pockets and need a place to unwind this may be the perfect “ out there ” option .
Their Micro - Gable and Micro - Shed models are a perfect in - between .
According to the site , within 350sq ft. “ there is everything you need for comfortable , year - round , sustainable living ” .
The different models can even be adapted to varying climates ; including arctic temperatures .
Treehugger ticks off the environmental attributes quite nicely : “ SIP ’s , low VOC wheatstock particle board , solvent free adhesives , portable green roof , rainwater collection , photovoltaics , LED lighting , composting toilets , stack - effect - based heat recovery ventilator , grey water storage , Stirling multifuel biodiesel system providing heating , hot water and electricity from one unit and , get this , siding made from hemp . ”
Yup , this one is made to impress .
Costs currently start at $ 107 for the SOLO model , but we ’re thinking they ’re a bit lower for the smaller designs on the site .
If you can afford it , this one impresses in features and construction .
Choice Three : The EcoSpace Studio
This company features meerkats in much of the marketing literature accompanying their structure ; so the ’re points ahead from the get - go .
We ’re also entering the realm of ‘ affordable ’ with this green studio composed of roughly 120 sq feet .
I dig the large windows and such features as a green roof , heated water - resistant rubber flooring , sustainable red cedar insulated walls , and the small footprint .
A standard model costs about $ 37 K .
Choice Four : The Mini-Jot
The Mini -Jot may be your best bet for aligning price with function .
At roughly $ 100 per square foot , this 120sq ft. studio can fit perfectly as a home office , guest house , etc .
The structure is designed with passive solar in mind to reduce heating and cooling costs ; as well as insulated lightweight structural panels , super - efficient windows , and optional concrete flooring to act as a heat sink .
With the money you save on building costs , you could also add on solar , a wood stove , or other cool green features .
Choice Five : The Hobbit House
I ’ve saved the best for last — because seriously , if you can pull these structures off you ’ll have a natural hideaway to rival all others .
First , let ’s take a look at the famed “ Woodland Home ” ; which gives the impression that Gandalf The Wizard may visit at any moment .
Half - snuggled into the side of a hill , this home is made from all - natural materials , incorporates a green rood , passive solar design , and some incredible artistic touches .
The pictures from the inside of this structure all lit up make it look like something out of a fairytale .
Costs for this home came in under $ 6 K , but the time and effort are certainly not included .
Another cool project coming in at the same price is the “ Low Impact RoundHouse ” .
Having Celtic origins , this roundhouse is made from sustainable materials and incorporates strawbale and timberframe design .
It took only four months to design and build and blends in beautifully with its surroundings .
Showers , woodstove , and other modern comforts are all easily integrated .
Sure , these two designs are bit too “ wild ” for some people , but just like the Bat Cave , beauty is in the eye of the beholder .
Something strange is happening to the Tiger Salamander , an endangered species , and native of California .
The invasive Barred Tiger Salamander has been working its whiles on the native populations , producing a swarm of hybrid salamanders .
These hybrids are more likely to survive than either parent species , according to a new study .
Found in Salinas , California , the swarm of hybridized salamanders may comprise the first population of sustainable hybrids created by an interbreeding involving an endangered species , and is among the first known sustainable populations of a hybrid animal .
The conservation issues raised by the discovery of the salamander hybrid may “ serve as a model ” for those issues to be raised by future discoveries of hybrids created by interbreeding between an endangered species and an invasive species , says Brad Shaffer of the University of California , who is a co-author of the study .
Because of advances in genetic analyses and because of increases in invasive species , Shaffer expects increasing numbers of hybrids to be discovered in the future .
Adult Barred Tiger Salamander .
The invader
The study of the hybridization of the California Tiger Salamander and the invasive Barred Tiger Salamander , which was introduced to the study area about 50 years ago as fishing bait , is described in the September 17 issue of The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
This research was partially funded by the National Science Foundation ( NSF ) .
When two plant species or two animal species are able to mate , they create hybrid offspring .
But hybridization has usually been considered “ an evolutionary dead end , ” says Benjamin Fitzpatrick of the University of Tennessee , Knoxville , who is the study ’s lead author .
This is because “ the mixture of genes from organisms that are distinct enough to be called separate species do n’t usually produce healthy , fit offspring ” that can sustain themselves .
Adult California Tiger Salamander .
The victim ?
In scientific terms , hybrids usually lack “ fitness . ”
( In the classic example of a horse mating with a donkey , the resulting mule is sterile and therefore less fit than both of its parents . )
But Fitzpatrick and Shaffer say that the larvae of hybrids produced by interbreeding between California Tiger Salamanders and invasive Barred Tiger Salamanders are more likely to survive than larvae of either parent species .
The researchers base this finding on their comparison of the genetic profiles of surviving salamander larvae with the genetic profiles of the initial pool of hatchlings in five wild populations .
Adult hybrid salamander .
The champion ?
The California Tiger Salamander and the Barred Tiger Salamander evolved independently for millions of years and are about as genetically different from one another as are humans and chimpanzees .
Therefore , the researchers say that their field studies of hybrid fitness show that hybridization can change evolutionary processes by conferring genetic advantages to hybrids .
The researchers say that their results also indicate that some non-native salamander genes may eventually spread to all California Tiger salamanders .
In a sense , the entire species would then have hybrid ancestry .
“ We always worry that invasive species will displace existing species , ” says Samuel Scheiner , an NSF Program Director .
“ But with hybridization , you lose an existing species not because it is driven to extinction by competition , but because its genes are mixed with those of another species .
While we have known about the potential threat to endangered species posed by hybridization , this study represents one of the first demonstrations of this threat . ”
The researchers do not yet know why the hybrids are thriving .
According to Fitzpatrick , “ the hybrids could be more resistant to disease , better able at escaping predators , or more efficient at gathering food than their parent species . ”
Barred Tiger Salamander larva .
But no matter why the salamanders are thriving , their success raises questions about whether hybridization is beneficial to native species .
Some conservationists , for example , may consider hybridization that is favored by natural selection to be an acceptable human - mediated change because it strengthens the original species , says Shaffer .
By contrast , other conservationists may consider hybrids to be genetically impure and regard them as threats to native species and as potential threats to competitor and prey species .
But Shaffer adds that “ to get rid of the fraction of genes coming from the invasive species , you would have to fight natural selection , which is difficult . ”
California Tiger Salamander larva .
As hybrids blur genetic lines , they also blur legal definitions .
Would , for example , the hybrid salamanders qualify for the same protection under the Endangered Species Act as the endangered California Tiger Salamander ?
Fitzpatrick says that besides the salamander hybrids , he only knows of one other sustainable animal hybrid and three sustainable plant hybrids .
But as more hybrids are created by the interbreeding of endangered and invasive species , the thorny scientific and conservation questions posed by hybrids will increase as well .
As most students at Eastern Michigan University were heading home for the holidays in December , the school put out a news release announcing that student Laura Dickinson had unexpectedly passed away in her dorm room .
There was no foul play , the school said .
Staff members assured worried students they were safe .
The campus fell into mourning , with candlelight vigils for the lanky 22 - year - old member of the crew team .
Neither students nor Laura ’s parents knew that investigators had found a grisly scene in Room 518 of Hill Hall .
Dickinson ’s body was on the carpeted floor , naked from the waist down .
A pillow covered her head and traces of semen were on her leg .

For 10 weeks , neither her family nor fellow students knew that authorities were investigating several suspects as part of a criminal inquiry into Dickinson ’s death .
Then , on Feb. 23 , Orange Amir Taylor III , an Eastern Michigan student , was arrested .
Only then did the university acknowledge that Dickinson had been raped and killed in her dorm room by someone who took her keys and locked the door when he left .
The school ’s secretiveness has left many students and residents of this suburb southwest of Detroit , with a population of 22,000 , shaken and outraged .
For many , this bucolic campus -- founded in the mid-1800s to train teachers -- had been violated .
The school “ lied to us , ” Laura ’s father , Bob Dickinson , said .
“ They let us bury her thinking that a healthy 22 - year - old girl died by some freak accident . ”

School officials will not say why they kept silent .
But some parents and people in the community believe administrators endangered students in an effort to protect the university ’s image .
An independent investigation initiated by the school ’s Board of Regents agrees .
In a 568 - page report released this month , investigators with the Detroit law firm of Butzel Long detail how school officials violated the Clery Act , a federal law requiring colleges and universities to disclose information about campus crimes and warn students of threats to their safety .
The report , as well as court documents , show that Eastern Michigan University police either suspected or believed all along that this was a homicide .
Some university officials did not know there was a criminal investigation , and unknowingly passed along misinformation , according to the Butzel Long report .
Others made a conscious decision to not warn the public or tell the Dickinsons .

University President John A. Fallon III said he was unaware that the death was a homicide .
Fallon repeatedly told the public and local media that university officials did not suspect a crime .
James Vick , vice president of student affairs who oversees the school ’s housing and campus police , told the Dickinson family that no foul play was suspected in Laura ’s death .
He also directed , in “ damage - control mode , ” that school staff shred a police report about the investigation , according to the report .
Fallon did not return calls for comment .
Vick , who denies the allegations , has become a designated scapegoat , his lawyer Thomas C. Manchester wrote in a Wednesday letter to the Board of Regents .
The letter says that Vick , eager to clear his name , has taken a polygraph test which shows he is telling the truth .

The U.S. Department of Education is looking into whether the school violated the 1990 Clery Act , which takes its name from the 1986 death of Jeanne Clery , who was raped and killed in her residence hall room at Lehigh University in Pennsylvania .
Though the department has conducted 70 similar inquiries since October 2003 , only three institutions have been fined under the law .
For Bob Dickinson , 51 , the search for answers has been exhausting .
Behind the counter of the family ’s coffee shop in Hastings , Mich . , he faces pitying looks from customers as he froths milk and works the espresso machine .
It ’s a routine that has stretched on for months here inside State Grounds Coffee House , where photographs Laura took while traveling with her boyfriend , Travis Scott , line one wall : the sun rising over a lake in the upper peninsula of Michigan , waves crashing on the coast of Washington , a wild horse gazing on the plains of Wyoming .
After Laura earned her associate ’s degree from Grand Rapids Community College , she decided to get a bachelor ’s degree in nutrition .

“ We wanted her to stay close .
She did n’t want to go too far away , ” Dickinson said .
“ Eastern had a very good nutrition program and was close enough for her to drive home on the weekends . ”
In September , the family drove the two hours southeast to Eastern ’s campus in Ypsilanti and her new home at Hill Hall , a 10 - story brick high - rise .
Dickinson and his wife , Deb , gave Laura some last - minute advice before they left :
Make lots of friends .
Call if you get lonely .
And always keep the door locked .
She followed their guidance .
She joined the novice crew team , spending her mornings sweating on the water and her evenings hanging out with teammates .

The night Laura died , she attended a team Christmas party where they swapped “ Secret Santa ” gifts .
It was Dec. 12 -- a Tuesday -- and finals week .
Some neighbors in Hill Hall were cramming for exams ; others had already left for winter break .
Video surveillance cameras show that she returned to Hill Hall at 11:12 p.m. , carrying a stuffed toy inside a red - and - green holiday gift bag .
In her room , Laura called Scott at Covanta Energy in Grand Rapids , Mich. , where he worked as an engineer .
It was the last time she used her phone .
When she failed to show up for exams , friends and family grew concerned and began calling her cellphone .
For two days , there was no answer .

On Friday morning , Bob Dickinson contacted the university housing department and Scott decided to drive to campus .
But it was a custodian , answering an odor complaint from one of Laura ’s Hill Hall neighbors , who opened the door to Room 518 and found her body .
Laura ’s slaying came at a time when Eastern Michigan University -- which has churned through three presidents in three years -- had spent months dogged by bad press and scandal .
In 2004 , state auditors found that the university had under - reported the budget of , and failed to get state approval for , a $ 6 - million mansion for its president at that time .
The controversy fueled a two - week staff strike in September .
Days before Laura was killed , three of the school ’s eight regents resigned , citing a campus culture of “ distrust and open animosity . ”

In this tense climate , the school made public assurances about Laura ’s death .
But school police were interviewing at least three men as suspects -- including her boyfriend , Scott , and Taylor .
They cleared Scott , but Taylor , who told campus police he had previously roamed through dorms to steal electronics , remained on their list of people to watch .
As the investigation progressed , semen samples taken from Laura ’s body and her bed matched Taylor ’s DNA .
Surveillance cameras showed Taylor sneaking into Hill Hall in the early hours of Dec. 13 -- and leaving 90 minutes later , with one of Laura ’s gift bags in hand .
Dr. Bader J. Cassin , the Washtenaw County medical examiner who conducted Laura ’s autopsy , ruled that Laura probably died of asphyxiation , according to court testimony .
Some physical details that might have shown how she died were not present , because of the body ’s advanced state of decomposition , according to court records .
Some media reports surmised that Laura , who had experienced stress - related cardiac arrhythmia in the past , may have died from a heart attack .

Taylor was arrested on Feb. 23 and charged with open murder , larceny , home invasion and two counts of sexual criminal conduct .
He has pleaded not guilty and is being held in County Jail without bond .
He is expected to go on trial this fall in Ann Arbor , Mich .
Stephen Gillers , professor of legal ethics at New York University ’s School of Law , said there were legitimate reasons why administrators and school police would not comment on the details of a case , particularly early in an investigation .
But to lie to the parents of the victim is “ an abdication of every responsibility a university administration has , ” Gillers said .
“ There ’s no reason for law enforcement to fear that keeping the parents informed will frustrate the ability to apprehend the perpetrator , ” said Gillers , a former vice dean of NYU ’s law school .
“ This is not the theft of a computer .
It ’s the death of a child . ”

In the weeks after Taylor ’s arrest , school officials held public meetings to let students air their complaints .
“ I was specifically told I was not in danger , that we were n’t in danger , and unless you guys already had a guy in custody , we were in danger , ” student Jaclyn Armstrong said in one meeting , according to the school newspaper , the Eastern Echo .
“ And the fact that he is being charged with criminal sexual assault , not only were our lives in danger , but we were in danger of many other things . ”
The Board of Regents is meeting on campus today to discuss the case and possible administration staff changes , said James Stapleton , who led the subcommittee of regents in commissioning the Butzel Long report .
“ Clearly , the report shows that the university has a lack of protective systems and policies in place , ” Stapleton said .
“ It ’s tough , but it ’s a completely dysfunctional culture at EMU .
And we are going to change that culture . ”

A supine and whorish press corps engaged in largely meaningless banter with President George Bush recently as he gave his 20th conference .
The event was a typical Bush activity full of smirks , off - colored gaffes , political bullying and sheer inability to understand complex geopolitical issues that resulted in his tried and tested evasions and tangential behavior .
Curiously , Mr. Bush called the pres conference to talk about his opposition to excessive federal spending even as he plans to ask congress for $ 26 billion more to fight his two wars and his total opposition to giving a measly $ 5 billion for children ’s insurance .
While the commander in chief behaved in his typical dysfunctional fashion he never raised any eyebrows in the media with a really alarming comment .
Speaking about Iran Bush said : “ I believe they want to have the capacity , the knowledge in order to make a nuclear weapon .
And I know it ’s in the world ’s interests to prevent them from doing so .
I believe that the Iranian — if Iran had a nuclear weapon , it would be a dangerous threat to world peace .
We ’ve got a leader in Iran who has announced that he wants to destroy Israel .
So I ’ve told people that , if you ’re interested in avoiding World War III , it seems like you ought to be interested in preventing them from having the knowledge necessary to make a nuclear weapon . ”
Amazingly not ONE of the assembled journalists asked Bush what he meant about this inference to war that could be of apocalyptical dimensions .
The silence was conspicuous and telling given that this was the most important statement of the entire press conference .
There were no post press conference analyses and no mention of the statement the next day in many of the mainstream media .
Have the American media become so “ imbedded ” – or wedded if you wish – to the Bush Administration that it demonstrates such sycophantic and sniveling behavior that it could not hold responsible , ask for clarification , from a man who has his finger on the US nuclear button and literally issued a threat of global war ?
Such saber - rattling should give Americans cause for concern and pause .
Iran is not Iraq and with 75 million people will not be a military cake walk .
Mr. Bush ’s language and tone suggests that he ’s become convinced about “ all options being on the table ” – including the nuclear one .
That is a deliberate contemplation of mass murder and if carried out would make other such events mere dwarfs in comparison .
Moreover , the threat of a new American - instigated and led war is now very real .
Consider this : Presidential Republican hopeful , Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) , has said the probability of an American attack against Iran is higher than our public debate suggests , while the rhetoric from the president , vice president and Republican candidates for president becomes so fevered it borders on irrational .
Mr. Bush ’s rhetoric , the passage of a resolution by the United States Senate branding a section of the Iranian government a terrorist organization that is led by that nation ’s Supreme Ayatollah , new vitriolic statements by Vice President Dick Cheney and the astounding “ World War III ” statement by his boss all point to a looming attack on Iran and plans for which were set in motion long before the president ’s “ Axis of Evil ” speech .
The Senate resolution , co-sponsored by Republicrat Joe Lieberman , would make Iran ’s Supreme Ayatollah a terrorist since he ’s the spiritual head of the Republican Guards and the Quds Forces .
Of course , with votes to be gotten in this upcoming Presidential Elections nobody even considered the deep implications of this reckless resolution .
This new round of manufactured pretexts to justify and make the case for war eerily resembles the Bush Administration ’s Iraq resolution of 2002 with all of its distortions and falsehoods .
It also resembles the kinds of lies and distortions that was built , packaged and manufactured around the Gulf of Tonkin resolution in Congress that dragged America into an ill - fated , unwinnable war in Vietnam .
Yet this Congress with all that history available continues to be strong - armed and brow - beaten by President Bush .
No wonder the American public has lost confidence in the Congress and rates its job performance lower than King George ’s – a disgraceful and shameful 27 percent .
In the case for war against Iraq Bush and company used scare tactics , the national trauma of 9 - 11 , and the need for justice or revenge .
He painted a picture of “ mushroom clouds ” occasioned by the use of Weapons of Mass Destruction ( WMD ) and is now doing the same thing as he sells his Third World War package while demonizing Iran and paying little attention to the very serious consequences of opening up a new war in that already destabilized part of the world .
To compare the present global situation of today with anything remotely resembling World War II is the height of extremism and alarmist , intemperate behavior from a president who has allowed the real enemy who killed Americans on Sept. 11 , 2001 to regroup and resurge .
But back to Mr. Bush ’s statement about World War III .
His assertion that “ if you ’re interested in avoiding World War III , it seems like you ought to be interested in preventing them from having the knowledge necessary to make a nuclear weapon ” is most revealing in that it suggests that Iran ’s real crime is not possessing a nuclear bomb but that war is necessary to “ prevent them from having the knowledge necessary to make a nuclear weapon . ”
For Mr. Bush the basis for a preemptive war with Iran is simply that nation ’s “ wanting to possess the knowledge to make a nuclear bomb . ”
It is an improvement over his Iraq justification and a new twist to his preemptive doctrine .
In Iraq ’s case he told the world and the American public that Iraq had Weapons of Mass Destruction ( WMD ) .
In fact , the person who said that he was “ 100 percent proof positive ” was none other than Vice President Dick Cheney who is now spreading new Iran fear among the American populace in his typically Darth Vader fashion .
But what insanity drives ostensibly responsible people to make these dangerous statements that must be interpreted as war preparations by the United States and its potential for a wider military conflagration in this most volatile part of the world ?
Any US - Iran confrontation is a very dangerous thing .
Israel will definitely become involved because it is the US ’s only ally in that part of the world and the one Middle East nation that can challenge it .
In Iraq the Shiite majority could turn drastically on US soldiers in sympathy with their brothers and sisters in Iran .
And Russia and China could be dragged into a wider conflict that could plunge the world to the brink of Bush - induced Armageddon .
Such a conflict will also involve other US client nations like France and Britain .
That is why the United States Congress should act now based on the history of President Bush and his penchant for military miscalculations and presumed infallibility .
Congress must not be duped into supporting a more dangerous war as it did in 2002 when it bought into Mr. Bush ’s militaristic , pseudo - patriotism and jingoistic fervor .
If Mr. Bush intends to wage war with Iran the American people must know the cost , consequences and other issues that were obfuscated from them in 2002 when Mr. Bush and Company launched a preemptive war against Iraq .
To fail to do so would be tantamount to an abnegation of Congressional authority and responsibility and ceding same to President Bush thus giving him effective control of two branches of government .
Congress must be very concerned when the top leadership of the Bush Administration starts synchronizing their public statements about war with Iran in the context of an extremely inflammable Middle East .

At various points , readers have seemed quite surprised to find out that I live in Iowa and that I can see cornfields in two directions from the back porch of the house I ’m about to buy .
By sheer numbers , many more people live in urban environments than live in an environment like this , and many of those ca n’t even imagine living in such an area .
Obviously , there are some disadvantages to living here , chief among them cultural .
I have few opportunities to experience large cultural events in Iowa ( though there are many interesting small ones ) and cultural trends often take a very long time to reach here .
Also , the population is very sparse – every time I visit an urban center , I have an almost overwhelming sense of too many people , even when I ’m in a suburban area .
Another disadvantage is salary ; dollar for dollar , jobs simply do not pay as well here as they do elsewhere .
But there are huge financial and cultural advantages to living in Iowa that often are n’t taken into account .
Here ’s why I love living in Iowa and have very little interest in moving away .
Low housing prices
Even in the most expensive regions of the state , you can get a newly - built four bedroom 2000 + square foot home for around $ 220,000 .
This comes out to monthly housing payments ( depending on specifics ) of about $ 1,400 a month .
No joke at all – people in most large cities almost seem unable to comprehend that this is possible .
Good schools Most Iowa schools outside of Des Moines are quite good .
The class sizes are small ( if there are only 5,000 residents in a fifty mile radius , the school district has to be small and this forces small classes ) and the teachers are usually people who want to be there – they chose a rural setting for a reason .
Iowa has a lot of tiny schools that turn out National Merit Scholars on a regular basis .
There ’s no need for private schooling at all .
Low cost of living Because of the low housing prices , most services are able to compete and have lower rates .
I have my son in the absolute best daycare in my area and for him alone the cost is less than $ 600 a month .
There are other options that are substantially cheaper than that .
I recently read that you have to pay $ 1.60 for a 20 ounce bottle of Diet Coke in San Francisco – if someone charges more than a dollar here , it ’s considered borderline extortion .
Low taxes
Because the salaries are lower , most people are in a lower tax bracket or , at the very least , are paying much less of their salary in a high bracket .
This means that we get to keep a larger portion of our salary for the same job as compared to urban centers .
Low cost of retirement Because I can live on a lower salary here than elsewhere , I do n’t have to put as much away for retirement as others – I may be working with the same percentages as others , but the raw dollar amount is significantly less for me .
As a final note , although many view it as a disadvantage , I believe there are some cultural advantages to rural Iowa .
I have a deep understanding of many aspects of America ( agriculture , outdoorsmanship , etc. ) that many Americans do n’t have the opportunity to experience .
Also , the solitude can be amazing – I can go for long country walks for hours without seeing another soul .
Yes , even though I may not make as much money , Iowa offers so much that I can scarcely think of living elsewhere .
Records may put new spin on Hitler
Outward hatred for Jews and Russians may have belied a secret passion for some of their greatest musical works , if a recently discovered cache of records proves to be the remains of Adolf Hitler 's private music collection .
The nearly 100 records , now worn and scratched , were stored in the attic of a former Soviet intelligence agent , who left a note saying he took them from Hitler 's Chancellery after the fall of Berlin in 1945 .
Among the records are recordings of works by Tchaikovsky , Borodin and Rachmaninov , and prominent Russian and Jewish musicians , notably Bronislaw Huberman , a Polish Jewish violinist , an article in this week 's Der Spiegel magazine said .
The discovery , if legitimate , could indicate a secret hypocrisy on the part of Hitler , but could also force a new look at Russia 's treatment of artifacts seized from museums in Germany and elsewhere during and after World War II .
The former Soviet intelligence officer , Lev Besymenski , described pilfering the records from the Chancellery at the end of World War II .
They remained hidden until last week when his daughter , Aleksandra Besymenskaya , showed them to Der Spiegel .
Besymenski died in June at the age of 86 .
" I was astonished that Russian musicians were among the collection , " Besymenski wrote .
Russians and Jews were among many groups disparaged by the Nazis as untermenschen , or subhumans , and tens of millions were killed in concentration camps and during the war .
The recordings were each stamped with the label " Fuhrerhauptquartier , " indicating that they belonged to Hitler 's headquarters , though Der Spiegel put forward no other evidence that Hitler had actually listened to or owned them .
Der Spiegel suggested that Besymenski , a former history professor in Moscow , kept quiet about the records for fear of being branded a looter , though in recent history Russia has tended to glorify its sizable collection of war spoils .
Besymenskaya said she had not decided what to do with the recordings , which remain in her possession .
In his WaPo column today , E.J. Dionne quotes one of his readers : “ Conservatism , like Christianity , has not failed .
Neither has ever been tried , especially by this administration . ”
This person may have a point about Christianity , although I think a handful of people have made a sincere effort ; Albert Schweitzer comes to mind .
But he ’s wrong about American - style conservatism .
It ’s been tried , and it failed .
As Digby wrote recently ,
I did not understand the zombie nature of Republicanism and had no way of knowing that unless you drive a metaphorical stake through the heart of GOP crooks and liars , they will be back , refreshed and and ready to screw up the country in almost exactly the same way , within just a few years .
In support of Digby ’s statement I present here A ( Pretty ) Short History of Wingnutism .
After the Civil War , the American Right reacted to European socialism by adopting “ laissez faire ” economics with a vengeance .
They embraced the idea that any government regulation of business was the equivalent of European socialism and a threat to civilization itself .
The rise of big business was the natural activity of the laws of nature and God , they said .
The late - 19th century Supreme Court saw itself not as the protecting of individual liberty against the state , but the protector of individual wealth against the mob .
As historian Eric Siegel wrote ,
According to what came to be known as “ constitutional morality , ” legislation supporting the right to unionize or limiting children ’s working hours was an un-American form of group privilege .
Laissez - faire conservatism reached its intellectual apogee in the 1920s .
A critic complained that by 1924 you did n’t have to be a radical to be denounced as un-American : “ according to the lights of Constitution worship you are no less a Red if you seek change through the very channels which the Constitution itself provides . ”
In Europe conservatism was based on hereditary classes ; in America it was based on hereditary religious , ethnic , and racial groups .
The GOP , a largely Protestant party , looked upon itself as the manifestation of the divine creed of Americanism revealed through the Constitution .
To be a conservative , then , was to share in a religiously ordained vision of a largely stateless society of self - regulating individuals .
[ The Reader ’s Companion to American History , edited by Eric Foner and John Garraty ( Houghton Mifflin , 1991 ) , p.222 ]
By now you probably see where we ’re going .
“ American Way ” conservatism was the dominant political philosophy in the 1920s , and the nation was governed by its principles through the Harding and Coolidge administrations , from 1921 to 1929 .
Some historians call this decade “ the Republican Era . ”
The vigorous progressivism of 1900 - 1916 was vanquished , and the labor union movement lost ground .
In fact , the longer one looks at America in the 1920s , the more familiar it gets — corporate profits rising faster than worker earnings ; a crackdown on immigration ; culture wars led by an aggressive Christian fundamentalist movement ; and tax cuts galore .
If they ’d had iPods back then , you ’d hardly know the difference .
Of course , it would come to pass that the Republican who won the 1928 presidential election by a landslide , Herbert Hoover , was probably sorry he won .
The stock market crashed in October 1929 , which marked the beginning of the Great Depression .
The Depression was caused by a number of interacting factors , and since it was a worldwide phenomenon you can’t blame the Republicans for all of it .
But in the United States many of those factors were created , directly or indirectly , by “ American Way ” conservative policies .
Among these factors were a wildly overheated stock market ( security regulation was socialism , after all ) and the maldistribution of wealth that resulted from laissez - faire business policies .
Since President Herbert Hoover was a tried - and - true “ American Way ” conservative , he mostly was at a loss to solve the nation ’s economic problems , even though he had almost all of his four - year term to do so .
In 1932 the nation turned to a liberal Democrat , Franklin Roosevelt , to make things right .
Righties are quick to point out that the New Deal had a limited impact on the Depression , and that the nation ’s economy did n’t really pull out of the slump until the industrialization of World War II — over which FDR also presided .
( This is just one of many examples of righties taunting lefties for not cleaning up rightie messes they could n’t clean up themselves ; Iraq is another . )
But New Deal programs had a longer - term success in fostering economic stability .
Federal deposit insurance , unemployment insurance , Social Security , increased government oversight of securities , and other New Deal innovations made Americans ’ economic lives more secure and created a buffer against many of the factors that cause economic depressions .
And considering that rightie counter - arguments to the New Deal usually advocate returning to the same governing philosophy that allowed the Depression to happen , you ’ll forgive me if I do n’t take them seriously .
Anyway , after the FDR landslide in 1932 it was clear the right wing had fallen from grace .
Righties spent the rest of the 1930s seething with resentment and planning a comeback .
And just when they had a shot at re-taking the White House — bam , World War II happened .
And this made the American Right look doubly stupid , because for the most part righties in the 1930s were isolationists who had not only pooh - poohed the threat of the Third Reich but had actually admired Mussolini .
After World War II righties rebounded with a fury .
They did this in large part by taking the issue of national security away from the Democrats .
It ’s important to understand that the Right managed this not because of anything they actually accomplished , but through a “ compilation of hysterical charges and bald - faced lies , ” to quote Kevin Baker in this Harper ’s article , “ Stabbed in the Back , ” which I vigorously urge you to read .
Much of the Red Scare and McCarthyist hysteria of the late 1940s and 1950s were as much about slapping down liberals and Democrats as it was about national security .
See the Kevin Baker article for details .
See also Richard Hofstadter ’s Anti-Intellectualism in American Life ( Vintage / Random House , 1962 ) , in particular pp. 41 - 42 ( emphasis added ) :
The inquisitors were trying to give satisfaction against liberals , New Dealers , reformers , internationalists , intellectuals , and finally even against a Republican administration that failed to reserve reverse liberal policies .
What was involved , above all , was a set of political hostilities in which the New Deal was linked to the welfare state , the welfare state to socialism , and socialism to Communism .
In this crusade Communism was not the target but the weapon , and it is for this reason that so many of the most ardent hunters of impotent domestic Communists were altogether indifferent to efforts to meet the power of International Communism where it really mattered — in the area of world politics .
For a brief time the Dems countered with the “ tough liberalism ” of which Peter Beinart is so fond , but Beinart misses what the political turmoil of the 1950s was really about .
The charges about “ losing China ” and being “ soft on Communism ” were not at their roots about national security at all , which is why no amount of national security toughness on the part of liberals will ever appease the Right .
And I sincerely believe you can take what Hofstadter wrote about the American Right and Communism and update it to the American Right and Islamic terrorism , and it would still be right on the money .
Although the Right was more or less aligned with the Republican Party , after World War II Republican presidents were never “ conservative ” enough to suit them .
Certainly Eisenhower was n’t , nor Nixon , although they supported Nixon because he was tough on hippies .
Neither did the late Gerald Ford please them .
Their true allegiance was drawn to the Goldwater - Reagan wing of the party , which is why Their Day Dawned when Ronald Reagan became president .
By now we ’ve moved into an area of history with which most younger readers are familiar — how Saint Ronald of Blessed Memory single - handedly slew International Communism and brought the nation to glorious prosperity by cutting taxes .
Neither of which is , of course , what happened , but it ’s what righties believe happened .
But even the Reagan Administration was n’t “ pure ” enough for them , because Democrats controlled Congress through the Reagan Administration .
And because of those pesky Democrats , wingnut lore says , Reagan was constrained from returning the nation to a pre-New Deal state of holiness as he had wished to do .
George H.W. Bush fell short of wingnut expectations when he broke the “ no new taxes ” pledge .
The Right never considered Bill Clinton to be a legitimate president even though he clearly won the elections of 1992 and 1996 , and righties went , as they say , batshit crazy for eight years trying to bring him down .
Even though neither Bill nor Hillary Clinton are all that liberal ( to this liberal , anyway ) , something about them enflamed all the rage and the resentment American “ conservatives ” have been nursing since the 1930s .
Finally , however , the Right got back the free hand they ’d lost in the election of 1932 .
They won control of the White House in 2000 and complete control of Congress in 2002 , and by exploitation of the September 11 attacks managed for a time to wrap a cult of personality around George W. Bush and make him invincible .
So righties have been mostly in control of the federal government for six years and fully in control for four , yet they still whine that they have n’t gotten a chance to do what they want to do .
And if our nation and our foreign policy are hopelessly bleeped up , it ’s not conservatism ’s fault .
Waa , waa , waa .
Paul Krugman wrote in his New York Times column today ( behind a subscription firewall , alas ) ,
After first attempting to deny the scale of last month ’s defeat , the apologists have settled on a story line that sounds just like Marxist explanations for the failure of the Soviet Union .
What happened , you see , was that the noble ideals of the Republican revolution of 1994 were undermined by Washington ’s corrupting ways .
And the recent defeat was a good thing , because it will force a return to the true conservative path .
Krugman writes that in 1994 House Majority Leader Dick Armey promised to “ reduce the federal government by half as a percentage of gross domestic product . ”
However , the reality is that most of what Armey wanted to cut are programs and services that lots of people really want , like Social Security , Medicare and Medicaid .
Krugman continues ,
As long as people like Mr. Armey , Newt Gingrich and Tom DeLay were out of power , they could run on promises to eliminate vast government waste that existed only in the public ’s imagination — all those welfare queens driving Cadillacs .
But once in power , they could n’t deliver .
That ’s why government by the radical right has been an utter failure even on its own terms : the government has n’t shrunk .
Federal outlays other than interest payments and defense spending are a higher percentage of G.D.P. today than they were when Mr. Armey wrote his book : 14.8 percent in fiscal 2006 , compared with 13.8 percent in fiscal 1995 .
Unable to make good on its promises , the G.O.P. , like other failed revolutionary movements , tried to maintain its grip by exploiting its position of power .
Friends were rewarded with patronage : Jack Abramoff began building his web of corruption almost as soon as Republicans took control .
Adversaries were harassed with smear campaigns and witch hunts : Congress spent six years and many millions of dollars investigating a failed land deal , and Bill Clinton was impeached over a consensual affair .
But it was n’t enough .
Without 9/11 , the Republican revolution would probably have petered out quietly , with the loss of Congress in 2002 and the White House in 2004 .
Instead , the atrocity created a window of opportunity : four extra years gained by drowning out unfavorable news with terror alerts , starting a gratuitous war , and accusing Democrats of being weak on national security .
Yet the Bush administration failed to convert this electoral success into progress on a right - wing domestic agenda .
The collapse of the push to privatize Social Security recapitulated the failure of the Republican revolution as a whole .
Once the administration was forced to get specific about the details , it became obvious that private accounts could n’t produce something for nothing , and the public ’s support vanished .
In the end , Republicans did n’t shrink the government .
But they did degrade it .
Baghdad and New Orleans are the arrival destinations of a movement based on deep contempt for governance .
Is that the end for the radical right ?
Probably not .
As a long - suffering civil servant once told me , bad policy ideas are like cockroaches : you can flush them down the toilet , but they keep coming back .
Many of the ideas that failed in the Bush years had previously failed in the Reagan years .
So there ’s no reason to assume they ’re gone for good .
Indeed , it appears that loss of power and the ensuing lack of accountability is liberating right - wingers to lie yet again : since last month ’s election , I ’ve noticed a number of Social Security privatizers propounding the same free - lunch falsehoods that the Bush administration had to abandon in the face of demands that it present an actual plan .
And that , bottom line , is the sad truth behind American conservatism — it ’s all talk , no walk .
It can bellyache up a storm , but it ca n’t govern its way out of a wet paper bag .
I mentioned the historian Richard Hofstadter earlier in this post .
Hofstadter ’s essays on pseudo - conservatism , written in the 1950s and 1960s , are essential reading for anyone who wants to understand wingnuttiness .
Some of these are collected in a book called The Paranoid Style in American Politics : And Other Essays that I recommend highly .
Some of Hofstadter ’s essays are online , but they ’re in badly and stupidly condensed form , so that much of the really good stuff is cut out .
Anyway , the people we call “ conservatives ” or “ righties ” or “ wingnuts ” today are what Hofstadter called pseudo - conservatives , and he defined them this way :
The pseudo conservative is a man who , in the name of upholding traditional American values and institutions and defending them against more or less fictitious dangers , consciously or unconsciously aims at their abolition .
The truth of it is that wingnuts know only how to destroy , not to build .
And wingnutism is a philosophy of resentment , not of governing .
Give the American Right a free hand to govern , and it will fail , every time .
Count on it .
How 4 % of Mortgages Have Brought Down the Entire Market
( August 21 , 2007 )
Back on February 21 , 2007 , I invoked The Pareto principle to suggest that a mere 4 % of U.S. mortgages going bad could bring down the entire U.S. housing and mortgage markets .
Seven months later , that call appears to be playing out in spades .
It now seems likely that the 64/4 ( 80/20 ) rule is playing out globally -- the " limited " subprime meltdown is set to take down the global mortgage market and the trillions in derivatives which have been written on trillions in real estate - based debt .
The list of non-U.S. banks , institutions and funds which are confessing huge losses in U.S. - based mortgage - backed securities is growing longer every day -- to take but one example : French Bank Natixis has $ 1.4 billion exposure to U.S. subprime .
Let 's briefly revisit the Pareto principle .
In other words , " the vital few " ( 20 % ) influence effects more than the " trivial many " ( 80 % ) .
A subset of the principle is that 4 % of the " very vital few " have an outsized influence on 64 % of the " trivial many . "
Here is the Wikipedia link to The Pareto principle .
This is a special case of the wider phenomenon of Pareto distributions .
If the parameters in the Pareto distribution are suitably chosen , then one would have not only 80 % of effects coming from 20 % of causes , but also 80 % of that top 80 % of effects coming from 20 % of that top 20 % of causes , and so on ( 80 % of 80 % is 64 % ; 20 % of 20 % is 4 % , so this implies a " 64 - 4 law " ) .
The 64/4 law is playing out across multiple , mutually reinforcing meltdowns : 4 % of the mortgages defaulting are bringing down the entire mortgage lending house of cards , even as 4 % of the CDOs and other leveraged bets on all that debt come apart at the seams , re-writing risk on a global scale , triggering immense , catastrophic losses in 4 % of the hedge funds who have over - extended leveraged bets on credit - swap and CDO derivatives -- and so on , spreading ever widening circles of financial havoc .
Keep this in mind : all those billions lost are in Hedge Fund Heaven .
Loosening credit so speculators can borrow more money on easy terms is not going to bring those losses back .
Despite months of suspiciously negative data -- housing sales and starts sagging , cancellations of sales and foreclosures rising -- housing apologists have maintained that the problems with subprime borrowers and lenders can be " contained . "
In other words , only those " few " who lose their homes will suffer any economic impact ; Home Depot and Lowes sales will remain robust , construction activity will continue unchanged , employment in construction , home furnishings , remodeling , lending and real estate will continue to hold up with minimal declines , etc .
This has now been revealed as fantasy .
As the 4 % subprime / no - doc " vital few " borrowers default , they have triggered an avalanche will will soon affect 64 % of all mortgage holders .
Eventually , the 20 % " vital few " whose mortgages , equity lines of credit and other housing - based debt is affected will then have outsized influence on the values of fully 80 % of U.S. and global real estate valuations .
This chart reveals that fully 5 % of recent home buyers are at great risk of default .
Another 5 % could not have qualified for a mortgage " in the good old days " ( i.e. 15 years ago ) so they too are vulnerable .
In terms of the Pareto Principle , only 40 % of that highly vulnerable 10 % need fall behind on their mortgages for outsized effects to hit 64 % of all homeowners .
But if we dig a little deeper , this chart ( courtesy of the FDIC ) seems to understate the true scope of delinquencies and foreclosures .
Here is the Financial Services Fact Book :
Adjustable rate mortgages , loans in which the interest rate is adjusted periodically according to a pre-selected index , accounted for 31 percent of mortgage originations in 2005 , up from 12 percent in 2001 .
The factbook also lists some very interesting charts of delinquencies : 12.9 % of all FHA loans are delinquent .
Are these listed as subprime ?
No .
These are " conventional mortgages . "
The Factbook also states that 24.7 million homes are owned " free and clear , " with no mortgage , and about 50 million have mortgages of one kind or another .
About 10 million homeowners have equity lines of credit as well as a mortgage -- in effect , second mortgages .
Though rarely mentioned in all the hoopla about subprime ARM ( adjustable rate ) mortgages , it is important to note that equity lines of credit are adjustable - rate loans ; they are not 30 - year , fixed - rate " conventional " mortgages .
The upshot : 10 million homeowners who statistically have " safe " conventional mortgages are at risk of their home equity line loans re-setting to higher rates .
There 's about $ 9 trillion in home mortgages on the books , and $ 500 billion is due to re-set higher .
Various versions of this chart have been popping up , displaying the unsettling reality that re-sets will continue hitting consumers / homeowners all through 2008 :
Here 's another version compiled by Credit Swisse :
It 's no secret that the number of delinquencies , defaults and foreclosures is rising : More Americans are losing their homes :
Nothaft estimates that $ 500 billion in variable rate mortgages will reset , or rise , sometime this year , leaving many with a payment they can no longer afford .
“ Those would be the candidates for … delinquent status , ” he said .
Foreclosures had been at historic lows in the past three years as rapidly appreciating home prices gave financially strapped owners the option to refinance , sell their house at a profit or take out a cheap home equity line of credit .
But with the pace of appreciation slowing in many markets and interest rates rising , for many , these avenues have been cut off .
" You ’re really out of options , " said Susan Wachter , professor of real estate at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania .
Meanwhile , back at the ranch , Number of vacant homes for sale surges 34 %
The number of vacant homes waiting to be sold surged 34 % to 2.1 million at the end of 2006 compared with the end of 2005 , by far the fastest increase ever recorded , the Census Bureau reported Monday .
" We have more than a million housing units of excess supply , " said James O'Sullivan , an economist for UBS .
" If you are looking for evidence that the worst is over for housing , you 're not going to find it in this report .
This argues that housing starts need to go down more . "
According to the Financial Times ,
The inventory of new and existing homes waiting for buyers is now approaching 4 m .
The total value of US residential property is now around $ 19 trillion , according to the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University .
The US Census Bureau calculates that there are around 123.9 m housing units in the US .
( ED : this includes condos and rental apartments )
Total household debt is $ 11 trillion : $ 9 trillion in mortgages and $ 2 trillion in revolving credit ( credit cards , etc . )
That means net equity for all 75 million American homeowners is $ 8 trillion ( $ 19 T - $ 11 T = $ 8 T ) -- including the 25 million households who own their homes free and clear .
What if we subtract those folks ?
Since 1/3 of all homes are owned free and clear , let 's assume about a 1/3 of the $ 19 trillion is represented by these mortgage - free homes .
That 's $ 6.5 trillion , which means all 50 million mortgage holders are left with a grand total of $ 1.5 trillion in net equity .
If housing values decline 15 % , that 's a $ 2.85 trillion haircut off net equity .
If we set 2/3 of that against mortgaged real estate , ( the other 1/3 being a decline in the value of free and clear homes ) , then the decline collectively suffered by all mortgage holders is $ 1.9 trillion -- enough to put them in a negative equity hole .
This is a staggering conclusion , for it suggests just how a " mere " 4 % delinquency / foreclosure rate could trigger a " modest " 15 % decline in housing values , which would put the nation 's mortgage holders ( if taken in aggregate ) under water : the nation 's household debt would exceed the value of the mortgaged residential real estate .
There are 50 million mortgages .
If 4 % is the magic number , that 's 2 million mortgages .
In other words , when 2 million mortgages enter delinquency / default , then according to the Pareto principle , that will affect the 64 % " trivial many , " i.e. those holding supposedly " low - risk " mortgages .
According to USA Today , 2.1 million homeowners are already in trouble : Record foreclosures hit mortgage lenders :
The reason many mortgage lenders are in trouble became alarmingly clear Tuesday .
The Mortgage Bankers Association said more than 2.1 million Americans with a home loan missed at least one payment at the end of last year — and the rate of new foreclosures hit a record .
In other words : the 4 % " vital few " threshold has been breached .
Also recall that 13 % of FHA loans - -" conventional fixed - rate mortgages " -- are already in delinquency .
( see Factbook link above for the chart )
So while the foreclosure rate on those mortgages is still low - - 2 % or so -- the pool of potential foreclosures is large , and increasing .
Here 's a question that deserves to be asked : if everyone who can afford a house -- even those who stretched their credit and stated incomes to the breaking point -- has already bought a house , then who 's left to buy 4 million empty dwellings ?
Please do n't say someone who 's selling their existing house -- they 're adding one unit of inventory even as they take one off .
If you add up the facts presented above , it is difficult not to reach disturbing conclusions : there is no way buyers will emerge to snap up 4 million empty homes .
Here 's another way to consider possible Pareto effects : if 20 % of the housing stock in the " hot markets " of Florida and the West and East coasts declines sharply in value , then will that cause a decline in 80 % of the U.S. home market ?

Isiah Thomas found liable for sex harassment But Madison Square Garden , not the Knicks coach , will have to pay punitive damages in the $ 10 million lawsuit filed by a former team executive
Recommended Video :
NEW YORK — A federal jury decided today that Madison Square Garden and its chairman must pay $ 11.6 million in damages to former New York Knicks executive Anucha Browne Sanders in her sexual harassment lawsuit .
The jury also found Knicks coach Isiah Thomas subjected Browne Sanders to unwanted advances and a barrage of verbal insults , but that he did not have to pay punitive damages .
Deciding MSG had harassed Browne Sanders , the jury found the Garden owes $ 6 million for allowing a hostile work environment to exist and $ 2.6 million for retaliation ; MSG chairman James Dolan owes $ 3 million .
" What I did here , I did for every working woman in America , " said Browne Sanders , who came out of the courtroom beaming .
" And that includes everyone who gets up and goes to work in the morning , everyone working in a corporate environment . "
She said it also was for " women who do n't have the means and could n't possibly have done what I was able to do . "
The Garden said it would appeal , but the verdict gave Thomas a partial victory after an ugly , three - week trial .

" I 'm innocent , I 'm very innocent , and I did not do the things she has accused me in this courtroom of doing , " said Thomas , who 's married with two children .
" I 'm extremely disappointed that the jury did not see the facts in this case .
I will appeal this , and I remain confident in the man that I am and what I stand for and the family that I have . "
After the verdict , Browne Sanders hugged family members and friends gathered in the back of the courtroom .
U.S. District Judge Gerard E. Lynch called it an " eminently reasonable " verdict , and gave the jurors instructions on how to proceed .
Before the jury resumed deliberations , attorneys from both sides appealed to the jurors .
Browne Sanders ' lawyer , Anne Vladeck , had urged the jury to affix damages that sent a message " to avoid this happening to somebody else . "
She said the defendants had ruined her client 's career , and she called Dolan a liar .
Thomas 's lawyer , Ronald Green , told jurors they had already sent " a very clear , very strong and very forceful message .
" Punishment for the sake of punishment is not what this is all about , " he said .
The harassment verdict was widely expected after the jury sent a note to the judge Monday indicating that it believed Thomas , the Garden and Dolan sexually harassed Browne Sanders , a married mother of three .
" We believe that the jury 's decision was incorrect , " MSG said in a statement before punitive damages were awarded .
" We look forward to presenting our arguments to an appeals court , and believe they will agree that no sexual harassment took place and MSG acted properly . "
MSG is owned by Cablevision Systems Corp. , based in Bethpage , N.Y. , and Dolan is Cablevision 's CEO .

Researchers at the University of Southampton have developed a software package for modelling asteroid impacts that enables them to assess the potential human and economic consequences across the globe .
The software , called NEOimpactor , has been specifically developed for measuring the impact of ' small ' asteroids under one kilometre in diameter , and early results indicate that the ten countries most at risk are China , Indonesia , India , Japan , the United States , the Philippines , Italy , the United Kingdom , Brazil and Nigeria .
' The threat of the Earth being hit by an asteroid is increasingly being accepted as the single greatest natural disaster hazard faced by humanity , ' comments Nick Bailey of the University of Southampton 's School of Engineering Sciences , who developed the software with University colleague Dr Graham Swinerd , and Dr Richard Crowther of the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory .
' Since 1998 the international Spaceguard survey has been cataloguing all near earth asteroids ( NEA ) larger than one kilometre in diameter .
However , small asteroids , under one kilometre in diameter , remain predominantly undetected .
While the direct consequences might not be quite as extreme , these small objects exist in far greater numbers and therefore will impact more frequently .
It is on these sub - kilometre asteroid impacts that we have been focusing to assess the consequences for both humans and for infrastructure across the globe . '
Initial investigations have examined how the consequences of an impact change with increasing impact energy .
Taking a spherical stony asteroid travelling at 12,000 miles per second and varying the diameter to increase kinetic energy , the results indicate that a 100 metre diameter asteroid will predominantly cause localised casualties and damage across a few countries when impacting on either land or ocean .
However , the consequences of a 200 metre diameter asteroid hitting the ocean increase significantly , with the generated tsunamis reaching a global scale .
At 500 metres in diameter , almost any ocean impact will generate significant casualties and economic cost across the world .
The team used the raw data from the multiple impact simulations to rank each country based on the number of times and how severely they would be affected by each impact .
Early results show that in terms of population lost , China , Indonesia , India , Japan and the United States face the greatest overall threat ; while the United States , China , Sweden , Canada and Japan face the most severe economic effects due to the infrastructure destroyed .
In both rankings , the United Kingdom appears eighth in the list of countries most affected .
Of the top twenty for each ranking , over half the countries appear in both lists .
' The consequences for human populations and infrastructure as a result of an impact are enormous , ' continues Nick Bailey .
' Nearly one hundred years ago a remote region near the Tunguska River witnessed the largest asteroid impact event in living memory when a relatively small object ( approximately 50 metres in diameter ) exploded in mid-air .
While it only flattened unpopulated forest , had it exploded over London it could have devastated everything within the M25 .
' Our results highlight those countries that face the greatest risk from this most global of natural hazards and thus indicate which nations need to be involved in mitigating the threat . '
After Rush Limbaugh referred to Iraq war veterans critical of the war as “ phony soldiers , ” the CEO of Clear Channel Communications , the parent company of Mr. Limbaugh 's syndicator , Premiere Radio Networks , received a letter of complaint signed by 41 Democratic senators .
Mr. Limbaugh decided to auction the letter , which he described as “ this glittering jewel of colossal ignorance , ” for charity , and he pledged to match the price , dollar for dollar .
On Thursday night , Mr. Limbaugh , the conservative radio talk show host , said he thought the letter would bring in as much as $ 1 million .
He was wrong .
When the eBay auction closed yesterday afternoon , the winning bid was $ 2.1 million .
It is the largest amount ever paid for an item sold on eBay to benefit a charity .
The money will go to the Marine Corps - Law Enforcement Foundation Inc. , a nonprofit organization in New Jersey that provides scholarships and other assistance to families of marines and federal law enforcement officials who die or are wounded in the line of duty .
Mr. Limbaugh is a director of the organization , which had total revenues of $ 5.2 million last year .

Mr Hayden staunchly defended " special methods of questioning "
Gen Hayden said programmes such as extraordinary rendition produced what he said was irreplaceable intelligence .
Under the programme , terror suspects are transported to secret prisons in countries with less stringent interrogation rules .
Mr Hayden , speaking in Chicago , said the leads gained justified rendition .
" The irreplaceable nature of that intelligence is the sole reason why we have what I admit freely is a very controversial programme . "
The CIA had produced thousands of intelligence reports from the " fewer than 100 hardened terrorists " detained since 2002 , Mr Hayden told the Chicago Council on Global Affairs .
' Water - boarding ' controversy
His comments came as President George Bush 's nominee for US attorney general came under fire for his position on interrogation techniques .
Michael Mukasey was grilled by the Senate Judiciary Committee
Nominee Michael Mukasey condemned one technique , water - boarding , as " repugnant " and possibly " over the line , " but declined to explicitly rule it out as torture , saying he could not speculate on classified procedures .
Water - boarding simulates drowning by immobilizing a prisoner with his head lower than his feet and pouring water over his face .
Leading Democrats in the Senate have threatened to block Mr Mukasey 's confirmation if he does not explicitly rule out water - boarding as illegal .
When asked to comment about Mr Mukasey 's statement , Mr Hayden avoided a clear answer .
" Judge Mukasey can not nor can I answer your question in the abstract .
I need to understand the totality of the circumstances in which this question is being posed before I can give you an answer , " he said .
Of all the graphs in The State of Web Development 2006 / 2007 report that SitePoint and Ektron published recently , the one that stood out the most to me was the one showing the platform currently being used by developers planning to start using Ruby on Rails :
It was n’t the fact that the graph shows PHP developers to be likely to start using Rails — this makes sense , as someone is more likely to experiment with another open source platform if they ’re already using another open source platform — it was the fact that PHP developers are more than three times as likely to start using Rails , even more so than Java developers !
This surprised me , because it ’s the Java developers that the Rails movement is targeting ( note : purely my own observation , based on the Rails tagline of being able to write “ real - world applications with joy and less code than most frameworks spend doing XML sit-ups ” ) .
To a Java programmer , Rails might well look like a much simpler way to achieve the same result .
But to a PHP developer who is only used to hacking together small apps ?
So here ’s the question : do PHP coders know what they ’re getting in for ?
Not to suggest that all PHP developers are burrowing away in an unstructured manner ( we all know there are plenty of PHP frameworks these days that provide MVC separation and other similar benefits to Rails ) , but I wonder how many PHP developers are actually using them .
Looking at some of the code out there , my guess is less than half .
Java programmers on the other hand are already more disciplined , if only by the fact that a standard at least exists for structuring Java web apps .
So are the PHP developers who are keen to move to Rails the disciplined developers , for whom Rails may be a natural fit ?
Or are they the hacks , who have yet to embrace any structure in their web apps , but are dazzled by the various beautifully designed Rails apps , and impressed by the charisma of Rails ’ leading evangelist ?
My guess is that it ’s the latter , and my message if you ’re eager to jump ship : be prepared to feel disoriented .
I ’m currently midway through editing SitePoint ’s upcoming Ruby on Rails book , and while spending so much time in Ruby - land has definitely been good fun , there ’s no question that coding in Ruby requires a completely different mindset .
Once you ’ve made the shift , things become quite intuitive and almost a pleasure to write .
But if your previous experience with object oriented programming is just the square - peg - in - a - round - hole approach that PHP provides , Ruby can be quite a headspin .
A good headspin — like the buzz from riding a roller - coaster — but a headspin nonetheless .

Image Compression : Seeing What 's Not There
Posted September 2007 .
In this article , we 'll study the JPEG baseline compression algorithm ...
David Austin
Grand Valley State University
david at merganser.math.gvsu.edu
The HTML file that contains all the text for this article is about 25,000 bytes .
That 's less than one of the image files that was also downloaded when you selected this page .
Since image files typically are larger than text files and since web pages often contain many images that are transmitted across connections that can be slow , it 's helpful to have a way to represent images in a compact format .
In this article , we 'll see how a JPEG file represents an image using a fraction of the computer storage that might be expected .
We 'll also look at some of the mathematics behind the newer JPEG 2000 standard .
This topic , more widely known as data compression , asks the question , " How can we represent information in a compact , efficient way ? "
Besides image files , it is routine to compress data , video , and music files .
For instance , compression enables your 8 gigabyte iPod Nano to hold about 2000 songs .
As we 'll see , the key is to organize the information in some way that reveals an inherent redundancy that can be eliminated .
In this article , we 'll study the JPEG baseline compression algorithm using the image on the right as an example .
( JPEG is an acronym for " Joint Photographic Experts Group . " )
Some compression algorithms are lossless for they preserve all the original information .
Others , such as the JPEG baseline algorithm , are lossy -- some of the information is lost , but only information that is judged to be insignificant .
Before we begin , let 's naively determine how much computer storage should be required for this image .
First , the image is arranged in a rectangular grid of pixels whose dimensions are 250 by 375 giving a total of 93,750 pixels .
The color of each pixel is determined by specifying how much of the colors red , green and blue should be mixed together .
Each color component is represented as an integer between 0 and 255 and so requires one byte of computer storage .
Therefore , each pixel requires three bytes of storage implying that the entire image should require 93,750 3 = 281,250 bytes .
However , the JPEG image shown here is only 32,414 bytes .
In other words , the image has been compressed by a factor of roughly nine .
We will describe how the image can be represented in such a small file ( compressed ) and how it may be reconstructed ( decompressed ) from this file .
The JPEG compression algorithm
First , the image is divided into 8 by 8 blocks of pixels .
Since each block is processed without reference to the others , we 'll concentrate on a single block .
In particular , we 'll focus on the block highlighted below .
Here is the same block blown up so that the individual pixels are more apparent .
Notice that there is not tremendous variation over the 8 by 8 block ( though other blocks may have more ) .
Remember that the goal of data compression is to represent the data in a way that reveals some redundancy .
We may think of the color of each pixel as represented by a three - dimensional vector ( R , G , B ) consisting of its red , green , and blue components .
In a typical image , there is a significant amount of correlation between these components .
For this reason , we will use a color space transform to produce a new vector whose components represent luminance , Y , and blue and red chrominance , C b and C r .
The luminance describes the brightness of the pixel while the chrominance carries information about its hue .
These three quantities are typically less correlated than the ( R , G , B ) components .
Furthermore , psychovisual experiments demonstrate that the human eye is more sensitive to luminance than chrominance , which means that we may neglect larger changes in the chrominance without affecting our perception of the image .
Since this transformation is invertible , we will be able to recover the ( R , G , B ) vector from the ( Y , C b , C r ) vector .
This is important when we wish to reconstruct the image .
( To be precise , we usually add 128 to the chrominance components so that they are represented as numbers between 0 and 255 . )
When we apply this transformation to each pixel in our block
we obtain three new blocks , one corresponding to each component .
These are shown below where brighter pixels correspond to larger values .
Y C b C r
As is typical , the luminance shows more variation than the the chrominance .
For this reason , greater compression ratios are sometimes achieved by assuming the chrominance values are constant on 2 by 2 blocks , thereby recording fewer of these values .
For instance , the image editing software Gimp provides the following menu when saving an image as a JPEG file :
The " Subsampling " option allows the choice of various ways of subsampling the chrominance values .
Also of note here is the " Quality " parameter , whose importance will become clear soon .
The Discrete Cosine Transform
Now we come to the heart of the compression algorithm .
Our expectation is that , over an 8 by 8 block , the changes in the components of the ( Y , C b , C r ) vector are rather mild , as demonstrated by the example above .
Instead of recording the individual values of the components , we could record , say , the average values and how much each pixel differs from this average value .
In many cases , we would expect the differences from the average to be rather small and hence safely ignored .
This is the essence of the Discrete Cosine Transform ( DCT ) , which will now be explained .
We will first focus on one of the three components in one row in our block and imagine that the eight values are represented by f 0 , f 1 , ... , f 7 .
We would like to represent these values in a way so that the variations become more apparent .
For this reason , we will think of the values as given by a function f x , where x runs from 0 to 7 , and write this function as a linear combination of cosine functions :
Do n't worry about the factor of 1 / 2 in front or the constants C w ( C w = 1 for all w except C 0 = ) .
What is important in this expression is that the function f x is being represented as a linear combination of cosine functions of varying frequencies with coefficients F w .
Shown below are the graphs of four of the cosine functions with corresponding frequencies w .
w = 0 w = 1 w = 2 w = 3
Of course , the cosine functions with higher frequencies demonstrate more rapid variations .
Therefore , if the values f x change relatively slowly , the coefficients F w for larger frequencies should be relatively small .
We could therefore choose not to record those coefficients in an effort to reduce the file size of our image .
The DCT coefficients may be found using
Notice that this implies that the DCT is invertible .
For instance , we will begin with f x and record the values F w .
When we wish to reconstruct the image , however , we will have the coefficients F w and recompute the f x .
Rather than applying the DCT to only the rows of our blocks , we will exploit the two - dimensional nature of our image .
The Discrete Cosine Transform is first applied to the rows of our block .
If the image does not change too rapidly in the vertical direction , then the coefficients should n't either .
For this reason , we may fix a value of w and apply the Discrete Cosine Transform to the collection of eight values of F w we get from the eight rows .
This results in coefficients F w , u where w is the horizontal frequency and u represents a vertical frequency .
We store these coefficients in another 8 by 8 block as shown :
Notice that when we move down or to the right , we encounter coefficients corresponding to higher frequencies , which we expect to be less significant .
The DCT coefficients may be efficiently computed through a Fast Discrete Cosine Transform , in the same spirit that the Fast Fourier Transform efficiently computes the Discrete Fourier Transform .
Quantization
Of course , the coefficients F w,u , are real numbers , which will be stored as integers .
This means that we will need to round the coefficients ; as we 'll see , we do this in a way that facilitates greater compression .
Rather than simply rounding the coefficients F w,u , we will first divide by a quantizing factor and then record
round ( F w, u / Q w, u )
This allows us to emphasize certain frequencies over others .
More specifically , the human eye is not particularly sensitive to rapid variations in the image .
This means we may deemphasize the higher frequencies , without significantly affecting the visual quality of the image , by choosing a larger quantizing factor for higher frequencies .
Remember also that , when a JPEG file is created , the algorithm asks for a parameter to control the quality of the image and how much the image is compressed .
This parameter , which we 'll call q , is an integer from 1 to 100 .
You should think of q as being a measure of the quality of the image : higher values of q correspond to higher quality images and larger file sizes .
From q , a quantity is created using
Here is a graph of as a function of q :
Notice that higher values of q give lower values of .
We then round the weights as
round ( F w, u / Q w, u )
Naturally , information will be lost through this rounding process .
When either or Q w,u is increased ( remember that large values of correspond to smaller values of the quality parameter q ) , more information is lost , and the file size decreases .
Here are typical values for Q w , u recommended by the JPEG standard .
First , for the luminance coefficients :
and for the chrominance coefficients :
These values are chosen to emphasize the lower frequencies .
Let 's see how this works in our example .
Remember that we have the following blocks of values :
Y C b C r
Quantizing with q = 50 gives the following blocks :
Y C b C r
The entry in the upper left corner essentially represents the average over the block .
Moving to the right increases the horizontal frequency while moving down increases the vertical frequency .
What is important here is that there are lots of zeroes .
We now order the coefficients as shown below so that the lower frequencies appear first .
In particular , for the luminance coefficients we record
20 - 7 1 - 1 0 - 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 - 2 1 1 0 0 0 0 ... 0
Instead of recording all the zeroes , we can simply say how many appear ( notice that there are even more zeroes in the chrominance weights ) .
In this way , the sequences of DCT coefficients are greatly shortened , which is the goal of the compression algorithm .
In fact , the JPEG algorithm uses extremely efficient means to encode sequences like this .
When we reconstruct the DCT coefficients , we find
Original Reconstructed Y C b C r
Reconstructing the image from the information is rather straightforward .
The quantization matrices are stored in the file so that approximate values of the DCT coefficients may be recomputed .
From here , the ( Y , C b , C r ) vector is found through the Inverse Discrete Cosine Transform .
Then the ( R , G , B ) vector is recovered by inverting the color space transform .
Here is the reconstruction of the 8 by 8 block with the parameter q set to 50
Original Reconstructed ( q = 50 )
and , below , with the quality parameter q set to 10 .
As expected , the higher value of the parameter q gives a higher quality image .
Original Reconstructed ( q = 10 )
JPEG 2000
While the JPEG compression algorithm has been quite successful , several factors created the need for a new algorithm , two of which we will now describe .
First , the JPEG algorithm 's use of the DCT leads to discontinuities at the boundaries of the 8 by 8 blocks .
For instance , the color of a pixel on the edge of a block can be influenced by that of a pixel anywhere in the block , but not by an adjacent pixel in another block .
This leads to blocking artifacts demonstrated by the version of our image created with the quality parameter q set to 5 ( by the way , the size of this image file is only 1702 bytes ) and explains why JPEG is not an ideal format for storing line art .
In addition , the JPEG algorithm allows us to recover the image at only one resolution .
In some instances , it is desirable to also recover the image at lower resolutions , allowing , for instance , the image to be displayed at progressively higher resolutions while the full image is being downloaded .
To address these demands , among others , the JPEG 2000 standard was introduced in December 2000 .
While there are several differences between the two algorithms , we 'll concentrate on the fact that JPEG 2000 uses a wavelet transform in place of the DCT .
Before we explain the wavelet transform used in JPEG 2000 , we 'll consider a simpler example of a wavelet transform .
As before , we 'll imagine that we are working with luminance - chrominance values for each pixel .
The DCT worked by applying the transform to one row at a time , then transforming the columns .
The wavelet transform will work in a similar way .
To this end , we imagine that we have a sequence f 0 , f 1 , ... , f n describing the values of one of the three components in a row of pixels .
As before , we wish to separate rapid changes in the sequence from slower changes .
To this end , we create a sequence of wavelet coefficients :
Notice that the even coefficients record the average of two successive values -- we call this the low pass band since information about high frequency changes is lost -- while the odd coefficients record the difference in two successive values -- we call this the high pass band as high frequency information is passed on .
The number of low pass coefficients is half the number of values in the original sequence ( as is the number of high pass coefficients ) .
It is important to note that we may recover the original f values from the wavelet coefficients , as we 'll need to do when reconstructing the image :
We reorder the wavelet coefficients by listing the low pass coefficients first followed by the high pass coefficients .
Just as with the 2 - dimensional DCT , we may now apply the same operation to transform the wavelet coefficients vertically .
This results in a 2 - dimensional grid of wavelet coefficients divided into four blocks by the low and high pass bands :
As before , we use the fact that the human eye is less sensitive to rapid variations to deemphasize the rapid changes seen with the high pass coefficients through a quantization process analagous to that seen in the JPEG algorithm .
Notice that the LL region is obtained by averaging the values in a 2 by 2 block and so represents a lower resolution version of the image .
In practice , our image is broken into tiles , usually of size 64 by 64 .
The reason for choosing a power of 2 will be apparent soon .
We 'll demonstrate using our image with the tile indicated .
( This tile is 128 by 128 so that it may be more easily seen on this page . )
Notice that , if we transmit the coefficients in the LL region first , we could reconstruct the image at a lower resolution before all the coefficients had arrived , one of aims of the JPEG 2000 algorithm .
We may now perform the same operation on the lower resolution image in the LL region thereby obtaining images of lower and lower resolution .
The wavelet coefficients may be computed through a lifting process like this :
The advantage is that the coefficients may be computed without using additional computer memory -- a 0 first replaces f 0 and then a 1 replaces f 1 .
Also , in the wavelet transforms that are used in the JPEG 2000 algorithm , the lifting process enables faster computation of the coefficients .
The JPEG 2000 wavelet transform
The wavelet transform described above , though similar in spirit , is simpler than the ones proposed in the JPEG 2000 standard .
For instance , it is desirable to average over more than two successive values to obtain greater continuity in the reconstructed image and thus avoid phenomena like blocking artifacts .
One of the wavelet transforms used is the Le Gall ( 5,3 ) spline in which the low pass ( even ) and high pass ( odd ) coefficients are computed by
As before , this transform is invertible , and there is a lifting scheme for performing it efficiently .
Another wavelet transform included in the standard is the Cohen - Daubechies - Fauraue 9/7 biorthogonal transform , whose details are a little more complicated to describe though a simple lifting recipe exists to implement it .
It is worthwhile to compare JPEG and JPEG 2000 .
Generally speaking , the two algorithms have similar compression ratios , though JPEG 2000 requires more computational effort to reconstruct the image .
JPEG 2000 images do not show the blocking artifacts present in JPEG images at high compression ratios but rather become more blurred with increased compression .
JPEG 2000 images are often judged by humans to be of a higher quality .
At this time , JPEG 2000 is not widely supported by web browsers but is used in digital cameras and medical imagery .
There is also a related standard , Motion JPEG 2000 , used in the digital film industry .

Losing a laptop to a spilt glass of wine can be a very frustrating experience , particularly when said wine is of the cheap Rosé variant , as was the embarrasing case with this writer 's late laptop .
Well , one group of kindly DIY technology authors have assigned their noggins to the problem , and have created a post with an accompanying video which shows exactly what to do if you accidentally spill some red on your keyboard .
Apparently , the best policy is to act fast -- just like the pretty , pretty , pretty good salt and club soda solution for carpet and upholstery spills -- by pouring off the excess liquid onto a towel , opening up the laptop , washing it under tap water , rinsing it under distilled water , and then leaving it out to dry .
A quick reassemble later and the laptop should be back in working condition : but for how long ?
Also , if you do watch the video after the break , bear in mind that the music track is a loud variant of " Kung Fu Fighting , " which seems to have been chosen purely for the line " and they did it with expert timing . "
Sigh .
See ewe ... sheep really can come in many colours
Critics say altering the words of the traditional nursery rhyme is an example of political correctness gone too far .
But the charity running the nurseries , Parents and Children Together ( Pact ) , said the move was educational , not motivated by racial concerns .
Pact said children were encouraged to use a wide range of words in songs .
Baa , baa , black sheep ,
Have you any wool ?
Yes sir , yes sir ,
Three bags full ;
One for the master ,
And one for the dame ,
And one for the little boy
Who lives down the lane
Baa Baa Black Sheep
" Pact has established that children sing a variety of descriptive words in the nursery rhyme to turn the song into an action rhyme , " the charity said in a statement .
" They sing happy , sad , bouncing , hopping , pink , blue , black and white sheep etc and they also exchange boy and girl at the end of the rhyme .
" This encourages the children to extend their vocabulary and use up some energy . "
While the words have been altered at two Oxfordshire nurseries - the Abingdon Family Centre and the Sure Start Centre in Sutton Courtenay - other nurseries in the area have not taken such steps .
" We sing Baa Baa Black Sheep and Baa Baa White Sheep because that 's reality , that 's what the children see in the fields and it encourages them to look around them , " said Jill Edge , from the Sunshine Centre in Banbury , north Oxfordshire .
" Realistically , they are not going to see rainbow sheep in the fields .
There are much better ways of addressing these issues . "
In 2000 , a warning that the nursery rhyme Baa Baa black sheep should not be taught in schools because it was " racially offensive " was scrapped .
The guidelines by education chiefs at Birmingham City Council were dropped after black parents condemned the advice as ridiculous .
Eleven years ago , researchers discovered a quirk in consumers ’ thinking about prices : they acted as if low digits were farther apart than higher ones .
For example , consumers behaved as if there were more of a gap between three and four than between eight and nine .
Image
A recent paper in the Journal of Consumer Research builds on that notion by examining people ’s responses to sale prices for fictional items , focusing on their reactions to differing right - hand digits in price figures .
The paper was written by Keith S. Coulter and Robin A. Coulter , professors at Clark University and the University of Connecticut , respectively .
There 's a pattern I 've noticed among those who achieve great things in their lives – whether it 's Tiger Woods winning his 60th title or Roger Federer 's dominance on the courts , Bill Gates ' mastery of software business and now philanthropy … and so on .
No , it 's not thinking positive , having a purpose , setting goals — though in many cases these things are true .
In fact , this odd behavior is quite hidden and is so powerful , I 'm finding breakthroughs in areas I could n't ever seem to make proress on before .
It has turned my thinking around 180 - degrees and the results are proving quite phenomenal .
This is going to sound strange , but the pattern of behavior is …
Not Accepting Reality !
Be careful , I 'm not trying to say that they do n't understand or get a feeling for what the normal definition of reality is , just that they have developed a personality ( or were born with it – a debate for another post ) , that allows them to completely ignore society 's definition of normal without the built - in need the rest of us have to accept and chase the current definition of reality .
Often , I would meet these people and they would engage me in a conversation where they talked about something in the future as if it were simple , with nothing standing in the way .
Now , I would sit there in a state of disbelief wondering how it was possible for them to NOT see the dozens of obstacles that stood in their way to achieve their desired goal —
They would only consider achieving what they wanted , I could only consider all of the obstacles that stood in the way to achieving that end result .
Guess how others perceived us when we were together ?
He was the visionary and I was the complainer .
He had passion and ' looked ' like a natural leader , I was seen as negative – not a team player .
Why could he take such a simple , unrealistic approach to this situation when it was obvious there were all kinds of landmines awaiting – could it be he lacks intelligence ?
Was that it – he must be stupid !
Quite the opposite .
Instead , it turns out that high achievers do not accept the current reality but have instead built their own reality .
Think about how powerful this concept is .
When you are stuck dealing with petty complaints , bumps along the way , fires that spring up , and spend all of your energy toward overcoming hurdles , the high achiever simply glosses over these in a fashion that they are almost NOT REAL so they do n't affect them .
To you or I , a setback may seem to be insurmountable – to the high achiever who has chosen to set his or her own reality , they are already IN their new reality which is characterized by achieving an even loftier goal .
These are the people that can take hit after hit , only to rebound immediately after with no obvious impact .
Living a life where you acknowledge , but do NOT accept reality and instead , set your own reality allows you to limit stress , become much more visionary , become a stronger leader and achieve amazing things in your life without all of the hangups the rest of us experience living according to the " normal " definition of reality .
Think about this – do you know anyone at work or in relationships that seems to be a dreamer – that sets out to achieve things without the smallest sense of whether it is possible or not ?
I bet you do know someone , and now you know that by NOT accepting reality , you can grow your personal development by leaps and bounds .

Presidential candidate Stephen Colbert gave an interview to Tim Russert this morning on Meet The Press and in typical Colbert fashion , he lays out his agenda and plan to lose the race .
Russert questions him , tongue in cheek , on some of the more controversial statements from his new book and talks to him about his now infamous appearance at the 2006 White House Correspondents Dinner , his obsession with Richard Nixon , his one - time goal to be a cult leader , and asks him if he would consider asking Sen.
Larry Craig to be his running mate .
The Greek parliament voted unanimously to make the information contained in the Bad Arolsen archive public .
Greece is the last of the archive 's 11 governing countries to approve amending the treaty governing the Nazi-era documents .
France voted in favor of the changes last week , and the US , Israel , Britain , Belgium , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , Poland , Germany and Italy agreed to the amendments earlier this year .
Much of the digital information kept in the archive has already been transferred to national Holocaust repositories in countries such as the US and Israel , but previously this information was only available to Holocaust survivors and their families .
The digital transfers should be completed by the end of 2007 , officials said .
Eventually , the information will also be made available to the public via the Internet .
The archives , which is overseen by the International Tracing Service ( ITS ) -- an arm of the Red Cross -- consist of up to 100 million digital pages of information .
This is divided into separate collections covering detention records , forced and slave labor , and displaced persons as well as an index containing around 17 million names .
Firsthand documentation
The archive 's contents can help educate people about the Holocaust
The archive in Bad Arolsen north of Frankfurt helps tell the individual stories of some of the six million Jews who were murdered by the Nazis .
Survivors of Nazi concentration camps have used information stored in Bad Arolsen to claim pensions and get compensation .
In addition , families have combed the archives in search of information about what happened to loved ones during the war .
The archive tells the stories of individuals killed by the Nazis
The United States led the campaign to open the archives to researchers and the general public , arguing that it needs to happen before the last Holocaust survivors die .
Ambassador J. Christian Kennedy , the U.S. special envoy for Holocaust issues , has spearheaded efforts to open the archive to the public .
" This is an enormously important evolutionary process , " Kennedy told the Associated Press in a telephone interview .
" We have now come to the end of the political and diplomatic part of the process , " he said from Thessaloniki , where he was meeting with Greek officials and representatives of the Jewish community .
Painting a picture of the Holocaust
The information will be sent to national Holocaust repositories
With its Gestapo reports , victim testimonials and other firsthand sources , the archive provides an amazing amount of information about the minutiae of life and death in World War II concentration camps .
The archive materials are so complex that for the time being , people will still have to rely on the archivists , Kennedy said .
" But it is a step toward searchable , digital databases that will be very important , " he said .
Experts hope historians and descendants of victims can use the information to get a better understanding of what happened to individuals during the Holocaust .
Police Juice Up on Steroids to Get ' Edge ' on Criminals Police on tough beats are increasingly turning to steroids to cope with fear .
Oct. 18 , 2007  --
Matthew , who asked that his name be changed for this article , had experimented with steroids in college .
But it was n't until an enraged criminal swung a crowbar at his fellow officer that he knew he had to buff up on the job .
A six - year veteran of a Pennsylvania police force patrolling an area encroached upon by urban crime , Matthew and his partner struggled for nearly seven minutes to subdue the crazed youth , who was high on PCP and had another officer in a head lock .
Soon after that close call , Matthew turned to illegal anabolic steroids for both strength and self - esteem , a decision for which he paid a heavy price .
Two years later , in 2005 , he was caught and forced to resign .
He spent 23 days in jail .
Matthew 's case is just one example in an increasing trend among urban police officers working tough beats .
In New York City this week six police officers are being investigated for allegedly using illegal prescriptions to obtain anabolic steroids for bodybuilding .
According to law enforcement experts , Matthew is the prototypical steroid user — in his 30s , white and worried about competing .
In Matthew 's case , he was trying to stay on top of a job that constantly forced him to face younger and stronger criminals .
" I look back on that and other scuffles , and I was not nearly as tough and strong as I once was , " said Matthew , now a 33 - year - old single father .
" It scared me to think how easily things could go wrong , " said Matthew .
" I kept thinking I am only getting older , and the criminals will always be young .
I was looking for an edge . "
' Juicing ' Across the Country
From Boston to Arizona , police departments are investigating a growing number of incidents involving uniformed police officers using steroids .
So - called " juicing " has been anecdotally associated with several brutality cases , including the 1997 sodomizing of Haitian immigrant Abner Louima in New York City .
Anabolic steroids are synthesized male sex hormones that promote muscle mass .
When prescribed legally , medical steroids are used to treat growth problems in children , anemia and chronic infections like HIV .
Without a prescription , the use of anabolic steroids is illegal .
Listed as a Schedule III substance along with morphine , opium and barbiturates , they can be just as psychologically addictive and dangerous .
Very little data are available on the number of adults who illegally use steroids , according to the federal Drug Enforcement Agency , because most abusers end up in private doctors ' offices for depression or suicidal tendencies .
A common side effect of steroid use is violent , aggressive behavior that can contribute to poor judgment and even police brutality , according to medical experts .
Gene Sanders , a Spokane , Wash. , police psychologist , estimates that up to 25 percent of all police officers in urban settings with gangs and high crime use steroids — many of them defensively .
" How do I deal with people who are in better shape than me and want to kill me ? " said Sanders , who worked as a street cop in Los Angeles in the 1970s and saw steroid use soar in the 1990s .
Steroid use is on the rise , and not just among weight lifters and other athletes .
An estimated 2.7 percent of all high school seniors have used steroids at least once , according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse , many of them women .
In the police community , cultural acceptance of bodybuilding and access to online suppliers make it easier for officers to obtain steroids .
Officers Propelled by Fear
" Some of it is real and some of it is imagined on the part of the officers involved : fear , anxiety , wanting to do a better job , " said Sanders , who consults with physicians across the country as director of the Police Stress Institute .
The temptation to find a " quick fix " is always present , said Sanders .
Several older studies have placed police officers at the " bottom of the fitness scale , " below firefighters and outranked by inmates , he said .
Typically , departments " turn a blind eye , " to steroid use , according to Sanders .
The International Association of Police Chiefs Association did not return calls for comment , but at least one of those being investigated in the New York City probe is a high - ranking officer , according to local news reports .
" The body feels really comfortable and likes [ the hormones ] , " said Sanders .
" You feel better , feel more buff and feel more able to take on the bad people . "
Indeed , Matthew felt the positive effects of steroids after only three months ' use .
His weight jumped from 170 pounds to 192 pounds , and he was able to bench - press 300 pounds from 225 pounds .
His habit — 500-700 milliliters a week injected into his deltoids , thighs or buttocks — cost about $ 500 a month .
" I was incredibly stronger , " he said .
" I never felt healthier in my life and woke up full of energy and felt it throughout the day .
Never once did I feel out of control . "
" Maybe I was a little edgier , " he added .
" The kids got me upset a little more and I was less tolerant , but never to the point where I would physically do anyone harm . "
' More Is Better '
Still , said Sanders , steroid users tend to think " more is better " and do n't know where to draw the line as they build bulk .
Users typically combine steroids with a combination of drugs in a phenomenon known as " stacking , " and " cycle " on and off the drugs to avoid building a tolerance .
" They can go from being calm and collected to raging bulls , " said Sanders .
" There is also a subcategory of these folks like the crazy Vietnam veteran .
They think that if they appear crazy , people will back off . "
But even short - term use of steroids can cause damage to brain tissue , which never grows back .
And according to the National Institute of Drug Abuse , steroid abuse can cause internal organ damage , jaundice and high blood pressure .
Men can also experience testicle shrinkage and breast development .
Women can see side effects of facial hair growth , menstrual changes and a deepened voice .
Teenagers may stop growing .
Research shows extreme mood swings can occur as a result of taking steroids , leading to violence .
Users may suffer irritability , delusions and impaired judgment .
" When they are used in excess , the individual crosses the line from adding muscle mass to rage or aggression or suicide , " said Dr. Robert S. Gotlin , director of orthopaedic and sports rehabilitation at Beth Israel Medical Center in New York City .
" Suppose that person is carrying a gun . "
" The results are so profound , and it 's so accessible , " he said .
In Matthew 's case , he obtained steroids from a friend .
At least 10 other officers in his 75 - member department were users when he started taking them .
Steroids are readily accessible at gyms — " if you know the right people " and online , he said .
" When I first became a police officer , I worked out , " said Matthew .
" As I got older , I ran into bigger kids on the street who were into all kinds of drugs .
They do n't feel the pain .
I thought if I could , I could have something to make me feel better about myself , I could handle it . "
Model to Children Now
Because of his felony conviction , Matthew , who had no previous criminal record before his arrest , will never be able to work in law enforcement again .
But he has n't touched steroids since , primarily because he wants to be a role model to his children , who are 4 and 7 .
Though he is proud of his 10 years of police work , Matthew now understands how steroids can create monsters out of police officers who are not responsible .
" There are rage issues , " he said .
" And there 's the mental part of it that makes you think you are invincible . "
MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - Former Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev criticized the United States , and current President George W. Bush in particular , on Friday for sowing disorder across the world by seeking to build an empire .

Gorbachev , who presided over the break - up of the Soviet Union , said Washington had sought to build an empire after the Cold War ended but had failed to understand the changing world .
“ The Americans then gave birth to the idea of a new empire , world leadership by a single power , and what followed ? ” Gorbachev asked reporters at a news conference in Moscow .
“ What has followed are unilateral actions , what has followed are wars , what has followed is ignoring the U.N. Security Council , ignoring international law and ignoring the will of the people , even the American people . ”
Russian President Vladimir Putin and Bush say they are friends but ties have been strained by U.S. plans for a missile defense shield in Europe , disagreements over Kosovo and the war in Iraq , and competition for allies in the former Soviet Union .
Many Russians view the United States as a rival and enemy .
Gorbachev , 76 , who left politics after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union , is deeply unpopular in Russia .
Though feted abroad , he is blamed in Russia for sinking the Soviet empire and plunging millions into poverty .
“ When I look at today ’s world I have a worrying feeling about the growth of world disorder , ” he said .
“ I do n’t think the current president of the United States and his administration will be able to change the situation as it is developing now -- it is very dangerous , ” he said .
Gorbachev said Russia ’s hopes of building stronger ties with Washington had waned in the face of a series of U.S. administrations interested in building an empire .
“ It is a massive strategic mistake : no single centre can command the entire world , no one , ” he said .
“ Current America has made so many mistakes . ”
He said the U.S. administration was apparently unable to adapt to a swiftly changing world and had ignored -- or was unable to see -- the rise of Brazil , Russia , India and China as economic heavyweights .
Treaties limiting the number of nuclear weapons should be observed , he said , adding that officials in Washington should be wary of sparking a new arms race .
Gorbachev , who became Soviet leader in 1985 , battled against the conservative wing of the Communist Party to push through reforms that dismantled the one - party system , freed the press and ended restrictions on religion .
The father of “ glasnost ” ( openness ) said he supported Putin ’s policies but that the pro-Kremlin United Russia party had eroded democratic rights .
He said Putin ’s “ seriousness ” as a leader would be assured if he left office according to the constitution .
Putin says he will leave office in 2008 after two terms in office .

Dominic LoTempio leans back in his deck chair and surveys the grounds of the second home he rented for the year : a sleek , modernist two - bedroom in a gated retreat 30 minutes north of Buenos Aires .
Ten feet from his toes , a stiff putting - green - style lawn continues uninterrupted to the border of a heated , infinity - edge pool and then eases down to a man -made lake with a dock for canoeing .
And half a mile down the street is the field where he takes off and lands his paraglider .
“ It ’s like living in the Hamptons , ” he says .
Except the whole thing costs just $ 1,400 a month .
It ’s these economics that have led LoTempio , a 31 - year - old former senior vice - president of bond sales with the Belgian banking conglomerate KBC , to step off the Wall Street treadmill and join the growing number of New Yorkers who ’ve taken their year - end bonuses or real - estate winnings and relocated to Buenos Aires .
“ I came to live life as a rich guy , ” he says .
In fact , he lives like a Master of the Universe — not like some Wall Streeter who checked out with enough to be technically , barely , a millionaire , but like the young , loaded Hollywood version .
“ I remember when I decided to move , ” says LoTempio .
Working in bond sales , he was keenly aware of the various financial crises around the world .
“ Thailand , Indonesia , Malaysia , Korea , Japan , Russia , Mexico .
Every time this would happen , the office would go bananas .
Things would be melting on our screens .
And somebody would look at their Bloomberg and say , ‘ You know what , fuck , I could move to Thailand , convert my dollars to baht , live like a millionaire , and never have to work again .
But nobody would ever go .
They were trapped .
I was the only one who was young and single and could do it . ”
And he knew he had to make a change — he was already beginning to feel the physical effects of an all - work lifestyle .
He started seriously considering expat life when Brazil devalued .
“ It hit me :
That ’s it .
I could live there . ”
But just as he was getting ready to quit , Argentina crashed .
If he ’d needed a sign , this was it .
The culture and climate of Buenos Aires seemed “ more American ” to him .
He could imagine feeling at home there .
In October 2003 , he traded in 6:15 a.m. wake - up calls and 60 - hour workweeks for his expat fantasy : late nights , no work , massive spending power , and beautiful Argentine women .
LoTempio still thinks of it in Wall Street terms .
“ Lifestyle arbitrage , ” he calls it .
Since Argentina ’s 2001 financial collapse put a two - thirds - off sign on everything in B.A. , the city has become a playground for Europeans and Americans looking to relax or reinvent .
The exact number of transplants is hard to pin down — under Argentina ’s lax immigration regulations , many expats live illegally for years on 90 - day tourist visas — but signs point to a boom .
The number of Americans registered with the embassy jumped nearly 13 percent between 2004 and 2005 .
There are other cities across the globe that offer relatively inexpensive living , of course : Mexico City , Rio de Janeiro , São Paulo , Bangkok .
But potential expats generally cross them off the list because prices have started rising ( Mexico City ) or they ’re too culturally different ( Bangkok ) or because the rich - poor conflict makes being a “ rich American ” too dangerous ( Brazil ) .
Buenos Aires mixes a potent cultural cocktail : low prices , a familiar - but - different ( and sexy ) vibe , good weather , great food , and the chance to start over .
For New Yorkers , the draw is particularly strong .
“ I find Buenos Aires to be as much like New York as you ’re going to get in the world , ” says LoTempio .
The architecture , the culture , even the neighborhoods make New Yorkers feel comfortable :
The expensive boutiques of Recoleta are reminiscent of Fifth Avenue , the family - heavy quiet of Barrio Norte is the Upper West Side , the vaguely tough San Telmo is the East Village of a decade ago , the hippest restaurant - and - boutique zone is called Palermo Soho , and Las Cañitas is a mini–meatpacking district .
“ People try to tell you where to go , and you say , ‘ No , I already know , ’ ” says Alfred Abraham , a 32 - year - old New York doctor who recently finished a four - month trip to Buenos Aires in preparation for a move there .
What better place to take your year - end bonuses or real - estate winnings and turn a life of subway rides and work into one of multiple homes , fancy restaurants , and weekend jaunts to Uruguay ’s chic Punta del Este ?
I should know , I did it .
In May 2005 , after our Lower East Side co-op rose 75 percent in value in two years , my wife and I left New York in a quest to live cheaply , learn a second language , and work on long - dormant book projects .
Life in B.A. is n’t perfect by any means .
The litany of expat complaints includes one - ply toilet paper ; slow restaurant service ; strikes that shut down subways , airlines , or highways nearly once a week ; and , as LoTempio puts it , an “ embargo on cool shit ” like plasma TVs , which arrive six months late and cost twice as much .
But from a wallet angle , it ’s hard to deny the attractions of Buenos Aires .
The average price for a square foot of Manhattan real estate — about $ 970 — will get you ten times the space in a tony neighborhood here .
( LoTempio ’s tricked - out pied - à - terre on the trendiest street in B.A. set him back just $ 68,000 . )
And a three - course meal including rack of lamb and a nice bottle of wine will only set you back about $ 40 a head at Sucre , one of the best restaurants in town .

But the point is n’t just cutting costs and living Soho lite .
It ’s about deciding that maybe you were n’t meant to be a banker / lawyer / consultant / ad exec after all .
That maybe , if you just had the time and brain space and a good exchange rate , you could make it big with that business or artistic project you could never start in New York .
With half a chance , you could be who you really are , and if you tried , you could be huge .
That ’s one of the most appealing parts of the Buenos Aires fantasy — that you can become the Player , the Mogul , the Entrepreneur , without paying the dues that New York would require .
LoTempio had n’t planned to work when he moved to Buenos Aires , but after early retirement got boring , he started thinking about doing something productive , but not too productive .
The answer seemed obvious .
“ Clearly , one of the attractions here for single 20 - or 30 - year - old guys is the girls , ” he says .
In fame - struck Buenos Aires , bikini - clad women will chat with anyone who might be able to get them into a magazine or , better yet , on television .
And what would be better in high - definition television than “ stunning footage of exotic travel , girls , bikinis , beaches ? ” thought LoTempio .
“ If I ’m a miserable , overworked single guy back in the U.S. , that would be my dream to flick on . ”
So LoTempio and a few friends ponied up $ 20,000 and partnered with Tamir Lotan , the co-host of an extreme - sports show on Fox Sports en Español , to launch MariposaHD , an Internet - distributed fashion - and - babes - and - travel show that sells the escapist fantasy LoTempio is living .
“ What would you do if you could just walk away from your life , start over , and do whatever you want ? ” teases the Website .
Whether the show is a success is sort of beside the point .
It ’s already meant raised profiles and can ’t - lose opening lines for its creators .
LoTempio spends a lot of his time scouting for beautiful “ talent ” at clubs or on the beach , and there is n’t a velvet rope he is n’t ushered past .
“ We ’re just meeting all these celebrities and models .
And I was like , This is something I ca n’t do in the U.S.
I ca n’t go to parties and hang out with movie stars , and I ’m doing it in Argentina , and I do n’t know these fucking people . ”
He almost ca n’t believe his good fortune .
“ If I go back and tell my friends what I ’m doing , that ’s more than every guy ’s dream , ” he says .
“ That ’s the icing on the cake . ”
Steven Blackman knows all about making sure people in New York are aware of How Great His Life Is in Buenos Aires .
He visits the city every six weeks to tell them about the dinners at Sucre , the drinks at Gran Bar Danzon , the fashion events in Punta .
Not to mention the fact that he pays $ 800 a month to rent two adjacent apartments from the son - in - law of Susana Giménez , Argentina ’s surgically enhanced version of Oprah .
Or that his maid comes five days a week : “ She cleans over the same places every day , even though nobody ’s been there .
It ’s insanity .
But it ’s something like 10 pesos a day .
I ’ll deal with it . ”
In May 2004 Blackman was a burned - out Mercer Delta organizational consultant in a Canali suit .
After sixteen years in the business , “ I was so done , ” he says .
“ And they were done with me too . ”
So , with a six - figure golden handshake that pushed his net worth “ easily into the sevens , ” he sublet his Central Park West one - bedroom , hung up his Canalis , and left town .
The idea to move to Buenos Aires had come to him while he was riding an exercise bike at New York Sports Club — and happened to be pedaling next to a former Meredith Corporation exec named John A. Kuhn who wanted to start South America ’s first city magazine .
Blackman , Kuhn , and their partners put up about $ 250,000 to launch Buenos Aires Metrópolis , a Spanish - language magazine that features fashion spreads , articles about surviving the single life , and news from New York .
Last fall , after the first issue hit the newsstands , Blackman and his cohorts threw a well - attended launch party complete with a half - nude lingerie show ( required at all top B.A. parties ) .
At the end of the event , Blackman mounted the stage to cheers and whistles .
“ Más , más , más , ” he hooted into the microphone .
“ It does n’t take long here , ” he tells me later .
“ I ’m a bigger fish here after a year than I ’d ever be in New York . ”
That status bump to Big Fish — instant glamorization — is a typical thrill for expats used to being ants in Manhattan , says Margaret Malewski , author of GenXpat : The Young Professional ’s Guide to Making a Successful Life Abroad .
“ You may be middle class back home , and suddenly you ’re dealing with the upper classes , ” she says .
“ That ’s one of the tough things when you come back : You become a nobody again . ”
Blackman ’s friend Heather Willens agrees with that assessment .
“ He ’d be nothing in New York , ” she says , without cruelty .
Her tone says she could be talking about herself , me , or any other expat .
“ It ’s just so hard in New York .
There are a million smart , interesting , wealthy people .
Whereas here , it ’s easy to be the most sophisticated person in the room because , like , you ’ve gone to Thailand . ”
Willens herself did n’t move to become a big fish ; her goal is to be able to live “ half fucking around ” without skating too close to the economic edge .
In New York , she had a fashionable job at Daniel Johnnes Wines that offered her plenty of free meals but a salary under $ 60,000 a year .
She could n’t save any money , and she could never splurge .
“ I never realized how much I was treading water , ” she says .
Since moving to Buenos Aires in December 2004 , the 34 - year - old wine broker can afford to work a more relaxed schedule — her commission on one recent sale was more than the average annual salary in Argentina — and indulge hobbies that were out of her reach in New York .
Her $ 500 - a- month two - floor apartment is decorated with paintings from Recoleta galleries that , at prices below $ 600 , allow her to be a collector of sorts .
And she pays about $ 55 a month for her membership in the swank Buenos Aires Lawn Tennis Club , which is akin to a $ 20,000 - a- year Westchester country club .
There are opportunities to be found in Buenos Aires ’s bargain - basement pricing — especially when it comes to real estate .
B.A. offers New Yorkers the chance to turn back the clock on the boom .
Property values have gone up 14 percent here in the last year , but nice two - bedrooms still go for under $ 100,000 .
Mark Morgan - Perez , a 34 - year - old Wall Streeter turned nonprofit real - estate developer , moved to Buenos Aires after clearing more than $ 400,000 on the sale of his 16 Park Avenue one - bedroom .
Now he ’s looking to transform his tidy profit into Trump - style moguldom .
“ A one - bedroom apartment in New York can become two buildings , three buildings here , ” he says .
He ’s in the process of buying a four - bedroom house with a terrace and garage for $ 170,000 .
He plans to turn it into a bed - and - breakfast or boutique hotel .
But it was n’t just the economic opportunities that attracted Morgan - Perez to Buenos Aires ; it was the lifestyle .
For one thing , he was drawn to the city ’s gay life , which he describes as more “ mixed ” than New York ’s , not defined by the “ Chelsea gym - bunny scene and the East Village snobby scene . ”
( In fact , B.A. is a very progressive city — the first in Latin America to approve a civil - union law . )
But he was also looking for the work - life balance that had eluded him in New York .
“ I want to sit around and play piano and collect rent and read .
Life in New York had become too much of a grind .
Everybody ’s time is so precious .
People are so wrapped up in careers , ” he says .
“ Here , I can invest and do projects and make money and not have it dominate my life . ”
And like all the New York expats I spoke with , he has no desire to go back .
As Dominic LoTempio puts it , “ Doing what I ’ve done is an interesting study in happiness .
Psychologists will tell you changing your station in life does n’t change your level of happiness .
But am I happier now than I was getting up at a quarter after six every morning ?
The answer is yes . ”

Catholic Nun Organization Calls For Bush / Cheney Impeachment Posted by Pile ( 6242 views ) [ E - Mail link ] [ Beating Dead Horses ]
A progressive group of U.S. nuns has called on Congress to impeach President Bush and Vice President Cheney because of their roles in the war in Iraq .
“ The National Coalition of American Nuns is impelled by conscience to call you to act promptly to impeach President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney for ... high crimes and misdemeanors , ” the group wrote in a letter written on behalf of its board members .
The letter says that impeachment is warranted for their “ deceiving the public under the false pretense that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction ” and “ destroying ” the reputation of the United States and the good will of other nations .
“ The time for impeachment is now — before the example of George W. Bush ’s regime is set in stone , ” they wrote .
“ Future generations will thank you for preserving the freedom of our nation and its relation to the entire human community . ”
The coalition was founded in 1969 for individual nuns dedicated to issues of social justice and human rights .
The letter was approved during a mid-August meeting of the board , held in Chicago .
During that same meeting , the board unanimously adopted statements opposing all war and affirming peacemaking efforts .
“ Rather than continuing support of a just - war theory , a more compassionate church would oppose all war and teach peacemaking skills for all levels of government and interpersonal conflict resolution , ” the statement reads .
The board also adopted statements pledging to work to “ moderate the impact we make on planet Earth , ” and supporting nuclear disarmament and relief efforts for the poor in Africa .

BONNEVILLE SALT FLATS , Utah --
For 51 weeks , Roosevelt Lackey refuses to ride his motorcycle .
He tunes it in his garage at his farm in Lapeer County .
He changes parts .
He tests and checks and rechecks every system on the bike , with the help of his best friend and fellow General Motors Corp. retiree , Ken Sperry .
In fact , Lackey , who is 70 and black , and Sperry , who is 60 and white , spend almost every Saturday morning building and rebuilding motorcycles designed to break world speed records .
Advertisement
And they have for decades .
Their children are like brothers , their wives , like sisters .
Never do the former engineers contemplate taking their creations for a spin on the street .
" Too dangerous , " Lackey likes to say .
It is an interesting perspective , considering that two weeks ago , on the first morning of Bonneville Speed Week , he rocketed into the white - hot horizon on one of the most inhospitable swaths of land in the United States , attempting to make history .
He was a ghost , a mirage , a blur folded into a machine hurtling down the Salt Flats at 190 m.p.h .
Sperry could n't see him -- nor could anyone else on the team , for that matter .
But they knew he was out there .
Static - filled voices crackled through the radio .
" Quarter - mile : 186.192 .
...
One mile : 187.724 . ...
Two mile : 189.822 . ...
Three mile : 189.983 ... "
By the time Lackey slowed down , he was more than 4 miles away from the start line .
Sperry and the rest of their team jumped into trucks and what they call the mule -- an all - terrain vehicle with a motorcycle trailer -- seconds after Lackey took off .
Their job was to retrieve Lackey and the bike .
As Sperry and the team closed in on him , Lackey appeared first as a speck on the horizon .
A minute later , he began to take human form .
He was kneeling , helmet removed .
Sweat slipped down his forehead .
It had been nearly 12 months since he rode a motorcycle .
Still , he knew in his bones that he had n't broken a world record .
He stood and began to shed his leather racing suit .
" Sorry , guys , " he said when Sperry finally approached .
Sperry shrugged it off .
It was the first race .
They had the rest of the week to get faster .
Back in the truck , driving to pit row , Lackey felt his adrenaline ease up as the air - conditioning washed over him .
" Now I 'm OK , " he said .
" Now I 'm OK . "
He always liked getting that first run out of the way .
His body needed to reacquaint itself with those g- forces , with the catapult into the salty white abyss .
The run down the track had lasted less than 2 minutes .
It was the most liberating 2 minutes of his life .
How it all began
HOW FAST CAN HE GO ?
With adrenaline pumping , Roosevelt Lackey of Dryden whizzes along a salty track in Utah on Aug. 13 on an MV Agusta signd by workers at the factory .
His average speed was 193 m.p.h. , but he hit 195 for a world record .

With adrenaline pumping , Roosevelt Lackey of Dryden whizzes along a salty track in Utah on Aug. 13 on an MV Agusta signd by workers at the factory .
His average speed was 193 m.p.h. , but he hit 195 for a world record .
( DIANE WEISS / DFP ) Racers , speed - junkies , engineers and mechanics have been chasing immortality on the Salt Flats for almost 100 years .
A daredevil topped 140 m.p.h. in 1914 in a Blitzen - Benz .
By the late 1940s , the flat , seemingly infinite horizon was drawing speed - seekers from around the world .
At Bonneville , a man pushed through 300 , 400 , 500 and 600 miles an hour , strapped into cars that resembled rockets on wheels .
Eventually , Bonneville Speed Week was born , and for one week every summer , teams racing souped - up cars and motorcycles descend on the flats to see how fast they can go .
Three - and 5 - mile courses are marked off with orange cones , like construction lanes on an interstate .
A volunteer timing association sets the rules -- how vehicles are classified -- and clocks the drivers .
The salty surface turned out to be the perfect track .
Geology made that possible .
A body of water the size of Lake Michigan once covered much of Utah .
Some 15,000 years ago , it spilled into Red Rock pass in Idaho , leaving behind a dreamy , salty , exquisitely flat surface .
Even now , Lake Bonneville 's old shoreline is etched into the mountains that surround the salt basin , a reminder to drivers that they are racing at the bottom of an inland sea .
" It 's humbling , " Lackey said .
He has made the cross-country trek from southeastern Michigan since 1969 .
He is drawn by the scope , the possibility .
THE KING OF SPEED : Lackey , 70 , left , celebrates with Ken Sperry , 60 , of Clinton Township , his friend , crew chief and former General Motors work buddy .

" Astronauts go to the moon to walk on a surface that looks similar to this , " he said .
" We can drive 30 hours . "
It is a long way from Ecorse , where he grew up and where he bought his first motorcycle -- a Triumph -- at 16 .
Back then , Rosey , as everyone calls him , rode the streets , navigating Downriver neighborhoods .
He rode among the mortals for 25 years , until one day in 1978 , when a car pulled in front of him .
After that , he swore off all but racetracks and drag strips , man -made or otherwise .
The Salt Flats , he said , are " so much safer than riding on the street , it 's pathetic . "
Lackey met Sperry in the late 1960s .
The racer already had owned and sold a gas station in Detroit and worked as a mechanic at a Triumph dealership .
Still , he had things to learn about bikes .
Sperry , who was only 20 at the time and 10 years younger , had things to teach Lackey , including how to build a fuel injector .
Sperry got his start as a mechanic at a Ford dealership in Highland Park , his hometown .
After serving three years in Vietnam , he took a job at a local fuel - injection supply company .
In 1972 , he went to work at General Motors ' Tech Center in Warren .
The next year , he told his managers about his buddy .
Sperry and Lackey worked their way into engineering jobs -- back then , you did n't need a college education .
" And it worked out for everybody , " Sperry said .

The combination of Lackey 's feel for riding and Sperry 's feel for eliciting horsepower quickly turned into victories .
Then into records .
Before long , the two of them -- along with a few other locals obsessed with bikes -- were heading to any track they could find .
Sometimes , that meant heading south , to places that were n't always so welcoming .
Lackey just ignored it .
There was the bike .
There was the race .
There was Sperry .
There was his team .
Everything else fell away .
Sperry , however , hated the tension .
He remembered one race in Gulfport , Miss . :
" It was tough , " he recalled .
" They were n't real happy with us .
When it looked like we were going to win the race , the promoter of the track came over and said , ...
You probably should n't stick around for the award ceremony .
Just come and see me , and I 'll give you the check and trophy , and you can take off . ' "
It happened more than once .
Blown engines and budding careers at GM's Tech Center were n't stopping them .
Small - mindedness was n't going to , either .
Adrenaline kicks in , takes hold

HISTORY OF THE FLATS The Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah formed when Lake Bonneville , a body of water comparable to Lake Michigan , began evaporating and spilling into the Red Rock pass into Idaho about 15,000 years ago .
The Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah formed when Lake Bonneville , a body of water comparable to Lake Michigan , began evaporating and spilling into the Red Rock pass into Idaho about 15,000 years ago .
The prehistoric Lake Bonneville covered much of North America 's great basin region .
This included most of present - day Utah .
The salty lake bed left behind stretches of roughly 100 square miles .
Until racing enthusiasts discovered the area , it was known mostly for its harsh climate .
The salt flats were named after explorer and fur trapper Benjamin Louis de Bonneville , a French - born officer in the U.S. Army .
Administration of the flats falls to the federal Bureau of Land Management , part of the Department of the Interior .
HOW THE RACE GOT ITS START
In 1896 , a cross-country bicycle - race organizer named W..D. Rishel stumbled upon the Bonneville Salt Flats as he mapped out a course from New York to San Francisco .
He convinced Fred Johnson to test - drive his Packard there in 1911 .
Three years later , he helped bring daredevil Teddy Tezlaff to the flats to race his Blitzen - Benz .
Tezlaff set a world record of 141 m.p.h .
By the late 1940s , the Bonneville Salt Flats were luring speed - seekers from around the world .
Drivers broke the 300 , 400 , 500 and 600 m.p.h. barriers at the flats .
Now , for one week every August -- weather permitting -- gearheads descend into the prehistoric salt basin to test the limits of their machines .

EYES ON THE PRIZE : Roosevelt Lackey -- also known as Rosey -- focuses on the task ahead moments before a race .
The Ecorse native is drawn to the salty course because of its scope and possibility .
He has made the trek from his home in southeast Michigan since 1969 .

( DIANE WEISS / DFP )
Over the decades , the racer and the engineer tried all manner of amateur programs -- drag racing , street - racing , land - speed - record racing .
They raced half the weeks in a year .
But as they got older , the travel and commitment grew cumbersome .
In the late 1990s , they agreed to just do Bonneville .
It was only a week .
They could convene at Lackey 's place in Dryden or Sperry 's place in Clinton Township .
They would eat breakfast , work at each other 's side for a few hours and depart with homework assignments to be completed by the following Saturday .
It was an entire year of calculating and prepping for the Salt Flats .
Sperry found it mesmerizing .
" Without the data , " he said , " you are just another jerk with an opinion . "
The flats demanded problem solving .
" Can you recover ? " Sperry said .
" In the heat ?
With no support equipment ? "
It was the greatest automotive laboratory in the world , populated by geeks , enthusiasts , gearheads and adrenaline junkies .
It was the perfect confluence of plate tectonics and human ingenuity .
" You can just run wide - open and leave it there , " Lackey said .
For most of their racing lives , their passion meant building and riding Triumphs .
Then serendipity hit last year .
And the pair found themselves encamped on pit row next to another adrenaline junkie from back home .
A new plan of attack
Gary Kohs runs a model - making business in Royal Oak .
Trains .
Planes .
Ships .
He also collects high - end , high - performance Italian motorcycles .
Last year , he took his MV Agusta to the Salt Flats .
He wanted a record .
He and his team could barely break 170 m.p.h .
As it happened , his pit was next to Lackey and Sperry's .
They were n't having a good week , either .
They blew two engines .
" But they never gave up , " Kohs said .
His neighbors used parts from the blown engines to fashion a third .
It sputtered and fought them , but managed to get the Triumph down the flats at 150 m.p.h .
Witnessing this , Kohs asked them for help with the Agusta .
Sperry suggested adding weight near the seat .
The addition worked , and Kohs coaxed 8 miles an hour more from his bike .
After that , Kohs , 63 , a whirlwind from Birmingham whose mind turns faster than the crankshaft in his Agusta , decided he had to change his team .
He offered Lackey a ride and Sperry the engine and setup .
Kohs took care of everything else , including planning and paying for the trip , and emblazoning shirts and hats and coffee cups to help with team chemistry .
Most important , Kohs convinced the president of MV Agusta to give him -- and thus by proxy , Lackey and Sperry -- a new , $ 25,000 machine to race on the flats .
So what compelled him to turn over his team and equipment to strangers ?
" It 's about Rosey , " he said .
" He has this friggin ' confidence , this kick - ass ambience .
He knows himself .
And he 's one of the nicest guys you will meet anywhere in the world . "

Experiencing the extreme
The day before racing opened at Bonneville Speed Week , Sperry did n't drink enough water .
Hours of setting up the pit and readying the bikes in the merciless sun and its reflection off the salt sent him to the hospital with heat stroke .
JUBILATION : Teammate Gary Kohs , 63 , of Birmingham lifts Lackey , unable to contain his joy over the racer 's achievement -- a personal best run of 195.53 m.p.h. on Aug. 13 .
" He has this friggin ' confidence , " Kohs says , explaining his admiration .
" And he 's one of the nicest guys you will ever meet anywhere . "

" He has this friggin ' confidence , " Kohs says , explaining his admiration .
" And he 's one of the nicest guys you will ever meet anywhere . "
( DIANE WEISS / DFP ) " I was a little oozy , " he said .
On the morning of the first run , Sperry did n't have much stamina .
Lackey , Kohs and the rest of the team tried to fill the void .
Lackey took it the hardest .
As the day passed , Sperry slowly regained his strength .
The team set a record that afternoon .
Race week was falling into place .
By Sunday morning , the second day of racing , Lackey and the team were back in line to break the record they had set Saturday afternoon .
They arrived as the sun rose over the mountains .
A couple of hours later , as blue sky settled over the white desert floor , Lackey tucked into the Italian machine and disappeared .
For 2 minutes , he heard nothing .
He felt nothing .
He was floating as the tactile life drifted away .
When he let off the throttle and descended back into full consciousness , he knew he had taken that particular kind of machine where no other man had .
He had pushed past 195 m.p.h. , a world record for 1000 cc stock bikes .
When the team reached him with the official news -- his bike has no speedometer -- he unleashed a primordial yell .
The end of the line
The next night , after a light day of racing -- no other competitor sniffed the record -- Kohs took the team to a shrimp and prime rib buffet in nearby Wendover , a dusty casino and trailer park town that straddles the Utah - Nevada border .
They settled into a casino restaurant lit by neon the color of Pepto Bismol and blue Kool - Aid .
Toward the end of the meal , between bites of chocolate cheesecake and banana crème pie , they began recounting the week 's highlights , including Rosey 's spectacular 195 m.p.h. run .
In only a few days , the guys had collected moments they would share with one another for years .
They talked of gears and bores and strokes and horsepower .
They talked of speed and heat and tradition .
They had come for competition and for car culture and for open spaces .
Every morning , for a week , hundreds of racers and builders lined up to test their theories and their guts .
Every night , guys like Lackey , Sperry and Kohs gathered around dining tables to relive the day .
" Everybody is the same out here , " Kohs explained .
Everybody who kneels down to run their fingers through the salt feels the same moisture , remnants of a prehistoric lake that stretched to infinity .
" Environmental hell , " Sperry said , " but engineering heaven . "
A few days after the team had set the record with the 195 m.p.h. run , a competitor on a Suzuki broke it .
The team was devastated -- until it began driving east .

From maddragon :
Subject : Rush Limbaugh ... Phony Soldier ad . I just saw your ad on FOX news regarding Rush Limbaugh ... Phony Soldier .
Get your facts straight you traitorous bunch of fucking cowards .
You let multiple Liberals slam our Country , Soldiers and President on a regular basis during a time of war , yet target one who supports all these , twist his words to suit your cowardly Socialist Liberal agenda and start a smear campaign to destroy his credibility .
I Know what he said and who he was referring to .
Your organization has taken this out of context and aired a blatant lie .
I hope you get sued into oblivion for slander , defamation of character , false advertising , and all other offences available .
I have informed several departments of FOX news that I will be contacting their sponsors and boycotting their products if FOX airs your slimy ad again .
I will do this to ANY and ALL media outlets I see this crap on .
I suggest you all denounce your U.S. citizenship and get the hell out of this Country .
Move to China or North Korea ...
Some place more suitable to your ilk .
The email above is pretty standard .
Some of Rush ’s fans ' emails are well - written .
Some are poorly written .
But the one thing they usually have in common is the idea that the veterans of VoteVets.org are somehow cowardly , that we ’re traitors , and that we ’re not " real soldiers . "
I wonder where they get that idea ?

I just went on your communist web site , unreal , I am retired military and you are a " P.O.S. " a mater of fact crap smells better than you !
Your website " Vote Vets " is despicable .
I am not a huge Rush fan , like I use to be , I am a huge Michael Savage & Glenn Beck fan !
I did hear the audio last week and those traitor Senators have been speaking of & Rush said nothing that offended me nor my friends !
I have been to the middle east a few times and the phony soldier Rush had mentioned was a traitor piece of crap , who could n't finish basic training !
I have heard and seen the audio numerous times and how the
far left such as you , who probably never spent a day in the military could put out such trash is unbelievable !
My friends , family and relatives who have been or are still in the military are not buying
it .
You need to get a life , if you really cared about are soldiers you would be supportive !
Because people who spent more than a few days in the military could never think the things we think at VoteVets.org .
You found us out , Cliff !

Subject : ( no subject ) I have just read everything on your web site and I 'm accusing you of telling untruths , lies and inuendo as truth .
That despicable Wesley Clark 's comments about Rush Limbaugh 's comments on the radio were not accurate .
Rush did n't call every vet that disagreed with the war " a phony soldier " he called Jason Betts , who was " washed out " of the Army after only 44 days " a phony soldier " .
It never matters to you Left wing liberal bastards about the truth , but it appears that the control of the future of this country is at stake and like it or not , we may have to resort to the same tactics as used back in 1860 when this country went to war with itself , North vs South , only this time it 's Conservative vs Liberal and I 'm ready to join in as soon as the fireworks start .
Just keep up the constant lying and sooner or later it will catch up with you and all those in Move On.org and Media Matters will get what you so richly deserve .

You can be against the war or any war , but I have one question ...
Why did you all sign up ?
For free college money ?
Wesley Clark is an embarrassment to the uniform , he claims that Rush has been demeaning the troops for years ????
Who the hell do you people get your information from ???
Hillary Clinton !
No , Wendy .
We signed up to participate in a global wild goose chase for weapons that did not exist , so that we could then take part in an effort to spark a vicious civil war , while our main enemy , Osama bin Laden , lived happily ever after in the Waziri tribal region of Afghanistan and Pakistan .
Make sense ?

Your guy on Fox News this morning obviously has never listened to Rush .
Your little hit squad obviously really does n't care about the facts when the dupes on the news shows give you face time for ratings .
I listened to Rush for 15 years and he is the biggest patriot and supporter of the troops I have ever heard .
You jump on a statement HE NEVER SAID !
And rant and rave and sell a bag of shit to poor trusting vets that unknowingly continue the lie .
Why ?
For money ?
For power ?
Plus you can be a patriot withot having served .
Lok at the millions who support the USO and other organizations that help the troops and vets .
I do both .
I am a patriot but I have never worn the uniform .
According to your standards how's your girl Hillary going to be a patriot and posibly commander in chief without never having served ?
You also can be a traitor like John Murtha who has served in uniform .
Was n't Benedict Arnold an officer and a hero before he betrayed his country ?
Murtha speaks treason and poisons our efforts around the world .
You are completely dishonest on the top three points .
But you know that and chuckle as you walk off the set and see all the hits on your web site .
Therefore you are doubly despicable .
You can easily be proved wrong ..
Just take a poll of the troops and vets on who 's the bigger patriot , Rush or Murtha .
Okay .

The last temptation of Gore .
Will he run ?
Though former Vice - President Al Gore has repeatedly insisted he has no plans to run for president in 2008 , many refuse to count him out of the running , NBCs  The Today Show reported this week .
Gore , who continues to make waves with his global campaign to raise awareness about climate change , has come under increased scrutiny in recent months as the presidential race begins to pick up steam .
 Some believe Al Gore would be the perfect choice , a mix of the rock star appeal of Barak Obama and the political experience and money raising muscle of Hillary Clinton ,  said NBC News  John Yang .
Despite not being in the race , Yang pointed out , Gore stands in third place among Democratic contenders in recent polls at 16 percent .
Private security companies in Iraq have come under political attack after mercenaries for Blackwater USA fired upon unarmed Iraqi civilians in Baghdad 's Nisour Square , killing 17 and wounding 24 .
Angry Iraqis , including collaborationist officials of the U.S. - backed occupation regime , have complained that swaggering rent - a- soldiers operate with callous disregard for the safety of Iraqis .
A 27 - year - old ex-paratrooper for Blackwater even stands accused of -- but faces no possibility of prison time for - shooting , while in a drunken frenzy , a man who was guarding Iraqi Vice President Adil Abd- al - Mahdi .
A media pile - on has ensued .
Condi Rice , whose State Department is a major Blackwater client , ordered cameras mounted on vehicles in the company 's convoys .
The House of Representatives , normally so divided it can't agree that torture is bad or that sick kids need doctors , came together as one -- 389 to 30 -- to pass a bill that would subject mercenaries to criminal prosecution when they blow away foreigners in a war zone .
Now the presidential contenders are weighing in .
" We cannot win a fight for hearts and minds when we outsource critical missions to unaccountable contractors , " said Barack Obama .
" To add insult to injury , these contractors are charging taxpayers up to nine times more to do the same jobs as soldiers , a disparity that damages troop morale . "
Obama may be onto something .
Why pay for employed by private corporations , when you can get the same cowboy antics at one - ninth the price ?
Pundits and politicians are scapegoating Blackwater and other private security firms to help sell the continuation of the Iraq War .
Some mercenaries shoot at anything that moves .
They endanger locals with crazy practices like speeding down jammed highways on the wrong side .
( Memo to Secy .
Gates : Ban screenings of " Ronin . " )
Rein in these Rambo wannabes or fire them , the argument goes , and Iraqi commuters will warm to their friendly public - sector replacements in the United States Armed Forces .
A thousand roses will bloom .
Soon we 'll be awash in that staple of postwar gratitude , Iraqi war brides .
But it is n't just Blackwater .
Official U.S. soldiers are no less stupid or vicious or trigger - happy than their private counterparts .
In 2003 U.S. troops manning a checkpoint in Karbala repeatedly fired a 25 - millimeter cannon at a Toyota containing 13 people trying to flee the fighting .
At least seven people , including five children age five or under , were killed .
" You just f--- ing killed a family because you did n't fire a warning shot soon enough , " a captain radioed to his platoon leader moments later .
Checkpoint shootings of innocent civilians became a daily occurrence , due to rules of engagement that placed more value upon the lives of American troops than those of the Iraqis they were supposedly there to liberate .
Often the " checkpoints " were invisible to Iraqi motorists .
American soldiers would hide in buildings near an intersection and fire " warning shots " at the engine blocks of approaching vehicles .
Assuming that they were being ambushed by bandits , Iraqi drivers would floor the accelerator .
Soldiers then treated them as potential suicide bombers , turning them into Swiss cheese .
" Many U.S. officials describe ... the military 's standard practice of firing at onrushing cars from their checkpoints in Iraq , " reports The Washington Post .
" We fired warning shots at everyone , " said one soldier .
" They would speed up to come at us , and we would shoot them .
You could n't tell who was in the car from where we were .
We found that out later .
We would just look in and see they were dead and could see there were women inside . "
That 's what happened to Italian intelligence agent Nicola Calipari .
After obtaining the release of a journalist from insurgents who had held her hostage for one month , Calipari accompanied her to a checkpoint near the Baghdad airport .
U.S. soldiers opened fire .
The warning shot missed the engine block .
Calipari died ; the reporter was wounded .
Though their Iraqi driver insists that he was driving their Toyota Corolla ( memo to travelers to Iraq : consider a Honda ) under 25 miles per hour , the Pentagon said he was " speeding . "
A lot of professional U.S. soldiers have screamed their contempt for Iraqis since the beginning of the war .
" For almost a year , " reported the East Bay Express in 2005 , " American soldiers stationed in Iraq and Afghanistan have been taking photographs of dead bodies , many of them horribly mutilated or blown to pieces , and sending them to [ a pornographic website ] .
American soldiers have been using the pictures of disfigured Iraqi corpses as currency to buy pornography . "
If you 've just eaten , stop reading now .
The Express describes the photos : " A man in a leather coat who apparently tried to run a military checkpoint lies slumped in the driver 's seat of a car , his head obliterated by gunfire , the flaps of skin from his neck blooming open like rose petals .
Six men in beige fatigues , identified as U.S. Marines , laugh and smile for the camera while pointing at a burned , charcoal - black corpse lying at their feet . "
There 's more .
" [ A ] person who posted a picture of a corpse lying in a pool of his own brains and entrails wrote , ' What every Iraqi should look like . '
One person posted three photographs of corpses lying in the street and titled his collection ' DIE HAJI [ a racist slur for Iraqis used by U.S. soldiers ] DIE . ' "
Google the Express story .
It gets even uglier .
Blackwater 's hired goons are exempt from prosecution .
So , apparently , are real soldiers .
Atrocity after atrocity goes unpunished or rewarded with a slap on the wrist .
Specialist Jorge Sandoval , 22 , was acquitted of murdering two Iraqis , one on April 27 , the other on May 11 near Iskandariyah , south of Baghdad .
However , a military court - martial found him guilty of planting detonation wire on the first victim to make him look like an insurgent .
If he was innocent , why did he try to cover up the shooting ?
Specialist James Barker , 23 , of the 502nd Parachute Infantry Regiment of the 101st Airborne Division , based in Fort Campbell , Kentucky , admitted that he held down a 14 - year - old Iraqi girl in 2005 while another soldier raped her , then shot her several times in her Mahmudiya home .
He dowsed her with kerosene and set her on fire .
According to CNN , " he was not sure if he penetrated the girl , because he was having trouble getting an erection . "
He and five fellow soldiers also murdered her parents and her 7 - year - old sister .
Thanks to a plea bargain , said The New York Times , " he could be released on parole in 20 years . "
The same crime committed in the U.S. would earn life in prison , or the death penalty .
A Marine Staff Sergeant charged in the massacre of 24 people in Haditha , The New York Times reports , will not face murder charges because investigating civilian deaths is n't a military priority .
" Prosecuting the Haditha case has posed special challenges because the killings were not comprehensively investigated when they first occurred , " says the Times .
" Months later , when details came to light , there were no bodies to examine and no Iraqi witnesses to test . "
The 2005 Express piece contains this tragicomic gem : " [ Disrespect for Iraqi deaths ] could become an international public - relations catastrophe . "
Internationally , the " war porn " scandal was merely one of a string of stories that confirmed our reputation as brutal neocolonialists .
Here in the United States , however , " supporting the troops " means turning a blind eye to their actions -- or blaming them on private contractors .

Over the next few weeks and months , civil libertarians and consumer advocates will wage a battle against the telecommunications companies and the Bush administration to preserve some semblance of privacy rights in Americans ' communications .
Congress will be considering several versions of bills that will , one way or another , expand government access to phone calls and e-mails .
These legislative proposals are complex and in flux , but there are two main issues at the center of the debate that citizens can focus on .
One is whether eavesdropping on millions of Americans simultaneously is acceptable .
The second is whether communications companies should get a free pass for breaking the law by allowing illegal warrantless surveillance of all Americans ' communications .
In the 1960s and '70s , several Supreme Court cases held that citizens can reasonably expect that the government will not eavesdrop on their personal communications without first demonstrating to a court the need for this privacy invasion .
Congress passed the Wiretap Act of 1968 to regulate eavesdropping for law enforcement purposes , and added the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) of 1978 to establish procedures for the president to follow when conducting surveillance for national - security purposes .
FISA established a " secret court " – the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court , or FISC – to review applications for national - security warrants .
These could be obtained merely by showing that the target was an agent of a foreign power .
Targeted surveillance was the order of the day for two primary reasons .
First , the Fourth Amendment prohibits " general warrants , " those which do not specify the names of people to be observed , the inventory of things to be seized , or otherwise fail to narrow the discretion of the officer performing the search .
Second – and it turns out , more importantly – it was prohibitively expensive to perform mass surveillance .
Eavesdropping required paying someone to sit and listen to calls , because storage and voice - recognition technology were not available .
By 2001 , things had changed .
Digital networks , vast storage and powerful computer processing meant that it was now economically feasible to monitor entire networks – including the phone network – using computers , voice recognition and other modern technologies .
The government began pushing to use these new technologies for wide - scale mass surveillance .
The Sept. 11 terrorist attacks also occurred in 2001 .
But while the attacks may have raised the American public 's tolerance for privacy invasions , it was not the sole impetus for mass spying .
The National Security Agency ( NSA ) was pressuring telcos to give it unfettered access to customer calling records seven months before the attacks .
Regardless , Sept. 11 inspired Congress to modify FISA to give national security officers more leeway in hunting down terrorists .
The USA Patriot Act modified FISA in several important ways , but none of them would have allowed the wholesale surveillance of American communications networks the NSA was pushing for behind the scenes .
Despite the missing legal authority , we now know that several telecommunications companies secretly cooperated in the mass diversion of phone calls and e-mails to the NSA .
The New York Times revealed the existence of this warrantless surveillance program in December 2005 .
After this revelation , the Bush Administration admitted it was listening without warrants to known al - Qaida members who called , or were called by , people in the United States .
However , the warrantless wiretapping went much further than that .
A former AT&T engineer by the name of Mark Klein revealed that all internet traffic flowing through AT&T 's backbone was regularly diverted to the NSA .
My employer , the Electronic Frontier Foundation , filed a class action lawsuit against AT&T on behalf of all its customers who had been intercepted without a warrant , as well as those who had had their phone records disclosed in a separate but apparently related program .
A few months later , other class actions against the telcos were filed nationwide .
The attorneys general of several states also began investigations to see whether the communications providers had violated their legal obligations as public utilities .
The federal government has intervened in the litigation to kill all of these cases , alleging that telco cooperation is an official secret and that the lawsuits must be dismissed .
That issue is currently on appeal to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals , although at least one high - level administration official – Mike McConnell , the director of national intelligence – has since confirmed the phone company - government collaboration .
Now the administration is bringing the battle for mass surveillance to Congress .
Just before this summer 's recess , Congress passed the Protect America Act ( PAA ) , which gave the U.S. attorney general and the director of national intelligence the power to authorize surveillance without a court order , so long as the target of that surveillance was reasonably believed to be overseas .
This was a major expansion of executive power from what FISA had allowed .
it also went well beyond what the Bush administration had said it needed :
The president had claimed FISA needed some modest tweaking to allow for efficient eavesdropping on foreign - to - foreign communications that travel through the United States , while leaving the privacy of Americans intact .
The PAA is due to expire in February of 2008 , so Congress is now considering new proposals to replace it .
An admirable goal of well - balanced legislation would be to enable us to detect and fight terrorism , without losing judicial and legislative oversight of the surveillance process .
The Restore Act , which failed to pass the House last week , tried to strike this balance .
It would have permitted warrantless surveillance of foreign - to - foreign communications and put surveillance review back in the hands of the FISC rather than administration officials .
And it would not have immunized phone companies for their illegal behavior .
However , it did allow for " blanket warrants " that would sanction mass , warrantless surveillance of Americans if the purported target was a foreign national .
The problem with such blanket warrants is practical , legal and technical .
On the technical side , the tactic produces far more false positives than we are capable of processing .
Also , warrants for general surveillance are proven vehicles for abuse .
Our Founding Fathers abhorred general warrants , which is why the Fourth Amendment specifically prohibits them , proscribing that " no warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized . "
The potential for abuse is extreme in the case of telecommunications , because the government is capturing and has access to every one of our calls or e-mails as they flow through telco offices , even if it 's not supposed to look at most of it .
The legislation that just cleared the Senate subcommittee and is currently under consideration makes a different mistake .
It would allow the attorney general in a closed - door session to unilaterally absolve any telco accused of illegally intercepting communications .
Communications carriers play an essential role in keeping the government honest about whether it 's eavesdropping on us .
Any working law must provide incentives to these companies to reject requests for unlawful surveillance by imposing liability when they fail to do so , while protecting companies that comply in good faith with valid legal process , just as FISA and the Wiretap Act already do .
It 's not clear why the Senate thinks encouraging secret collusion between a president and a major industry is a good idea .
Telcos accused of violations will donate money to the campaigns of those officials most likely to absolve their bad behavior .
The bill also abandons the substantial oversight role that either Congress or courts could play in ensuring that laws are followed and effective .
My employer , EFF , also objects to telco immunity because it is intended to kill our pending class action lawsuit .
Rather than offering a rational reason for the amnesty provision , the Senate seems to be acting out of confusion .
Feeling left out , Congress said it would not consider amnesty unless the White House disclosed documents that would allow lawmakers to determine what exactly was going on with secret , warrantless surveillance in this country .
Now that the Senate has received some documents , it is ready to pay off the administration for this small , belated courtesy of inclusion , while forgetting to exercise the oversight function that caused the legislators to ask for the information in the first place .
Sen .
Russ Feingold 's office says that the documents show that the surveillance was illegal , a very good reason to refuse any amnesty .
Sen .
Jay Rockefeller , who recently benefited from unusually large campaign contributions from the phone companies , supports amnesty .
As the legislative process plays out , the issues of when to authorize mass surveillance , how to minimize abuses and how to deter unlawful behavior will continue to be major parts of the debate .
The American Revolution was fought in part against the abuses practiced by an unchecked executive power .
Terrorism and new technologies are novel challenges , but the legal techniques developed over the past 200 years – separation of powers , checks and balances , individualized suspicion and special warrants among them – have and will continue to serve us well , if we let them .

Why Are Women More Likely to Be Obese Than Men ?
In almost all countries , women are more likely to be obese than men .
The economists Anne Case and Alicia Menendez set out to learn why , using data collected from a township outside of Cape Town , South Africa .
Here ’s what they determined :
1 . “ Women who were nutritionally deprived as children are significantly more likely to be obese as adults , while men who were deprived as children face no greater risk . ”
2 . “ Women of higher adult socioeconomic status are significantly more likely to be obese , which is not true for men . ”
These two factors , Case and Menendez write , fully explain the difference in female / male obesity rates they found in their sample .
But there is a third point as well :
3 . “ Finally ( and more speculatively ) , women ’s perceptions of an ‘ ideal ’ female body are larger than men ’s perceptions of the ‘ ideal ’ male body , and individuals with larger ‘ ideal ’ body images are significantly more likely to be obese . ”
Although this research was done in a setting far removed from the typical U.S. town or suburb , Case and Menendez ’s findings seem well worth thinking about for anyone here who is trying to fight obesity .
Another issue to explore further might be whether obesity has a large cost for a woman when she is unmarried , but less so when she is married — although one could ask the same question of men .
It is perhaps also worth noting an obvious fact here : Case and Menendez are both women , and have produced here what looks like an important piece of research that concerns women .
Emily
Oster also comes to mind as a woman who does important research concerning women .
Which leads me to wonder :
1 . Do male economists tend to do too little research on women ’s issues ?
2 . If so , should n’t there be many more female economists ?

Simple web service invocation def __getattr__ ( self , method ) :
def method ( _self=self , _method=method , ** params ) :
_method = _method.replace ( " _ " , " . " )
url = HOST + PATH + " ? method=%s&%s&api_key=%s " %
( _method , urlencode ( params ) , self.api_key )
try : rsp = xmltramp.load( url )
except : return None
return _self._parseResponse(rsp )
If you 're not familiar with Python , what 's going on here is a bit of metaprogramming genius .
The __getattr__ makes it so that FlickrClient.foo ( ) automatically means " invoke the Flickr API call foo " , for any API call .
The method ( ) code builds a URL out of the Python method name foo and the parameters the method was invoked with , then does a GET to Flickr .
Because of the consistent naming of the Flickr REST API this all works like you 'd expect .
FlickrClient.py is good software .
It 's a Python library for the 68 methods in the Flickr API in 48 lines of code .
Such parsimony !
Here 's the nut of it :
If you 're not familiar with Python , what 's going on here is a bit of metaprogramming genius .
Themakes it so thatautomatically means " invoke the Flickr API call " , for any API call .
Thecode builds a URL out of the Python method nameand the parameters the method was invoked with , then does ato Flickr .
Because of the consistent naming of the Flickr REST API this all works like you 'd expect .
Parsing the response data is done by passing the Flickr XML to xmltramp , a quick and dirty Python XML binding that does what you want .
The _parseResponse ( ) method ( not shown ) does error handling in four lines .
I love how simple and Pythonic this is .
Data is loosely typed .
API calls are built dynamically .
Everything is so abstract that the library code does n't even have to be updated when new API methods or datatypes are added to Flickr .
Clean , simple , perfect for scripting .
It 's about the exact opposite of SOAP and WSDL where you typically use thousands of lines of generated code to call the service .

WASHINGTON , Dec. 14 — Comets are not all made of interstellar dust and ice , but instead may contain material shot from the heart of the solar system during its tumultuous birth , scientists reported Thursday after examining pristine particles of a comet that were brought back by the Stardust spacecraft .
The evidence suggests that comets did not form in isolation in the outer parts of the solar system as it coalesced from a swirling mass of primal material , the researchers said .
Instead , they said , some of the hot material that formed planets around the Sun seems to have spewed off into distant areas and become a component of distant comets .
“ Many people imagined that comets formed in total isolation from the rest of the solar system ; we have shown that ’s not true , ” said Donald Brownlee , a University of Washington astronomer who is the lead scientist for the Stardust mission .
“ As the solar system formed 4.6 billion years ago , ” Dr. Brownlee said , “ material moved from the innermost part to the outermost part .
I think of it as the solar system partially turning itself inside out . ”

THE Cannon building is the oldest of the mighty office towers that ring the Capitol , housing close to a hundred members of the House of Representatives with their retinues and a score of committee rooms .
It is there , on Monday September 10th , that the latest battle in the long war in Washington , DC , over the conflict in Iraq , is to be played out .
This is a busy and consequential week for America 's Iraq policy .
Monday 's hearing is an unusual combined sitting of the House 's Armed Services and Foreign Affairs committees , to hear the testimony of the American commander in Iraq , General David Petraeus , and America 's ambassador in Baghdad , Ryan Crocker .
On Tuesday the two men will repeat the exercise before the Senate .
And before the end of the week the administration is due to issue a written report on Iraq 's progress towards a set of 18 military and political “ benchmarks ” which , if met , would signify that the country is ready to stand on its own feet .
This report is likely to draw heavily , though not exclusively , on the opinions of the American government 's two senior men in Iraq .
What was designed originally as a simple progress report has evolved into something far more significant : the Petraeus / Crocker testimony is being awaited almost as if it were holy writ .
Yet both sides of the debate are preparing to draw opposite conclusions from whatever General Petraeus and Mr Crocker say .
The president 's supporters are determined to “ stay the course ” and leave Iraq only once victory of some sort has been achieved .
The Democrats ( and a fair few Republicans ) now believe that the war is lost and that America should withdraw before it expends any more blood and treasure on a hopeless cause .
The witnesses may , of course , have a few surprises to spring , but the broad outlines are pretty clear .
General Petraeus will note that the “ surge ” , which has seen an extra 30,000 men deployed in Baghdad and in Anbar province since February , has had a moderate degree of success .
Sectarian killings have fallen sharply , weapons seizures are up , and fewer Iraqi soldiers and police have been killed — although attacks on Americans and American troop casualties have not abated much .
In addition there has been , in part coincidentally but in part because of the surge , a virtual ending of the insurgency in Anbar province , once the most deadly part of the country , as ordinary Iraqis and their tribal leaders have turned in disgust against the foreign al - Qaeda killers in their midst .
Much of this is an argument for continuing an active American involvement in Iraq .
But on the political front the news is much less good .
The “ benchmarks ” report , when it is published , will show almost no progress towards a political reconciliation that could see Sunnis and Shias governing a united country together and sharing its oil revenues in an equitable manner .
Which poses two very tricky questions .
Is political progress possible if General Petraeus continues to keep the killing just about under control ( though it is still , by any reasonable standards , appalling ) ?
And if not , should America head for the exit , or does it have a moral duty to stay on in order to prevent the country slipping into full - scale civil war and bloodshed far worse than anything yet seen ?
This is what Congress and the president will now have to decide .
It is hardly an academic debate .
The original reason both for the “ benchmarks ” report and for this week 's hearings was a compromise between Congress and the president over a supplementary budget allocation for Iraq earlier this year : Congress was thereby putting down a marker that it would not continue to pay indefinitely without results .
But the big battle over money is only just beginning .
September 30th is the end of the fiscal year in America , and by then the main budget , including a defence request of close to $ 650 billion , needs to be passed .
Congress is determined to end the war , using its power of the purse .
The next few days will determine the shape of that struggle .
Robert Jordan , whose opus was vast ,
Had his Wheel of Time turn its last .
With his Eye on the World ,
His Great Hunt was unfurled ,
But the Shadow was Rising too fast .
Thus James Rigney , this fantasy lord ,
Wore a Crown made of spells and of Swords .
But quite fickle is luck ;
At his Heart , Winter struck .
The Knife through his Dreams could n't be ignored .
Yet this Dragon , in print , was Reborn ,
For to finish these books , he had sworn .
Thus his tales still enthrall ,
But when Heaven 's Fires call ,
It is at Twilight 's Crossroads we mourn .
As the Lord of this Chaos he reigned ,
But his Path contained Daggers and pains .
Now the Dragon , al' Thor ,
Shall go questing no more ,
And a Memory of Light 's what remains .

“ When am I ever going to use this info ? ”
That is the burning question lingering quietly in the busy minds of all students .
It could be elementary , middle , high school , or even college … some people arrive at this curious thought earlier than others .
When the time comes , the student naturally wants to see a clear relationship between theoretical educational lessons from class and real world practical application .
At the initial moment of questioning it ’s easy for a student to discredit the theoretical academic lessons , making an assumption that the information is useless outside of the classroom .
“ When will I ever need to do complex factorials or find determinants of multi dimensional matrices ?
Will I ever really need to recite the dates of prominent historical events ? ”
The answer is simple : Maybe you will , and maybe you wo n’t .
The key is to become conscious of the fact that you will never truly appreciate the importance of the knowledge you have learned until the moment you actually need it .
This split - second epiphany of understanding is rather astonishing .
It ’s simply one of the most satisfying experiences in an educational career , the instant it all comes together .
In that silent moment , one makes the clear connection between formal education and real world application .
This moment too comes at different times for different people , but it ’s a brilliant feeling when the childhood world of formal education that most of us live in for nearly 2 decades intersects fluidly with a problem placed before you in adulthood .
Yes , it is impossible to retain every theoretical lesson ever learned .
That ’s just an obvious predicament we must live with .
The important thing is to understand why it was not a waste of time , something I think we all eventually figure out for ourselves .

Venezuela May Eliminate Congress , Lawmaker Vivas Says
Venezuela may eliminate the National Assembly and transfer the powers of congress to community councils , congressman Dario Vivas said .

UK attempts take over of private Muslim schools
September 11 , 2007 17:26 IST
Last Updated : September 11 , 2007 17:27 IST
In a bid to take over private Muslim schools in the country , the British government has offered money to the religious institutions , which largely operate behind closed doors .
Schools Secretary Ed Balls has assured funds to more than 100 private Muslim schools if they become state - run , the Daily Mail reported in London [ Images ] on Tuesday .
' There are 115 or 116 independent Muslim schools and seven maintained Muslim schools .
All of those seven have transferred into the maintained sector from the independent sector .
It should only happen if in the broadest sense the local community wants it .
Where that is what the local community wants , it will provide the capital to make that possible , ' Balls was quoted by the daily as saying .
Warning that minority religions currently did not have enough free faith school places in Britain , he said the religious institutions could definitely become a force for improving community relations
While the government argues that bringing private faith schools into the state system will give ministers greater control over the Muslim schools , opponents said it could entrench segregation .
' Faith schools make existing racial segregation worse and when you adjust for social class their results are no better than community schools , ' Liberal Democrat MP Dr Evan Harris was quoted as saying .
However , Dr Mohamed Mukadam , chairman of the Association of Muslim Schools in the UK , said : " There is demand from the Muslim community for state faith schools but it will take time for this to develop .
In the fullness of time , we will see many more . "
It may be mentioned that a third of England 's [ Images ] 21,000 state schools are faith schools but the vast majority are Anglican or Catholic .
There are 37 Jewish , seven Muslim , two Sikh , one Greek Orthodox and one Seventh Day Adventist .
A Hindu school is due to open next year .
Nearly 15,000 Muslim pupils and 11,000 Jewish ones are currently taught in fee - paid faith schools across Britain .
Moreover , in its report in April , the Commission for Racial Equality had said that the UK was in danger of becoming a ' mini America , ' with schools separated along religious and ethnic lines .
Britain 's segregated schools were a ' ticking time bomb waiting to explode , ' it said .
The forecast called for heavy snow on the route home , so the three pilots who had just flown a covert CIA - sponsored “ extraordinary rendition ” flight were forced to stay an extra night at the Gran Melia Victoria , a luxury hotel overlooking the marina on the island of Majorca .
Up in Room 552 , the pilot who called himself Capt .
James Fairing picked up the phone at 2:28 in the afternoon and dialed his tree - shaded home in a subdivision carved out of pine forests here in Clayton , about 15 miles southeast of Raleigh .
He also called his employer , a North Carolina - based air charter service that long has worked for the CIA .
Fairing ’s copilot , who registered as Eric Matthew Fain , reached for the phone in his room and called a woman back home with whom he owns a 22 - foot speedboat and who also flies missions for the CIA .
The third pilot from the stranded flight carried a U.S. passport issued to Kirk James Bird .
The passport photo shows a balding , middle - age man with a broad smile .
The names they used were all aliases , but The Times confirmed their real identities from government databases and visited their homes this month after a German court in January ordered the arrest of the three “ ghost pilots ” and 10 other alleged members of the CIA ’s special renditions unit on charges of kidnapping and causing serious bodily harm to Khaled Masri , a German citizen of Lebanese descent , three years ago .

Charged under aliases
None of the pilots responded to repeated requests for comment left with family members and on their home telephones .
The Times is not publishing their real names because they have been charged only under their aliases .
Relying on the operatives ’ passport numbers , hotel records , credit card bills and aviation records , German prosecutors are seeking to properly identify the 13 Americans in a high - profile case that has upset relations between Washington and Berlin and caused a political scandal in Germany over whether government officials sanctioned the CIA operation .
Elsewhere in Europe , legal and parliamentary investigations have focused a harsh spotlight on the CIA ’s program to abduct suspected terrorists and ferry them to secret sites for interrogation , operations known variously as “ black renditions ” or “ extraordinary renditions . ”

On Friday , an Italian judge issued arrest warrants for 26 suspected CIA operatives for allegedly abducting a radical Muslim cleric outside his mosque in Milan in February 2003 and delivering him to Egypt , where his lawyer says he was tortured .
The trial is set for June 8 in Milan .
All the Americans charged , including the top two CIA officers in Italy at the time , have departed the country , but Italian law allows defendants to be tried in absentia .
None of the aliases used in Italy match those in the German case , although one of the pilots may have been involved in both incidents .
One former CIA operation officer who was involved in the Italian case at CIA headquarters , speaking on condition of anonymity because the case is classified , said he and his colleagues were increasingly nervous about traveling in Europe for fear of getting swept up in the investigations .
He said he checked with a contact at the Italian intelligence service for reassurance that he would not be arrested .

Seized in error
According to Masri ’s account , he was detained by local authorities while crossing from Serbia into Macedonia on Dec. 31 , 2003 .
Three weeks later , seven or eight men in masks stripped him naked , put him in a diaper and jumpsuit , drugged him and then chained him , spread - eagle and blindfolded , to the floor of a Boeing 737 that flew to Afghanistan on Jan. 24 , 2004 .
German prosecutors say the men in masks were with the CIA rendition team .
At the time , U.S. intelligence authorities believed Masri was involved with radical Islamic groups in Ulm , a city in southern Germany .
Masri was released five months later after undergoing what he described as repeated beatings and other physical abuse in a now - closed CIA - run prison called the Salt Pit in Kabul , the Afghan capital .
U.S. officials have told German authorities that Masri was seized and imprisoned in error because his name is similar to that of a suspected terrorist linked to Al Qaeda .
Flight records show that Aero Contractors , based in Smithfield , N.C. , operated the plane that carried Masri from Macedonia to Afghanistan .
The charter aircraft company has flown scores of sensitive missions for the CIA and has played a key support role in counter - terrorism operations since the Sept. 11 attacks , according to former agency officials .

The three pilots in the Masri rendition case live within a 30 - minute drive of the guarded Aero hangar and offices at the rural Johnston County airport .
Reached by telephone Saturday , Aero official Freddy Pearce declined to discuss any aspect of the company ’s business .
The chief pilot in the Masri case , who used the alias Fairing , called Pearce at his Clayton home during his layover in Spain .
In real life , the chief pilot is 52 , drives a Toyota Previa minivan and keeps a collection of model trains in a glass display case near a large bubbling aquarium in his living room .
Federal aviation records show he is rated to fly seven kinds of aircraft as long as he wears his glasses .
His wife , reached by phone at her office , said her husband had done no wrong .
“ He ’s just a pilot , ” she said .

His copilot , who used the alias Fain , is a bearded man of 35 who lives with his father and two dogs in a separate subdivision .
He called home during a subsequent mission from the Royal Plaza Hotel on the Spanish resort island of Ibiza , according to records collected by Spanish investigators from the Guardia Civil .
The third pilot , who used the alias Bird , is 46 , drives a Ford Explorer and has a 17 - foot aluminum fishing boat .
Certified as a flight instructor , he keeps plastic models of his favorite planes mounted by the fireplace in his living room in a house that backs onto a private golf course here .
His wife declined to comment .
On the flight back to Washington , after the snow had cleared , the rendition team celebrated by ordering 17 shrimp cocktails and three bottles of fine Spanish wine , according to catering invoices obtained by the prosecutors .

The House Judiciary Committee issued subpoenas today for five top aides to President Bush in connection with the developing investigation into the firing of eight U.S. Attorneys :
A House panel today authorized the issuance of subpoenas for top White House and Justice Department aides as it investigates the firing of eight U.S. attorneys last year .
The House Judiciary Committee ’s subcommittee on commercial and administrative law passed by voice vote a motion giving the committee chairman , Rep. John Conyers Jr. ( D - Mich . ) , the power to issue subpoenas for five current and former officials , as well as for “ unredacted documents ” from the White House and Justice Department .
Among the five are Karl Rove , the deputy White House chief of staff , and Harriet E. Miers , the former White House counsel .
In authorizing the subpoena power over the objections of Republican members , the subcommittee rejected an offer by President Bush yesterday to allow the officials to testify under strict conditions .
The White House is demanding limits on the kinds of questions they would answer , opposes having them testify under oath and does not want their testimony to be recorded or transcribed .
Absent an agreement between the White House and Congress , this one act turns what I ’ve got to admit is a confusing “ scandal ” over the firing of a few U.S. attorneys into a Constitutional showdown .
Â President Bush made clear yesterday that the White House would assert executive privilege as a bar to any effort to force Presidential aides to testify under oath .
And , quite honestly , they would have a pretty good argument in their favor if they did .
Presidents have claimed executive privilege , if not by name , since the time of the Jefferson Administration , but it ’s most famous example is the U.S. v. Nixon case , where the Supreme Court ruled that President Nixon had to turn over the tapes of Oval Office conversations sought by the Watergate Special Prosecutor .
At the same time , though , the Court did recognize that some form of privilege does exist :
The Court recognized “ the valid need for protection of communications between high Government officials and those who advise and assist them in the performance of their manifold duties . ”
It noted that “ [ h ] uman experience teaches that those who expect public dissemination of their remarks may well temper candor with a concern for appearances and for their own interests to the detriment of the decisionmaking process . ”
What executive privilege really is , though , is a result of the Seperation of Powers doctrine .
As a the head of a co-equal branch of government , the argument goes , the President has the right to have confidential meetings with his advisors and not fear that those conversations will be divulged to Congress , or to a prosecutor , using their subpoena power .
How far that privilege goes is the answer that Courts have wrestled with since the early 19th Century .
If nothing else , this exceedlingly confusing story could provide the nation with some clarity on this issue .
Canada has urged the US to remove him from its watch list
Syrian - born Maher Arar told a congressional hearing his 10 months in a Syrian jail had been " hell " .
Mr Arar appeared by video link from Canada because he remains on a US government watch list .
A Canadian government inquiry cleared him of any involvement in terrorism .
Syria denies that he was tortured .
Mr Arar appeared on a giant screen before a joint hearing of House of Representatives committees into " extraordinary rendition " .
This term refers to a highly secretive process by which US intelligence agencies send terror suspects for interrogation by security officials in other countries , where they have no legal protection or rights under US law .
' Still haunted '
Mr Arar described being detained by US homeland security agents at New York 's JFK airport and of later being sent by private jet to Syria , where he spent 10 months in a prison cell he described as a grave .
" I was beaten with an electrical cable and threatened with a metal chair , the tyre and electric shocks .
I was forced to falsely confess that I had been to Afghanistan , " he said .
" When I was not being beaten I was put in a waiting room so that I could hear the screams of other prisoners .
The cries of the women still haunt me the most . "
Mr Arar was later released without charge .
Among those offering their apologies at the hearing was Congressman Jerrold Nadler from New York .
" On behalf of my fellow citizens I want to apologise to you , Mr Arar , for the reprehensible conduct of our government for kidnapping you , for turning you over to Syria - a nation that our own state department recognises as routinely practising torture .
This conduct does not reflect the values of the American people , " he said .
Rep Dana Rohrabacher also apologised , saying the US should be ashamed of what happened to Mr Arar .
But , he said , " that is no excuse to end a programme which has protected the lives of hundreds of thousands , if not millions , of Americans ...
We are at war .
Mistakes happen .
People die " .
The Canadian government has formally apologised to Mr Arar and offered him compensation amounting to more than $ 10 m ( US $ 10.2 m , £ 5 m ) .
Canadian police had labelled him an Islamic extremist .
By day , Kevin Egler is a substitute teacher in Kent , Ohio .
By night , he puts up posters at busy intersections and over highways .
He is part of a group called Freeway Bloggers .
Go to www.freewayblogger.com.
The motto of the website is " Free Speech : Use It or Lose It . "
Egler was arrested on July 25 and ticketed for " advertising on public property . "
The city dropped that charge and now is going after him for littering .
I posted an item about his case a few days ago .
Here now is his story , as he gave it to me in a phone interview on August 16 .
In October of last year , I decided to take up a project called freeway blogging .
I had gone to peace rallies , I 'd written letters to all my elected representatives , and I just did n't see that it was doing much good .
I can't idly sit by as the slaughter of innocent people goes on .
The estimated casualties in Iraq now total more than 1 million .
Proportionally , that would be like 11 million people here dying .
I had to do everything in my power to do something about it .
The only way we 're going to end this war is through impeachment , and there 's plenty of cause there .
The Downing Street Memos show that diplomacy was a lie ; Bush was dead - set on going to war .
Then there 's the out and out disregard for civil liberties :
They can listen in to our phone calls , take our e-mails , freeze our assets .
I love this country .
So I had to do something .
This seemed like a good , inexpensive way to get the word out and influence people .
Over the last ten months , with a few friends , I 've put up about 450 sign all over Ohio , western Pennsylvania , and a little part of West Virginia .
What we like to do the most is overpasses over major freeways .
We put up our signs during the wee hours of the morning so they are there for the morning rush hour .
But what I got in trouble for was n't a large " Impeach Bush " sign over a freeway .
It was actually a yard sign much like you would see at any election time , about two feet by two and a half feet .
It was 1:09 a.m. when I was pulled over by Officer Jerry Schlosser of the Kent Police Department .
I had just put a sign up at an intersection where three roads come together : in the grassy area where Main St and Willow Street and Haymaker Parkway meet .
I was only out of the van for less than 5 seconds , but as soon as we got through that intersection my driver said there 's a cop behind us .
The cop followed us for probably a half mile , and then pulled us over .
He kind of ignored the driver , looked back at me , and said something like , " What are you doing ?
Putting up ‘ Impeach Bush ' signs tonight ? "
So I said , " Well , yeah . "
I 'm not going to lie to him .
He said , something to the effect : " Do n't you know that 's littering ? "
I said , " No , it 's my guaranteed right of free political speech . "
He did n't seem real impressed with my answer .
So he took my driver 's license and went back to his cruiser to run a check on me .
The last time I was in trouble in Portage County was a speeding ticket in 1995 .
I 'm a law - abiding citizen .
When he came back up to the van , he asked me , " Why do n't you put these in your own yard ? "
And I said , " Well , it 's public property .
As a taxpayer of this city , it kind of is my yard . "
I said , " Can I ask you a question ? "
" Yeah . "
" What 's the difference between the kind of sign I put up and a sign a realtor would put up saying , House for Sale , this direction ? "
" You do n't know the difference between those two ? "
" No sir , I do n't . "
And I 'm still waiting for an answer to that one .
I think political speech should be more protected than commercial speech .
At that point , he says , " I have all your information .
I 'll be issuing a summons at a later time . "
When we parted , I said , " Have a good night . "
Two days later , 6:00 am , I get a knock on the door .
It 's Officer Schlosser .
He explained that I was violating a Kent ordinance against advertising on public property .
I had an arraignment date for August 1 .
I had four protesters there with me .
They were wearing T - shirts that said " Impeach Bush " or " Honk for Peace " or " Got Fascism ? "
I was wearing a shirt with a Plato quote on it : " The price good people pay for their indifference to public affairs is to be ruled by evil men . "
When it came my turn , I approached the bench .
Judge Plough asked for my plea .
I said , " Not guilty . "
He set a pretrial date for August 9 , and a trial date for August 16 .
So I got legal representation : Bob Fitrakis .
He 's a great guy .
I told him the whole story .
As soon as we got to the courthouse on August 9 , the city law director , Jim Silver , talked to Bob in private .
And Bob came back and told me : " Well , they 're offering you a deal .
They 're going to drop the advertising on public property charge no matter what .
Your options are to either plead guilty to disorderly conduct , pay a $ 25 fine , and it 's over and done , or they 're going to refile a littering charge against you . "
The advertising on public property charge was considered a minor misdemeanor .
Maximum fine : $ 125 , including court costs .
The littering charge was more serious : a third - degree misdemeanor , punishable up to $ 500 and 60 days in jail .
So I asked Bob , " What should we do ? "
Bob said , " No , what do you want to do ? "
I said , " I feel like I 'm not guilty of any crime .
I 'd like to fight it . "
He was with me on that .
So we decided to not bite on the deal they were offering .
Free political speech is free political speech , and I do n't care what charge they put against me , I want to stand up for the First Amendment .
I will be arraigned on September 6 , and I will plead not guilty again .
Most of Mitt Romney 's famous flip - flops have come over a period of years , as he ran to the left in his Massachusetts races and is now running hard right away from that record for a national Republican primary .
So this 1 minute , 13 second video of a recent campaign appearance is probably a record .
Romney begins his response to a question about Social Security by saying quite firmly :
" I 'm not in favor of privatizing Social Security or making cuts . "
Twenty seconds later , though , it was a different story :
Romney : " The two major paths we have are one , to raise taxes on people , which I do n't want to do , and the other is to allow some portion of people 's money that they are are now having taken out of their salary to be invested in Social Security , have some of that be allowed by them to be invested . "
Questioner - " That 's privatization . "
Romney - " You call it privatization , I call it a private account . "
In fact , the second Mitt was the one telling the truth here - he 's a big fan of Social Security privatization , though he prefers to use the Bush - approved language of " personal accounts . "
Good for his questioner here for calling him on his attempt to play language games .
After weeks of outcry from customers and the press about the company ’s apparent lack of action concerning a growing Internet phenomenon , Apple has finally announced its strategy for lolcats .
At a press event on the Cupertino campus , CEO Steve Jobs said that an upcoming revision to .
Mac would enable users to automatically add lolcats text to any of their iPhoto images .
“ I think this is going to be a really exciting feature for our customers , ” Jobs said .
“ And I ’d love to show it to you now . ”
Taking a sip from a bottled water , Jobs sat down at a keyboard and monitor and brought up .
Mac .
“ We ’ve got some standard , pre-built lolcats text you can see here in this pull - down menu .
Let ’s say I want to add ‘ I CAN HAS CHEEZBURGER ? ’ to this picture .
First , I select the picture … then I select ‘ I CAN HAS CHEEZBURGER ? ’ from the list of pre-defined lolcats texts … and then it ’s just one click .
Clicking a button , Jobs created an image of a clearly uncomfortable - looking iPod product marketing manager Stan Ng dressed up in a crude cat suit with “ I CAN HAS CHEEZBURGER ? ” emblazoned on it in sans serif text .
“ Boom .
It ’s that easy . ”
Jobs also said that Apple ’s lolcats technology would be added to the iPhone so users can add humorously truncated text to the pictures they take with the unit ’s built - in 2 megapixel camera .
“ And the great thing about that , ” Jobs noted , “ is that the iPhone ’s on - screen keyboard is already so difficult to use that it ’s highly likely to interpret your keystrokes in a hilariously misspelled fashion .
So it makes rolling your own lolcats almost automatic . ”
The iPhone implementation also includes a feature where users can , Madlibs - like , supply their own words to complete the commonly - used lolcats syntax “ I ’M IN UR [ blank ] , [ blanking ] UR [ blank ] . ”
“ This is light years ahead of what anyone else is doing with lolcats .
And it ’s only available on .
Mac and the iPhone . ”
Microsoft was expected to respond shortly by announcing its own strategy which will consist of a crayon that users can use to write lolcats text on the images that appear on their screens .

This Hubble image shows the gigantic nebula NGC 3603 located in the Carina spiral arm of the Milky Way , about 20,000 light - years from the Solar System .
NGC 3603 hosts one of the most prominent , massive , young clusters in the Milky Way .
Hubble has been observing this prime location for star formation studies .
The images show a young star cluster surrounded by a vast region of dust and gas .
Most of the bright stars in the image are hot , blue stars .
They produce ultraviolet radiation and violent winds that have formed an enormous cavity in the gas and dust surrounding the cluster .
Habeas Corpus Restoration
Act of 2007 , a bill by Senator Arlen Specter ( R - PA ) that would " …restore habeas corpus for those detained by the United States . "
At that point , the legislation had 23 cosponsors -- 22 Democrats and Independent Bernie Sanders of Vermont -- and I thought I would check back in today and see who has stepped up to show leadership on this issue since then .
With the addition over the last couple of weeks of Senators Byrd , Carper , Klobuchar , McCaskill , Menendez and Nelson ( Bill ) , there are 28 Democratic Senators , along with Sanders , cosponsoring Specter's
Here 's the cosponsor list :
It 's been almost three weeks since I last wrote about the status of cosponsorship on the , a bill by Senator Arlen Specter ( R - PA ) that would " … restore habeas corpus for those detained by the United States . "
At that point , the legislation had 23 cosponsors -- 22 Democrats and Independent Bernie Sanders of Vermont -- and I thought I would check back in today and see who has stepped up to show leadership on this issue since then .
With the addition over the last couple of weeks of Senators Byrd , Carper , Klobuchar , McCaskill , Menendez and Nelson ( Bill ) , there are 28 Democratic Senators , along with Sanders , cosponsoring Specter 's S. 185 , which could very well come up for a vote next week as an amendment to the Defense Department authorization bill .
Here 's the cosponsor list :
Joe Biden ( D - DE )
Jeff Bingaman ( D - NM )
Barbara Boxer ( D - CA )
Sherrod Brown ( D - OH )
Robert Byrd ( D - WV )
Maria Cantwell ( D - WA )
Ben Cardin ( D - MD )
Thomas Carper ( D - DE )
Hillary Clinton ( D - NY )
Chris Dodd ( D - CT )
Dick Durbin ( D - IL )
Russ Feingold ( D - WI )
Dianne Feinstein ( D - CA )
Tom Harkin ( D - IA )
Ted Kennedy ( D - MA )
John Kerry ( D - MA )
Amy Klobuchar ( D - MN )
Frank Lautenberg ( D - NJ )
Patrick Leahy ( D - VT )
Carl Levin ( D - MI )
Claire McCaskill ( D - MO )
Robert Menendez ( D - NJ )
Bill Nelson ( D - FL )
Barack Obama ( D - IL )
Jay Rockefeller ( D - WV )
Ken Salazar ( D - CO )
Bernie Sanders ( I - VT )
Debbie Stabenow ( D - MI )
Sheldon Whitehouse ( D - RI )
So I again raise the question : Where are the other Democrats ?
We expect almost none of Specter 's Republican colleagues to support his leadership on something so basic to our country 's creed .
The GOP long ago divorced itself of any commitment to our Constitution , so our standards for them have been lowered accordingly .
But we expect more of Democrats and should ask why the others are not stepping up and cosponsoring this legislation along with 29 of their colleagues ( including Sanders ) in the Democratic caucus .
Can they support it when the roll call vote comes , but just not go all the way and sign their names as cosponsoring the bill ?
Yes .
But that 's not showing true leadership and , when it comes to one of the most basic American rights trashed by Team Bush , you 've got to stand and be counted -- in other words , it 's not enough to just show up for the vote .
The following Democratic Senators have still not signed up to cosponsor the Habeas Corpus Restoration Act of 2007 :
Daniel Akaka ( D - HI )
Max Baucus ( D - MT )
Evan Bayh ( D - IN )
Robert Casey ( D - PA )
Kent Conrad ( D - ND )
Byron Dorgan ( D - ND )
Daniel Inouye ( D - HI )
Tim Johnson ( D - SD )
Herb Kohl ( D - WI )
Mary Landrieu ( D - LA )
Blanche Lincoln ( D - AR )
Barbara Mikulski ( D - MD )
Patty Murray ( D - WA )
Ben Nelson ( D - NE )
Mark Pryor ( D - AR )
Jack Reed ( D - RI )
Charles Schumer ( D - NY )
Jon Tester ( D - MT )
James Webb ( D - VA )
Ron Wyden ( D - OR )
Actually , it was September 1st of last year , but who is counting .
Close enough , right ?
Either way , about a year ago I up and quit my job .
After many discussions at home with the wife and a little advance financial planning , I walked into my job of 4 years and gave my notice .
No one saw it coming …we were a very small company and my leaving had never been discussed .
But after a few years of not being given the support that I asked for and some health issues taking their toll , I decided that I was better off on my own trying to sort things out .
So 30 days later ( Yes , I was generous because I wanted to make sure that a few projects got handled for some clients ) , I was outta there .
And if you happen to have been a reader from a while ago , you know that I got lucky … I got a job just a few days later .
No , I do n’t make as much as I used to , but I am a lot happier and a lot healthier , and that what was really important to me .
So what have I been doing since I quit ?
First off , I am still doing the job I got just a few days after I left .
It ’s no longer the 40 + hours per week job that it was , but it still provides me with about 20 hours a week of work .
Add that to the work I do for outside clients , the blogs I run and various other things , and I make a pretty decent living .
And , I get to do it at home .
Again , I do n’t make as I made before at my cushy job … but money never was a motivating factor for me .
Happiness is way more valuable to me the older I get and I have learned that money only provides so much of it .
I have gotten to see what it feels like being my own boss .
Sure , those 20 hours a week that I work are for a company and I am on their payroll … but the hours I work are up to me .
I get to decide when and how long I do their work , and how much time I put into other work that is available to me .
It ’s a pretty cool feeling , knowing that I do not have to work on a Tuesday if I just do n’t feel like it .
Red Sox game on in the afternoon ?
No problem , I just turn the computer off and go flick on the TV .
It has encouraged me to learn new skill sets .
I have learned new stuff about what I do for a living , learned a lot more about blogging , and I have started taking more tennis classes that start earlier in the day .
At my old job I went 4 years without really doing anything different ; I was comfortable , the work was easy and I knew I was irreplaceable …sure it was a dead end job but I got paid well to learn nothing new and do nothing difficult .
Trust me , it gets boring after a while .
Freeing myself from that environment invigorated me to try new things and to see what else is out there , and it has been an eye - opening experience .
I get to be even more anal about how organized I am .
Whether this is a good or a bad thing , it is the way I am .
And being at home all day gives me even more time to purge , clean , and organize .
Call it OCD or whatever , but my house is cleaner , I have sold a ton of our stuff to make some extra money , my financial ( and life ) records are in order and under control , and I have a much calmer personality because I am not coming home pissed off every day from work .
Overall , life is good .
In fact , it ’s better than good , it ’s great .
I make my own hours , I decide what projects I work on , I can take vacations and time off when I feel like it , I get to try new things and have new experiences … and a lot of this would not have been possible without me taking that plunge of quitting my stable but boring gig and trying something new .
I guess I am writing this to encourage you to give your work life a real in - depth look …are you doing something you truly enjoy , or doing something only because it pays well ?
Can you take chances in your everyday life , or does what you do to make money limit your ability to try new things ?
Are you happy ?
I would never tell anyone to do what I did …it can take months if not years to find new work .
But I both planned ahead AND got lucky , and it has worked out well .
Plus , I have time on Wednesday afternoons to walk over to the Farmer ’s Market to get our groceries .
😉
Life is good .

Apple needs to respect its users
They warned you but Apple decided to follow through and give those iPhone enthusiasts exactly what they wanted : shiny , bricked iPhones .
Well done Apple .
Way to meet the needs of your customers .
There were warnings but many thought them only a deterrent .
Not so .
The latest iPhone " patch " , while adding some features and fixing some security flaws has been bricking unlocked iPhones .
Apple has always enjoyed its locked - down status .
It affords them stability and control over their products with ease — something that more open systems have trouble with .
The iPhone has been a roaring success for them ( especially as this is their first phone ) but it has introduced challenges that they ’re not dealing with well .
Application development is the major crime on the iPhone .
There ’s no Apple - given way to make your own native applications and install them on the phone — something that many other smart - phone brands thrive upon .
And there is a lot of demand for this on the iPhone .
People far and wide have been hacking their expensive little phones apart to let them install what they like .
Why does Apple think it has the right to control how I use something I buy ?
The second crime is locking the phone to one network .
In the US they ’re locked to AT&T and when they ’re released here , they ’ll be locked to O2 .
Why does Apple think it has the right to control how I use something I ’ve bought ?
If you bought a car you would n’t expect to only be able to drive on certain toll roads , would you ?
So people have been unlocking their phones from AT&T so they can use them on any network they like .
This update , however , is causing some problems …
Rather than check for the presence of an unlocked phone , Apple ’s patch appears to charge in and assume everything is as it was when bought .
Therefore on modified phones , things are n’t as expected and when the iPhone tries to reboot , nothing happens .
Nothing good anyway .
What were you thinking , Apple ?
Your customer tries to use the item they bought from you ( at great expense ) .
You know many users are unlocking them — and the unlock code is all over the internet so you could build your patcher to accommodate for it .
But instead of respecting their wants , you issue a warning saying that ( and I believe this to be a lie ) the unlocking process causes " irreparable damage " and push out an update that makes it a reality .
So it ’s the unlocker that causes the damage , is it ?
Tell me Apple , what do you consider more damaged : a unlocked and working iPhone or a bricked one after the user runs your updater ?
The update has also been blamed for nuking home - installed applications along with contacts , photos and music … even on unmodified phones !
Did n’t you test it ?
This so - called " update " would certainly get my vote for worst patch of the year .
And I know other companies ( ** cough * * Sony * * cough * * ) are equally evil in this respect but Apple still has the " Apple can do - eth no wrong " image .
I ’m sorry but that ’s bullshit .
Just when we thought it could n’t get worse ( seriously , we thought it would stay an isolated and rare defect ) , Nomura International analyst , Richard Windsor released a note to clients indicating that the iPhone ’s “ dead strip ” display problem could become more widespread .
Apple bought the rights to the screen technology used in the iPhone from a Finnish firm .
Finnish firm reported that usage led to the same unresponsive display problems after some time .
Apparently , 3 to 6 months of “ extensive use ” would start to degrade the technology and cause a lose of sensitivity to touch - inputs .
This suggests that the relatively new iPhone fleet in the US could start to exhibit similar problems with time .
With technologies as advanced as multi-touch , and production volumes as large as they are , hardware faults could very reasonably start to crop up .
We ’ll keep a close eye on this problem for you guys , but should you find yourself facing the dreaded “ dead strip , ” drop us a line and let us know .
Seriously , we ’d appreciate it .
Update
The iPhone does not use heat chemical deposition technology , nor does it detect inputs based on heat .

A group of pupils angered by their school 's decision to change its uniform rules staged a dramatic protest yesterday - by setting fire to their blazers .
Firemen and police were called to Abertillery Comprehensive School in South Wales after 60 children tried to burn their garments .
Headmistress Pauline Thomas said ' only a small group ' of pupils aged between 15 and 16 were involved in the demonstration , with many later being excluded from classes .
More follows ...
The protest against the reintroduction of traditional school uniforms comes a day after Tory leader David Cameron pledged to being the blazer back to improve classroom discipline and behaviour .
Mrs Thomas said : ' At approximately 11 am the youngsters walked out of their third lesson of the day and congregated in the bus bay .
The children , who were mainly Year 11 pupils , took off their blazers and began to burn them .
' I called the emergency services to get the group under control .
They were intimidating the younger pupils and that kind of behaviour will not be tolerated . '
She added : ' It was just a case of some pupils who do not like being told what to do .
But what they were doing is a criminal offence .
' Letters will be sent out to all the parents of the children involved and some , a couple , will have to be excluded .
We can not put up with this sort of behaviour . '
Some parents and children had been upset by Mrs Thomas 's decision to bring back the black blazers as part of the school 's official uniform .
Pupils had been given until this Friday to comply with the new regulations .
However , most children have been wearing the uniform since the start of term a month ago .
On the school 's website , Mrs Thomas wrote : ' I would like to thank all parents and carers for their assistance with supplying correct uniform to a very high standard . '
The headmistress , who has a reputation for being strict , also complimented Year 11 pupils for looking smart .
But the website warns that anyone who turn up in nonregulation jackets and jumpers will have them confiscated and they will be sent home .
Mrs Thomas said : ' Letters were sent out last term informing parents that youngsters must wear the blazers .
' They do n't have to buy blazers from the school , they can go to Asda and buy anyone 's and put the school badge on .
It was not a protest over cost . '
One 16 - year - old pupil said : ' Everyone has been complaining against the blazers .
It 's not fair - we do n't want to wear them .
' Teachers do n't understand that they can't force us .
It 's not right , but some Year 11s have paid £ 34 for these horrible itchy blazers when they will be leaving in a few month 's time . '

web.py チュートリアル 他言語への翻訳 : ロシア語 スペイン語 ポルトガル語 : 1 2 3
インストー ル
このチュートリアル全体を試すには、web.py , flup , Cheetah , psycopg2 , Postgres をインストールしておく必要があります。詳細は、 web.py のトップページを参照してください 。
URLの操作 お好みのエディタを起動し、 " code.py " とでも名前を付けて新しいファイルを作り、次のようにタイプしてください：
import web
この行で、web .py のフレームワークを読み込みます。 urls = (
' /' , ' view '
)
これは、機能が割り当てられるURLの一覧を表現しています。
最初の部分は、パス表現と一致するもので、正規表現が使え、普通は / , /help /faq , /item /(\d+ ) などのように使います( \d+ は数字の並びと一致するものです。括弧は後に続く一致する部分を捕獲するために使います ) 。
二番目の部分は、リクエストを送るためのクラスの名前です。たとえば、 view , welcomes .hello ( welcomes モジュールの hello クラスを得る ) や get_\1 のように使います 。 \ 1 は、正規表現で最初に取得されたものに置き換えられます。どのような値が得られても、すべてあなたの作った関数に引き渡されます。 class view :
def GET ( self ) :
これは、GET関数を備えたHELLOクラスです。すでにお察しのように、誰かがあなたたのURLを
HTTP GET メソッドで呼び出したときに 、GET
が呼ばれます( たとえば誰かがブラウザであなたのURLを開くような場合のことです)。 print " Hello , world ! "
これは、訪問者に ' Hello , world ' とプレーンテキストを返す部分です。 web.internalerror = web.debugerror この行は、要求されたリクエストがエラーになる場合は常に、多くの有用なデバッグ情報を備えたページを web.py に表示させます。あなたは、サイトを公開する時には、ユーザーがエラーページを見ることがないよう、この行をコメントアウトしたいと思うでしょう。 if __name__ == ' __main__ ' : web.run( urls , web.reloader )
この部分は、ファイルが実行されたときに、あなたのアプリケーションを動かすように web.py に命じるものです。最初の項目であるurlsは、ここより前に書かれたURLと関数の結びつきを定義しています。もう１つの項目は、「ミドルウエア」用の
ものです。それは、あなたのアプリケーションのいくつかの部分を補助するためのラッパー機能です。reloader
を使うと、ソースコードが変更されたときには自動的に再読み込みします。したがって、わたしたちは毎回サーバーを再起動させる必要がありません。あなたは
おそらく、サイトを公開する時に、すぐにもこの機能を使いたいと思うでしょう。それは開発中には貴重なものです。さらに、web.profiler というものもあります。profiler は、それぞれの機能がページ生成を完了するまでにどのくらいの時間を使ったかという情報を出力します。これを使うことによって、コードをより速くすること ができます。 あなたのアプリケーションを動かすWebサーバーを起動させるために、 " python code.py " と実行してみてください。ポート8002を指定して動作させる場合は、 " python code.py 8002 " のようにします。code.py を CGI や FastCGI のスクリプトとして動作させることもできます。それは自動的にきちんと動くでしょう。また、web.py
は Python の Webアプリ用インターフェイスの標準である WSGI の上に作られているので 、WSGI に対応した mod_python を含む全てのプログラムの中で実行できます。 さあ、ブラウザであなたが作ったサイトをアクセスしてみましょう。' Hello , world !'
と表示されるのが確認できるでしょう。
テンプレートを使う " templates " と名付けた新しいディレクトリを作りましょう。その中には、名前が " .html " で終わる新しいファイルを置きましょう。たとえばここではそれを " view.html " としましょう 。
# if $ name
I just wanted to say hello to $name .
#else
Hello , world !
#end if
code .py にもどって、 .
view .GET を次のように変更します： name = ' Bob '
web.render ('view.html ' )
ブラウザであなたが作ったサイトをアクセスしてみると、Bob にこんにちはと言っているのが確認できるでしょう。
これらのテンプレート機能は、Cheetah テンプレートエンジンが実現するものです。Cheetah のすべての重要な機能は、たった１ページのチュートリアルに網羅されています。ほとんどの場合、それは
Python コードに HTML ( や、あなたが書いたその他のどんなフォーマットでも)を組み込む場合と同じように動くでしょう。
注意：現在の計画では 、Cheetah はもう少し単純でパワフルな別の何かに置き換えられる予定です。このフォーマットは、デザインは済んでいますが、まだ実装が完全に終わっていません。
カスタ ムURL URLリストを以下のように書き換えてみましょう： '/(.* ) ' , ' view '
view .GET も同様に書き換えます： def GET ( self , name ) :
name を定義している行を削除してください。 " / Joe " に ブラウザでアクセスする と 、Joe にこんにちはと言っているのが確認できます。 " / " にアクセスすると 、' Hello , world ! ' が表示されます。
データベースを使う web.run 行の上に追記します： web.db_parameters = dict ( dbn= ' postgres ' , user='me ' , pw='pass ' , db='dbname ' )
使っているデータベースプログラムの設定状況にあわせて、それぞれの値を反映させましょう。
たとえば、MySQL
を使っている人は、 dbn を mysql に変更したいでしょう。 データベースに単純なテーブルを１つ定義します： CREATE TABLE todo (
id serial primary key ,
title text ,
created timestamp default now ( ) ,
done boolean default 'f '
) ;
サンプルデータも追加します： INSERT INTO todo ( title ) VALUES ( ' Learn web. py ' ) ;
code .py にもどって、view .
GET の先頭に以下を追記します： todos = web.select ( " todo " )
view.html を以下のように変更します： <ul >
# for todo in $ todos
< li id =" t$todo.id " >$todo.title</li >
#end for
</ul >
サイトを表示すると 、' Learn web.py ' という予定 が１ つ表示されます。 view.html の末尾に以下を追記します： < form method= " post " action = " add " >
< p >< input type =" text " name = " title " /> < input type =" submit " value = " Add " /></p>
</ form >
urls リストを以下のように変更します： '/' , ' view ' ,
' / add ' , ' add '
view .GET を変更し、追加のパラメータを取り除きます： def GET ( self ) :
そして、 view クラスの真下に以下を追記します： class add :
def POST ( self ) :
i = web.input ( )
n = web.insert ( ' todo ' , title=i.title )
web.seeother ('./#t'+str(n ) )
web.insert は、新しく挿入された項目のIDを返します。そして、 web.seeother はそのユーザーをリダイレクトするのに使います。 あとは簡単に : web.transact ( ) は トランザクションを開始します。 web.commit( ) はそれをコミットし、 web.rollback ( ) はロールバックします。 web.update は、 web.insert と同じですが， id を返すのではなく，逆に id ( または WHERE 節を表す文字列 ) をテーブル名の次の引数にとります。 もう、あなたはリストに予定項目を追加できるようになったことでしょう。
余談：ストレージオブジェクト web.input と web.query は、web.py の中の他の多くのものと同様に 「 ストレージオプジェクト 」を返します。 ストレージオブジェクトは、 d.foo が d [ ' foo ' ]
と同じ結果になることをのぞいて 、Python のディクショナリに似ています。これを使うと、タイピングの量を減らすことができます。
クッキーを使う クッキーは、 web.input とよく似た方法で働きます。 web.cookies ( ) は、設定されたすべてのクッキーを返すストレージオブジェクトです。 web.setcookie( name , value , expires= " " ) でクッキーを設定します 。
web.input と web.cookies は、一連のキーワードとキーワード引数を持ちます。もし、たとえば web.input ( ' color ' , times =1 ) のように呼び出せば、 color と名付けられた変数を受け取らなかったり、値 を１ にセットされる times を受け取らなかった場合、エラーを返すでしょう。 共通する慣用表現は以下のようになります： try : i = web.input ( ' foo ' , bar=2 )
except KeyError : return web.badrequest ( )

Preface
After so many years , there is still no clear evidence that using a PDA ( Personal Digital Assistant ) is any better than just an old - fashioned paper organizer .
Or is there ?
I ’m sure many of you have contemplated whether it was worth buying a PDA or if it was better for you to just to stick to your Franklin Covey .
Even back in the days when PDA ( Palm OS - dominated ) was riding the crest of popularity , they were still finding it hard to convince the old - fashioned paper users to change to the digital way .
It was a pretty equal battle between the PDA and paper organizers back then .
This was partly because of the intuitive simplicity of the Palm OS organizer functions and on the contrary , the lack of proper marketing for these PDAs .
Fast forward to today .
The popularity of standalone PDAs have slumped to the point they can be considered on the verge of extinction .
That 's not a slight on their evident usefulness .
Rather , their extinction is due to the birth of PDA phones .
Ironically , the same technology that gave birth to the PDA has advanced to the point it can be integrated into mobile phones , turning them into PDA phones .
It is the advent of these new hybrids that rang the bell of doom for standalone PDAs .
The current de facto operating system for PDAs ( with few exceptions ) is Microsoft 's Windows Mobile 2003 .
However , it is no longer used exclusively in the few PDAs left in the market .
Now , practically all PDA phones are also using this operating system .
The integration of this operating system signified the beginning of the end of standalone PDAs .
With PDA phones sporting the same operating system and PDA functionality , it 's no surprise that PDAs are being eclipsed by these phones .
In fact , the Dell X51V was the last notable PDA released .
With many of these PDA phones dominating the higher - end segment of the mobile phone market , it can be said that if you buy a high - end mobile phone today , there 's a high chance it is a PDA phone .
However , most mobile phone users are n't really PDA users and are probably more than content to stick with their pen-and - paper routine , if at all .
That may really be a waste of all that capability that you paid for .
So , this article will help give you some insights into the current world of digital assistants and how they compare to the time - tested paper organizers .
This may be the right time to finally go digital .
TOKYO , Japan ( Reuters ) -- A Japanese biker failed to notice his leg had been severed below the knee when he hit a safety barrier , and rode on for 2 km ( 1.2 miles ) , leaving a friend to pick up the missing limb .
The 54 - year - old office worker was out on his motorcycle with a group of friends in the city of Hamamatsu , west of Tokyo , on Monday , when he was unable to negotiate a curve in the road and bumped into the central barrier , the Mainichi Shimbun said .
He felt excruciating pain , but did not notice that his right leg was missing until he stopped at the next junction , the paper quoted local police as saying .
The man and his leg were taken to hospital , but the limb had been crushed in the collision , the paper said .

All About Japan
No one really knows the answer because it has never happened and been litigated .
However , the majority view is that a president can pardon himself ( assuming he does so prior to impeachment ) .
Art. II Sec. 2 of the Constitution states , in part , that the president " shall have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States , except in Cases of Impeachment . "
The purpose of this clause was to insure the separation of powers by preventing the courts from using the law as a legal blackmail against the president .
The argument that the president could murder someone and then pardon himself is rather a non-sequitur considering that the vice president ( or anyone ) could kill anyone for the president and then the president could pardon him or her .
Note :
There is a minority view that the president cannot pardon himself .
Lowering the Cost of Health Care
by Ron Paul by Ron Paul
DIGG THIS
As a medical doctor , I ’ve seen first - hand how bureaucratic red tape interferes with the doctor - patient relationship and drives costs higher .
The current system of third - party payers takes decision - making away from doctors , leaving patients feeling rushed and worsening the quality of care .
Yet health insurance premiums and drug costs keep rising .
Clearly a new approach is needed .
Congress needs to craft innovative legislation that makes health care more affordable without raising taxes or increasing the deficit .
It also needs to repeal bad laws that keep health care costs higher than necessary .
We should remember that HMOs did not arise because of free - market demand , but rather because of government mandates .
The HMO
Act of 1973 requires all but the smallest employers to offer their employees HMO coverage , and the tax code allows businesses — but not individuals — to deduct the cost of health insurance premiums .
The result is the illogical coupling of employment and health insurance , which often leaves the unemployed without needed catastrophic coverage .
While many in Congress are happy to criticize HMOs today , the public never hears how the present system was imposed upon the American people by federal law .
As usual , government intervention in the private market failed to deliver the promised benefits and caused unintended consequences , but Congress never blames itself for the problems created by bad laws .
Instead , we are told more government — in the form of universal coverage — is the answer .
But government already is involved in roughly two - thirds of all health care spending , through Medicare , Medicaid , and other programs .
For decades , the U.S. healthcare system was the envy of the entire world .
Not coincidentally , there was far less government involvement in medicine during this time .
America had the finest doctors and hospitals , patients enjoyed high - quality , affordable medical care , and thousands of private charities provided health services for the poor .
Doctors focused on treating patients , without the red tape and threat of lawsuits that plague the profession today .
Most Americans paid cash for basic services , and had insurance only for major illnesses and accidents .
This meant both doctors and patients had an incentive to keep costs down , as the patient was directly responsible for payment , rather than an HMO or government program .
The lesson is clear : when government and other third parties get involved , health care costs spiral .
The answer is not a system of outright socialized medicine , but rather a system that encourages everyone — doctors , hospitals , patients , and drug companies — to keep costs down .
As long as somebody else is paying the bill , the bill will be too high .
The following are bills Congress should pass to reduce health care costs and leave more money in the pockets of families :
HR 3075 provides truly comprehensive health care reform by allowing families to claim a tax credit for the rising cost of health insurance premiums .
With many families now spending close to $ 1000 or even more for their monthly premiums , they need real tax relief — including a dollar - for - dollar credit for every cent they spend on health care premiums — to make medical care more affordable .
HR 3076 is specifically designed to address the medical malpractice crisis that threatens to drive thousands of American doctors — especially obstetricians — out of business .
The bill provides a dollar - for - dollar tax credit that permits consumers to purchase " negative outcomes " insurance prior to undergoing surgery or other serious medical treatments .
Negative outcomes insurance is a novel approach that guarantees those harmed receive fair compensation , while reducing the burden of costly malpractice litigation on the health care system .
Patients receive this insurance payout without having to endure lengthy lawsuits , and without having to give away a large portion of their award to a trial lawyer .
This also drastically reduces the costs imposed on physicians and hospitals by malpractice litigation .
Under HR 3076 , individuals can purchase negative outcomes insurance at essentially no cost .
HR 3077 makes it more affordable for parents to provide health care for their children .
It creates a $ 500 per child tax credit for medical expenses and prescription drugs that are not reimbursed by insurance .
It also creates a $ 3,000 tax credit for dependent children with terminal illnesses , cancer , or disabilities .
Parents who are struggling to pay for their children ’s medical care , especially when those children have serious health problems or special needs , need every extra dollar .
HR 3078 is commonsense , compassionate legislation for those suffering from cancer or other terminal illnesses .
The sad reality is that many patients battling serious illnesses will never collect Social Security benefits — yet they continue to pay into the Social Security system .
When facing a medical crisis , those patients need every extra dollar to pay for medical care , travel , and family matters .
HR 3078 waives the employee portion of Social Security payroll taxes ( or self - employment taxes ) for individuals with documented serious illnesses or cancer .
It also suspends Social Security taxes for primary caregivers with a sick spouse or child .
There is no justification or excuse for collecting Social Security taxes from sick individuals who literally are fighting for their lives .
Dr. Ron Paul is a Republican member of Congress from Texas .
The Best of Ron Paul
A drive to give the more than half - million residents of the District of Columbia a vote in Congress came up short in the Senate on Tuesday .
It fell three votes shy of the 60 needed to overcome a threatened filibuster and begin debate .
But the bill garnered more Republican support than it has in 30 years of discussion on the issue .
Its backers pledged to try again -- if not in this session , then in a new Congress in which Democratic gains could spell the difference .
“ I feel strongly about D.C. voting rights , ” said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) .
Saying that there are “ a lot of other things crying for attention ” in the Senate , he explained that he chose to bring the issue to the floor because D.C. residents were fighting and dying in Iraq without a voice in Congress .
“ This is fairness , ” Reid said .
“ It ’s the right thing to do . ”

The Senate vote was 57 to 42 , with eight Republicans voting to allow the bill to be considered .
Citing constitutional concerns , President Bush has threatened to veto the legislation .
The bill passed the House in April by a vote of 241 to 177 , short of the two - thirds needed to override a veto .
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R - Ky . ) opposed the measure .
He called it “ clearly and unambiguously unconstitutional ” and said the remedy for disenfranchisement of the district ’s residents is to amend the Constitution to make the District of Columbia a state .
But a proposed constitutional amendment to do just that failed in 1985 because it did not win support from two - thirds of the states .
In the years since , proponents have tried to persuade Americans to embrace the idea of congressional representation for D.C. residents .
Arguing that the federal government already recognizes the District of Columbia as a state in matters of commerce and taxes , they organized under a new umbrella effort , DC Vote ( www.dcvote.org), and began a grass - roots lobbying campaign .

This latest effort would have added a House seat for largely Democratic D.C. and given majority Republican Utah another House seat , raising the voting membership in the House of Representatives to 437 .
Proponents attracted a wide array of political support , inspiring a bipartisan lobbying push from former Rep. Jack Kemp , a Republican , and the Democratic mayor of Washington , Adrian M. Fenty .
Fenty was allowed on the floor to buttonhole senators .
“ Not since segregation has the Senate blocked a voting rights bill , and this is a voting rights bill , ” Fenty told a rally on Monday .
The District of Columbia has had a nonvoting delegate in the House since 1971 .
The unlikely yoking of D.C. and Utah was the brainchild of Rep. Thomas M. Davis III ( R - Va. ) , who described it as an attempt to “ take the partisanship out of this . ”
With a 57 % African American population , D.C. has voted Democratic in every presidential election since 1964 .
If it were a state , with the congressional representation allotted by the Constitution , its voting habits would likely add one Democrat to the House and two to the Senate .
That is one reason some congressional Republicans and GOP - dominated state legislatures have balked at statehood .

Utah , meanwhile , was aggrieved that the 2000 census left it 857 residents shy of getting a fourth member of the House .
The state protested that decision to the U.S. Supreme Court , saying the census had not counted thousands of residents serving abroad as Mormon missionaries .
Utah , which has not voted for a Democratic president since Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964 , lost that case .

Click to viewIn an alternative Universe , this is what the Nintendo Wii's Wiimote and nunchuck would have looked like : this is the amazing transforming GyroPod , a motion - sensing gamepad prototype that Gyration made for Nintendo back in 2001 .
Advertisement
Thanks to a recent chance encounter , we were able to uncover a couple of PowerPoint slides that showed the GyroPod , a prototype design for a one - handed motion sensing controller designed specifically by Gyration for Nintendo .
Here 's the back story : Gyration is a company that holds most of the best motion - sensing patents .
Nintendo licensed a number of those patents from Gyration in 2001 , and brought the company on board that year to develop a one - handed controller .
( Nintendo even became an investor in Gyration , which is now owned by Thomson . )
Advertisement
In one of the first meetings with Nintendo 's people , Gyration designers brought these animated slides to the conference room .
I am a fan of the breakaway handle , and some of you may appreciate the fact that the controller forms one solid piece when connected , rather than the current Wii-mote and Nunchuk setup .
Slide 1 :
Still , you can't argue that even Gyration understood the new world that was opening up with one - handed motion .
The following game slide depicts only the most obvious action , and does n't come close to foreshadowing the greatest game of all ( IMHO ) : Wii Tennis .
( Maybe that 's on a missing slide ? )

Northern Rock has been heavily hit by the sub - prime crisis
However this does not mean that the bank is in danger of going bust , Business Editor Robert Peston says .
There was no reason for people with Northern Rock savings accounts to panic , he added .
The bank has struggled to raise money to finance its lending ever since money markets seized up over the summer .
' Temporary problem '
The decision for the Bank of England to become the " lender of last resort " is extremely rare - and comes after consultation with the Treasury and the Financial Services Authority .
However the disclosure is expected to rock financial markets , Mr Peston said .
" Although the firm remains profitable , the fact that it has had to go cap in hand to the Bank is the most tangible sign that the crisis in financial markets is spilling over into businesses that touch most of our lives , " he added .
It is much more exposed than its rivals to this distaste for mortgage debt
Robert Peston
BBC Business Editor
Robert Peston 's blog Q&A : Northern Rock Reaction to the news
The Governor of the Bank of England , Mervyn King , said in a letter to the Treasury Select Committee on Wednesday that the Bank would be prepared to provide emergency loans to a bank that ran into difficulties , so long as those difficulties were the result of temporary market conditions .
" The fact that the Bank of England has been prepared to act as the lender of last resort is an indication that it thinks the problems at Northern Rock are temporary ones , " Mr Peston added .
Treasury Select Committee chairman John McFall urged Northern Rock customers not to panic .
" I do n't think they should be worried about their current accounts or mortgages , " he said .
" The fact that the Bank is willing to act should be reassuring . "
The loan would be provided at a penal interest rate , he said , as a recognition that management at the firm were not without blame .
' Question of confidence '
Following the widespread losses made by investors in loans to US homebuyers with poor credit history , the so - called sub - prime loans , investors have become wary of buying all mortgage debt , including Northern Rock's .
NORTHERN ROCK FACTS
Founded in 1965 after merger of Northern Counties Permanent Building Society and Rock Building Society Became a public company in 1997 Has 18.9 % of UK lending Loans and assets of £ 113bn Deposits from customers of £ 24bn
Northern Rock 's share price
" All banks are having greater difficulties than normal getting funding from the market but as a specialist mortgage lender , no - one really wants to lend to Northern Rock . "
Mr Peston said .
" It is much more exposed than its rivals to this distaste for mortgage debt , because its business is overwhelmingly focused on providing mortgages , rather than other kinds of banking business . "
Analyst Justin Urquhart - Stewart of Seven Investment Management said the problem was essentially about confidence in the markets .
" We do n't know where the poison went from all these bad loans and you have to look at all these bad loans as a bit like a blancmange that 's been hit very heavily by a spade and it 's gone everywhere .
" They turn up in all sorts of strange funds and therefore we do n't know who 's got the losses . "
Northern Rock is the UK 's fifth largest mortgage lender .
In the first six months of the year , it made pre-tax profits of just under £ 300 m , barely changed from the previous year .
However it massively increased its share of the mortgage market , taking 18.9 % of all net mortgage lending in the UK against its previous peak of 14.5 % , seen in the second half of 2006 .
The firm 's shares have almost halved in value this year and talk that it may be in further trouble left it as the biggest loser on the FTSE 100 on Thursday , closing down 4.9 % .
Northern Rock has loans and other assets on its balance sheet of £ 113bn .
The value of deposits placed with it by retail customers is £ 24bn .

In killer heels and little else , they have a definite deadly charm .
But the risque images of women that have decorated warplanes since the First World War have been scrubbed out .
The Ministry of Defence has decreed they could offend the RAF 's female personnel .
Officials admitted they had no record of any complaints from the 5,400 women in the RAF .
But commanders are erring firmly on the side of caution and " nose art " , as it is known , has been consigned to the history books .
Harrier jump jet bombers currently launching daily airstrikes against the Taliban in southern Afghanistan have been scrubbed clean to comply with the orders .
Critics said the MoD should be focusing on more important issues - such as the quality and quantity of equipment available to British forces sent off to war .
Nose art first appeared on warplanes during the First World War and enjoyed a golden age during the Second World War when thousands of American fighters and bombers were decorated with pictures of glamorous women .
Military commanders tolerated the practice as a morale booster .
Famous examples include the Memphis Belle , a U.S. Army Air Force B - 17 bomber that was the subject of a 1990 Hollywood movie .
Many RAF units picked up the practice from the Americans .
During the Second World War it was common to see images of movie stars including Rita Hayworth and Jane Russell on British bombers heading for Germany .
Nose art enjoyed another surge in popularity during the 1991 and 2003 Gulf Wars , when risque images appeared on many British warplanes .
The decision to ban the images followed a visit by glamour models to southern Afghanistan before Christmas .
During the trip they signed paintings of themselves on RAF aircraft .
Commanders decided the images were sexist and insisted there was no place for them in the modern armed forces .
There was also concern that they could cause offence in a muslim country where until 2001 all women were forced to wear the head - to - toe burkha in public .
Glamour model Lucy Pinder , 23 , who visited the RAF detachment at Kandahar last November and signed a painting of herself on a Harrier jet , said such images were only " harmless fun " .
" It 's very flattering and it 's nice that they get to do something that takes their minds off things for a while , " she said from her home in Winchester , Hampshire .
Conservative MP Phillip Davies said : " Has the MoD really got nothing better to worry about at a time when there are serious concerns over equipment and resources available to our forces in Iraq and Afghanistan ? "
An RAF spokesman defended the decision to remove images which he said " cut across " the service 's culture of equal opportunities .
" If you have women flying aircraft and working on them as engineers then these kinds of pictures are inappropriate , " he said .
" That 's why it 's crossed the line and that 's why they have been removed . "

Keith Olbermann has been tracking the Bush Administration 's use of trumped up terror alerts to manipulate the American people for the past two years , but in this latest Nexus of Politics & Terror report on Countdown , it appears the president stooped to a new low by using a bogus terror threat that specifically targeted Capitol Hill to manipulate members of Congress just hours before a crucial vote on the FISA bill last August .

According to Rep. Jane Harman ( D - CA ) , Chairwoman of the House Homeland Security Subcommittee on Terrorism Risk Assessment , the Bush administration knowingly used bogus intelligence to make lawmakers believe there was the chance of an imminent attack on the U.S. Capitol , thus frightening them into passing the temporary expansion of his powers to spy on Americans under the FISA act .
Keith talks with former Reagan administration official and chairman of the American Freedom Agenda Bruce Fein , who has called for the impeachment of both Dick Cheney and George Bush about Bush 's unconstitutional power grabs and how the Democrats can exert their powers as a co-equal branch of government by refusing to fund any spending mandated in future FISA bills .
@Jay -C: Maybe you meant the same one ... but if not , worse was the one where the parents surprised the girl with a Lexus on her actual birthday instead of at the party .
The girl called her mother stupid , said she had ruined her life , not only that had ruined " everything " , did n't want the party anymore , oh and by the way , that was n't the exact model she wanted .
I was so happy when the mother gave it back to the dealer .
Best part ?
The girl was turning 15 and could n't drive it for another year anyway ...
Neither Mrs. Acuna ’s lawyer , Harold J. Cassidy , nor John Zen Jackson , lawyer for the doctor , returned messages left for them seeking comment .
Officials for the American Civil Liberties Union praised the decision .
“ It sends a message that New Jersey will not tolerate backdoor efforts to curtail reproductive rights or free speech , ” Ed Barocas , legal director of the state ’s A.C.L.U. chapter , told The Associated Press .
“ We will not allow the anti-choice lobby to force its moral or theological beliefs upon others and to intimidate doctors or women with lawsuits that are without merit . ”
Marie Tasy , executive director of New Jersey Right to Life , told The A.P. that she was disappointed in the ruling .
“ My reaction is that once again the court relies on an outdated schizophrenic mentality to the detriment of women and indulges in semantic gymnastics to avoid the indisputable fact that a child in the womb is a human being , ” she said .
“ It is human from the minute it comes into existence .
From the moment of conception . ”
Mrs. Acuna , who is now 40 years old , suffered from kidney problems beginning in high school .
She said that she went to Dr. Turkish , who had been her doctor for five years and had delivered one of her children , when she found herself suffering from abdominal pains and headaches in early 1996 .
After an examination and an ultrasound , the doctor told her she was six to eight weeks pregnant .
Mrs. Acuna said in court documents that the doctor told her the pregnancy would put her health at risk because of her kidney problems , and that she should have an abortion or she had only three months to live .
The doctor said in court papers that he did not tell her she had only three months to live and said it was Mrs. Acuna and her husband who first brought up the subject of abortion as an option .
“ According to Acuna , Turkish told her that she ‘ needed an abortion because ( y ) our kidneys are messing you up , ” ‘ court papers said .
“ Acuna asked Turkish whether ‘ the baby was already there . ’
According to Acuna , Turkish replied , ‘ Do n’t be stupid , it ’s only blood . ’ ”
Painful , emotional memories that people would most like to forget may be the toughest to leave behind , especially when memories are created through visual cues , according to a new study by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill .
“ When you ’re watching the news on television and see footage of wounded soldiers in Iraq or ongoing coverage of national tragedies , it may stick with you more than a newspaper headline , ” said the study ’s lead author , Keith Payne , an assistant professor of psychology in the College of Arts and Sciences .
It is adaptive to be able to intentionally forget neutral events such as wrong directions , a friend ’s outdated phone number or a switched meeting time .
Intentional forgetting helps update memory with new information , Payne said .
But Payne and former psychology graduate student Elizabeth Corrigan found that even “ mild ” emotional events , like getting a bad grade on a test or a negative comment from a coworker , can be hard to forget .
Their study , “ Emotional constraints on intentional forgetting , ” appears in the September 2007 print issue of the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology .
When people are trying to intentionally forget information , they need to mentally segregate that information and then block off the information they do n’t want to retrieve , Payne said .
Emotion undermines both of those steps .
“ You make a lot of connections between emotional events and other parts of your life , so it might be difficult to isolate them .
As far as blocking retrieval of an unwanted event , emotion makes events very salient and therefore highly accessible , ” Payne said .
Their results contrast with previous studies of emotional events and intentional forgetting , but those studies used emotion - laden words as stimuli , like “ death ” and “ sex . ”
The UNC study took a new approach , asking 218 participants to react to photographs instead of text .
“ The word ‘ murder , ’ for instance , may or may not make you afraid , but if you see a graphic , violent picture , it may be powerful enough emotionally to change the way you feel , ” Payne said .
The researchers found that their subjects could not intentionally forget emotional events as easily as mundane ones .
They also found that both pleasant and unpleasant emotional memories were resistant to intentional forgetting .
The UNC findings contribute to understanding the ways that emotion constrains mental control and to the question of whether intentional forgetting can be helpful in coping with painful or traumatic experiences .
“ Our findings add to accumulating evidence that emotion places limits on the ability to control the contents of the mind , ” Payne said .
“ Our results suggest that even a relatively mild emotional reaction can undermine intentional forgetting .
But this does n’t necessarily mean that emotional memories can never be intentionally forgotten .
If the motivation to forget is powerful enough , individuals might be able to overcome the effects of emotion by enlisting additional coping strategies . ”
A different study would be needed to examine what treatment and coping strategies might be effective in helping people voluntarily forget an unwanted memory , he added .

日本初のハッカー、和田先生が語る「 ハッカー気質」
ハッカー気質について講演する東京大学名誉教授の和田英一氏
「 ハッカーというのは自分 で “ ハッカー ” と名乗るのではなくて、いろいろやっているうちに人からそう呼ばれるもの」――。集まった500人を超えようかという聴衆に向かって、そう語り出したのは東京大学名誉教授の和田英一先生だ。日本の計算機科学分野のパイオニアで、最近ではハッピーハッキングキーボードの監修などで知られる和田先生こそ、“日本最初のハッカー”として知られる人物だ。和田先生の講演で幕を開けた軽量プログラミング言語イベント、「
Lightweight Language Spirit」をレポートする。
週末が似合うLL言語
8月4日土曜日、東京・一ツ橋のホールでRubyやPHP、Pythonに代表される軽量プログラミング言語（以下、LL言語）のファンが集う年に1度のイベント「
Lightweight Language Spirit」（以下、通称のLL魂を使用）が開催された。同イベントは2003年に「LL Satuday 」としてスタートして今年で5年目。2004年に「 LL
Weekend 」 、2005 年に「 LL
Day and Night 」 、2006 年に「 LL Ring」と少しずつ名称が変わっているが、一貫しているのは、毎年週末に行われるということだ。
約 500 人の聴衆が集まったイベント会場
最近LL言語はビジネス方面での応用が注目され始めているので、「そろそろ平日開催にして会社の業務として参加できるようにしてほしい」という声も聞こえてきそうだが、LL魂は週末が似合うイベントだ。セミナーや講演が中心のIT系イベントとは異なり、情報の発信・共有ということよりも、「プログラミング言語について語ること」「自分が好きなプログラミング言語がいかに優れているかをデモやベンチマーク結果を交えて自慢して、みなで盛り上がる場」「ハックの成果を披露する」という種類の“ お祭り” だ。昨年は「 LL Ring」と題してボクシングリングを囲んで言語別対決をやったりと、遊び心いっぱいの集まりだ。会場を見渡してもジーンズ姿が主流で、参加者には若い開発者や学生が多かったようだ。
ハックは 「 個人の表現 」
「 遊び心がある（playful）ことがハックの条件の1つです」。和田先生は、平均すると自分よりも3周りも4周りも年下ではないかという聴衆に向かって、終始楽しそうに語りかけた。和田先生は1931年生まれと高齢だが、ジーンズ姿で「次に読んでみたいソースコードはTeXで書かれたBASIC」と言って会場からリスペクトの混じった笑いを取るなど、ハッカーぶり健在といった様子だ。
和田先生のマサチューセッツ工科大学時代の研究仲間に、こんな人がいたそうだ。その人は、エレベータに乗り込むなり操作盤のパネルを開いてパチパチとスイッチを切り替え、1階から9階まで必ずノンストップで上がってしまい、1日の作業を終えて帰宅する際には、必ず自分の端末からエレベータを自分のいる階に呼び寄せてしまう。すごいのか、ずるいだけなのか、よく分からない。ともあれ、聞いている方もニヤリと笑ってしまうようなエピソード。遊び心があるのがハックだという格好の例だろう。
「 hack」の意味について、辞書の語釈をひもといて説明する和田先生
一般的な英語の辞典を引くと、 「 ハック 」 （hack）という動詞には、もともと「貸し馬」などの意味があったそうだが、もちろんコンピュータの世界でハックといえば、特別な意味がある。「新ハッカーズ辞典」
（The New Hacker 's Dictionary 、Eric.S.Raymond著）によれば、1番目に「必要なことをやるための、素早く、しかし上手いやり方ではない仕事」という定義があり、2番目に「必要なことをやるだけなのに、信じられないほどいい仕事で、おそらく非常に時間のかかる仕事」という定義が挙げられているという。和田先生は「1番と2番は矛盾していて、何だか分かったような分からないような定義ですね」と笑う。
ハックには斧で家具を作るという意味もあり、これが現在コンピュータの世界で使われているハッカーという言葉の語源に当たるのだという。そして、そのハックの成果というのは「個人の表現で、その人のキャラクターがにじみ出ているようなもの。チームではハックはできない」（和田先生）
和田先生が挙げる 「 非常なハック」とは
自身は軽量プログラミング言語は使わないという和田先生は、「今日はハードウェアについてお話ししましょう。昔のハードウェアは、今のソフトウェアより分かりやすかった」と、ハックの事例をいくつか挙げた。
1つは、最近ダ・ヴィンチ展で見たというレオナルド・ダ・ヴィンチが作った楕円コンパス。それは右の写真のように3本の支柱によって支えられた筒状の容れものに鉛筆を入れたシンプルな道具だ。鉛筆の長さは筒のアングルによって代わり、ぐるっと筒が回ると紙に楕円が描けるのだという。「数学の講義みたいになってきましたね」と笑いながら、和田先生は、その原理を説明した。

も う1つのハックは潮位予測器。潮の満ち引きによって、特定の港の水位が、日々どのように変化するかを予測するための機械式計算機だ。潮汐による水位の変化は、主に太陽と月の引力による。水位は、地球とこれらの天体との位置関係によって決まる。これは地球や月の自転・公転周期をパラメータとしたsin関数の合成によって求められる。これはつまり、特定の港で観察した水位の変化をフーリエ解析してパラメータを決定し、逆に求めたパラメータから、いくつかのsin波を合成して水位を求めるという話だ。緯度の異なる港ごとにパラメータは異なるため、それぞれの港に対して潮位予測表を作成しなければならない。
これは、現代なら電子式コンピュータが瞬時に答えを返してくる話だが、和田先生によれば、初期の潮位予測器が登場したのは19世紀。まだ電子計算機が姿もなかった時代、水位を求めるには玉、円柱、円盤、滑車を使ったのだという。
具体的な説明を聞いている途中で記者は理解不能で脱落したが（シャッターを押すのに忙しかったとしておく）、潮位予測器の原理は、およそこうだ。
中央に1本の足がついた円盤の上に、球と円柱を接触させて置く。円柱は上下にだけ動く。この円盤を回転させることで摩擦のある球と円柱がある関係で動き、円柱の移動距離を測ることでsin値が求まる。潮位予測器は、この円盤形の積分器をいくつか用意し、滑車とひもを組み合わせることでフーリエ合成を行う。最終的には「ひもの長さ」というアナログな値として、水位の時間変化を求め、ロール紙状のものに記録したのだという。
こうした潮位予測器は、日本でも気象庁が1930年から1960年まで使うなど、ごく最近まで使われていたといい、現在は上野の国立科学博物館に展示されている。同じ上野の博物館には9元連立方程式を解く機械も展示されているが、和田先生は、こうした機械は「非常なハックだ」と話す。一見ソフトウェアのプログラミングとは何の関係もなさそうだが、入手可能な道具を組み合わせてアルゴリズムを実現するという点では、むしろ、むき出しのアナログな機械式計算機のほうが、見て分かりやすいのかもしれない。

ところで、和田先生はダ・ヴィンチの楕円コンパスの図も潮位予測器の図もポストスクリプトで描いたという。「楕円コンパスの図はね、けっこう描くのが大変だった」というと、会場から「わざわざ難しいことを難しいやり方でやって喜ぶのがハッカーなのか」という、ちょっとトゲのある突っ込みが入った。すかさず和田先生は、「慣れでしょうね、私はファイルを開くと、まずパーセント、ビックリと入力しちゃうんですよ」と言い放ち、会場は拍手と笑いに包まれた。「％！」はポストスクリプトファイルの先頭2バイトだ。
ポストスクリプトはソフトウェアが出力するDTPデータや画像向けのフォーマットだが、ちょうどHTMLのように中身はテキストファイルで、その気になれば手書きも可能だ。変数や演算を用いたプログラミング言語的な処理も可能なことから、世の中には“ポストスクリプトを手書きするハッカー”という人種が存在する。
楕円コンパスぐらい、適当な画像作成ソフトを使えば済みそうな話だ。しかし、ハッカー辞典の2番目の定義はこうだった。「必要なことをやるだけなのに、信じられないほどいい仕事で、おそらく非常に時間のかかる仕事」。この定義を実演して見せた和田先生は、やはりハッカーだというほかない。

The FreeBSD Project is proud to have taken part in the Google Summer of Code 2007 .
We received more high quality applications this year than ever before .
In the end it was a very tough decision to narrow it down to the 25 students selected for funding by Google .
These student projects included security research , improved installation tools , new utilities , and more .
Many of the students have continued working on their FreeBSD projects even after the official close of the program .
We are happy to report that all students made some progress towards their goals for the summer , and the 22 students listed below completed the program successfully .
Information about the student projects is available from our Summer of Code wiki and all of the code is checked into Perforce .
The summaries below were submitted by the individual students and their mentors with minor editing for consistency .
Project : GNOME front - end to freebsd - update ( 8 )
Student : Andrew Turner
Mentor : Joe Marcus Clarke
Summary : The FreeBSD update front - end is a GTK + interface to freebsd - update .
It is split into a GUI to allow system administrators to select the binary patches to update or rollback and a back - end that communicates with freebsd - update .
Development of both parts has moved to Berlios at http://developer.berlios.de/projects/facund/.
Ready to enter CVS :
The back - end is not yet ready to enter CVS , but a port is being made for the front - end
Project : Multicast DNS responder ( BSD - licensed )
Student : Fredrik Lindberg
Mentor : Bruce M. Simpson
Summary : Multicast DNS ( mDNS ) is a part of Zero Configuration Networking ( Zeroconf ) and provides the ability to address hosts using DNS - like names without the need of an existing ( unicast ) , managed DNS server .
The Multicast DNS responder ( mdnsd ) , is more or less feature complete and is currently in a bug fixing and testing phase .
A few more features are planned , most notably mdns proxy support .
The daemon performs multicast dns queries on behalf of clients and acts as a unified cache to all clients .
Provides the ability to announce its own mdns records onto the network .
The daemons abilities are exposed to clients through libmdns , it provides an API to do mDNS queries and to add / remove / list records and view / flush cache .
Two consumers exists , one console based basic debugging and administrative utility ( mdns ) which simply provides whatever libmdns provides and a NSS module ( nss_mdns ) which integrates mDNS lookups with the systems name lookup routines .
Ready to enter CVS : after testing and reviewing
Project : Unified ports / package system database backend
Student : Garrett Cooper
Mentor : Kirill Ponomarew
Summary :
This project revised FreeBSD 's package tools ( /usr/src/usr.sbin/pkg_install ) to use Berkeley DB files for storing information held in / var / db / pkg /* , and use Hash table structures .
It also aims to devise a frontend for dealing with package and ports installation and management and insert virtuals into ports infrastructure to support modular components functionality , for dealing with ports installed components vs base installed components ( OpenSSL , OpenSSH , Kerberos ) .
Ready to enter CVS : not determined yet
Project : Super Tunnel Daemon
Student : Matus Harvan
Mentor : Max Laier
Summary :
The project implements the Super Tunnel Daemon , a tunneling daemon using plugins for different encapsulations and automagically selecting the best encapsulation in each environment .
When the environment changes , the user should not notice the transition to a different encapsulation except for a small delay .
Connections established within the tunnel shall seamlessly migrate to a different encapsulation .
In this way , mobility is supported as well , even to the extent of changing between different physical network interfaces , e.g. disabling the wireless interface and plugging in an ethernet cable .
New encapsulations can easily be added in the future using the plugin interface .
The daemon and several plugins have been written .
The daemon now has multi-user support , i.e. , one server supports multiple clients .
Plugins implemented so far are UDP , TCP , ICMP , DNS .
There are also sys patches allowing it to listen on all unused UDP and TCP ports as well as processing ICMP echo requests in the user space .
Missing features : more plugins ( HTTP , SSH , ...)
config file format and parsing
and some more ...
More details are available at http://wiki.freebsd.org/mtund
Ready to enter CVS : after some additional features as part of the Ports Collection
Project : Rewriting lockmgr( 9 )
Student : Attilio Rao
Mentor : Jeff Roberson
Summary :
This project involved rewriting the lockmgr synchronization primitive since recent efforts ( in particular sun4v porting ) evicted that this is a strong bottleneck for fs workloads ( due to its spreadness in VFS land ) .
One of the main goals of the rewriting was offering a more customized interface , trimming all unused ( and possibly bugged ) features of lockmgr and offering a more intelligent interface ( that would help a lot in debugging and lock assertions ) .
Ready to enter CVS : not determined yet
Project : Apple 's MacBook on FreeBSD
Student : Rui Paulo
Mentor : Andre Oppermann
Summary : Apple 's MacBook computers are nicely designed and have neat features that other laptops do n't .
While Mac OS
X is a nice operating system , UNIX folks ( like me ) would prefer to run other operating systems like FreeBSD .
This project brings bug fixes and new drivers to FreeBSD that help running this OS on this platform .

Project : Security regression tests
Student : Zhouyi ZHOU
Mentor : Robert Watson
Summary :
This project involved testing the correctness of FreeBSD Mandatory Access Control Framework including correctly passing the security label from userland to kernel and non-bypassibility of Mandatory Access Control Hooks .
Specific contributions include : A pair of pseudo ethernet drivers used for testing network related hooks .
To avoid the packet go through the lo interface , the IP address in the packet is twisted in the driver .
A framework for logging Mandatory Access Control hooks which is called during a period of time .
In kernel , every non-null label is got externalized into human readable string and recorded in a tail queue together with the name of hook that got called and possible flags or modes ( etc. VREAD / VWRITE for mac_check_vnode_open hook ) .
There is a thread much like audit subsystem 's audit_worker logging the queue into a userspace file .
The userland program use open , ioctl and close the / dev / mactest node to trigger and stop the logging .
The logging file is truncated to zero every time the logging mechanism is triggered .
In userland , a bison based parsing tool is used to parse the logged file and reconstruct the record chain which will be compared with testsuite supplied configuration file to examine if expected hooks is got called and the label / flags / modes are correct .
The testsuite mainly follows src / tools / regression / fstest , modified to adapt to test Mandatory Access Control Framework and include tests for signals
The test cases about mandatory access control hooks for fifo , link , mdconfig , netinet , open , pipe , rename , rmdir , signal , symlink , sysvshm and truncate are written .
Two security vulnerabilities where found during the test case writing .

Project : GVinum Enhancements
Student : Ulf Lilleengen
Mentor : Lukas Ertl
Summary :
The project schedule was a bit changed in the start , because there were some rewriting of some internal parts of gvinum .
Much of the time went to adapt the rest of gvinum to this new event - based system .
This rewrite made gvinum less vulnerable to race bugs , and made it much easier for a developer to reason about the code .
Improvements were made to the rebuild and syncing process of volumes , so that one could still use the volume ( e.g. have it mounted ) while rebuilding or syncing gvinum plexes .
The growing of striped volumes ( includes RAID - 5 ) in the background was also implemented .
Perhaps most important , is that most important gvinum features were implemented , and many bugs were fixed .
A lot of testing has been done to make gvinum more robust .

Project : TCP / IP regression test suite
Student : Nanjun Li
Mentor : George V. Neville - Neil
Summary :
The project was about a testing suite for any host 's perform - ability in TCP / IP networks .
N. Li implemented it on a FreeBSD machine using libpcap ( a library of BSD Packet Filter ) to sniff frames on MAC layer , decode them into human - readable format , and send crafted ones to examinate if the target host follows RFC793 's requirements .

Project : Avoiding syscall overhead
Student : Jesper Brix Rosenkilde
Mentor : Scott Long
Summary :
In FreeBSD the setproctitle call is implemented with a sysctl , this has the unfortunate side effect that this simple call locks the Giant - lock .
As this call is a simple matter of setting a value , it could be better implemented with shared memory between the kernel and user - space .
This project proposes a scheme to securely share process specific data between the kernel and a user - space process .
This is done by having each process allocate a special memory page , in which the kernel and user - space process can share data .
This will give the security needed , as the VM - system will make sure that no outside processes can fiddle with a process ' data .
As everything is going on in user - space , there is no concern about a rogue process could write inside the kernel memory .
There is still a locking concern , which will be addressed either by locking the entire page , or micro-locking each data field on the page .
A suggestion by Howard Su is a multi page scheme , where a read / write page is used for things like get / setproctitle and a read - only page for things like getpid .
And maybe a system wide read - only page for things like getdomain , gethostname etc .

Project : Port OpenBSD 's sysctl Hardware Sensors framework
Student : Constantine A. Murenin
Mentor : Shteryana Shopova
Summary : The GSoC2007 / cnst - sensors project was about porting the sysctl hw.sensors framework from OpenBSD to FreeBSD .
The project was successfully completed , and is pending final review and integration into the CVS tree .
The sensors framework provides a unified interface for storing , registering and accessing information about hardware monitoring sensors .
Sensor types include , but are not limited to , temperature , voltage , fan RPM , time offset and logical drive status .
In the OpenBSD base system , the framework spans sensor_attach ( 9 ) , sysctl ( 3 ) , sysctl ( 8 ) , systat ( 1 ) , sensorsd ( 8 ) , ntpd ( 8 ) , and more than 50 drivers , ranging from I2C temperature sensors and Super I /O hardware monitors to ipmi( 4 ) and RAID controllers .
Several third - party tools are also available , for example , a plug - in for Nagios and ports / sysutils / symon .
As a part of this project , all major parts of the framework were ported , including sysctl , systat and sensorsd .
Some drivers for most popular Super I/O Hardware Monitors were ported , too : it ( 4 ) , supporting most contemporary ITE Tech Super I /O , and lm ( 4 ) , supporting most contemporary Winbond Super I/O. Moreover , some existing FreeBSD drivers were modified to use the new framework , for example , coretemp ( 4 ) .

Project : Distributed audit daemon
Student : Alexey Mikhailov
Mentor : Bjoern A. Zeeb
Summary :
The basic idea of this project was to implement secure and reliable log file shipping to remote hosts .
While the implementation focuses on audit logs , the goal was to build tools that will make it possible to perform distributed logging for any application by using a simple API and linking with a shared library .
The audit logs served as a testbed , other logs can be adopted .

Project : Generic input device layer
Student : Maxim Zhuravlev
Mentor : Philip Paeps
Summary : Originally selected to design and implement a common way to retrieve and process data from input devices , the project resulted in a code base of a bigger and more generic project -- Enhanced NewBus .
The following features are introduced by now : basic functional devices support , filter drivers and NewBus input / output subsystem .
Functional devices ( ex. demuxing , muxing , terminals ) are supposed to coordinate real devices .
Each device is handled by a stack of drivers ( low - level and filters ) .
Filter drivers are to simplify code reuse .
The NewBus input / output subsystem is designed to push io requests through the NewBus graph .

Project : bus_alloc_resources ()
Code Update
Student : Christopher Davis
Mentor : Warner Losh
Summary : Currently , many devices in FreeBSD 's source tree use the excessively verbose methods of resource allocation and deallocation .
Numerous calls to bus_alloc_resource ( ) or bus_alloc_resource_any ( ) are used to allocate resources , and subsequently , multiple calls to bus_release_resource ( ) are used to free the resources after an error in allocation or when the device is detached .
Recently , however , the bus_alloc_resources ( ) and bus_release_resources ( ) functions have been added .
These simple wrappers around bus_alloc_resource_any ( ) and bus_release_resource ( ) both operate on the same resource description , so that much of the repetition once needed to allocate and free resources can be mitigated .
This project updated driver source code where necessary using the new functions to make the code related to allocation and deallocation simpler and clearer , while making other refinements as needed .
Approximately 40 drivers were updated during SoC , although testing is still needed .
There are likely 25 or more other drivers that could be updated as well , and these are listed on the wiki .

Project : FreeBSD ' safety net '
IO logging utility
Student : Sonja Milicic
Mentor : Lukas Ertl
Summary : Some administrative operations like filesystem or partition table debugging / repair would benefit from an " Undo " function , so they can be performed without putting vital data at risk .
This project 's goal was to implement a module which plugs into the GEOM framework and allows copy - on - write style logging of I / O requests to one or more snapshot files , including the possibility to rollback , replay or analyze their effects .
The core functionality of this module and a userland tool was finished , but will need more testing / bug fixing .

Project : Graphical installer for FreeBSD ( finstall )
Student : Ivan Voras
Mentor : Murray Stokely
Summary :
This project aims to create a user - friendly graphical installer for FreeBSD & FreeBSD - derived systems .
The project should yield something usable for 7.x - RELEASE , but the intention is to keep it as a " second " installer system during 7.x , alongside sysinstall .
In any case , sysinstall will be kept for architectures not supported by finstall ( e.g. currently all except i386 and amd64 ) .

Mr Erdogan , who has resisted demands from the Turkish armed forces for the past six months for a green light to cross the border into Iraqi Kurdistan , where the guerrillas are based , called an emergency meeting of national security chiefs to ponder their options in the crisis , a session that some said was tantamount to a war council .
A Turkish incursion is fiercely opposed by Washington since it would immensely complicate the US campaign in Iraq and destabilise the only part of Iraq that functions , the Kurdish - controlled north .
Two Turkish soldiers were killed yesterday in booby trap explosions laid by guerrillas of the Kurdistan Workers ' party ( PKK ) - fighters classified as terrorists by Ankara , Washington and the European Union .
Those casualties followed the killing of 13 Turkish soldiers in the south - east on Sunday when PKK forces outgunned a Turkish unit of 18 men without sustaining any casualties , according to the Kurds .
Last week , in an ambush also ascribed to the PKK , gunmen sprayed a bus with automatic fire in the same region , killing 13 civilians , including a boy of seven .
The Turkish media described the toll from the attacks as the worst in 12 years in a conflict spanning several decades that has taken almost 40,000 lives .
Mr Erdogan is known to think little of the invasion option , making the pragmatic calculation that it would probably fail .
Western diplomats in Ankara agree that an invasion could be counter - productive .
The Turkish military raided Iraqi Kurdistan dozens of times in the 1990s but were unable to suppress the insurgency .
After a cabinet meeting dominated by the Kurdish conflict , Cemil Cicek , the Turkish government spokesman , said yesterday : " What is at issue here is how much any action we decide to take would bring us closer to a result . "
He did not rule out an invasion but queried its " usefulness " .
The prime minister , however , is being challenged by the army command , which earlier this year demanded his authority to invade .
He is also vulnerable to a mounting public clamour to act because of the upsurge in guerrilla activity and the heavy casualties being suffered .
Hardline Turkish nationalists entered parliament in Ankara following elections in July and they are also baying for Kurdish blood .
Following the soldiers ' deaths on Sunday , Mr Erdogan signalled a shift in policy without specifying how .
" Our campaign against terrorism will continue in a different manner , " he said .
The Turkish military has just declared 27 " security zones " on the Iraqi and Iranian borders off - limits to civilians , suggesting to some that it might be gearing up for an invasion .
But despite the rising violence , Mr Erdogan has opted for politics in his attempts to defuse the conflict with the Kurds .
His Justice and Development party ( AKP ) enjoyed a stunning success among the Kurdish minority , concentrated in the south - east , in the July elections and he has also focused on political pacts with Baghdad to get the better of the guerrillas .
Last week Iraqi and Turkish interior ministers signed an accord aimed at combating the PKK by trying to cut the rebels ' funding and logistics , and agreeing to extradite captured " terrorists " .
The accord , however , took three days to thrash out ; Turkish insistence on a " hot pursuit " formula , allowing cross - border raids , was denied , and scepticism is high as to whether Baghdad can deliver .
Officially , Ankara refuses to recognise or deal with the government of Iraqi Kurdistan , although there have been back - channel attempts over the past year to engage with Massoud Barzani , the president of the Iraqi Kurdish region .
Mr Erdogan 's options are also constrained by strong US hostility to an invasion .
While Turkish public opinion has been strongly anti-American since the 2003 invasion of Iraq , much of the logistical support for the US troops goes to Iraq via Turkey .
Relations are also under severe strain because of US congressional moves to brand the 1915 massacres of Armenians in Ottoman Turkey as " genocide " .
Mr Erdogan sent aides to Washington yesterday to lobby Congress on the " genocide " resolution .
Ankara is also warning that it could block the logistical support to the US in Iraq if the resolution is passed .
PKK guerrillas
The Kurdish separatist guerrillas of the Kurdistan Workers ' party , or PKK , have been at war with the Turkish state since the early 1980s .
Although it is now said to favour home rule within Turkey over secession , the PKK has historically pursued the breakaway of Kurdish - dominated south - east Turkey as a prelude to unifying Kurdish lands in Turkey , Iraq , Iran and Syria .
Turkey pursued a scorched earth policy in the 1980s and 1990s , destroying thousands of villages , sending millions of Kurds west and leaving some 37,000 dead .
Turkey 's biggest coup came in 1999 with the capture of the PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan , who was jailed for life .
ARROYO GRANDE , Calif. ( MarketWatch ) --
Yes , you 're saving too much for retirement .
But is n't that counterintuitive in today 's uncertain world , where more is never enough ?
No , because there 's some powerful new research to prove it .
Yeah , I know , you 're going to insist on telling me why you really need a million bucks invested at 6 % to generate $ 60,000 annual cash flow in retirement .
But I already know why : Because that 's what all those fancy online financial calculators tell you , right ?
Oh , wake up , a sixth grader could calculate that number without breaking a sweat .
And Charles Schwab has an even simpler version :
In " You 're Fifty -- Now What ? " he offered this formula : " It 's pretty easy to get a ballpark idea of how much you 'll need .
To get a rough estimate , you can use what I call my guideline of 230K , which says for every $ 1,000 you 'll need each month , you should have at least $ 230,000 invested when you stop working . "
Get it ?
You 'd need five times $ 230,000 or $ 1.15 million to retire on $ 60,000 annually .
And that 's real bad news folks , because the average American has a net worth less than $ 50,000 , exclusive of home equity .
Warning , you 're being hypnotized : Wall Street insiders , bankers , brokers , advisers and their buddies want you to pile up assets .
Why ?
Not for your own good , but because the more securities you own , the more money they make in fees !
Get it ?
This ingenious game caught fire in the mid-1990s when Wall Street began a historic revolution :
First : business model .
The 1995 - 96 SEC's Tully Commission articulated an industrywide strategic shift from cyclical commission income to a more stable fee - based business model .
Shortly afterwards Goldman - Sachs released its famous report on financial industry mergers and consolidations .
Tully was also Merrill 's CEO .
In 1998 I interviewed one of Merrill 's top lieutenants who said the company 's business plan called for a doubling of assets under management within five years .

In 1998 I interviewed one of Merrill 's top lieutenants who said the company 's business plan called for a doubling of assets under management within five years .
Second : ethics and image .
Simultaneously , Wall Street was under pressure to clean up its act .
Studies revealed " brokers " had the ethics of used - car - salesmen .
So Wall Street 's gave " brokers " new name tags , as " advisers " managing assets .
As a result , Main Street is now in a no -win situation .
Jack Bogle 's famous " Iron Law of the Markets " puts this assets - based monster in context with his new " Little Book of Common Sense Investing : " " Trying to beat the stock market is theoretically a zero - sum game ( for every winner , there must be a loser ) , but after the substantial costs of investing are deducted , it becomes a loser 's game . "
Bogle has had a consistent solution to the " Iron Law " dilemma for three decades :
" The simplest and most efficient investment strategy is to buy and hold all of the nation 's publicly held businesses at very low cost .
The classic index fund that owns this market portfolio is the only investment that guarantees you with your fair share of stock market returns . "
We 've put this strategy into action with our lazy indexed portfolios .
See how the lazy portfolios have beaten the market .
Unfortunately , Wall Street understands the " Iron Law " better than Bogle !
Wall Street knows it cannot charge big management fees off low - cost index funds .
So Wall Street is relentlessly hypnotizing investors into believing that actively managed funds beat the indexes even though about 80 % fail to do so , largely because their average expense ratios are 10 to 15 times the fees charged by index funds .
New research challenges online calculators
In other words , Wall Street and friends have a substantial unstated self - interest in encouraging you to invest more than you need for retirement .
I 've been making this argument for years and finally it 's being documented in research by economists who also are n't buying into Wall Street 's hype .
The leader of this counterintuitive challenge is Larry Kotlikoff , a Boston University economics professor and co-author of " The Coming Generational Storm , " an analysis of dire solutions necessary to cover future unfunded Social Security and Medicare benefits .
His co-author is financial columnist Scott Burns of the Dallas Morning News .
Kotlikoff 's research says investors should focus on income while working to figure out retirement needs .
Saving too much ?
You bet .
A New York Times review of Kotlikoff 's numbers " showed that Fidelity 's online calculators typically set the target of assets needed to cover spending in retirement 36.4 % too high .
Vanguard 's was 53.1 % too high .
A calculator offered by TIAA - CREF , one of the largest managers of retirement savings , was 78 % " higher than the calculations generated by Kotlikoff 's ESPlanner .
As expected , they were quite defensive about this challenge .
The Times says : " The financial - planning industry prefers to characterize itself as cautious .
William Ebsworth , chief investment officer of Fidelity Investments ' Strategic Advisers division , which runs retirement programs , said , ' We take a very conservative approach , ' preferring to err on the side of having money left over at death rather than risk running out before then . "
While their reaction is understandable , it 's a diversion :
They fail to deal with their own conflict of interest and motives in overstating assets needed in retirement .
So let 's repeat it again :
You are unnecessarily investing too much of your hard - earned money into too many assets for retirement .
As a result , you 're sacrificing too much of the present , under the highly questionable and misleading assumptions about piling up excessive savings for an uncertain future .
In planning , forget assets , focus on income
Conversely , Burns tells me that " most people are actually better off than they think because they 've never lived at the 70 % to 85 % of preretirement income living standard that conventional financial planning espouses .
And the reason is simple : if you have a family , having children is a long - term suppressant on your adult standard of living . "
The fallacy with Wall Street 's logic is also simple :
They focus on assets , the exact same strategy Goldman - Sachs , Merrill Lynch and Wall Street 's insiders have been focusing on since the mid-1990s .
Why ?
Because it 's making billions .
Between 1995 and 2005 this strategy has roughly tripled assets under management for Wall Street and mutual fund firms , according to the Bogle Research Institute , with annual revenues also tripling to over $ 350 billion by 2005 , while returns to Main Street investors have actually declined in the past decade .
So please , forget assets .
Here 's another example to prove our point :
Suppose you retire from government or corporate life , with a pension generating $ 60,000 annually , with no assets !
Ergo , those silly asset - based calculators are misleading .
I encourage you to go back and review our earlier , detailed example of the elements included in an income - based formula .
Focus on income : Pensions , Social Security , IRAs , and a new career , business or some part - time work .
And remember , savvy families also quietly build wealth in home equity .
Pay off the mortgage , live debt - free .
Downsize .
Maybe cut costs moving to a cheaper region .
Go for a reverse mortgage .
Be creative .
Add up these pieces of income and you 'll see how to reach whatever you need to live comfortably in retirement .
‘ Internet addiction ’ does n’t exist .
It can ’t , because it ’s a logical impossibility , a category error , and there ’s no good evidence that heavy internet use , in itself , is a risk to mental health .
A paper of mine , just published in the Journal of Mental Health [ pdf ] , describes why , but I ’m going to summarise the arguments here because of an infuriating and self - contradictory press release about “ Internet addiction disorder ” that seems to be all over the internet .
Perhaps the most important point is the concept of ‘ internet addiction ’ relies on a fundamental misunderstanding of what the internet is .
‘ Internet addiction ’ researchers conceive of the internet as if it were a set of activities when , in fact , it ’s a medium for communication .
People become addicted to substances or activities , but it ’s impossible to become addicted to a medium .
You can be no more addicted to the internet than you can to language or radio waves .
This is important because the proposed criteria for internet addiction or pathological internet use ( there is no accepted classification , contrary to what the press release says ) typically make reference to ‘ using the internet ’ or ‘ spending time online ’ without reference to any specific activity .
It ’s important to specify specific activities , because , as noted above , the concept of a behavioural addiction logically requires one .
It ’s also important to make the distinction between something being compulsive , something that you want to do again ( commonly , but confusingly , called ‘ addictive ’ in everyday language ) , and a fully - fledged behavioural addiction – a mental disorder where you keep doing the activity even when it has serious damaging effects .
The cinema , reading books , going for walks , chatting to friends and any other enjoyable activity can be compulsive , but it does n’t make it an addiction , even if it ’s a daily time consuming activity and you get pissed off if you ca n’t do it .
Some online activities are almost universally accepted as being genuinely addictive ( e.g. gambling ) whereas others are subject to significant debate ( e.g. gaming , chat ) .
This is not to say that some of the people who have been described as having ‘ internet addiction ’ do n’t have any problems or are n’t suffering .
There are definitely people who are dysfunctional in day - to - day life , have significant problems with mood and motivation , and who spend a huge amount of time online .
However , there ’s little evidence that heavy internet use actually causes these problems :
Although initial work suggested that time spent online was correlated with a small but significant increase in loneliness and depression ( Kraut et al. , 1998 ) , subsequent replications and extensions found the reverse ( Howard et al. , 2001 ; Moody , 2001 ; Wastlund et al. , 2001 ) and a follow - up to the original Kraut et al .
study found the negative effects were no longer present and that , in contrast , internet use was generally associated with positive effects on communication , social involvement , and well - being ( Kraut et al. , 2002 ) .
A key finding from this latter study was that extroverts generally showed a positive relationship between internet use and social well - being measures , whereas introverts showed the reverse ‚ Äì reporting an increase in isolation and loneliness .
It is still not clear why this might be the case , although it has been suggested that the internet might provide tools to ‚ Äòamplify ‚
Äô predispositions ( Joinson , 2003 ) , so that extraverts can meet more people and socialise , while introverts can keep them at a distance .
Furthermore , it ’s difficult to see why addiction is the best way of understanding these problems .
Addiction researcher Prof Mark Griffiths has outlined some elements that an activity needs to have to be considered addictive , notably salience , mood modification , tolerance , withdrawal , conflict and relapse .
He also notes that the proposed description of ‘ internet addiction ’ does not fulfil these criteria .
The core problem is not using repetitive , extended internet use , or even intrusive thoughts about keeping track of online events ( otherwise 90 % of the office workforce would be diagnosed ) , but low mood and social withdrawal .
In Japan , almost exactly the same problems have been named ‘ hikkikomori ‘ .
One of the key characteristics of hikkikomori individuals is that they isolate themselves and occupy their time with the internet and video games .
But the Japanese , rather sensibly , identify the core problem as social withdrawal , and the excessive solitary activities as symptoms – just ways in which isolated people try to fill the void .
In fact , this is exactly what a recent study of internet game users found : the driving force behind internet games was less the ‘ fun ’ , the kick of the game if you will , but instead a sense of achievement , freedom and social connectedness .
There ’s always a temptation to try and fit fuzzy human problems into comfortable pre-existing categories because it makes us feel useful and qualified to use our existing tools .
Psychiatrists and psychologists have clear and defined treatments for addiction but very little for social withdrawal , because social withdrawal is n’t a diagnosis in itself .
The press release is apparently based on a published paper in the Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology , although it has yet to appear .
It may contain a revolutionary new argument , but I doubt it , as there is not a single study showing that heavy internet use causes the features of an addiction .
And certainly not the supposedly “ extreme and menacing ” condition that is described as affecting 10 % of all internet users .

With tough new U.S. sanctions against Iran now in place , the next step falls to European nations :
Will they agree on biting measures of their own , the only way to make the unilateral U.S. action truly effective ?
European officials expressed worry Friday that the Bush administration ’s designation of Iranian agencies and firms as supporters of terrorism and purveyors of weapons threatens efforts to bring Iran back into the fold of diplomacy .
That could erect a formidable barricade against relations with Tehran for years to come , some analysts warned .
“ It will make things much more difficult , ” said Alex Bigham of the London - based Foreign Policy Center , echoing the uneasy sentiment across the continent about the go - it - alone U.S. stand .
“ Obviously this is about Bush trying to be tough and ratchet up the pressure on Iran , but also it ’s kind of trying to lock in his successor .
Because it ’s one thing to put an organization on the terrorist list , and quite another matter to take it off . ”
The U.S. on Thursday imposed sweeping sanctions targeting Iran ’s Revolutionary Guard Corps , which it labeled a proliferator of weapons of mass destruction , and more than 20 individuals and companies associated with the powerful military organization .
The Revolutionary Guard ’s Quds Force unit was declared a supporter of terrorism .

The measures not only prohibit U.S. business contacts but also threaten access to American markets for foreign companies that do business with designated companies in Iran .
But many European analysts said Friday that it would be difficult to hope to engage Tehran in negotiations while attempting to isolate groups such as the Revolutionary Guard , from whose ranks Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and many of his colleagues have emerged .
Cornering Iran ’s military hard - liners could diminish the government ’s willingness to negotiate and is unlikely to produce the hoped - for wedge between the Revolutionary Guard and the Iranian public , many Europeans fear .
“ The idea that there is a clear separation between the population and the Revolutionary Guard is completely false , ” said Thierry Colville of the Institute for International and Strategic Relations in Paris .

“ There has been an eight - year war with 500,000 dead in Iran , ” he said , referring to the Iran - Iraq war in the 1980s .
“ It looks like the U.S. has forgotten this war , which legitimized the Guard . ”
European leaders feel compelled to support those in the Bush administration who favor sanctions over military threats , yet are concerned about jeopardizing their own lucrative business ties to Iran .
Europe is Iran ’s biggest trading partner , and even the tough new U.S. sanctions will not bite unless European businesses scale back their multibillion - dollar trade and investments in Iran .
Several European banks have curbed their ties with Tehran .
But European oil and engineering firms continue to do a robust trade , underwriting much of Iran ’s new oil and gas expansion and industrial operations .
Still , a consensus is emerging that the European Union will have to adopt its own unilateral sanctions , possibly within the next few weeks , to complement the U.S. action .
Europe ’s support is needed , particularly in the face of Russian and Chinese reluctance , if the administration hopes to force Iran to back down on its controversial uranium enrichment program .

Russia ’s position was clear Friday : “ Why aggravate the situation now , why push [ Iran ] into a blind alley , threaten it with sanctions or hostilities ? ” said President Vladimir V. Putin , who a day earlier described the new U.S. sanctions as “ running around like a madman with a razor blade in his hand . ”
Britain , which has come out strongly endorsing both the unilateral U.S. steps and the idea of a third round of United Nations sanctions if Iran does not comply with international demands , is pushing for strong EU action .
But the U.S. should not get impatient if the Europeans take their time in order to achieve a consensus , especially since Europe has already imposed an arms embargo on Iran , a British official said Friday , speaking on condition of anonymity .
“ The EU have n’t exactly been sitting and not delivering anything on this .
Yes , it has been a slow process , but that ’s the way the EU works , on the basis of consensus , ” the official said .

Now , following French President Nicolas Sarkozy ’s call for independent EU action on sanctions to back up President Bush , European leaders are looking at various measures .
They include banning travel and restricting visas for some Iranian officials , freezing assets and levying penalties that would target key players in Iran ’s nuclear program .
“ You ’ve got to hit them where it hurts , which is obviously what the Americans decided to do .
So now is the time to bring the EU ’s quite significant pressure to bear on Iran , and look at practical measures , ” the British official said .
European leaders say an EU decision could be made within the next few weeks , with the possibility of another round of sanctions at the United Nations Security Council if the U.N. 's nuclear monitoring organization , the International Atomic Energy Agency , does not report full cooperation from Iran before then .
Bringing on board nations such as Germany and Italy , which together had more than $ 7 billion in exports to Iran last year , will be difficult .
Berlin already saw Russia pick up the contracts German companies abandoned for Iran ’s Bushehr nuclear power station ; now , European companies fear that Russia and China will move in if the EU imposes sanctions outside a U.N. framework .

There are signs , however , that both Germany and Italy are prepared to back whatever consensus is reached within the EU .
One factor is Germany ’s desire to make sure sanctions have a chance to work , as a means of discouraging the alternative prospect of military action , said Henning Riecke of the German Council on Foreign Relations in a phone interview from Berlin .
“ If you have too weak sanctions , or if you do n’t agree to them , you might play into the hands of those in Washington who want to seek a military solution , the Cheney faction , ” Riecke said , referring to U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney .
“ So to support the supporters of a diplomatic solution , you had better support sanctions . ”
Italy so far has taken a wait - and - see approach , preferring no increase in sanctions , but unprepared to buck a European tide .

It seems unlikely that France ’s Sarkozy will be successful in prevailing on his European partners to adopt tough unilateral sanctions , said Franco Pavoncello , president of John Cabot University in Rome , in a telephone interview .
Many feel “ that maybe this is not the proper time to push the Iranians into a corner . ”
“ But should Europe go along with America , ” Pavoncello said , “ you wo n’t have Italy producing a lonely voice and saying no . ”

Local authorities and environmentalists are protesting construction of a $ 1 billion natural gas terminal in Mexico about 50 miles south of the U.S. border .
The Sempra Energy terminal , now in the final phases of construction , will receive liquefied natural gas from overseas via tanker , and inject it into existing natural gas pipelines , The San Diego Union - Tribune reported Sunday .
But the gas that will be processed at the new terminal contains higher levels of chemicals that produce nitrous oxide , which contributes to ozone pollution , the newspaper said .
Once the gas is imported to the United States , it could considerably worsen air quality in Southern California .
The technology to make the gas cleaner exists , the Union - Tribune said , but regulator are not requiring it be used , and Sempra does not want to assume the additional cost .
Sempra has said the connection between gas that has not been cleaned and higher levels of air pollution has not been scientifically proven .

An enormous cold spot in our universe could be explained by a cosmic defect in the fabric of space - time created shortly after the Big Bang , scientists say .
If confirmed by future studies , the finding , detailed in the Oct. 25 issue of the journal Science , could provide cosmologists with a long - sought clue about how the infant universe evolved .
But other scientists , and even members of the study team , are skeptical of the new claim .
Cosmic ice cubes
Scientists think that shortly after the Big Bang , as the universe cooled and expanded , exotic particles transformed into the particles we know today via phase transitions similar to the gas - liquid - solid transitions that matter now experiences on Earth .
And like phase transitions on Earth , defects inevitably occur .
When water crystallizes to ice , for example , cloudy spots appear in the ice that mark where water molecules are misaligned .
Physicists predict that similar defects happened during the phase transitions of the early universe , and that the defects took different forms .
The team thinks a cold spot in the cosmic microwave background ( CMB ) — an energy artifact of the Big Bang that has been detected and mapped by NASA 's Wilkinson Microwave Anisotopy Probe ( WMAP ) satellite — represents the most complex kind of cosmic defect , a 3 - D blob - like structure called a texture .
Marcos Cruz of the Instituto de Fisica de Cantabria in Spain and colleagues analyzed the CMB cold spot , which spans 1 billion light - years across , finding it had properties consistent with a texture .
" The cosmic microwave background is the most ancient image we have of the universe , and therefore it's one of the most valuable tools to understand the universe 's origins , " Cruz said .
" If this spot is a texture , it would allow us to discriminate among different theories that have been proposed for how the universe evolved . "
' Not compelling '
Other scientists say the team 's case for a cosmic defect is still weak .
" It would be spectacular , and a new handle on the early universe , if this cold spot turned out to be a texture as opposed to a random fluctuation , which is perhaps a more likely explanation , " said Lyman Page , a WMAP team member at Princeton University who was not involved in the study .
Liliya Williams and Lawrence Rudnick , astronomers at the University of Minnesota , recently attributed the CMB cold spot not to a cosmic defect , but to an enormous " hole " in our galaxy , devoid of stars , gas and even dark matter , a mysterious substance thought to pervade the universe but which has so far eluded direct detection .
A " cosmic defect is an intriguing and plausible explanation .
However , I do n't think one can dismiss a void as the cause of the CMB cold spot , " Williams said in an e-mail interview .
" Whatever the correct interpretation will turn out to be , it is bound to open a new window on the early universe , but what we 'll see through that window is still not clear . "
Study team member Neil Turok of the University of Cambridge admits his team 's case is " not at all compelling " at the moment .
The cold spot could be a texture , but there is a 1 percent probability it is just a random temperature fluctuation in the CMB .
" What makes this so interesting is that there are a number of follow - up checks , which can now be done , " Turok said .
" So the texture hypothesis is actually very testable . "
A cosmic texture would cause light passing through it to bend and point in certain ways that should be detectable by future space missions , Turok said .

Lfix X. F X = All X. ( F X -> X ) ->
X .
Gfix X. F X = Exists X. ( X -> F X ) * X .
という定義はどっから降ってきたのかというと、単に、こういう話のような。
以下、f をFunctor、inF :: f( Fix(f ) ) ->
Fix (f ) として、 buildF : :( forall x.( f x -> x ) -> x ) ->
Fix f build F ( g ) =g ( inF ) とすると、acid rain theoremから、g : : forall x.( f x -> x ) -> xに対して、 fold phi ( buildF g ) == g( phi ) が成り立って、 flip fold ( buildF g ) == g 逆に、a : : Fix fについて、 buildF ( flip fold a ) == flip fold a inF = fold in F a = a より、build Fとflip fold は互いに 「 逆写像 」
buildの意味をよく理解してなかったよ。GFixに対して、unfold/destroyで同じことができそうだけど、Existsというのは、どっからでてきたのか謎。
( 2006/11/30追記 ) http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/519604.htmlの214ページあたりによると、
exists x.t = forall c.( forall x.(t-> c ) ->c ) ( 但し、cはtの自由変数でない )
という定義で、destroyの型が
destroy :: Functor f => ( forall x . ( x -> f x ) -> x -> c ) ->
Fix f -> c
なので、destroyをflipしたものが、同形を与えるんでないかな。確かめてないけど、きっとそう
Church Encodingについて。結局自然数型Natには、2種類定義があって、その二つが一致するのは何でかという話に。一つ目の定義は、関手NatFの不動点で、もう一つの定義は、
Nat = forall x.( x->x )->x->x
で、もう一つの定義は、関 手NatFの不動点。
NatF t = ZeroF | SucF t
で、( 一般化した ) buildの定義を思い出すと
buildF ::( forall x.( NatF x ->x ) ->x ) ->( Fix NatF )
で、build F は「 同形写像 」なので、( forall x.( NatF x ->x ) ->x ) < => forall x.( x->x )->x->xが言えればよくて(<=>は自然な一対一対応が存在するという意味)、形式的に
( NatF x -> x ) -> x < => ( ( Either ( ) x ) -> x ) -> x<=> ( x->x )->x->x
が成り立つという、そんだけの話か。Fix( NatF ) に、どういう要素が含まれるかは、一概にはいえないけど、集合の圏で考えれば、通常の自然数の集合になる( はず ) 。
分かって見ると、しょうもないというか、これが理解できないと、普通のリストに対するfoldr/buildとgenericなfold/buildが繋がらないな･･･(なんか勘でやってたけど)
foldr : : forall a. ( forall x.(a->x->x ) ->x ->[ a ] ->x ) forall a. ( forall x.(a->x->x )->x->[ a ] ->x ) < => forall a. ( forall x.( ( a, x ) ->x ) ->x->[ a ] ->x ) < => forall a. ( forall x. ( ( Either ( ) ( a, x ) ) ->x ) ->[ a ] ->x ) < => forall a. ( forall x. ( ( ListF a x ) ->x ) ->[ a ] ->x ) where ListF a t = Nil | Cons a t build :: forall a . ( forall b . ( a -> b -> b ) -> b -> b ) -> [ a ] forall a .
( forall b . ( a -> b -> b ) -> b -> b ) -> [ a ] < => forall a. ( forall b. ( ( a , b ) ->b ) -> b -> b ) -> [ a ] < => forall a. ( forall b. ( ( Either ( ) ( a , b ) ) -> b ) -> b ) -> [ a ] < => forall a. ( forall b. ( ( ListF a b ) -> b ) -> b ) -> [ a ]
今まで如何に何も理解せず書いていたかという。もっと早く気付けよ、頭悪すぎてorzまあいい、まあいいんだ。これから賢くなれば！ところで、最小不動点・最大不動点ということは、( LFix f )->( GFix f ) という「埋め込み」が構成できそうな気もするけど、どうなんだろう。ありそうな気もするし、無理そうな気もする。
buildの定義を見ると、( f x -> x ) -> xが入ってるので、Haskellで書けるような関手fに対しては、(f x -> x ) -> xは、「 Either やTupleを明示的に含まない」形に変形できる(はず) 。というか、
data SumF a b t = LeftF a | RightF b
data PairF a b t= Pair a b
とする と( SumF a b ) と（ PairF a b ) は自然に定数関手で、
Either a b < =>
Fix ( SumF a b ) < => forall x.(( SumF a b x ) -> x ) -> x < => forall x.( ( Either a b ) -> x ) -> x <=> forall x.( a->x , b->x ) ->x <=> forall x.(a->x )->(b->x ) ->x ( a , b ) <=>
Fix ( PairF a b ) < => forall x.( ( PairF a b x ) -> x ) -> x < => forall x.( ( a , b ) -> x ) -> x < => forall x.( a -> b -> x ) -> x polybool <=> Either True False < => forall x .(( )->x )->(( )->x ) ->x <= > forall x.x->x->x
結局 、Haskellで使えるデータ型は、全て多相ラムダ計算の範疇でモデル化できることに。多相ラムダ計算って、よくできてるな〜。と思って、WikipediaのSystem Fの項見てたら、Girardの書いた教科書っぽいものが、Referenceにー。しかし、なんか長いなぁ。強正規化定理/Reparesentable theorem/型推論の決定不能性の証明を理解すること(そのうち)。理解してやるってセリフは、、、終わってから言うもんだぜ。俺たちギャングの世界ではな

One of the biggest crowds joined the rally in San Francisco
Rallies took place in a dozen cities , with the biggest crowds gathering in New York , Chicago and San Francisco .
They were timed to coincide with the fifth anniversary of a vote by the US Senate to authorise the Iraq invasion .
Those taking part , who included relatives of servicemen fighting in Iraq , urged the US congress to cut off funding for the war .
The ' national day of action ' was called by the United for Peace and Justice coalition .
Silence for dead
Mike Carano , who organised a march in Ohio , told Reuters news agency : " This is across - the - country sentiment about ending the occupation , redirecting funds for needs in this country , our attempt to get Congress to stand up and have its prerogative to cut funding , to take charge . "
One of the national co-ordinators of the protests , Leslie Kielsen , told Reuters that the " half a trillion " dollars spent on the war was money that could have been used for education , social housing and to feed the hungry .
In New York participants gathered in Union Square , before marching on to Foley Square , which is close to many of the city 's largest courthouses and government offices .
A two minute silence was held to honour those killed in the violence which has blighted Iraq since the 2003 US - led invasion .
An estimated 10,000 people joined a march in Chicago and in San Francisco there was an even greater turnout .
Iraq War Analysis [ May. 24th , 2007 | 05:36 pm ] tungsten I know I 'm preaching to the choir , I 'm actually writing this down more for myself in the future , and for myself now because I have actually thought this all through and want to have it written down .
Let me preface this by stating that I disagree with George W. Bush on most things ( not really a surprise to anyone - though I do almost agree with him on immigration issues ) .
On to the war .
How to Win or Lose the War in Iraq :
We keep hearing political spin that blah blah blah blah blah will be to surrender or lose the war .
In order to surrender you must have someone you 're surrendering to , and as long as we 're in Iraq nobody will talk to anyone else so there really is n't anyone to surrender to .
To lose the war you have to have a mission that is not achieved .
But lets take a look at this argument anyway .
I 'm sure some would say we would be surrendering to Al Qaida .
This on its face looks like a good argument , except for the facts .
Without us there Al Qaida does n't have a mission in Iraq other than to be a pain in the ass , and that is n't a mission .
Certainly they would like a friendly regime in Iraq and have shown tenacity when Iraq is in chaos ( Zarqawi was in Iraq as an independent agent of AQ prior to the war - we refused to attack him so that we could help justify the war ; though not the lives he would take later ) but their base of support is exclusively Sunni and they 're opposed to the Kurdish governments in Iraq 's north .
So that leaves them a consituency of 15 - 20 % of the population and of those people the vast majority have no love for Al Qaida .
Currently they have the luxury of American troops and because we 're an occupier they can rally Iraqi's .
Because most of the region see's as for occupiers Al Qaida is able to bring in $ $$ via their Iraq operation .
Without us there Al Qaida in Iraq would clearly be in collapse .
Their funding ( which is also being exported to other Al Qaida causes ) would be cut off and their agents already marginalized would be in trouble with the locals .
So if we left it would clearly not benefit Al Qaida ; unless we blundered our exit too by say playing the political expectations game in a way to make our leaving look like a victory for them .
Who or what else could we surrender to ?
We could be surrendering to the general chaos .
We created that chaos by destroying the countries infrastructure for 10 years then invading and destroying their civil society , creating a new political structure based on religion and ethnicity , and maintaining an occupation with no promise of end .
There is a civil war going on , and if we left it looks as though we would be surrendering to it .
On the other hand if we stay and maintain the same course Iraq will most certainly continue in Civil War .
So our continued being there does n't seem to have any effect on the chaos .
Now lets take a look at Losing the war .
In order to Lose you have to have not achieved your objective .
What is our objective ?
There were no weapons of mass destruction , we knew that going in .
We achieved the goal of removing Saddam Hussein from power .
We even set up a democratic republic with a constitution and government .
Is the mission to leave a stable Iraq ?
If so one of the best things we could do is get out of the way and force them to deal with their problems .
Is our goal a stable Middle East ?
Well , we 're far too late for that .
There is the fear that if we left Iraq the civil war there could escalate and their neighbors could all be sucked into it .
Its easy to foresee the possibility of Turkish / IraqiKurdistan troubles .
We know Al Qaida in Iraq has strong support in Saudi Arabia , Jordan , and Syria for attacking the occupiers .
We also know that Syria , Jordan , and Saudi Arabia are sunni arab countries and Iran is a predominately shia non arab country with close ties to southern Iraq .
None of them want to be drawn into a covert regional war .
If we leave they all have to talk to each other .... Diplomacy .
The probability of a larger regional war while real is very slight .
Syria and Iran have more in common than their distrust of the US ( after all we invaded a country " pre-emptively " after blatantly lying about them for years and rejecting peace , you would n't trust us either if you were n't us , and you may not anyway ) .
The truth is we do n't have a mission in Iraq .
Leaving would n't lose because we have no definition of what " losing " is .
If we were to end our occupation we would leave troops along the border to help secure the border ( something we have n't been able to do during the occupation ) and we would likely be asked to stay in Iraq Kurdistan because the Kurds realize they 're stuck between a rock ( Iran , Turkey , and Syria do n't want an indpendent Kurdistan as it may give hope to the indigenous Kurds in their countries ) and a hard place ( Iraq 's arabs and the distrust created amongst these groups by Saddam 's efforts to ensure that the arab population controlled the oil in the Kurdish area of the country ) .
They 're the only portion of the country that wants and needs us there , and even so it would most likely be for the border .
Actually this vision of withdrawal and redeployment is pretty much the same as representative Murtha and most ( though not all ) congressional Democrats .
So pretty much the only way to lose the war in Iraq is to maintain the war in Iraq .
But what about us ?
What would ending the war as we know it do for us ?
Well it would mean most of our troops would be able to come home , we would save billions of $ $$ , we would win a battle with Al Qaida , we would help stabalize the region , we would cut off a good deal of the impetus behind Iran 's seeking the Nuclear weapons , we could lower the cost of petroleum , we could have the National Guard around to respond to domestic emergencies , and we could close off the spigot of money going to Haliburton of Dubai 's price + contracts that encourage waste ( thats where they 're based now ) .
So pretty much ending the war in Iraq is a win , win , win , win situation .
We win , the region win's , the Iraqi 's win , and the world wins .
Next time someone says that leaving Iraq would be a surrender or a loss ask them what their definition of loss is or who they think we'd be surrendering to .
The phrase that will always be associated with Vice President Dick Cheney is " undisclosed location . "
Whenever there is a crisis in government , that 's where Cheney is .
Whenever anyone in Congress needs Cheney to answer questions , he is out at Rancho Undisclosed .
Apparently , the undisclosed location is often just his official residence at the U.S. Naval Observatory , but he reflexively does not want that fact revealed .
He does n't want any facts revealed .
He wants to avoid at all costs the notion that he is working for the American people and is thus accountable to them in any way .
At a time when governmental transparency is all the rage , he seeks governmental opacity .
He 's trying for the perks of dictatorship without the requisite infrastructure -- and , most of the time , he 's getting those perks .
He rules with an iron fist in an iron glove .
His mania for secrecy is unsurpassed .
In 2001 , he headed a task force to develop energy policy for the then - new Bush administration .
The Government Accountability Office sought to know the names of the members of the task force .
The vice president said no .
His office has refused to comply with ethics laws requiring disclosure of travel paid for by special interests .
In 2004 , he refused to provide Congress with the names of the people who worked for him .
He refused to provide a list of visitors to his official residence .
And now , he has unilaterally exempted his office from rules regarding the safeguarding of classified documents .
His justification is that the vice president 's office is not an " entity within the executive branch . "
His reasoning : Because the vice president presides over the Senate when he wants to and breaks ties when he has to , he is really a member of legislative branch -- not that he follows the rules of that branch either .
In essence , he is now the fourth branch of government .
Soon , civics classes will be taught a revised version of our precious system of checks and balances .
There 's the administrative , the legislative , the judicial and the cheney .
The exact function and duties of the cheney are unknown .
The cheney does not report to the president because that would be a violation of the separation of powers .
The cheney just does what it does because it is what it is .
And you 'd best not ask questions .
When the Information Security Oversight Committee of the National Archives made the initial request for information , the cheney tried to have the committee abolished .
The cheney sounds more like a department at Hogwarts than an agency of government .
Inside the cheney , all is darkness .
In other bad news : China has decided to build a 67 - mile road to the glacier at the foot of Mount Everest .
This is such an obviously bad idea that I had to check to make sure I was n't being taken in by another brilliant Onion parody .
But no , the road is real .
It 's being built , say the Chinese , in order to facilitate the carrying of the Olympic torch to the top of the mountain .
Clearly , the building of the road would damage an already fragile ecosystem .
Also , it would make it easier for tourists to come see the mountain , which would further trash the Himalayan high country .
It would put more pressure on the high glaciers , which are already under attack by global warming .
While it 's not saying so out loud , another reason China wants to build the road is to reinforce its hegemony in Tibet .
We 're here and we 're in charge and if we want to build a road , we 're going to build that road .
China is the cheney of nations .
It 's odd how excited China is about the Olympics .
It 's good in a way -- the air will be cleaner in Beijing , and political dissidents will be released , and the press will be sort of free at least for a few weeks .
I 'm not sure why China cares .
It 's a large and powerful nation , fiercely independent in many ways , and yet it was almost wiggling with gratitude when that bunch of aging plutocrats on the Olympic committee graciously consented to allow it to spend a billion dollars or so to get a huge and often irrelevant sporting event .
It 's not clear whether the Olympics provide any benefit at all to the host city .
The idea is that the city gets back in tourist money and private investment what it spends in capital improvements , but it 's really a crapshoot .
Then there 's the " validation " provided by the Olympics , although validation of what by whom is very murky .
Look , we 're in the community of nations -- we hosted the 3 - meter springboard competition !
The pentathlon , c'est moi .
It 's as though China were attracted by the lure of the West almost in spite of itself .
So here 's the news flash : Building a road to Mount Everest is not going to yield good publicity .
The photos of bulldozers tearing up the glaciers will not go over well .
Time to reconsider .
Bad things happen in the world , and often there are bad people involved .
Not that I want to spoil your day , but you needed to know that .

A woman behind me asked if I had a dog .
On impulse , I told her that no , I was starting The Pal Diet again although I probably should n't because I 'd ended up in the hospital last time , but that I 'd lost 50 pounds before I awakened in an intensive care ward with tubes coming out of most of my orifices and IV 's in both arms .
I told her that it was essentially a perfect diet and that the way that it works is to load your pants pockets with Pal nuggets and simply eat one or two every time you feel hungry & that the food is nutritionally complete so I was going to try it again .
I have to mention here that practically everyone in the line was by now enthralled with my story , particularly a guy who was behind her .
Horrified , she asked if I 'd ended up in the hospital in that condition because I had been poisoned .
I told her no ; it was because I 'd been sitting in the street licking my balls and a car hit me .
I thought one guy was going to have a heart attack he was laughing so hard as he staggered out the door .
Stupid b*tch ... why else would I buy dog food ??

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. security contractor Blackwater has been involved in at least 195 shooting incidents in Iraq since 2005 and , in eight of 10 cases , their forces fired first , a leading U.S. lawmaker said on Monday .
State Department contractor Blackwater , under investigation for the shooting deaths of 11 Iraqis on September 16 , will answer questions about that incident and its performance in Iraq at a Congressional hearing on Tuesday .
Senior State Department officials will also be grilled by the House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Government Reform examining whether the growing use of military contractors undermines U.S. efforts in Iraq .
Committee chair Rep. Henry Waxman , a vocal critic of the Iraq war , released details from Blackwater ’s own reports of multiple incidents involving Iraqi casualties .
The memorandum also slammed the State Department ’s oversight of the company .
It listed 195 shooting incidents from the start of 2005 until September 12 of this year , an average of 1.4 per week .
Of those , there were 16 Iraqi casualties and 162 cases with property damage , the California Democrat said .
“ In 32 of those incidents , Blackwater were returning fire after an attack while on 163 occasions ( 84 percent of the shooting incidents ) , Blackwater personnel were the first to fire , ” Waxman said .
State Department rules say Blackwater ’s actions should be defensive rather than offensive .
Blackwater , which has been paid a little over $ 1 billion by the U.S. government since 2001 , declined to comment on Waxman ’s memorandum .
“ We look forward to setting the record straight on this and other issues ” when Erik Prince , Blackwater ’s chief , testifies before the committee , spokeswoman Anne Tyrrell said .
OVERSIGHT QUESTIONED
Waxman criticized the State Department ’s handling of several incidents involving Blackwater and accused it of trying to get the contractor to pay off victims ’ families rather than investigate .
“ It appears that the State Department ’s primary response was to ask Blackwater to make monetary payments to put the ‘ matter behind us ’ rather than to insist upon accountability or to investigate Blackwater personnel for potential criminal liability , ” said the memorandum .
In a shooting incident on December 24 , 2006 , a security guard for Iraqi Vice President Adel Abdul - Mahdi was killed by an allegedly drunken Blackwater contractor , who was then flown out of the country and faced no charges .
E-mail traffic from the U.S. embassy in Baghdad back to Washington described Iraq concerns over the incident .
“ Iraqis would not understand how a foreigner could kill an Iraqi and return a free man to his own country , ” it said .
The State Department ’s charge d’affaires recommended Blackwater make a “ sizeable payment ” and an “ apology . ”
Waxman noted the State Department ’s diplomatic security said that was too much and eventually Blackwater agreed on a $ 15,000 payment .
State Department spokesman Tom Casey declined to comment on specifics listed by Waxman but said the department was “ scrupulous ” in its oversight of all contractors .
“ These are tough jobs and these people often perform heroically in very difficult circumstances , ” Casey said .
“ But at the same time they have to be held accountable for their actions . ”
In another incident where Blackwater shooters killed an “ innocent Iraqi , ” Waxman said the State Department requested only a $ 5,000 payment to “ put this unfortunate matter behind us quickly . ”
Blackwater protects U.S. embassy convoys in Iraq and , along with two other contractors , DynCorp and Triple Canopy , has a worldwide security deal with the State Department .
Waxman said reports provided by Blackwater indicated the North Carolina - based firm was involved in more shooting incidents in Iraq than the other two companies combined .
He and Dr. Steinhardt recognized that the artisans in the 13th century had begun creating mosaic patterns in this way .
The geometric star - and - polygon girihs , as quasi crystals , can be rotated a certain number of degrees , say one - fifth of a circle , to positions from which other tiles are fitted .
As such , this makes possible a pattern that is infinitely big and yet the pattern never repeats itself , unlike the tiles on the typical floor .
This was , the scientists wrote , “ an important breakthrough in Islamic mathematics and design . ”
Dr. Steinhardt said in an interview that it was not clear how well the Islamic designers understood all the elements they were applying to the construction of these patterns .
“ I can just say what ’s on the walls , ” he said .

Mr. Lu said that it would be “ incredible if it were all coincidence . ”
“ At the very least , ” he said , “ it shows us a culture that we often do n’t credit enough was far more advanced than we ever thought before . ”
From a study of a few hundred examples , Mr. Lu and Dr. Steinhardt determined that the technique was fully developed two centuries later in mosques , palaces , shrines and other buildings .
They noted that “ a nearly perfect quasi- crystalline Penrose pattern ” is found on the Darb - i Imam shrine in Isfahan , Iran , which was built in 1453 .
The researchers described how the architects there had created overlapping patterns with girih tiles at two sizes to produce nearly perfect quasi-crystalline patterns .
In the report , Mr. Lu and Dr. Steinhardt said the examples they had studied so far “ fall just short of being perfect quasi crystals ; there may be more interesting examples yet to be discovered . ”
In a separate article in Science , some experts in the math of crystals questioned if the findings were an entirely new insight .
In particular , Emil Makovicky of the University of Copenhagen in Denmark said the new report failed to give sufficient credit to an analysis he published in 1992 of mosaic patterns on a tomb in Iran .
Summary : Introductory text on Web pages is usually too long , so users skip it .
But short intros can increase usability by explaining the remaining content 's purpose .
The introductory paragraph (s ) found at the top of many Web pages is what I call blah - blah text : a block of words that users typically skip when they arrive at a page .
Instead , their eyes go directly to more actionable content , such as product features , bulleted lists , or hypertext links .
The worst kind of blah - blah has no function ; it 's pure filler — platitudes , such as " Welcome to our site , we hope you will find our new and improved design helpful . "
Kill the welcome mat and cut to the chase .
People read very little on Web pages .
Do n't waste word count on generic , feel - good material .
It 's not going to make customers feel good anyway .
They care only about getting their problems solved as quickly as possible so they can leave your site .
Mea Culpa
It 's easy to tell Web writers to cut the fluff .
It 's harder to actually do it .
Each time a new content contributor joins your team , you must drill them incessantly on the special guidelines for writing for the Web .
The guidelines seem obvious , but it takes a lot of skill to design good verbiage .
That 's why I repeatedly stress the rules for content usability , and why I include targeted writing courses at all my conferences .
( As far as I know , our event is the only usability or Web design conference with this level of commitment to writing .
I always teach content usability because the actual information is the Web design component with the highest impact on website profitability . )
Despite my constant emphasis on the importance of the writing guidelines , I fall into the bloated blah - blah trap myself .
It 's been 10 years and numerous lectures since I developed the guidelines in 1997 , but I still make content usability mistakes .
That shows just how hard it is , and why you need to continuously check your copy for usability compliance .
As an example , we recently posted a series of interviews with participants in the UX Conference .
In my original design , the page featuring these interviews started with the following blah - blah text :
The conference attracts a highly diverse audience of professionals who are committed to advancing user experience in their companies .
Hearing from participants at previous conferences will give you an idea of the colleagues you 'll meet and the discussions you 'll have when you attend .
At least I had the smarts to highlight keywords .
Still , this is too much text , and most users are guaranteed to skip a full paragraph like that , particularly when it sits above a list of enticingly blue links that are begging to be clicked .
Just before posting the page , I remembered my own advice to cut the text in half for online readers .
I removed the first sentence , reducing the intro paragraph from 43 words to 24 .
( Admittedly , this was only a 44 % reduction in word count ; I should have cut deeper . )
Why Retain Any Introductory Text ?
Ruthlessly editing introductory paragraphs might be good advice , but why not just kill them off completely ?
Cutting word count seems a weasely approach .
Intro text has a valid role in that it helps set the context for content and thus answer the question :
What 's the page about ?
In my example , simply showing visitors a list of 7 completely different interviews might be confusing .
Why are these 7 articles in one section on a single page ?
Two lines of intro , and users know what the interviews have in common ( they profile UX Conference participants ) and what they 'll gain by reading them ( they 'll get an idea of the conference 's off - program aspects , which are often the most important , but — by definition — are hard to convey through the program description ) .
Intro text serves the same purpose for an interior page as the homepage does for the entire site and the tagline does for the homepage itself .
For all three scenarios , people need to know what they are getting into before they dive in .
Of course , many users do dive straight into deep waters without the benefit of an intro :
Visitors from search engines or other sites follow deep links , parachuting into the site and landing directly on an interior page , thus bypassing the homepage .
But they 'll often visit the homepage as their second or third step , when they want to know what else the site has to offer .
People arriving at a specific page often skip the blah - blah , even when it 's laudably concise .
But , if they 're confused about the page or want to know more about it , they 'll typically turn to the top of the page and scan the intro and / or the tagline .
If the intro's short and scannable , they 'll benefit from its situating perspective .
A brief introduction can help users better understand the rest of the page .
Even if they skip it initially , they might return later if it does n't look intimidatingly long and dense .
If you keep it short , a bit of blah might actually work .
So , prune your initial draft of marketese and focus on answering two questions :

XML in 10 points
Note :
This document is no longer maintained but is left for historical purposes .
XML , XLink , Namespace , DTD , Schema , CSS , XHTML ...
If you are new to XML , it may be hard to know where to begin .
This summary in 10 points attempts to capture enough of the basic concepts to enable a beginner to see the forest through the trees .
And if you are giving a presentation on XML , why not start with these 10 points ?
1. XML is for structuring data
Structured data includes things like spreadsheets , address books , configuration parameters , financial transactions , and technical drawings .
XML is a set of rules ( you may also think of them as guidelines or conventions ) for designing text formats that let you structure your data .
XML is not a programming language , and you do n't have to be a programmer to use it or learn it .
XML makes it easy for a computer to generate data , read data , and ensure that the data structure is unambiguous .
XML avoids common pitfalls in language design : it is extensible , platform - independent , and it supports internationalization and localization .
XML is fully Unicode - compliant .
2. XML looks a bit like HTML
Like HTML , XML makes use of tags ( words bracketed by ' < ' and '>' ) and attributes ( of the form name = " value " ) .
While HTML specifies what each tag and attribute means , and often how the text between them will look in a browser , XML uses the tags only to delimit pieces of data , and leaves the interpretation of the data completely to the application that reads it .
In other words , if you see " < p > " in an XML file , do not assume it is a paragraph .
Depending on the context , it may be a price , a parameter , a person , a p... ( and who says it has to be a word with a " p " ? ) .
3. XML is text , but is n't meant to be read
Programs that produce spreadsheets , address books , and other structured data often store that data on disk , using either a binary or text format .
One advantage of a text format is that it allows people , if necessary , to look at the data without the program that produced it ; in a pinch , you can read a text format with your favorite text editor .
Text formats also allow developers to more easily debug applications .
Like HTML , XML files are text files that people should n't have to read , but may when the need arises .
Compared to HTML , the rules for XML files allow fewer variations .
A forgotten tag , or an attribute without quotes makes an XML file unusable , while in HTML such practice is often explicitly allowed .
The official XML specification forbids applications from trying to second - guess the creator of a broken XML file ; if the file is broken , an application has to stop right there and report an error .
4. XML is verbose by design
Since XML is a text format and it uses tags to delimit the data , XML files are nearly always larger than comparable binary formats .
That was a conscious decision by the designers of XML .
The advantages of a text format are evident ( see point 3 ) , and the disadvantages can usually be compensated at a different level .
Disk space is less expensive than it used to be , and compression programs like zip and gzip can compress files very well and very fast .
In addition , communication protocols such as modem protocols and HTTP / 1.1 , the core protocol of the Web , can compress data on the fly , saving bandwidth as effectively as a binary format .
5. XML is a family of technologies
XML 1.0 is the specification that defines what " tags " and " attributes " are .
Beyond XML 1.0 , " the XML family " is a growing set of modules that offer useful services to accomplish important and frequently demanded tasks .
XLink describes a standard way to add hyperlinks to an XML file .
XPointer is a syntax in development for pointing to parts of an XML document .
An XPointer is a bit like a URL , but instead of pointing to documents on the Web , it points to pieces of data inside an XML file .
CSS , the style sheet language , is applicable to XML as it is to HTML .
XSL is the advanced language for expressing style sheets .
It is based on XSLT , a transformation language used for rearranging , adding and deleting tags and attributes .
The DOM is a standard set of function calls for manipulating XML ( and HTML ) files from a programming language .
XML Schemas 1 and 2 help developers to precisely define the structures of their own XML - based formats .
There are several more modules and tools available or under development .
Keep an eye on W3 C 's technical reports page .
6. XML is new , but not that new
Development of XML started in 1996 and it has been a W3C Recommendation since February 1998 , which may make you suspect that this is rather immature technology .
In fact , the technology is n't very new .
Before XML there was SGML , developed in the early ' 80s , an ISO standard since 1986 , and widely used for large documentation projects .
The development of HTML started in 1990 .
The designers of XML simply took the best parts of SGML , guided by the experience with HTML , and produced something that is no less powerful than SGML , and vastly more regular and simple to use .
Some evolutions , however , are hard to distinguish from revolutions ...
And it must be said that while SGML is mostly used for technical documentation and much less for other kinds of data , with XML it is exactly the opposite .
7. XML leads HTML to XHTML
There is an important XML application that is a document format : W3 C's XHTML , the successor to HTML .
XHTML has many of the same elements as HTML .
The syntax has been changed slightly to conform to the rules of XML .
A format that is " XML - based " inherits the syntax from XML and restricts it in certain ways ( e.g , XHTML allows " < p > " , but not " < r > " ) ; it also adds meaning to that syntax ( XHTML says that " < p > " stands for " paragraph " , and not for " price " , " person " , or anything else ) .
8. XML is modular
XML allows you to define a new document format by combining and reusing other formats .
Since two formats developed independently may have elements or attributes with the same name , care must be taken when combining those formats ( does " < p > " mean " paragraph " from this format or " person " from that one ? ) .
To eliminate name confusion when combining formats , XML provides a namespace mechanism .
XSL and RDF are good examples of XML - based formats that use namespaces .
XML Schema is designed to mirror this support for modularity at the level of defining XML document structures , by making it easy to combine two schemas to produce a third which covers a merged document structure .
9. XML is the basis for RDF and the Semantic Web
W3 C's Resource Description Framework ( RDF ) is an XML text format that supports resource description and metadata applications , such as music playlists , photo collections , and bibliographies .
For example , RDF might let you identify people in a Web photo album using information from a personal contact list ; then your mail client could automatically start a message to those people stating that their photos are on the Web .
Just as HTML integrated documents , images , menu systems , and forms applications to launch the original Web , RDF provides tools to integrate even more , to make the Web a little bit more into a Semantic Web .
Just like people need to have agreement on the meanings of the words they employ in their communication , computers need mechanisms for agreeing on the meanings of terms in order to communicate effectively .
Formal descriptions of terms in a certain area ( shopping or manufacturing , for example ) are called ontologies and are a necessary part of the Semantic Web.
RDF , ontologies , and the representation of meaning so that computers can help people do work are all topics of the Semantic Web Activity .
10 . XML is license - free , platform - independent and well - supported
By choosing XML as the basis for a project , you gain access to a large and growing community of tools ( one of which may already do what you need ! ) and engineers experienced in the technology .
Opting for XML is a bit like choosing SQL for databases : you still have to build your own database and your own programs and procedures that manipulate it , but there are many tools available and many people who can help you .
And since XML is license - free , you can build your own software around it without paying anybody anything .
The large and growing support means that you are also not tied to a single vendor .
XML is n't always the best solution , but it is always worth considering .

Our Stories and What They Say About Our Culture
In normal , direct - style programming in ( mostly - ) functional languages such as scheme and ML , folding is an operation that crops up all the time in various guises .
Most list - manipulation libraries for such languages include implementations of left - fold and right - fold as standard .
But what about the situation when you ’re programming in continuation - passing style ( CPS ) , such as when you ’re writing ( or trying to write ) a metacircular evaluator ?
Library support for continuation - passing folds is n’t nearly as common .
Here ’s the direct - style left - fold function :
( define ( foldl kons knil xs ) ( if ( null ? xs ) knil ( foldl kons ( kons ( car xs ) knil ) ( cdr xs ) ) ) )
and here ’s the continuation - passing left - fold function :
( define ( foldl - k kons knil xs k ) ( if ( null ? xs ) ( k knil ) ( kons ( car xs ) knil ( lambda ( v ) ( foldl - k kons v ( cdr xs ) k ) ) ) ) )
Note that kons takes three arguments here , where in the direct - style version , it takes two .
One benefit of having CPS folds available is that they expose more control over the loop .
For instance , using a normal fold , there ’s no way to terminate the iteration early , but using a CPS fold , your three - argument kons routine can simply omit invoking its continuation parameter ( presumably choosing some other continuation to run instead ) .
This means that operations like ( short - circuiting ) contains ? , any , and every can be written with CPS fold , but not with plain direct - style fold :
( define ( contains ? predicate val elements ) ( foldl - k ( lambda ( elt acc k ) ( if ( predicate elt val ) #t ;; note : skips the offered continuation ! ( k acc ) ) ) #f elements ( lambda ( v ) v ) ) )
Sure , you love cooking in unusual places - for fun grilling recipes that you can try out almost anywhere , I recommend the Campground Cooking e-Book - but as adventurous as you are , you might wonder why you would ever want to cook food on your car engine .
I say , why would n't you ?
It can be a practical solution on long road trips :
Now you wo n't have to eat that crappy fast food .
Or it can be something to try just for fun .
It 's really easy to do .
All you need is aluminum foil , a car and some food .
Decide what you want to cook .
You can cook almost anything on your car engine .
It works like a slow - cooking microwave , so , depending on how long you 'll be driving , you can make most meals work .
I would n't suggest soup , but other than that , have at it !
I chose a chicken sausage since I knew it was pre-cooked ( so I would n't kill myself if I messed it up ) , easy to wrap and would n't take long to be ready .
Wrap your food well .
If this is your first time , you may want to stick to foods that are n't very greasy or drippy .
May I suggest a potato or some veggies ?
Hot dogs can be greasy , but they 're easy to wrap up tight , so if you 're into meat I 'd suggest something in sausage - form .
As long as you double or triple wrap your food , you should n't have a problem , but pay attention to where the creases in the foil are .
You do n't want anything dripping onto your car engine or other important wires and connections .
Additionally , you probably do n't want anything that might be leaking from your car to get onto your food .
Adding marinade is one thing , but soaking your steak in washer fluid probably does n't taste too good .
Since you 're placing your food on top of your engine this typically is n't a problem , but just something to consider while you 're preparing your cooking surface .
As long as your car has passed its smog ( or emissions ) test , which it should have to be on the road in the first place , you 'll be safe from contaminants like exhaust .
Your car is designed to send exhaust out the ( you guessed it ) exhaust pipe , which sticks out the back of your car .
Unless you start cooking lots of meals this way , there 's nothing to worry about in terms of health risks .
And while I encourage utilizing this strategy every once in a while , I think it would be just plain weird if you did it all the time .
Pop your hood and find a good spot .
Once your food is wrapped up tight , then wrapped again , then covered one final time just to be safe , you need to figure out where to place your meal .
You want your food to be as secure as possible while getting as much heat from the engine as possible .
This can be a little tricky because you do n't want to interfere with any connections , such as your brake lines .
This is more important , obviously , than the heat factor .
So find a place away from all the wires and lines .
You 'll need to find the warmest area .
Start your car for a while ( or do this after your next short drive ) , then turn it off and pop the hood .
Without touching the engine , feel around to determine where the most heat is radiating from .
It 's not necessary to actually touch the engine , but if you do you may want to wet your fingers first and touch it lightly and quickly .
If you lay your hand on something hot , like a car engine , you 're going to burn it !
Secure your food .
Now that you 've found the hottest part of the engine that does n't have anything potentially hazardous around it , you 'll need to secure your wrapped food to the engine so it does n't slide around .
Make sure it 's in a snug space .
It can help to use the aluminum foil to secure your food , but remember that it 's going to get hot .
Do n't attach it to anything that might melt from the heat .
Most of your wires are insulated , but double check before you decide to cook those along with your sausage .
Drive .
Now it 's time to drive .
If you 've never cooked food on your engine before , you may want to stop after a few miles and check on the position of your food to see if it has shifted .
I suggest pulling over on a side street .
People are nice and tend to stop and help you if your car hood is up and you 're standing there looking at your engine .
It might be difficult to explain to friendly passersby that you 're really just checking on the progress of dinner .
Each car and engine is different , so it may take a little trial and error to determine how long it takes to properly cook each food item .
Do n't forget that freeway driving vs. city driving may also affect how quickly your food will cook .
Just because you 're stuck in traffic does n't mean that sausage is n't still heating up , and may even be heating up faster than it would at 65 miles per hour !
Check out the most popular book on this subject : Manifold Destiny , for tips on average driving times and how best to approach different dishes .
( Manifold means car engine ... if you did n't know that , it might help explain things . )
Check on your food .
As I mentioned in step 5 , you may want to pull off on a side street to check on your food .
Then people wo n't look at you funny ... or at least fewer people will .
You should use the same techniques you usually do to determine whether your food has cooked .
Is it warm to the touch ?
Has it , in the case of my sausage , blistered and expanded ?
Does it smell yummy ?
Still not sure .... cut into it and check on the color of the center .
You know how to tell if something 's cooked ...
If it 's not cooked yet , you have a couple options : First , keep driving for a while and check again in a few miles .
How long you drive will depend on how long you 've already driven to get your food to its current state of " cookedness " and how much more it needs to be cooked .
Second , you can stop the car and let the food continue to cook on the engine for a while .
Once the car stops , the engine will remain hot for some time .
For instance , my sausage was n't quite done when I arrived at my destination ( remember I only drove 10 miles ) , so I left it on the engine for another 20 minutes ... perfect !
Hopefully you remembered to bring along any condiments or other edible accoutrements to go along with your meal .
Enjoy !
Now it 's time to mustard that dog up and chow that puppy down !
In a disgusting display of mendacity not seen since the run-up to the invasion of Iraq , a pro-war advertising campaign spearheaded by former White House spokesman Ari Fleischer is buying $ 15 million worth of 30 - second television spots that repeat the lies linking 9/11 to Iraq  and explicitly threatening another terrorist attack in the US if we “ surrender . ”
It ’s the first storm in a season of fear .
The content of the ads  four of them , so far  is so completely dishonest that one wonders what the producers were thinking : do they really imagine the American people are going to swallow another round of complete fabrications ?
It ’s hard to believe , but there you have it .
Even more surreal than the assertions tying the 9/11 terrorist attacks to the Iraqis is the blatant exploitation of US troops in Iraq : this one , for example , shows a soldier who has lost a leg declaiming that he will have lost it for nothing if we allow “ politics ”  i.e. the overwhelming majority of Americans  to influence our policy .
Then “ everything I ’ve given and sacrificed will mean nothing . ”
Here is the complete text :
“ Congress was right to vote to fight terrorism in Iraq and I re-enlisted after September 11 because I do n’t want my sons to see what I saw .
I want them to be free and safe .
I know what I lost .
I also know that if we pull out now everything I ’ve given and the sacrifices will mean nothing .
They attacked us and they will again .
They wo n’t stop in Iraq .
We are winning on the ground and making real progress .
It ’s no time to quit .
It ’s no time for politics . ”
So the liars who lied us into war , who fabricated “ evidence ” of Iraq ’s “ weapons of mass destruction , ” are n’t to blame  oh no , of course not !
It ’s those of us who oppose this monstrous and mistaken invasion who are to be targeted as advocating “ surrender ” in a conflict that cannot be won without murdering half the population of Iraq and enslaving the other half .
Because we allowed the Scooter Libbys and the Ari Fleischers to lure us into a quagmire , we must remain submerged there forever  or the loss of this soldier ’s leg was all for naught .
What kind of morality is it that lets the perpetrator of a fraud off scot - free while blaming the victim who has been defrauded ?
It ’s called neocon morality  where the neocons are always in the clear , and the rest of us are dunned to pay the price of their immeasurable hubris .
This ad features a grieving mom who opines “ we ’ve already had one 9/11  we do n’t need another , ” while giving out the administration - neocon line that we ’re “ making progress ” in Iraq , and ca n’t “ surrender ” now .
Yet how will withdrawing from the midst of the Iraqi civil war , where Sunnis fight Shi’ites and we are caught in the middle , result in an attack on the U.S. ?
Logic has nothing to do with the message behind this ad , which is all about pure fear , plain and simple .
Again , the implication is that the fallen soldiers will have died in vain if we leave  not , you understand , because the war we started had no clear rationale , and was based on a series of carefully - forged lies .
Here is a vet in a wheelchair who glowers at the camera as he contemplates Congress “ considering surrender . ”
There is a vaguely threatening tone to his words , as if all the wounded veterans of this misguided war will descend on the Capitol and exact vengeance if we do n’t “ emerge victorious . ”
Here the neocons  let ’s name the real enemy , after all  are quite explicitly pushing their “ stab - in - the - back ” theory , which blames our looming defeat in Iraq not on the inherent impossibility of winning over the Iraqis while we occupy their country and brutalize their people , but on the evils of “ politics ” ( i.e. democracy , where the majority supposedly rules ) and scheming politicians , who are somehow manipulating the popular will in order to betray our fighting men and women .
“ They attacked us ” avers the wounded vet , but that ’s not true : Iraq never attacked us , never had the capacity to attack us , and was never even a credible threat .
We attacked them  i.e. the Iraqis , not al - Qaeda  and we ’re still attacking them , four years after the “ liberation ” of Iraq .
In this one , a woman talks about the tragic loss of her uncle and her husband  the former was a New York City fireman on 9/11 , the latter a soldier fallen in Iraq  and warns that if we leave Iraq , “ it will mean more attacks in America . ”
Her husband died so that her children wo n’t have to fight .
Blah blah blah blah  it ’s just one lie after another , with sinister speed - freaky music playing in the background and all of it overhung with an all - pervasive fear .
Logic , reason , and facts  all are absent from this emotive narrative , which simply reiterates the conflation of Iraq and al - Qaeda , and reinforces the urban legend that has Iraqi rather than Saudi hijackers ramming into the World Trade Center towers .
Here is the real face of the War Party : openly and brazenly peddling long - debunked myths designed to appeal to the emotions , rather than the intellect .
This is classic war propaganda produced without respect for the facts of reality or the most basic human decency .
So what else is new ?
What ’s interesting , aside from the crude content of these ads , is their funding : who ’s paying for this pack of lies ?
The Washington Post lists the major donors :
Mel Sembler 
A multi-billionaire shopping center magnate and real estate developer , CEO of the Sembler Company , and former ambassador to Australia , Nauru , and Italy , Sembler was also chairman of the Scooter Libby Defense Trust .
His tenure in Rome was coincident with a series of rather dubious goings - on connected to the Niger uranium forgeries , including secret back channel meetings between leading neocons in the Pentagon , Iranian arms dealer and Iran - Contra figure Manucher Ghorbanifar , and convicted spy Larry Franklin , who was caught red - handed funneling classified top secret information to Israeli embassy personnel via two officials of AIPAC , the powerful pro-Israel lobbying group .
As Joshua Micah Marshall put it :
“ There ’s a lot that ’s still really murky about what was happening at the U.S. embassy in Rome after 9/11 with the forgeries and other matters .
That was on Sembler ’s watch .
And Libby ’s bad acts stem from the whole forgeries bamboozlement .
( Whacking Wilson was part of the larger White House effort to keep the forgeries scam covered up  a cover - up that ’s still underway . )
“ So Sembler just seems like a pretty big part of this story to be collecting money for the one person under indictment for their role in it . ”
Sembler ’s bio veers from the neoconnish to the nightmarish when we consider his founding of “ Straight , Inc. , ” a teen drug rehabilitation program that was forced to close on account of numerous successful lawsuits by former clients who were tortured , raped , and systematically humiliated .
Their hair - raising testimony of sadistic abuse while in custody at Sembler ’s teen - Guantánamo can be read here .
Apparently , an entire movement of Sembler ’s victims has risen up spontaneously  that ’s how many lives “ Straight , Inc. ” destroyed .
All this bad publicity required a name change , and “ Straight , Inc. , ” was reconstituted , in 1996 , as the Drug Free America Foundation .
As a result of Sembler ’s political clout , the Foundation is prospering , thanks to federal subsidies , $ 720,000 in the year 2000 alone .
The drug war , the Iraq war , Scooter Libby ’s private war against Valerie Plame and her husband  with Sembler , it ’s always wartime , and that ’s the way he likes it .
John Templeton , Jr. 
The son of renowned investor John Templeton , is in charge of the Templeton Foundation , which , last year , poured some $ 60 million into numerous projects broadly dedicated to “ bringing science under the guiding hand of religion . ”
Templeton is an evangelical Christian , and his generosity has funded a wide variety of projects dear to conservative hearts , such as the theory of “ intelligent design ” and the re-election of George W. Bush .
Some libertarians have also been in on the gravy train : the Cato Institute received funding for its Russian - language web site , cato.ru  and presumably to pay for the dubious services of such pro-war blowhards as Cato senior fellow Andrei Illarionov , who has openly called for the West to prepare for a military conflict with Russia .
Sheldon G Adelson 
He ’s the third richest person in the U.S. , worth $ 20.5 billion , with a rags - to - riches story : the son of a Boston cabdriver , Adelson inaugurated the Comdex computer trade show , and then went into tourism , real estate , and casinos .
He is CEO of the Las Vegas Sands Corp. , which operates the Venetian Casino Resort and the Sands Expo and Convention Center .
Adelson is a major contributor to Jewish and Israeli causes , and to the GOP .
This series of ads is n’t his only propagandistic foray : the Vegas casino king has also gone into the newspaper business  in Israel .
Yisrael Hayom is a new daily paper closely tied to the ultra-nationalist wing of the Likud party , and Benjamin Netanyahu ‘s political aspirations .
It was recently launched with a massive free mailing to hundreds of thousands , and has attracted considerable attention .
Richard Fox 
He made his fortune in real estate , with properties centered in eastern Pennsylvania and southern New Jersey , and is a co-founder of the Republican Jewish Coalition .
Gary Erlbaum , owner of Greentree Properties in Ardmore , Pa. , an ardent Republican organizer in the Orthodox community and a Giuliani supporter , as well as a staunch advocate for Israel .
Anthony Gioia , former ambassador to Malta , and the head of Gioia Management .
He ’s on Giuliani ’s “ finance team . ”
Howard Leach , former ambassador to France , CEO of Leach Capital Corp. and president of Foley Timber and Land Co .
Ed Snider , chairman of Comcast Spectacor , which includes TicketMaster and the Philadelphia Spectrum sports center .
He also is the proprietor of Prism , the biggest pay - per- view TV network in America .
Snider sits on the board of the Simon Wiesenthal Holocaust museum in Los Angeles , and is owner of the Philadelphia Flyers pro hockey team .
Kevin E. Moley , once a senior advisor to Dick Cheney and formerly US representative to international organizations in Geneva .
President of this astroturf outfit is Bradley A. Blakeman , formerly a deputy assistant to the president and now with the public relations firm of Gordon and Gregg .
Most of the above are closely tied into the Lobby , and their agenda is pretty clear : to manipulate the American people into once again supporting a foreign policy that serves the interests of a very narrow sector of foreign opinion , rather than distinctly American interests .
This is , in short , a revolting attempt to pimp out the misery of those who have lost loved ones in the neocons ’ war to make the Middle East safe for Israel  while sacrificing American lives to do so .
The “ Freedom ’s Watch ” ad campaign is going to boomerang , and badly , hitting the War Party in the face with a loud wallop  and a richly deserved one .
To argue , as these ads do , that we have to keep fighting a war in spite of a complete lack of public support  “ politics ”  or else we ’re going to be attacked again , just like on September 11 , 2001 , is a thinly disguised threat  almost as if the War Party is wishing , hoping , and praying for another 9/11 - style attack .
You ’ll note that this propaganda campaign is being launched as we approach the sixth anniversary of that signal event , and we can expect the atmosphere of impending doom to thicken considerably as the day approaches .
These ads are part of it , as is the crazed rhetoric coming from the administration , including the President ’s evocation of the “ stabbed - in - the - back ” thesis as applied to the Vietnam war .
The American people are not going to be won over by a cabal of money - laden ideologues who use the suffering of others to promote and ensure yet more suffering .
The judgement of the majority is clear , and the margin of the antiwar movement ’s victory in the battle for public opinion is growing by the day : Americans oppose this war , and want it to end as soon as possible .
No amount of scare - mongering and slick appeals to primitive emotions are going to revive the war hysteria of the immediate post - 9/11 period .
Nothing short of another 9/11 will accomplish that  which is why we have the more honest neocons , like Stu Bykofsky , openly pining for just that .
What ’s pathetic , really , and quite telling , is that Señor Fleischer , asked by guest “ Hardball ” host Mike Barnicle the name of the soldier in the first ad , did n’t know it .
“ I do n’t have it here in front of me . ”
So for all the emotionalism of these ads , they are offered in the most cold - blooded , manipulative manner  typical of the tactics of the War Lobby , and utterly repulsive to most normal people .
Iranian and UN officials began new talks in Tehran on Monday
French Defence Minister Herve Morin challenged Iran to allow UN inspectors unlimited access to sites .
The US said Iran 's efforts to enrich uranium rather than import it more cheaply , indicated that it really wanted nuclear weapons .
Mr ElBaradei said on Sunday that Tehran was years away from developing a bomb .
Iran denies it is seeking to build nuclear weapons and says it wants only civilian nuclear energy .
Its refusal to stop enriching uranium - a process which can lead to a nuclear bomb - has led the UN Security Council to impose two sets of sanctions , which the US has followed up with unilateral penalties of its own .
White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said Iran was " enriching and reprocessing uranium , and the reason that one does that is to lead towards a nuclear weapon " .
Her remarks were later clarified by US National Security Council spokesman Gordon Johndroe , who was asked whether any country enriching uranium seeks nuclear weapons .
" I would say that we 're concerned about Iran doing this because they could have the capability to have a nuclear weapon .
Each country is different , but obviously Dana was asked and was talking about Iran , " he said .
French scepticism
The French defence minister said : " Our information , which is backed up by other countries , is contrary [ to Mr ElBaradei 's comments ] . "
Iran has denied its nuclear work is intended to develop weapons
" If ... ElBaradei is right then there is no reason that Iran stops ElBaradei and the IAEA [ the UN nuclear watchdog ] from carrying out inspections , " Mr Morin told reporters on a visit to Abu Dhabi .
" If [ the nuclear programme ] is only civil what would be the reason to stop international inspections ? "
The IAEA has some access to Iranian nuclear facilities but Tehran 's refusal to allow intrusive inspections means the UN cannot verify the absence of undeclared nuclear material .
The US Ambassador to the UN , Zalmay Khalilzad , said on Monday that Washington saw " no indication " Iran was moving towards suspending uranium enrichment .
Eyes on ElBaradei
Mr ElBaradei's deputy , Olli Heinonen , arrived in Tehran on Monday for a now round of talks on Iran 's nuclear programme .
There is tension between Western countries and Mr ElBaradei over an agreement he reached with Iran in August , drawing up a timetable for the country to answer questions about its past nuclear activities .
This was seen as buying time for Iran , the BBC's Laura Trevelyan reports from the UN .
Mr ElBaradei says he will report to the IEAE 's board in mid-November on how much information Iran has provided .
He warned Tehran of the importance of active co-operation and transparency .
Diplomats say discussions on a third sanctions resolution are under way in case Iran stalls again .
However it is not clear that Russia and China will support further sanctions , our correspondent adds .
Wonkette :
Iraq veteran and honorably discharged Marine Sgt. Adam Kokesh has been the Pentagon 's biggest public relations nightmare this year , because he 's some kind of magical Cindy Sheehan - people actually like him ! [..]
Kokesh and his anti-war veteran buddies have pulled several picture - perfect stunts in Washington , including a mock military funeral at the Hart Senate building and keeping score of how many times Alberto Gonzales said " I do n't recall " during his Senate grilling last month .
The funeral stunt earned the protesters a coveted " political protest " arrest - apparently it's now illegal to protest anything for political reasons - and your favorite Marine was also charged with " Unlawful Assembly - Loud and Boisterous , " despite the fact that he was silent during the performance .
For this , the Marine Corps is now " investigating " Kokesh , even though he 's officially out of the Corps and banished from reenlistment due to bringing home an Iraqi pistol for his war souvenir - that 's against the rules if you get caught !
On Monday , Kokesh has to show up at a hearing so the Corps can re-discharge him , this time dishonorably .

September 23 , 2007 at 06:55 Tags Lisp
In discussions of Lisp code , you will often see the terms free variable and bound variable used .
Understanding these terms is essential in order to really grok how lexical scoping and closures work in Lisp .
Today , while watching one of the SICP video lectures ( 5.1a ) , I saw a great definition for these terms that I want to record here .
A bound variable :
A variable , V , is “ bound in an expression ” , E , if the meaning of E is unchanged by the uniform replacement of a variable , W , not occurring in E , for every occurrence of V in E .
And a free variable :
A variable , V , is “ free in an expression ” , E , if the meaning of E is changed by the uniform of replacement of a variable , W , not occurring in E , for every occurrence of V in E .
Let ’s look at an example :
( lambda ( x ) (* x 2 ) )
In this expression , x is bound according to the definition , because of we change every occurrence of x by w , we get :
( lambda ( w ) ( * w 2 ) )
Which is essentially the same expression .
On the other hand , consider :
( lambda ( x ) (* x y ) )
Here , x is still bound , but y is free .
That is because if we change y to , say , z :
( lambda ( x ) (* x z ) )
We get an expression with a different meaning .
To see an all - encompassing example , consider this snippet of code :
(( lambda ( x ) (* x 2 ) ) 6 ) => 12 ( ( lambda ( w ) (* w 2 ) ) 6 ) => 12
Nothing changes , really , because x ( and now w ) is bound in the expression .
On the other hand :
( define y 5 ) ( define z 2 ) ( ( lambda ( x ) (* x y ) )
9 ) => 45 ( ( lambda ( x ) (* x z ) ) 9 ) => 18
The Art of Niche Linkbaiting
This is the first guest post ever on my site , and it could n’t come from a better blogger .
Ahmed Bilal is a prolific writer , who is found frequently on Performancing , with such posts as 21 Ways to Build a Better Blogger , and What Makes a WordPress Theme Great .
Many thanks to Ahmed for starting guest posting off here with a bang .
Are you interested in guest posting here ?
Feel free to pitch me an idea via my contact form .
On to the post …
Linkbaiting is usually defined as some form of content on your website / blog that attracts links , but in reality it can be any action or news story ( as will as different forms of content – images , videos , podcasts , etc ) that attracts the attention of the linkerati .
Understanding linkbaiting is one thing , learning to recognise linkbait opportunities for your niche market is quite another .
In this article , I ’ll discuss specific strategies that you can use to discover linkbait topics for your own niche .
1. Identify Your Audience
Let ’s get one thing clear from the start – the linkerati are not your actual blog / site audience – they are just the people who are most likely to link to interesting , quality content , thus making your content popular so that it gets noticed by your end audience , the people using industry - leading blogs and search engines to find information in your niche .
Bloggers in your niche
Bloggers in related niches
Active community members in your niche ( forum users , blog commenters / readers , etc )
Social media networks ’ users
Different styles of presenting content attract different types of audiences – you may write an article that attracts a lot of links from forums and encourages debate but gets little love from bloggers .
On the other hand , you could put up some news that puts you on the front page for many bloggers just because you wrote something funny , but it could escape the attention of forum goers completely .
Forum links may not provide great search engine value but you can be pretty sure they bring in regular readers , and that in itself is as valuable ( if not more ) than links .
You want to be able to target all sections of your audience , even if it takes you several baits to attract one section at a time .
Links from these sources are important in their own way and in terms of bring readers and search engine rankings , these are a must .
2. Research and Observe Successes and Failures
Find out what works in your niche on social media networks .
You can do this quite easily by searching through a particular network based on your niche keywords ( or any specific topic that you want to cover ) .
Observer what the top blogs / sites in your niche talk about and link to .
Track trends – what ’s hot right now , what ’s not .
Track the timeless stuff – discussions and topics that never get old .
All this time , keep making notes of what you can write about using the information you are accumulating from all this research .
Build a profile of what topics are successful and what type of writing is most linked to .
You ’ll realise that most of the time , people will link to friends , although sometimes they will link to stuff that they ’ve come across out of coincidence .
More on the promotional angle later – for now observe what sells ( and what does n’t ) .
3. Write Your Resource Bait
Find a good ‘ resource ’ topic to write on in your niche – something basic and foundational .
If it fits the profile of flagship content , even better .
In fact , I would suggest that it would greatly help you if , before this step , you read the two articles I ’ve linked to here on linkbaiting and flagship content .
The ideas you will get just from reading these two articles will be enough to keep you busy writing linkbait for several weeks .
Do not limit yourself by excluding topics that have already been covered online .
If there is a gap which you think can be improved , go forth and fill that gap .
Provide your unique analysis , freshen things up by making them simpler and clearer ( if the material is dense and detailed ) and / or flesh topics out ( if the material is sketchy on details ) .
If you ’re stuck on how to structure your content ( and structure is a key part of good linkbait ) , here ’s how to do it .
4. Copy Successful Linkbait Formats
You ’ve been researching articles that get links in your niche , right ?
By now you ’ll see familiar patterns in how the content is structured .
I ’d urge you to go ahead and copy a popular format ( whether you go with a list or a mini- report ) and add your own variations if you feel it necessary ( images are a must , by the way ) .
For resource - oriented linkbait , lists , reports , series of articles ( mini- linkbaits ) – all of these work really well .
And when you are copying success , remember that it all starts with a ) the right topic and b ) a killer headline .
5. Promote Through The Right Channels
Unless you have 50 friends who are going to digg all your articles ( well , until the repeated patterns gets your site banned on suspicion of trying to game Digg ) , you need to work on the smaller social networks where you have a better chance of success .
Propeller , Delicious and StumbleUpon are my bets to start with , plus you should look towards social networks and aggregators in your niche .
Leverage your existing social networks – encourage your friends to vote for you / link to you ; if you have strong profiles on Orkut , Facebook or MySpace then leverage them to the hilt .
Are you a new blogger just starting out ?
In that case you wo n’t attract the attention of the big fish .
Instead , the trick is to attract the attention of those second - tier bloggers who are read and linked to by the top bloggers in your niche ( research ! ) and then pitch them your top posts .
And always – always – learn from linkbait promotion success stories .
More Niche Linkbaiting
This is just the tip of the iceberg – there ’s a lot more that you can do in the sphere of linkbaiting , such as :
Use advanced topics to create linkbait
Target ‘ tougher ’ social media networks like Reddit , Fark and Digg
Linkbait the press ( A link from the Fox News website is worth more in terms of traffic and link - building than a front - page story on Digg )
Experiment with different formats and types of content
But all of that comes later , after you have the knowledge , experience and confidence of creating successful niche linkbait .

Riding the New York City Marathon on the city ’s mass - transit system was almost as grueling as running it .
It took seven buses and three subway trains to trek through five boroughs along roughly the same 26.2 - mile route some 40,000 runners will follow this Sunday .
My race began on the S53 bus in Staten Island , and like the start of the actual marathon , there was little space to breathe .
I had to duck errant elbows and fists , and thanks to one of my fellow riders , I was overcome by the odor of a thousand people sweating .
We hit the starting line at the base of the Verrazano Bridge at exactly 10 a.m .
I mapped out my route , which I dubbed the “ Rosie Ruiz run , ” using the MTA ’s online Trip Planner .
If I made every single connection , I could complete the marathon in three hours , 45 minutes – a respectable finish an hour quicker than my running time last year .
But having ridden the city ’s subways and buses all my life , and having written about them for the past two years , I knew , as every runner does , to be prepared for the unexpected on race day .
The weather cooperated until the end of the race ; it was a comfy 55 degrees before it started to rain toward the finish line .
Both times I ran the actual race , it was in the mid-60s with no sign of rain to be found .
I got off the S53 on 86th Street and Fourth Avenue in Bay Ridge at 10:09 , and at this point , we are on a world - record 3.3 - minute - mile pace .
On the R and G trains , I finished two chapters of “ War and Peace , ” which seemed like appropriate reading material for this adventure , and I reached the halfway mark in Long Island City at 11:15 , which put me on track for an elite amateur finish of two hours , 30 minutes .
But I knew from having run the race twice before that this is where the real marathon begins .
Cyclists and pedestrians zipped by us on the jammed 59th Street Bridge .
Then on the M15 bus on First Avenue , we were held up for 47 minutes by a bus driver who did not think marathoning and flash photography were permitted on the transit system .
She insisted on calling her supervisor and held the entire bus hostage while we waited for him to arrive to clear things up .
Instead of getting cheered every step of the way as in the real marathon , now I got yelled at by a pack of elderly women bus passengers who questioned the value and purpose of my enterprise in language unfit for a family paper .
I rounded the stretch up to The Bronx and then back to Manhattan .
The bus driver , having learned of my adventure over the transit radio , stopped me as I swiped my MetroCard .
“ So how ’s your time going ? ” she said .
“ I will do my best to help . ”
I told her I was exhausted , desperately needed a bathroom , and was beginning to doubt I would make it .
“ Do n’t worry , you ’re going to make it , ” a passenger on the M1 told me .
I crossed the finish line in Central Park in four hours , 57 minutes – two minutes slower than I ran the race in 2006 .
Of that time , I spent three hours , 15 minutes riding buses and subways and another one hour , 42 minutes waiting for them .
Along the route that took me on seven buses and three subways , I swiped my MetroCard 10 times .
Nevertheless , I took out my MetroCard once more and felt grateful to live in a city where such feats are even possible .

DESRT WORLD
Background
Daisyworld is a model ecology with coupling between life and the environment .
It shows how the adaptation of plants ( daisies ) can respond to and ameliorate external driving forces .
The model was first proposed by Watson and Lovelock to investigate James Lovelock 's Gaia hypothesis concerning feedbacks between climate and life on the Earth .
The Applet
On an imaginary planet , the sun shines ( insolation ) and daisies grow .
The daisies may have different shade of green ( albedo , from 0 - 1 ) , the lighter they are , the more they reflect sunlight , cooling the planet ( and vice versa ) .
Heat diffuses across the planet via a diffusion constant ( diff ) .
Daisies can die ( fixed probability ) or spread to adjacent sites : they grow best at 295.5 K and the offspring colour mutates by a random amount ( up to mutate ) .
Daisy colour gives no direct reproductive advantage , but some combinations of colours regulating the temperature better , giving a feedback which gives the whole system a growth advantage .
The net effect is that the daisy colour adjusts to regulate the temperature at 295.5K .
Adjust the insolation , and the mean daisy colour adjusts to compensate .
If you choose a curved planet , you will find darker daisies near the pole and lighter ones at the equator .
For extreme insolations , the regulation can no longer compensate , and everything dies ( yellow = bare earth ) .
In the curved planet this can produce polar or equatorial deserts .
The feedback / diffusion process means that some parts of the planet regulate the temperature elsewhere , thus life survives longer on the curved planet , but when it breaks down the formation of a small desert ( no regulation ) causes positive feedback and the desert spreads to cover a whole band of the planet .
To run the applet , press the " Go ! " button .
While running , the " Stop " button pauses the applet , whereas the " New " button allows you to change the parameters without reseting the simulation .
The " Reset " button resets the applet to new random initial conditions .

First , let me thank everyone for their comments on my posts from yesterday .
Personal attacks aside , I actually agreed with a significant percentage of what people wrote .
I hope people will stick around the site to see what else we have to say .
In more case than not , we 're on the same side here .
Ok , on to today 's blogging .
I 'm a bit surprised that this story in Sunday 's NYT about the failed U.S. war in Afghanistan did n't get more attention .
I wo n't try to summarize the tale of missteps by the Bush Administration , although suffice to say it 's as depressing as you might imagine .
At critical moments in the fight for Afghanistan , the Bush administration diverted scarce intelligence and reconstruction resources to Iraq , including elite C.I.A. teams and Special Forces units involved in the search for terrorists .
As sophisticated Predator drone spy planes rolled off assembly lines in the United States , they were shipped to Iraq , undercutting the search for Taliban and terrorist leaders , according to senior military and intelligence officials .
None of this should be terribly surprising .
It was obvious 5 years ago that for its talk about democracy and stability in Afghanistan , they did n't really have the stomach to do the tough sort of nation - building necessary to stop the country from falling back into turmoil .
The Administration 's fixation on Saddam caused them to lose sight of a real potential for foreign policy success in Afghanistan .
Imagine how much better off America would be today if that nation was on the path toward democracy .
It 's rather amazing in one respect .
We dropped the ball on winning a smaller war in Afghanistan so that we could lose a much bigger and costlier war in Iraq .
One line in particular , however , jumped out at me :
The Computer and Communications Industry Association has just released a study it commission to calculate the value returned to the US economy by fair use and other exceptions to copyright .
We often hear stories about how much money the US economy generates by giving certain sectors and companies exclusive access knowledge and information , but it 's rare to see such a quantitative approach to the value created by not creating regulatory monopolies in certain cases .
Even more interesting is the sum that the study comes up with — according to the economists ( who worked " in accordance with a World Intellectual Property Organization methodology " ) , " $ 4.5 trillion in revenue [ was ] generated by fair use dependent industries in 2006 , a 31 % increase since 2002 , fair use industries are directly responsible for more than 18 % of U.S. economic growth and nearly 11 million American jobs .
In fact , nearly one out of every eight American jobs is in an industry that benefits from current limitations on copyright . "
" As the United States economy becomes increasingly knowledge - based , the concept of fair use can no longer be discussed and legislated in the abstract .
It is the very foundation of the digital age and a cornerstone of our economy , " said Ed Black , President and CEO of CCIA .
" Much of the unprecedented economic growth of the past ten years can actually be credited to the doctrine of fair use , as the Internet itself depends on the ability to use content in a limited and nonlicensed manner .
To stay on the edge of innovation and productivity , we must keep fair use as one of the cornerstones for creativity , innovation and , as today 's study indicates , an engine for growth for our country "

( Fortune Magazine ) --
This past summer 's subprime meltdown involved about $ 900 billion in now - suspect securitized debt , reckless lending , and consumers who buckled under the weight of loans they could n't afford .
Now another link in the consumer debt chain - credit cards - is starting to show signs of strain .
And the fear that the $ 915 billion in U.S. credit card debt ( an uncannily similar figure ) may blow up has major financial institutions like Citigroup , American Express , and Bank of America strapping on their Kevlar vests .
Last month , as banks reported their worst quarterly results since 2001 , concerns about rising credit card delinquencies began to make their way onto earnings announcements alongside mentions of subprime woes .
First Citigroup ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) , reporting a 57 % decline in earnings , cited higher consumer credit costs and said it would put aside $ 2.24 billion in loan - loss reserves to cover future defaults .
In describing the situation to analysts , CFO Gary Crittenden said Citi 's credit card holders were beginning to increase the balance on their cards or take cash advances on those cards for the first time - behavior that , in his experience ( which includes seven years as CFO of American Express ) , can translate into future trouble .
Citi said the change in loan losses was " inherent in the portfolio but not yet visible in delinquencies . "
Then American Express ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) said that it too was seeing " signs of stress " and would boost its loss reserves in its core U.S. card unit by 44 % .
Capital One ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) , Bank of America ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) , and Washington Mutual ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) all said they are bracing for a 20 % or higher increase in credit card losses over the near and medium term .
So are U.S. credit cards going to be the catalyst for the next seizing up of the global credit markets ?
It depends on whom you ask .
" We are in a heightened state of alert to monitor a potential domino effect , " says Michael Mayo , Deutsche Bank's U.S. banking analyst .
Dennis Moroney , an analyst at TowerGroup , expects credit card delinquencies will rise as consumers , who have until now used home - equity lines of credit to pay off their cards , start ratcheting up higher card debt .
When housing prices were rising , it was easy for consumers to tap the escalating values of their homes to keep borrowing .
With the home - equity spigot turned off , over - leveraged consumers may have trouble keeping up with payments .
The doomsday scenario would play out something like this : Just like CDOs and other asset - backed securities , credit card debt is sliced , diced , and sold off again as packages of securities .
Rising delinquencies would hurt not only the banks involved but the securities backed by the credit card receivables .
Those securities would decline in value as consumers defaulted , leading to bank losses as well as portfolio losses in the hedge funds , institutions , and pensions that own the securities .
If the damage is widespread enough , it could wreak havoc on the economy much as the subprime crisis has done .
To be sure , there are key differences between the subprime market and the problems brewing with credit cards .
The first is that while rising mortgage delinquencies were apparent for months before the subprime market blew up , credit card delinquencies are actually coming off unusually low levels .
" This is absolutely not the next one to blow , " says Meredith Whitney , banking analyst at CIBC .
Christopher Marshall , CFO of Fifth Third Bancorp in Cincinnati , points out that the U.S. has a long history of credit card securitization , " so it 's fairly well understood . "
The securitization of the subprime sector , by comparison , " got blurry , and people did n't focus on what it meant . "
Credit agencies that monitor credit cards in the asset - backed securities market share that confidence .
" The performance in the core consumer [ asset - backed securities ] sectors is expected to deteriorate modestly , but not enough to cause substantial downgrades , " says Kevin Duignan , managing director at Fitch .
But credit card debt is different from subprime debt in another way :
Unlike mortgages , credit card debt is unsecured , so a default means a total loss .
And while missed payments are at a historical low , they show signs of an uptick :
The quarterly delinquency rate for Capital One , Washington Mutual , Citigroup , J.P. Morgan Chase , and Bank of America rose an average of 13 % in the third quarter , compared with a 2 % drop in the previous quarter .
What 's more , consumers and the people who market financial services to them may not have learned their lesson .
Klaus - Peter M�ller , CEO of Germany 's Commerzbank , told Fortune he was stunned on a recent trip to the U.S. to see TV ads still aggressively touting no-questions - asked credit .
In Germany he 's calling for tighter standards .
" I 'm speaking out on the ethical questions about consumer lending , " he says .
If there is an international precedent the U.S. should be watching , it 's actually that of the U.K .
British consumers are just as overstretched as Americans , but since the real estate market there rose faster and fell earlier , they 're about 18 months ahead in the credit cycle .
Since the last quarter of 2005 , credit card delinquencies and charge - off rates in Britain have risen as much as 50 % , forcing banks to take huge write - offs .
It 's a sign of the times that , according to one survey last month , 6 % of British homeowners have been using their credit cards to pay their mortgages .
That 's suicidal , of course , given that credit card interest rates are more than double even the heftiest mortgage .
Keep your fingers crossed that it's not a trend that crosses the Atlantic .
I have the most knee trembling orgasms when I cum on my clit .
They are much more intense than the penetrative kind , which are gripping and pleasurable .
It must be due to the nerve ending stimulation which clit masturbation brings about .
Well today because I have no vehicle I was unable to get in to work so what does a naughty girl do ?
I took myself off to the bedroom with one of my favourite DVD ’s to accompany my afternoon fun .
I turned on the player and placed the DVD in the drive , removed all my clothes and climbed under the sheets .
The DVD started up and I fast forward to the scene with the young blonde taking it up the ass whilst deep throating the other .
I leaned over and withdrew my clit vibe from my drawer .
It ’s so handy having it in my bedside drawer , for such an emergency .
😉
Laying back against the bed I ran my fingers between my pussy lips , no need for lube I was more than ready .
The vibe needed a little lube so I licked the rubber cup ensuring that plenty of saliva went inside .
Shuffling to get more comfortable I opened my legs and placed the cup over my clit , pushing my swollen pussy lips apart for docking on to my eager clit .
With a press of the button my vibe started to vibrate sending electronic ripples through my pink nub and in to my pubic bone .
Setting one was good , then setting two but three had just the intensity I needed .
I moved the cup from side to side massaging my button , keeping contact with my flesh , feeling those vibrations work their way through the tip of my bud , up into my pubis .
I crossed my ankles and pushed my right foot in to the top of my left as my body started to react to the stimulation .
My eyes were fixed on the girl being taken anally whilst the other guy fucked her moth , mascara running down cheeks as she gagged for effect .
My hips began to buck and I tightened my buttocks , as my nerve endings started send small electric impulses around my lower back and pubis .
I moved the vibe faster across my clit , waggling the swollen flesh beneath the cup .
I was now bucking against my hand , almost holding my breath as my orgasm took me over .
“ Aghhhh ! ” , I cried out .
Fortunately there was nobody in next door .
As the orgasm started to subside I thought I would continue to masturbate and see if I could make myself come again .
I ’ve never been able to do this , usually my clit is so sensitive after orgasm that it makes it almost impossible to rub it any more .
Today it was different , I decided to try for another .
I relaxed back against the mattress again and began to move the vibe around my clit .
At first it did n’t arouse me and I was about to give in , knowing that I usually get to come once this way .
But I had a gut feeling that this was going to be a good session .
From nowhere another orgasm built and I cried out once more as my orgasm enraptured every fibre of my being .
I did n’t prolong the orgasm , so as to try once more .
I succeeded in coming four times .
This is a first for me and for some strange reason I feel quite proud of myself .
I had come so much that it had run between my butt cheeks and wet the sheet underneath me . 😉
After the final orgasm had subsided I watched the rest of the MFM scene , somehow it is always more enjoyable to watch porn when you have come yourself .
I think I may have been smiling …

You know what ?
I ’m starting to miss compulsory semicolons as statement terminators in Ruby .
“ What ? ” I hear you say .
“ But not needing semicolons is one of Ruby ’s cardinal virtues !
Are you mad ? ”
I do n’t think so , but maybe you ’ll disagree after I explain further .
Here ’s a piece of code that I might write if semicolons were the only way of terminating a statement :
Category.should\_receive(:find\_by\_permalink ) . with ( ' foo ' ) .and\_return( mock\_category ) ;
def find\_tags \_for( tag\_maker , order = ' count ' ) klass = tag\_maker.class find :all , : select => ' tags.\* , count ( tags.id ) count ' , : group => Tag.sql\_grouping , : joins => " LEFT JOIN taggings ON " + " tags.id = taggings.tag\_id " + " LEFT JOIN bookmarks ON " + " bookmarks.id = taggings.taggable\_id " + " AND taggings.taggable\_type = ' Bookmark ' " + " LEFT JOIN \#{klass.table\_name} ON " + " \#{klass.table\_name}.id = bookmarks.\#{klass.to\_s.underscore}\_id " , : conditions => conditions\_for(tag\_holder ) , : order => ( order == ' count ' ) ? ' count(tags.id ) desc , tags.name ' : " tags.name " , : readonly => true ; end
Category.should\_receive(:find\_by\_permalink ) \\ . with ( ' foo ' ) \\ .and\_return(mock\_category ) ;
\\
form\_for( @comment ) do |f| f.input ( : author ) f.input ( : title ) f.input ( : body ) end
Comment >> printOn : html ( html formFor : self ) input : \#author ; input : \#title ; input : \#body .
(( self collect : \[ : each | each wordCount ) inject : 0 into : \[ : total : each| total + each\ ] ) printOn : aStream .
self collect : \[ : each | wordCount\ ] ;; inject : 0 into : \[ : total : each | total + each\ ] ;; printOn : aStream .
Or how about a complex find query I first came across the idea of the leading comma in Damian Conway 's excellent [ Perl Best Practices ] ( amazon:0596001738 ) .
The idea is that , by leading with the comma it 's very easy to add a new argument to an argument list or hash specification without having to remember to stick a comma on the end of the preceding line if it was at the end , and also , the leading comma makes it very plain that the line is a continuation of its predecessor in some way .
To make the examples work in Ruby , you have to add a `\` to the end of each line that has a continuation , so the first example has to be written : Lining up thes helps to stop them disappearing , but it 's an awful faff .
What tends to happen ( in the rails source especially ) is that ruby programmers simply do n't break their lines up .
A quick search of the rails source finds plenty of lines more than 160 characters long .
Of course , some will argue that it does n't matter , that the old 80 column limit is a silly hangover from the days of steam when the only way to interact with your code was through an 80 column , green phosphor terminal .
They have a point .
An arbitrary line limit * is* silly , and we should get over it , especially in source code .
However , unless you 're going to go around with every window open to its maximum width , lines * will * wrap , and they wo n't do it nicely , or respect the indentation conventions of your language .
Long lines are murder in diffs too , finding the point of difference is so much easier when your eye does n't have to scan an epic line .
It 's a shame there 's no way of forcing ruby 's parser to * require * semicolons as statement terminators for those programmers like me who think that the restriction that a statement * must * end with a semicolon is worth the freedom to break lines where we like without needing to escape every line break .
It 's a shame too that popular tools like Textmate are so clumsy when it comes to dealing with line breaks .
I would attempt to hold Emacs up as a paragon in this respect , but its Ruby mode tends to get a wee bit bemused once you start breaking lines , so that 's no good .
### Domino theory
It 's amazing how far reaching seemingly simple language design decisions can be is n't it ?
Just getting rid of the need to terminate statements with a semicolon has an enormous effect on they way code in ruby looks .
I 'm just not sure that they look * better * .
Maybe Smalltalk got it really right - they chose to use the most valuable syntactic character of all , the space , to denote sending a message .
That freed up the `.` for use as a statement ( sentence ? ) terminator .
Then that freed up ` ;` for use in one of Smalltalk 's most distinctive patterns - the cascade .
Where a Rails programmer might write : A Smalltalk programmer might eliminate the need for a temporary variable by doing :
All those `input : ...` messages get sent to the result of `html formFor : self` .
Once you get the hang of it , it 's a really sweet bit of syntax .
Incidentally , there 's been some discussion on the squeak mailing lists of a companion to the cascade , which would use a ` ; ;` as a sort of ' pipe ' .
The idea is to be able to replace code like : with ( NB : Please ignore what those code snippets * do* , because that 's gruesome .
Concentrate on how they do it ) .
Nobody 's quite proposed going as far as Haskell does with its Monads , which can be thought of as a magical land where the meaning of the semicolon changes according to what sort of Monad you 're in .
( In an IO monad for instance , the semicolon imposes an evaluation order .
In some other monad , the semicolon could just as easily denote a backtracking point ) .
Then again , there 's nothing to * stop * the dedicated Smalltalker implementing something Monadish - every Smalltalk class can specify how its methods should be compiled after all ... ###
In conclusion .
..
I 'm not sure I 've got a real conclusion for all this .
I 'm mostly musing .
However , I do think it 's useful to think carefully about restrictions and what they free us to do as programmers .
Lispers will wax lyrical about the way that their language 's pared down syntax lets them do amazing things with macros .
Smalltalkers will defend to the death the idea that the only way to do anything is to send messages to objects .
Pythonistas love their syntactic whitespace .
Haskellers love their static typing ( admittedly , they have an incredibly flexible notation for expressing type that leaves most other programming languages standing ) .
And any English speaker with ears will know that a poem like Dylan Thomas 's Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night gains much of its power from it 's form , the villanelle , one of the most restricted forms of poetry there is .
Two lines repeating through the poem and a staggering number of rhymes to find : >
Do not go gentle into that good night , >
Old age should burn and rave at close of day ; >
Rage , rage against the dying of the light . >
Though wise men at their end know dark is right , >
Because their words had forked no lightning they >
Do not go gentle into that good night . >
Good men , the last wave by , crying how bright >
Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay , > Rage , rage against the dying of the light . >
Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight , >
And learn , too late , they grieved it on its way , >
Do not go gentle into that good night . >
Grave men , near death , who see with blinding sight >
Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay , > Rage , rage against the dying of the light . >
And you , my father , there on the sad height , >
Curse , bless me now with your fierce tears , I pray . >
Do not go gentle into that good night . >
Rage , rage against the dying of the light .
If that 's not making a virtue of a restriction , I do n't know what is .
A reproduction of the painting was created
Spielberg 's staff spotted an FBI theft notice last week and realised it was in their employer 's collection .
Norman Rockwell 's Russian Schoolroom was bought by Spielberg in 1989 from a legitimate dealer , the FBI said .
The painting was stolen in 1973 from an exhibition in Missouri .
The FBI estimate the work could be worth $ 700,000 ( £ 360,000 ) .
Spielberg is co-operating with the FBI and will keep hold of the painting until its " disposition can be determined " , the FBI said .
Spielberg 's office got in touch with the FBI immediately
The work features a group of children in a classroom with a bust of Vladimir Lenin .
Rockwell is best known for his evocative portrayals of everyday small - town life .
He created many covers for the Saturday Evening Post , the magazine he considered to be the " greatest show window in America " .
Rockwell died in 1978 at the age of 84 .

My story on Al Franken ’s Minnesota senate run hits the web today , and I thought I ’d round it out with some more material on the blog .
There were three things that I heard consistently when I was on the ground in Minnesota .
First , no one seemed to mind that Franken ’s background is an unconventional one for a Senate candidate .
Here were some responses I got when I asked about it :
“ I think a lot of comedians find real big problems in our world .
And they point out problems by making humor out of them . ”
“ It may be time we sent someone different to Washington . ”
“ Anybody who listens to [ his radio show ] knows he knows his stuff .
If you read his books , you know he knows his stuff . ”
“ You can be a comedian and you can still be serious . ”
“ Humor is a form of common sense anyway . ”
I was genuinely surprised that Minnesota Democrats ( known as DFLers ) were not more worried about Franken ’s history of dirty jokes and lack of public service .
The national media seems to think those two factors make Franken ’s candidacy a non-starter , and Norm Coleman , the Republican incumbent , and other GOP forces are trying to play them up as much as possible .
The second thing I found is that Minnesotans deny being abnormally open to oddball candidates .
It ’s a common media meme , based on the fact that Minnesota elected Paul Wellstone , a short , bald college professor with a fanatical devotion to extremely liberal beliefs , and Jesse Ventura , a wrestler and C - level actor .
“ I do n’t know if it ’s just an anomaly , ” Franken told me .
“ People embraced Paul because of his uniqueness , and I do n’t know if that was just … unique . ”
He made the point that Wellstone connected in a very special way with people and was almost genetically truthful , and that voters from any state would have found him appealing .
“ And Ventura won in a three - way race at a point when the state was totally flush , when the economy was just tooling along , we had a surplus in the country and in the state .
And I really believe that during that period … people went like , “ How hard is it really to do this ? ”
Franken pointed something else out .
“ I think Ventura did speak to people ’s dissatisfaction with the blandness of politics at the time .
You know he had Skip Humphrey and Norm Coleman on either side of him . ”
As Minnesota native Garrison Keillor would say , “ empty suits . ” ( Coleman later went on to win Wellstone ’s senate seat after Wellstone died in a plane crash less than two weeks before the election . )
Even the professional punditry agreed .
I asked Wy Spano , long - time Democratic politico and Director of the Center for Advocacy and Political Leadership at University of Minnesota Duluth , if Minnesotans like quirky politicians .
He seemed taken aback .
“ I do n’t know about that , ” he said .
He paused , and then went into a detailed explanation of Wellstone ’s and Ventura ’s elections .
This is the way Minnesotans account for their voting history , from Franken and Spano all the way down the line .
If you examine the circumstances of Wellstone and Ventura individually , they say , and look at the accidents of history surrounding their campaigns , the explanations reveal themselves .
As Mark Ritchie , Minnesota ’s Secretary of State , said to me , “ I do n’t think voters appreciate quirkiness here any more than any place else . ”
As for authenticity , it ’s on the fore because of Wellstone — a man who Minnesotans , at least politically active ones , clearly still miss .
Instead of a senator in Wellstone who was legendary for his rigid principles , Minnesotans got Coleman , a former Democrat with weathervane tendencies .
One Democrat described Coleman to me as “ one of the most transparently phony people in all of American politics . ”
Franken has an aura of authenticity that Minnesotans were buzzing about .
Maybe it ’s that he sometimes gets so angry over a Bush Administration sin that he stumbles over his words and loses any semblance of a politician ’s veneer .
Maybe it ’s that he has confronted all of the Right ’s biggest bullies ( O’Reilly , Limbaugh , Gingrich , Wolfowitz , among others ) and no half - hearted liberal would put his reputation in harm ’s way so recklessly and frequently .
Regardless of the reason , people buy in .
“ We tend to send the same kind of people [ to Washington ] , ” said a retired farmer I spoke with Minnesota .
“ [ They ] are arrogant , have ambition , and have drive , and when they get there they kind of forget why they went .
I think Al is the kind of person who if he got there would be the same kind of person he is now . ”
The question is , is that a good thing for Minnesota ?
And for the Democratic Party ?
And PS – I should admit that I spoke mostly to Democrats when I was up north — following a Democratic candidate on the campaign trail does n’t put you in touch with many Republicans — so people were naturally disposed toward Franken .
But the facts as I saw them do have bearing on his chances in the Democratic primary .
I did attempt to contact Coleman ’s campaign and the Minnesota Republican Party — they did n’t return my calls .
President George W. Bush held an hour - long video conference with Iraqi leaders on Monday and pronounced himself “ impressed and reassured , ” announced White House Press Secretary Tony Snow .
The president believes that Iraqi “ leaders are working together ” on important issues .
Yes , President Bush has seen light at the end of the tunnel .
He believes that we have turned the corner .
He knows the dark of night is about to give way to the light of dawn .
He thinks we have achieved a real turning point .
What could be more obvious ?
Of course , that ’s what he has been telling us ever since he stood on the flight deck of the USS Abraham Lincoln on May 1 , 2003 and declared : “ Mission Accomplished . ”
In March 2004 President Bush cheerfully told soldiers at Fort Campbell that “ Because America and our allies acted , all the world is now seeing democracy rising in the heart of the Middle East . ”
Iraqi law now “ guarantees basic rights for all : freedom of religion , the right to cast a secret ballot , and equality under the law .
And these historic changes are sending a message across the region from Damascus to Tehran : Freedom is the future of every nation . ”
As news from Iraq grew darker , President Bush continued to verbalize happy thoughts .
Last June , for example , U.S. troops were on the move and Iraqi politicians were promising results .
President Bush announced that “ I sense something different happening in Iraq . ”
A few months later he dumped Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld , before promising victory by escalating the war .
Now the president says he is “ impressed and reassured . ”
The Bush surge has been billed as a last resort , an escalation intended to reduce violence enough to help Iraqi politicians reach an accommodation .
Give credit to Gen. David H. Petraeus , the overall U.S. commander in Iraq : he ’s experimenting with new tactics , rather than simply doing more of the failed same .
Putting a good face on events in Iraq , he said that the extra troops had enabled “ us now to launch operations into sanctuaries , areas in which we have had very little coalition force presence other than raids in recent years . ”
Unfortunately , while it might be too early to call the Bush escalation a bust , there is little reason to believe that it will result in anything approaching “ victory , ” whatever that means .
Adding five combat brigades to Iraq has had only a limited impact on the violence , and even that appears to be wearing off .
And Iraqi politicians seem little inclined to make the compromises necessary to achieve genuine reconciliation .
Indeed , the legislature is taking two months off this summer , as if it had completed its work and peaceful nirvana had replaced sectarian war .
If this is the best Iraq is going to become , then why are U.S. troops still there ?
Sadly , the president has been living in a dream world from the moment he first considered attacking Iraq .
He imagined that the U.S. could magically implant liberal democracy in the Mideast with Iraqis cheerfully submitting to foreign rule .
For a long time his officials reinforced the president ’s message .
But the president ’s appointees suddenly seem to be edging away from him .
For instance , Ryan Cocker , the American ambassador in Baghdad , says that “ the surge by itself does not fix the problem . ”
He calls the situation “ a mixed picture , but certainly not a hopeless one . ”
Quite an endorsement .
Speaking of the Iraqi government , Defense Secretary Robert Gates says “ that frankly we are disappointed by the progress so far . ”
Gen. Raymond Odierno , the operational commander in Iraq , admits that the authorities have full control of only 40 percent of Baghdad , despite the concentrated enforcement as part of the surge .
The rest of Baghdad lacks outside control or suffers “ a high level of violence . ”
This information hardly fills one with confidence .
Gen . Petraeus admitted on Fox News that “ certainly it is a mix , ” with the number of sectarian murders and car bombs in Baghdad falling but the overall number of attacks in Iraq rising .
Moreover , he said that September is too soon to assess the impact of the troop increase .
The many challenges facing the U.S. wo n’t even be resolved “ in a year or even two years , ” he contended .
Petraeus pointed to British counter - insurgency operations in Northern Ireland which “ have gone at least nine or ten years . ”
He also cited the long - term U.S. security guarantee for South Korea  now in its 54th year  as “ probably a fairly realistic assessment ” of what the U.S. would need to do .
This judgment is really encouraging .
Last weekend the U.S. military initiated “ Operation Arrowhead Ripper , ” sending 10,000 troops into Diyala province , 31 miles northeast of Baghdad .
The sweep is supposed to flush out and kill Al - Qaeda operatives .
The early results were “ positive , ” explained Bobby Ghosh of Time magazine , by which he meant “ the U.S. forces reported they had killed at least 22 insurgents . ”
At this rate even ten years obviously is a wildly optimistic estimate for pacifying the country .
Indeed , over the last four years the Bush administration has claimed to have killed thousands of insurgents , yet their number continues to grow .
In any case , on its own terms the surge appears to be faltering .
This is not the first time that the U.S. sought salvation in Iraq through a troop build - up .
In early 2004 the growing insurgency caused Iraqi officials to join American politicians in calling for more troops .
Defense Secretary Rumsfeld made permanent a previously temporary increase in personnel in order to enhance U.S. military operations .
That troop “ surge ” did not prevent Iraq from falling down several rungs of Dante ’s hell .
Even today ’s increased force level is too low to have any real chance of success .
The U.S. currently has 150,000 troops in Iraq , about the same as in May 2003 .
( The number of other Coalition personnel actually has dropped by 11,000 over the same period . )
As such , the “ surge ” has merely put us back to the inadequate numbers with which Washington began the occupation .
Alas , that number is clearly insufficient under the anti-insurgency doctrine developed by Gen.
Petraeus ; instead , the occupation force should be two or three times larger .
But the U.S. does n’t have sufficient manpower and the administration does n’t have sufficient public support to use that manpower even if it was available .
Unfortunately , the results of the Bush escalation bear out this judgment .
Last month was one of Iraq ’s bloodiest , with at least 2,155 Iraqi deaths .
In Baghdad there were 743 execution - style murders in May , close to the pre-surge number of 830 in January .
With 126 American personnel killed , May was the worst month since 2004 , and U.S. military officials warn that the coming months could be even worse .
Equally disheartening is the Brookings Institution ’s latest statistical State of Iraq .
Looking at the month of May , they find that U.S. troop deaths were 37 in 2003 , 69 last year , and 123 in 2007 .
Iraqi security force deaths were , respectively , 50 , 150 , and 198 .
Attacks on Iraqi and coalition civilians ran 150 , 3,500 , and 4,200 .
Iraqi civilian deaths were 500 , 2,670 , and 2,750 .
The number of Iraqis forced to flee were 10,000 , 100,000 , and 80,000 .
Multiple fatality bombings were 0 , 56 , and 42 .
The percentage of Iraqis saying that their country was moving in the right direction was 70 , 39 , and 36 .
Los Angeles Times reporter Tina Susman finds that Iraqis who felt safer in the immediate aftermath of the surge now report “ the reappearance of roaming Shiite militiamen and corpses on the streets . ”
A junior Army officer , who remained anonymous out of fear of retaliation , told her : “ I just know it ’s not much different than it was seven months ago .
We are n’t holding ground . ”
Even more astonishing , the Pentagon ’s latest official assessment , “ Measuring Stability and Security in Iraq , ” [ pdf ] offers little reason for optimism .
Actual experience continues to belie administration promises .
For instance , political reconciliation appears to be going no where fast .
DOD notes that “ Reaching consensus among a wide array of political factions with competing agendas has proven difficult . ”
Reform of the de-Baathification process “ could be delayed months . ”
Moreover , “ Iraqi politicians continue to make little progress toward enacting laws that could advance reconciliation . ”
Overall , the process “ has been complicated by violence and slow progress in forging cooperation among political parties , as well as by the dominance of identity politics over politics based on issues . ”
The economic news , despite some positive signs , is equally disappointing .
Reports DOD : “ Over the past quarter the Iraqi government has made little progress ” in “ improving the availability of basic services such as electricity , water , and health care . ”
That Iraq is actually producing less oil and generating less electricity than earlier in the occupation is truly shocking .
Access to health care “ continues to face numerous challenges due to increases in demand due to violence , shortages in electricity and medical supplies , and intimidation and kidnapping of doctors and nurses , as well as reports of theft and corruption . ”
Even worse is the appraisal of the security situation .
The challenge obviously is enormous .
Explains the Pentagon :
" The increasingly complex conflict has remained a struggle among and within ethno - sectarian , criminal , insurgent and terrorist groups to wrest political and economic power from the elected [ Iraqi government ] .
Much of the violence is attributable to sectarian friction , and each faction is driven by its own political and economic power relationships .
Illegally armed groups are engaged in a cycle of sectarian and politically motivated violence , using tactics that include indiscriminate bombing , murder , executions , and indirect fire to intimidate and to provoke sectarian conflict . "
As Gen . Petraeus and others have noted , the “ surge ” has resulted in some good news : sectarian violence and car - bombings are down in Baghdad , while Sunni tribal resistance to al - Qaeda has reduced violence in parts of Anbar Province .
The Iraq security forces have somewhat improved their performance .
Gen .
Petraeus even claims “ astonishing signs of normalcy ” in Baghdad , such as soccer leagues .
However , notes the Pentagon , “ terrorist attacks increased in other areas as [ al - Qaeda Iraq ] and other groups attempted to spread sectarian conflict . ”
Indeed , this “ however ” almost completely subsumes the good news .
First , security remains largely a U.S. job .
Notes DOD , “ Iraqi government delivery on these commitments [ to even - handed enforcement ] has been uneven . ”
Essentially nothing has been done to disarm the sectarian militias , and “ militia infiltration of local police remains a significant problem . ”
Moreover , says the Pentagon , “ Coalition advisors continue to report marginal improvement in the [ Ministry of the Interior ’s ] ability to perform key ministry functions such as developing and implementing plans and policies , intelligence , personnel management , logistics , communications , and budgeting . ”
Moreover , “ Corruption , illegal activity and sectarian / militia influence constrain faster progress in developing [ Interior ministry ] forces and gaining Iraqi populace support . ”
The Ministry of Defense is little better , since its “ continued limited logistic and sustainment capacity is a key hindrance to Iraqi forces ’ ability to assume missions from the Coalition . ”
The best DOD could say is that the Iraqi government had made “ some progress in developing capacity to manage ” police and military forces .
Second , the Bush escalation has reshuffled rather than reduced violence in Iraq .
The Pentagon offers this astonishing admission :
" The overall level of violence in Iraq this quarter remained similar to the previous reporting period but shifted location .
Insurgents and extremists are unable to operate as freely in Baghdad because of [ U.S. operations ] and in Anbar Province because of growing tribal opposition to [ al - Qaeda ] .
Accordingly , many insurgents and extremists have moved operations to Diyala , Ninewa , and the outlying areas of Baghdad Province .
Outside Baghdad and Anbar , reductions in Coalition force presence and reliance upon local Iraqi security forces have resulted in a tenuous security situation .
Sectarian violence and insurgent attacks still involve a very small portion of the population , but public perceptions of violence have adversely affected reconciliation and contribute to population migration . "
In western Iraq , other than Anbar Province , the Pentagon reports that “ insurgent groups continue to attack Coalition and [ Iraqi security ] targets . ”
Moreover , the military reported “ increased inter- sectarian violence in Diyala , increased high - profile attacks in northern Iraq by [ al - Qaeda ] , and Coalition and Iraqi forces confronting the [ Mahdi Army ]  the Shia militia associated with the radical cleric Muktada - al Sadr  in Diwaniyah . ”
Intra-Shia violence rather than al - Qaeda attacks bedevils southern Iraq and , reports DOD , “ has contributed to a significant increase in attacks against Coalition forces in Basrah and an observed greater hostility towards Coalition presence , as well as high - lighted the failure of the Iraqi police to challenge Shia militants in southern Iraq . ”
Even Baghdad , the focus of allied efforts , looked anything but normal .
The Mahdi Army “ continued to act as a de-facto government in Sadr City , ” admitted the Pentagon .
Despite increased security efforts , al - Qaeda “ maintained the ability to conduct infrequent , high - profile , mass - casualty attacks . ”
Finally , “ Although sectarian - motivated Iraqi - on - Iraqi violence has declined in Baghdad , violence against Coalition and Iraqi security forces remained consistent with previous levels . ”
Lest anyone miss the point , DOD helpfully provides a look at “ overall attack trends and violence . ”
Explains the Pentagon : “ The aggregate level of violence in Iraq remained relatively unchanged during this reporting period .
Violence has decreased in the Baghdad security districts and Anbar , but has increased in most provinces , particularly in the outlying areas of Baghdad Province and Diyala and Ninewa Provinces . ”
Throughout the country “ the total number of attacks on Coalition forces , the [ Iraqi security forces ] , and Iraqi civilians increased by 2 % in the February through May reporting period compared with the previous quarter .
High - profile attacks , usually conducted by [ al - Qaeda ] , are now causing more casualties in Baghdad than do murders by militia , criminals , or other armed groups . ”
The number of suicide attacks nationwide jumped from 26 in January to 58 in each of March and April .
It is hard to read the Pentagon ’s latest report and call the result of the surge “ progress . ”
Indeed , the latest “ Failed States Index ” from the Fund for Peace and Foreign Policy magazine places Iraq at number two , trailing only Sudan .
Iraq ran fourth last year , but has deteriorated in virtually every category .
In such areas as group grievances , human flight , security forces , refugees , and human rights , Iraq now is at or near the bottom .
In a rare moment of realistic thinking , President Bush allowed that “ No question , 2006 was a lousy year for Iraq . ”
Yes , it was .
In a new Pew Research Center poll , 56 percent of Americans said they wanted to bring home the troops  as soon as possible .
That ’s up from 53 percent in April .
Those wanting to keep personnel in Iraq fell from 41 percent to 39 percent .
Obviously , Americans are growing impatient with the Iraq occupation , and who can blame them ?
If the administration ’s definition of a successful surge is increased violence across Iraq , then what would be the administration ’s definition of a failed escalation ?
Of course , it would be wonderful if the U.S. could turn Iraq into a liberal democracy .
But even a competent , realistic , far - sighted administration would have little hope of achieving “ victory ” in Iraq .
The Bush crew has no chance .
Indeed , this administration has been guilty of criminal incompetence from day one .
Actually , from before day one , since officials failed to plan for the Iraq occupation .
Gen. Jack Keane , former Army Vice Chief of Staff  and one of the architects of the present escalation  said recently that while the president uses “ terms like ‘ win , ’ ‘ we ’re going to defeat the insurgents , ’ ‘ victory ’ , ” the military “ never had that as a mission in Iraq . ”
Rather , he explained : “ We never even considered an insurgency as a reasonable option .
We took down the regime , and we thought what we had to do then was occupy the country , stabilize it , and in the matter of a few months we could reduce the force . ”
God help us .
President Bush says that he ’s “ impressed and reassured ” with progress in Iraq .
Of course he is .
Helicopters could be lifting U.S. personnel off of building rooftops in Baghdad and the president would tell Americans that all was well .
He has been wrong from the beginning .
Every promise and prediction offered by the administration has been proved wrong .
The early evidence is that the Bush escalation is n’t even reducing overall violence , let alone leading to the sort of permanent political solution necessary for any semblance of peace in Iraq .
Administration policy is a debacle .
The U.S. will leave Iraq .
The only question is how soon and under what circumstances ?
With Iraq in flames , as violence continues and American deaths climb , an American withdrawal cannot come soon enough .

At ProgressiveHistorians.com on August 20 , " Ahistoricality " offered up an absurd mischaracterization of my argument about judicial review in The Politically Incorrect Guide to the Constitution .
This distortion is typical of bloggers ’ treatment of books .
What one learns from this is that it is a bad idea to criticize a book you have n’t read .
Judicial review , recall , is the American practice of having judges refuse to enforce laws they dub " unconstitutional . "
This practice was invented in America , and it remained virtually solely American until the 1980s .
Although this power had been exercised repeatedly by state judges in Virginia before the federal Constitution was ratified , and although federal judges in lower courts had exercised this power before the Supreme Court did so , the power is usually associated with the Supreme Court ’s decision in Marbury v. Madison ( 1803 ) .
" Ahistoricality " says of my argument that , " His principle argument seems to be that Marbury v. Madison , which established the principle of judicial review , was contrary to the spirit and intent of the constitution . "
But that is absolutely not my argument .
If " Ahistoricality " knew anything about the Constitution , he would recognize this , as he goes on to quote me as saying , " The chief problem , it seems to me , is that although judicial review was said by the Constitution ’s proponents in some states to be among the powers federal courts were intended to have — and thus is legitimate — the people were not told that it would be exercised by federal courts over state statutes .
They certainly were not told that under the title of a u2018 living , breathing ’ constitution , the federal courts would be empowered to disallow enforcement basically of any state statute they disliked . "
My chief point in The Politically Incorrect Guide to the Constitution is that while nationalists , meaning people who wanted to destroy the local self - government by elected officials for which the Revolution had been fought , were defeated in the Philadelphia Convention , the model of government that the people were sold has by now been replaced by the defeated model : a centralized one in which a national legislature exercises unfettered power and unaccountable judges ’ power grows and grows .
Obviously , then , when I note that judicial review exercised by federal courts over federal laws was said by some of the Constitution ’s proponents to be part of the system they were advocating , I am arguing for its legitimacy to that extent .
My complaint is with the Supreme Court ’s decision in Fletcher v. Peck ( 1810 ) , in which the Court claimed authority to review state laws for " constitutionality . "
The progeny of this case have included a plethora of cases in which the Supreme Court has invented various limitations on state legislative authority without actual constitutional justification .
Here we have the genesis of the Court ’s power to invent " rights " to abortion , homosexual sodomy , one man - one vote , Miranda warnings , secular schools , etc .
It is for that reason that I have advocated " reining in " the courts , apparently to " Ahistoricality " ’s chagrin .
" Ahistoricality " says of me that , " He seems to be trying to balance state ’s rights against the Federalist position ( which is dubious , but let ’s go with it ) . "
Here , he demonstrates his ignorance of my argument concerning the Federalist position .
Contrary to the traditional , Hamiltonian account of the Philadelphia Convention in which the Constitution was drafted and the Jeffersonian Republican Party that dominated federal politics in the first quarter of the nineteenth century , state ’s rights were the key to the Federalist position in the ratification debates of 1787 — 89 .
If " Ahistoricality " read books before criticizing them , he would know that .
( He might find support for this argument in my 2004 Review of Politics essay " Edmund Randolph and Virginia Constitutionalism , " too .
( Of course , this assumes that " Ahistoricality " actually cares to know the truth . ) )
He concludes by pontificating that " the fundamental problem with regard to states ’ rights is n’t the courts , but Congress , and — to a greater extent now than ever before — the Executive - as - national - daddy .
Reducing the role of the courts at a time when Unitary Executive theories are alive in the Administration is a recipe for disaster . "
Again , this demonstrates " Ahistoricality " ’s utter ignorance of the American constitutional system ( not to mention of The Politically Incorrect Guide to the Constitution ) : he had just quoted me decrying John Marshall ’s decision in McCulloch v. Maryland ( 1819 ) , which gave Congress virtually unlimited legislative discretion .
How , then , he could turn around and instruct me concerning the real problem in federal - state relations is unclear .
If he dislikes lawless executives , well , lawless courts are not the answer ; for judges to usurp state legislative authority is not to return to respecting constitutional limits on presidential power .
The Best of Kevin R. C. Gutzman
Reports continue to filter in about DVDs that refuse to play on standard players from Toshiba , LG , Pioneer , Sony , and others .
The culprit is titles that utilize Sony 's ARccOS copy protection scheme , such as Disney 's " Pirates of the Caribbean : Dead Man 's Chest , " The Weinstein Company 's " Lucky Number Slevin , " and Sony 's " Casino Royale , " " The Holiday , " and " Stranger Than Fiction . "
ARccOS artificially scrambles sectors on the disc in an attempt to keep users from ripping the disc to a drive .
Many older ( or less sophisticated ) players simply skip these corrupted areas as unreadable and continue on .
Computers -- and unfortunately , some newer players -- try to perform error correction on these areas and fail playback .
When contacted , Sony seems to deny the problem , much like Microsoft and the 360 disc scratching , and simply passes the buck onto the player manufacturers to upgrade their firmware .
Meanwhile , many users have simply downloaded programs to bypass the protection and make copies without the " defect . "
So , is this a rootkit - like class action lawsuit in the making ?
Is it just overblown hype over a few players that do n't follow standards ?
Another example of copy protection that bites legitimate users and ignores the real problem ?
And do average consumers even care ?

Bush vows to resist calls for withdrawal .
Bush vows veto of Iraq funding bill .
How many times have we seen these headlines before ?
Seems like about 3 times a week since the likelihood first emerged that Congress would pass a bill calling for withdrawal .
In his belligerent , bullying threats to veto the funding that goes with that call for withdrawal , Bush has tried to set up a battle between himself and Congressional Democrats , to make it a partisan fight he can exploit .
But what Mister Bush needs to realize is that this is not fight between him and Democrats .
It is a fight between him and the majority of the American people , a majority in favor of withdrawal .
According to a new CBS News / New York Times poll ( PDF ) , 64 % of Americans believe the U.S. should set a timetable for withdrawal from Iraq in 2008 .
That 's up from 57 % in the same poll just two weeks ago .
And columnists and op - ed writers around the country speak for this majority .
DeWayne Wickham in the News - Leader of Springfield , Missouri :
Having lost the backing of most Americans for the continued presence of U.S. forces in the middle of Iraq 's civil war , Bush now wants to make this conflict the generals ' war .
He wants people to think that congressional Democrats are undermining this nation 's military leaders — not putting the breaks on his war - making power — when they try to force a withdrawal .
Bush bamboozled this nation into war with Iraq .
Now he is trying to hoodwink Americans into believing that Congress is intruding upon the prerogatives of the generals he ordered into combat .
Bush knows better — or at least he should .
Pat Murphy in the Idaho Mountain Express :
Americans are doomed for the next 20 months to endure a presidency driven by a personal obsession — to protect a fragile sense of self - importance with denial of reality .
President Bush wo n't admit the war in Iraq is lost because he and his architects of the " cakewalk " war would be exposed as wrong .
Likewise , President Bush 's " full confidence " in his dunce attorney general , Alberto Gonzales — who lied his way through U.S. Senate questioning by babbling " I do n't recall " and its variation more than 60 times — wo n't let him fire Gonzales because it would mean admitting he was wrong to entrust him with the most intellectually challenging and constitutionally most powerful agency in the land .

MAWULEHAWE
Maloway was sold to help alleviate his family 's poverty
Twelve - year - old Mawulehawe has been sold by his mother to a local fishermen in Ghana for $ 40 ( £ 25 ) .
He may not see his mother again for many years .
She will use the money to buy cooking oil to fry the fish she sells on the shore at Ada , a small fishing town a couple of hours drive east of the capital , Accra .
The fisherman to whom Mawulehawe is sold , Aaron , will take him away to serve a three - year apprenticeship .
Mawulehawe , like many others in the region , is being sold to help alleviate his family 's poverty .
He has several brothers and sisters and has had some schooling , but there is not enough money for him to continue .
It is now his younger brother 's turn to go to school instead .
Mawulehawe insists he is happy with the deal .
Fishing has always been part of his life .
And as his family toast the " sale " with a strong drink , it is clear he sees his new life as a new adventure .
While many of the children working on Lake Volta go enthusiastically , most have no idea the dangers that lie ahead .
The long , unregulated hours and dangers such as getting tangled in the nets underneath the water 's surface can lead to accidents and fatalities .
ALI
The largest number of children found begging in Saudi are from neighbouring Yemen
Six - year - old Ali was picked up by Saudi authorities for begging on the streets of Jeddah .
He was smuggled into Saudi Arabia from Yemen in order to beg .
Ali says he ended up begging after physical abuse involving metal wire attacks on his back .
He says he was beaten up when he said he did not want to beg all day .
Ali is one of thousands of Yemeni children sold to gangs and forced to beg each year .
These children are often sold by families who are duped into believing their offspring will get a better life .
Many of the children who are smuggled over the Saudi / Yemen border are beaten and sometimes even mutilated to become better , more effective beggars .
It is hard to be exact about figures , but in 2005 the Yemeni Ministry of Social Affairs acknowledged that about 300 children were crossing the border every month .
RAHUL AND AMIT
Amit ( L ) and Rahul ( R ) worked in sweat - shops producing zaris
The Kumar cousins - Rahul , 12 and Amit , seven - thought they were leaving their remote village in the north east of India to go to school and learn a trade .
They had no idea their parents had sent them to one of the most populated cities in the world - Delhi - to work in a sweat - shop .
The boys hated sewing beads on fabric for 18 hours a day .
They lived , worked and slept in the same tiny room and only saw daylight when they were allowed out on Sunday under the supervision of a minder .
Their hands are blistered and their feet deformed because of the repetitive nature of the work .
They were beaten and had little food .
Children like Rahul and Amit who work in the zari units are classified as " bonded labourers " , often working to clear obscure debts usually incurred by their families .
" Bonded labour " has been illegal in India since 1976 but legislation is largely unenforced and charitable organisations have taken on the burden of investigating illegal labour .
A non-governmental organisation helped the Kumar boys to escape and return home ... but the welcome they received was not quite what they were expecting .
DALYN
Dalyn was rescued from a brothel when she was 13 years old
When Dalyn was only 12 years old , she was tricked and forced into prostitution .
She recalls how she was approached by a woman who asked her if she would like to work at a garment factory in Kompong Cham .
But when she arrived , she was sold to a brothel in Cambodian capital Pnomh Penh for $ 150 ( £ 78 ) .
Locked in a cage with others underneath the brothel , she was starved , beaten and threatened at gun point until she agreed to service clients .
Many of the children at the shelter where Dalyn is , became infected with HIV or other sexually transmitted diseases after being sold into sexual slavery , and all have been severely traumatised .
Dalyn was rescued by the police and an aid agency but it is only now , at 17 years old and after substantial amounts of therapy , that she feels able to tell her story .
Aid agencies are only able to scratch the surface of the problem of child sex slaves in Cambodia .
In the first six months of last year , of the 186 raids carried out on brothels by the agency , only two resulted in convictions being made .
And in South East Asia alone , Unicef says one million children are involved in the commercial sex trade .
FREDDY
Freddy has been mining since he was six years old
Freddy , 11 , is not a slave .
He is enslaved by poverty .
He bunks off school to work illegally in a Peruvian state - owned gold mine .
He either sneaks in when nobody is looking , or bribes someone to let him in .
What he finds , he keeps .
But the reality is that he finds very little .
He is up at 0500 and works all day .
If he does not find anything , he is beaten by his dad .
There is often no food in the house , so after working all day he begs for food from neighbours or in the street .
Freddy is not alone .
The International Labour Organisation has estimated that up to 50,000 children are working in mines in Peru .
Freddy 's mine at La Rinconada is located at one of the most inhospitable places on earth - 5,500 metres above sea level .
Conditions are dangerous and miners often die from explosions inside .
Freddy is also at risk from many chronic diseases that could affect him later in life having worked in a mine from such a young age .

You know you have heard the ads on the radio and TV … “ We ’ll beat any advertised price or your mattress is FREEEEE ! ” .
Annoying , huh ?
Sometimes funny , but getting old the longer they run on the air .
Anyway , you might have heard that ad at some point and thought about going to them with a competitor ’s ad , hoping to get a free mattress .
Well , sorry to tell you , but it will never happen .
And here is why :
The same mattress is sold under different names at each store that carries them .
Yep , that ’s right .
Say you see an ad for a mattress at Store X called … um … ” Sleepytime ” .
So you take this ad to the above non-mentioned store ( but you know who they are ) and expect them to beat the price or give it to you for free .
However , once you get there , you see that they do not sell the “ Sleepytime ” mattress .
They have another one called “ Nappytime ” that looks the same , but they tell you it is a different model , and they cannot beat the price on the one you brought in , because they do not carry it .
In fact , if you bring an entire mattress ad from another store into their store , you will not find a single one of those mattresses in their store .
Thus , they never have to match and / or beat a single price , because they do not sell anything that anyone else does .
Well , in reality they do , but it is called something else , so in their “ rulebook ” they do n’t .
However , some big chain stores carry the same names , but not all of them .
That is why it is best to just pick a store you feel comfortable buying from , find a mattress you like that they sell , and then either buy it or wait for them to put it on sale .
Driving around from store to store with different ads will get you nowhere , as you will never find the same mattress in two different stores .
Just a little bit of friendly advice for those of you about to drop $ 1,000 or more for a new mattress .
We ended up getting ours at Sears on a year end clearance , and the one we got was $ 1200 … on sale from $ 2500 .
End of the year sales at big chains is a great place to get mattresses , because really , how much are they going to change from one year to the next ?
Would you like your genome sequenced in a matter of hours for under $ 100 ?
An article from GenomeWeb last week , â€ œComplete Genomics , BioNanomatrix to Use $ 8.8M NIST Grant to Develop ‘ $ 100 Genome ’ Platform , â€ reveals that BioNanomatrix and Complete Genomics have partnered together to share an $ 8.8 million grant from the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology to â€œdevelop technology that will be able to sequence a human genome in eight hours for less than $ 100.â € 
From the article ( donâ€™t worry , I have no idea how these technologies really work either ) :
â€ œThe proposed sequencing platform will use Complete Genomicsâ€™ sequencing chemistry and BioNanomatrixâ€™ nanofluidic technology .
The companies said they plan to adapt DNA sequencing chemistry with â€œlinearized nanoscale DNA imagingâ€ to create a system that can read DNA sequences longer than 100,000 bases quickly and with accuracy â€ œexceeding the current industry standard .
â€â€ 
So what does this mean for genetic genealogists ?
Well , considering many genetic genealogy tests cost substantially more than $ 100 and return a much smaller amount of sequencing , whole genome sequencing for $ 100 would have a pretty strong impact .
Although this technology requires a considerable amount of development , there has been a lot of recent investment and remarkable progress in this area .

After Democrats won control of Congress , they moved to fulfill their pledge to crack down on the controversial practice of lawmakers slipping projects in spending bills without public scrutiny .
In February , they scrapped Republican - drafted bills loaded with earmarks and passed a bill that they boasted had none .
Among those celebrating the achievement was Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) , who said that piecing together the $ 463.5 - billion spending bill was difficult , “ but we got it done without a single earmark . ”
But the day after President Bush signed it , Reid wrote federal agencies to “ strongly support the priorities ” in the discarded GOP bills .
“ I believe they are essential to the nation and to my home state of Nevada . ”
Advertisement
Reid was not alone in seeking to save his earmarks .
Lawmakers from both parties -- including Democrats ranging from the most senior , such as Sen. Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia , to one of the most junior , such as Sen. Jon Tester of Montana -- pressed agencies to grant their spending requests , according to correspondence obtained under the Freedom of Information Act by the Center for Investigative Reporting .
The behind - the - scenes lobbying for projects stripped from this once “ earmark - free ” bill underscores how difficult it will be for lawmakers to curtail a practice that has expanded despite criticism that it is out of control .
Already , lawmakers are seeking to replace lost earmarks in next year ’s appropriations bills , although they have promised to be more open about it .
“ What is ironic is that at the same time lawmakers were crowing about no earmarks this year , they were surreptitiously drowning agency heads in funding requests , ” said Steve Ellis of Taxpayers for Common Sense .
Advertisement
Rep. Jeff Flake ( R - Ariz . ) , a leading critic of earmarking and one of the few lawmakers who wants to end the practice , offered a simple explanation : “ We ’re addicts . ”
The Center for Investigative Reporting requested documents from 13 agencies .
Five responded : the Environmental Protection Agency , the departments of Labor , Commerce and Interior , and the Air Force .
Those agencies provided 122 spending requests from 52 senators and 205 representatives between January -- after Democrats announced they would exclude earmarks -- and April .
Federal agencies must fund earmarks lawmakers insert into bills .
With the earmarks eliminated , the agencies were free this year to set their own spending priorities .
So , lawmakers touted their own requests to influence those decisions .
Reid wrote Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne , a former Senate colleague , to ask him to support projects in the Republican - penned Interior bill , which included $ 200,000 for a Mojave Desert science center and $ 300,000 to help preserve historic buildings in the frontier mining town of Goldfield , Nev .

In a handwritten note , Reid added , “ Call if I can ever help . ”
In his letter to Labor Secretary Elaine Chao , wife of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R - Ky. ) , Reid also added a personal touch , scrawling : “ P.S. I ’ll keep an eye on Mitch . ”
Jim Manley , a spokesman for the majority leader , said Reid and other members of Congress have strong views on how to spend federal dollars in their states .
“ There ’s absolutely nothing wrong with communicating these views to the executive branch , ” he said .
Despite the taint attached to the term “ earmark , ” Tester said that he and Sen. Max Baucus ( D - Mont. ) recovered millions of dollars “ lost when Congress did n’t fund specific projects , also known as earmarks . ”
Among the funding they secured : nearly $ 1 million for the Joe Skeen Institute for Rangeland Restoration at Montana State University .

Byrd , one of the Democratic spending bill ’s principal authors , lauded the bill ’s restraint .
“ The legislation does not include earmarks -- hear me -- the legislation does not include earmarks , ” he said on the Senate floor .
But Byrd , chairman of the appropriations committee , who is regarded as a master of pork - barrel politics , then wrote the Interior Department to “ strongly urge ” funding for 13 projects in his state .
The department funded seven , including more than $ 1 million for a fish hatchery for endangered freshwater mussels .
Byrd and other lawmakers have revived their earmarks in the new spending bills now moving through Congress .
The senator , for example , inserted $ 125,000 for the International Mother ’s Day Shrine building in Grafton , W.Va. , in the fiscal 2008 interior appropriations bill .
Lawmakers from both parties wrote the Commerce Department seeking $ 13 million for the National Textile Center , a consortium of universities that conducts research to help U.S. companies remain competitive .
The money was not provided .
Advertisement
Sen. Jack Reed ( D - R.I. ) urged the Commerce Department to provide $ 500,000 for a marine education program that allows students with limited means to learn about Narragansett Bay .
“ Reed ’s job is to advocate for the state , and that ’s what he ’s doing , ” said Reed spokesman Chip Unruh .
These efforts to bring home the bacon contrast with the election - year pledge Democrats made to reduce earmarks , which numbered more than 13,000 and cost $ 19 billion in fiscal year 2005 .
“ They say , ‘ We ’re not doing earmarks anymore , ’ but in fact , they really are , by intimidating agencies and departments that are dependent on Congress for their appropriations , ” said Ronald D. Utt , a senior research fellow for the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank .
Byrd spokesman Tom Gavin said the senator was “ simply trying to alert the agencies to specific needs in West Virginia . ”

Matt McKenna , a Tester spokesman , said his boss believed the projects he supported were worthwhile .
“ He wants the process to be conducted with transparency , ” McKenna said .
“ The earmarks he does n’t support are the ones slipped in in the dark of night , with no opportunity for public scrutiny . ”
When Democrats won control of Congress last fall , they were left with nine unfinished appropriations bills from the former Republican majority .
They decided to pass a single measure with no earmarks to fund most of the government through September , the end of the 2007 fiscal year .
It made for smart politics .
Earmarks , often inserted in bills anonymously and at the behest of lobbyists , had come under heightened scrutiny after scandals involving now - incarcerated former Rep. Randy “ Duke ” Cunningham ( R - Rancho Santa Fe ) and disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff , who referred to the House Appropriations Committee as “ the favor factory . ”
The explosion of earmarks under Republican control , such as Alaska ’s $ 223 - million “ bridge to nowhere ” connecting Ketchikan to an island with an airport and about 50 inhabitants , also generated public outrage .
Advertisement
The day Bush signed the Democratic spending bill , the White House budget director issued a memo to federal departments saying : “ Funding decisions should be based on the merits . ”
But critics say that it is difficult for agencies to say no to lawmakers who write their budgets .
“ These agencies know who butters their bread , ” Flake said .
“ They ’ll be under a lot of pressure to accede to the requests . ”
Although sponsors of earmarks will be identified in the current round of spending bills , the behind - the - scenes lobbying this year on the “ earmark - free ” bill made that process less transparent .
Advertisement
“ In the past , there was at least a faint public paper trail in the report accompanying the legislation , ” said Ellis of Taxpayers for Common Sense .
“ Even that small shred of disclosure was greater than the letters and phone calls we are not seeing now .
As a result , taxpayers may never know where and how much of their money was wasted this year . ”
California lawmakers were among those petitioning for funds .
Rep. John Campbell ( R - Irvine ) , whose district would have received $ 1 million for a water project from the discarded House appropriations bill , appealed to the Interior Department : “ I would ask that you call me personally if for any reason you are hesitant to provide funding for this project . ”
Campbell said he did n’t consider his action an effort to salvage an earmark .
“ It ’s not an earmark because these guys can just say no , ” he said .
Rep. John T. Doolittle ( R - Roseville ) , noting that $ 1 million had been included in the GOP - drafted bill for a water project in his district , told the Interior Department that “ appropriate deference should be given to the clear intent of Congress . ”
Advertisement
Lawmakers ’ appeals often went nowhere .
The EPA ’s chief financial officer , Lyons Gray , responded to Byrd ’s request for money for two West Virginia projects by noting that the White House had instructed no earmarks should be funded in the agency ’s budget .
“ EPA is committed to being a good steward of our environment and a good steward of our tax dollars , ” he said .

NRI doc donates $ 20 mn to Kerala village
August 01 , 2007 10:23 IST
An Indian - American neurosurgeon , who was born into an " untouchable " caste in a Kerala [ Images ] village of Chemmanakary , made millions in the US and has now donated some $ 20 million to establish a neurosurgery hospital , a health clinic and a spa resort in his village .
Kumar Bahuelyan , 81 , did not wear his pair of shoes until he went to medical school but earned so much that his lavish life - style included five Mercedes Benzes and one aeroplane .
" I was born with nothing , I was educated by people of that village and this is what I owe to them , " he told the Buffalo News .
Life for him has come full circle , the paper said - from dire poverty in India to the life style of rich in America and back to his native village where he has traded his Mercedes for a bicycle .
" I'm in a state of nirvana , eternal nirvana , " he told the paper .
I have nothing else to achieve in life .
This was my goal , to help my people .
I can die any time , as a happy man . "
Another Indian native , Pearay Ogra , the former chief of infectious diseases at Women and Children 's Hospital and the president of the Bahuleyan Charitable Foundation , said he understands why Bahuleyan donated his fortune .
" He grew up in a traditional Hindu culture , with a deep sense of universal giving , " Ogra told the paper .
" You can afford it , give it back to the people who brought you up . "
Others too are moved by Bahuleyan 's spirit and energy , the paper said , adding Bill Zimmermann , executive director of a Buffalo sailing school is helping Bahuleyan set up a sailing and boat - building school in Chemmanakary .
The venture is designed to teach sailing and boat - building skills to the Indian villagers , provide more jobs and use its profits to help fund medical treatment for the villagers .
Once Bahuleyan got hooked on the concept , he started spending 50 hours a week at Zimmerman 's Seven Seas Sailing School , located on the Buffalo ship canal , trying to learn about his latest venture .
" He 's not mesmerising or evangelical , but he seems like a living saint , " Zimmermann said .
" He does nothing but imbue a sense of calm and decency .
He brings out the best in you . "
Bahuleyan , who lives in Buffalo with his wife , pathologist Indira Kartha , now spends half the year in the US , the other half in India .
In his native land , he oversees his foundation 's work , gets around on a bicycle and still does almost daily surgery .
" My dream is to see this all running without my help , so I can pass away peacefully , knowing that I created something and gave something back , " he said .
" That would justify my existence . "
Struggling for Relevance in Cuba : Close , Still No Cigars
by Ron Paul by Ron Paul
DIGG THIS
Since Raul Castro seems to be transitioning to a more permanent position of power , the administration has begun talking about Cuba policy again .
One would think we would be able to survey the results of the last 45 years and come to logical conclusions .
Changing course never seems to be an option , however , no matter how futile or counterproductive our past actions have been .
The Cuban embargo began officially in 1962 as a means to put pressure on the communist dictatorship to change its ways .
After 45 years , the Cuban economy has struggled , but Cuba ‘s dictatorship is no closer to stepping to the beat of our drum .
Any ailments have consistently and successfully been blamed on US Capitalism instead of Cuban Communism .
They have substituted trade with others for trade with the US , and are " awash " with development funds from abroad .
Our isolationist policies with regards to Cuba , meanwhile , have hardly won the hearts and minds of Cubans or Cuban - Americans , many of whom are isolated from families because of this political animosity .
In the name of helping Cubans , the US administration is calling for " multibillions " of taxpayer dollars in foreign aid and subsidies for internet access , education and business development for Cubans under the condition that the Cuban government demonstrates certain changes .
In the same breath , they claim lifting the embargo would only help the dictatorship .
This is exactly backwards .
Free trade is the best thing for people in both Cuba and the US .
Government subsidies would enrich those in power in Cuba at the expense of already overtaxed Americans !
The irony of supposed Capitalist , free - marketeers inducing Communists to freedom with government hand - outs should not be missed .
We call for a free and private press in Cuba while our attempts to propagandize Cubans through the US government - run Radio / TV Marti has wasted $ 600 million in American taxpayer dollars .
It ’s time to stop talking solely in terms of what ’s best for the Cuban people .
How about the wishes of the American people , who are consistently in favor of diplomacy with Cuba ?
Let ’s stop the hysterics about the freedom of Cubans — which is not our government ’s responsibility — and consider freedom of the American people , which is .
Americans want the freedom to travel and trade with their Cuban neighbors , as they are free to travel and trade with Vietnam and China .
Those Americans who do not wish to interact with a country whose model of governance they oppose are free to boycott .
The point being — it is Americans who live in a free country , and as free people we should choose who to buy from or where to travel , not our government .
Our current administration is perceived as irrelevant , at best , in Cuba and the message is falling on deaf ears there .
If the administration really wanted to extend the hand of friendship , they would allow the American people the freedom to act as their own ambassadors through trade and travel .
Considering the lack of success government has had in engendering friendship with Cuba , it is time for government to get out of the way and let the people reach out .

Charles Simonyi will complete 200 orbits of the Earth
Soyuz launch
Billionaire Charles Simonyi , 58 , who led development of Microsoft 's Word , lifted off from the Baikonur space station in Kazakhstan at 1731 GMT .
He is the 450th person to enter orbit and the $ 25 m ride makes him , by his own admission , " the first nerd in space " .
American businesswoman and lifestyle guru Martha Stewart was there to wave her friend off on the 12 - day trip .
She selected a gourmet meal of roast quail and duck breast , which Mr Simonyi and his Russian colleagues will enjoy once they reach the International Space Station ( ISS ) .
Vital control
The Soyuz TMA - 10 took off on schedule and entered orbit a few minutes later .
Inside the spacecraft , Mr Simonyi and two Russian crew members smiled into an onboard camera ; he then gave the thumbs - up sign .
Martha Stewart said goodbye separated by a glass wall
Dr Simonyi and the two cosmonauts - Fyodor Yurchikin and Oleg Kotov - will spend two days reaching the ISS .
Once there , he will spend 10 days onboard , completing 200 orbits of the Earth , covering 8 million km ( 5 million miles ) .
The return journey , accompanied by the 14th ISS crew already onboard , will take just two hours and will land on Earth on 20 April .
Dr Simonyi began training for the flight six months ago at the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Centre in Star City , Russia and at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan .
He underwent a gruelling physical programme , including strict medical tests , to prepare him for the ride to escape the Earth 's atmosphere and his time on board the ISS .
Space traditions
Once on the space station , Dr Simonyi will carry out a series of experiments including measuring the amount of radiation that he is exposed to while on board the ISS .
The aim is to help to generate an accurate map of the radiation environment on the space station .
He will also take part in a series of ceremonies and rituals , including a viewing of Russian film White Sun of the Desert , a tradition for cosmonauts spanning many years .
Dr Simonyi's once - in - a - lifetime trip was arranged by US - based Space Adventures .
The company has previously sent four private explorers to space .
In 2001 , American Dennis Tito became the first space tourist .
He was followed by South African Mark Shuttleworth the year after , and American Greg Olsen in 2005 .
Iranian - born US businesswoman Anousheh Ansari became the first ever female space tourist in September 2006 .
She was a last - minute replacement for Japanese businessman Daisuke Enomoto who failed his medical tests .
Imagine if someone , somewhere managed to find the exact formula for producing the most perfectly awful example of the uncanny valley ( say , for a horror movie or something ) .
Now , accept the fact that this organization is the Japanese Science and Technology Agency , and that they managed to produce the most disturbing machine you 've ever seen , without even realizing it .
The 33 kilogram CB2 is literally beyond words in its freakiness , not only in its nailing of the uncanny valley , but in its description .
Apparently it emulates " the physical ability of a 1 - or 2 - year - old toddler , can turn over and stand up with assistance , " has 51 compressed air - powered actuators , and has 200 tactile sensors in its " skin . "
It sends so many shivers up our spine to think of the CB2's lifeless putty coating as " skin " that it 's a wonder we 're even able to continue typing .
Seriously , just so that we can stop and move onto something else a little more human ( heck , even a motherboard feels homely next to this ) , go check out the video after the break of the horrifying little thing writhing about on the floor . [ Via Tokyo Times ; thanks Dave ]

ISRAEL has finally conceded that air power alone will not defeat Hezbollah .
Over the coming weeks , it will learn that ground power wo n’t work either .
The problem is not that the Israelis have insufficient military might , but that they misunderstand the nature of the enemy .
Contrary to the conventional wisdom , Hezbollah is principally neither a political party nor an Islamist militia .
It is a broad movement that evolved in reaction to Israel ’s invasion of Lebanon in June 1982 .
At first it consisted of a small number of Shiites supported by Iran .
But as more and more Lebanese came to resent Israel ’s occupation , Hezbollah — never tight - knit — expanded into an umbrella organization that tacitly coordinated the resistance operations of a loose collection of groups with a variety of religious and secular aims .
In terms of structure and hierarchy , it is less comparable to , say , a religious cult like the Taliban than to the multidimensional American civil - rights movement of the 1960’s .
What made its rise so rapid , and will make it impossible to defeat militarily , was not its international support but the fact that it evolved from a reorientation of pre-existing Lebanese social groups .
Evidence of the broad nature of Hezbollah ’s resistance to Israeli occupation can be seen in the identity of its suicide attackers .
Hezbollah conducted a broad campaign of suicide bombings against American , French and Israeli targets from 1982 to 1986 .
Altogether , these attacks — which included the infamous bombing of the Marine barracks in 1983 — involved 41 suicide terrorists .

Being a consumer these days sucks .
My travel around the mountain west means that I 'm pretty much stuck with Verizon for good cell coverage wherever I travel .
My profession pretty much ensures that my calls have been " captured " for the NSA .
" Affordable " options for cable and high - speed Internet ( also a requirement for this job ) in my area are severely limited .
So I 'm stuck with Comcast , which might have been restricting my Internet activity for who knows how long .
Comcast , the AP determined , actively manages data on its network by using software to essentially masquerade as its subscribers ' machines .
When non-Comcast Internet subscribers request files from your Comcast - connected machine -- as happens in peer - to - peer file - sharing applications -- Comcast 's technology steps in and tells the non-Comcast subscriber you 're not available .
This is a difficult story to explain , but it 's quite important .
For years , consumer advocates have been demanding that Congress and / or the Federal Communications Commission impose " network neutrality " regulations that would force broadband providers ( like Comcast ) to treat all data on a network equally .
Lawmakers have so far failed to do so .
Broadband providers , meanwhile , insist that they do treat all traffic equally , but they reserve the right to use certain technologies to " manage " data on their network .
The Comcast plan suggests that broadband providers mean something very broad by " traffic management " -- including , it appears , purposefully stepping into your network sessions to shut them down .
Excellent .
Some of the traffic targeted could be illegal file - sharing , but it's also things like highly legal voice over Internet phone service , like Skype , or TV like Joost , or basically any BitTorrent download .
Want to get that movie from Netflix to watch on your laptop on your next flight ?
Only if Comcast decides to let you do it .
Case in point :
To test how Comcast is managing traffic , AP reporters tried to download a version of the King James Bible using BitTorrent .
The Bible , of course , is perfectly legal to trade ; indeed , some people might say that putting the good book up for others to download is a blessed thing .
But when AP reporters tried to download the Bible from Comcast subscribers in Philadelphia and San Francisco , they found that the connections were either blocked outright or delayed .
( Downloads from other providers worked fine . )
Oh , and btw , Comcast is n't telling you , or the non-Comcast ISPs trying to communicate with it , or anybody else that they 're doing this : " We rarely disclose our vendors or our processes for operating our network for competitive reasons and to protect against network abuse . "
As the post author -- Salon 's Farhad Manjoo - - points out , it 's probably not just Comcast that 's doing this , so while canceling your Comcast subscription might be satisfying , your replacement ISP might be doing the same thing .
Manjoo is also completely correct in pointing out that what we need is a law .
You guessed it , Net Neutrality .

Pupils who have been excluded will have to be supervised by parents
Regulations coming into force in England this week require parents to keep pupils under supervision for the first five days of an exclusion .
Following this " home detention " , local authorities will have to provide pupils with lessons from the sixth day of an exclusion from their own school .
Last year , there were an average of 1,700 pupils excluded each school day .
Schools Secretary Ed Balls says that " schools can only do so much in isolation .
Parents have to be responsible for instilling right and wrong too " .
HAVE YOUR SAY
Todays parents do n't care what their little darlings get up to in school , as far as they are concerned they are little angels

" It is important that parents take a central role when a child is excluded , making sure they are at home working , rather than treating the exclusion as a holiday or an excuse to wander the streets . "
Fines for parents
Parents will face fines of £ 50 if they do not supervise children who have been excluded .
There is to be a new offence of failing to ensure a child is not found in a public place without reasonable justification .
And there will be a requirement for local authorities to step in with an educational provision for excluded pupils after the week with parents .
At present , this requirement is not until the sixteenth day of an exclusion .
TOUGHER RULES
Children to be supervised by parents during exclusion Parents face fines if children are not supervised Local authorities responsible for education provision after five days Interview with school , child and parents at end of exclusion period
Most exclusions are only for a few days - on average 3.5 days - but there were more than 13,000 exclusions last year for a fortnight or longer .
When exclusions are completed , there will be a compulsory " reintegration " interview between the school , the child and parents before returning to mainstream lessons .
This autumn will also see the introduction of lessons in secondary schools teaching respect and " emotional intelligence " , designed to reduce violence and bad behaviour .
This Social and Emotional Aspects of Learning ( Seal ) programme is already extensively used in primary schools - and in July the government announced a £ 13.7 m plan to introduce these lessons into secondary schools .
Research published by the Institute of Education claims that schools where the Seal programme has been piloted have become " calmer places with more positive atmospheres " .
" The children appreciated each other more and were more thoughtful towards each other , " said the institute 's Professor Susan Hallam .
Disruptive youngsters who have been excluded from mainstream classes can be sent to pupil referral units - with more than 15,000 pupils being taught in 450 such units last year .
' Tough love regime '
In July , the Conservatives ' leader , David Cameron , called for an overhaul of the pupil referral unit system for excluded pupils - saying that such units were expensive and ineffective .
Commenting on the new regulations , shadow children 's secretary Michael Gove said : " Let 's not kid ourselves that these measures , welcome as they are , do anything like enough to solve the behaviour problem in our schools .
" You can't have a proper discipline policy unless heads are free to exclude disruptive pupils without being second - guessed .
" And children who 've been excluded should n't be left to sink or swim .
They need a tough love regime to turn round their behaviour and get their lives back on track . "
BAGHDAD ( Reuters ) - Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki questioned on Wednesday whether U.S. private security firm Blackwater had any future role in Iraq because of the high number of shooting incidents in which it had been involved .
Maliki appeared to toughen his stand again against Blackwater over a September 16 shooting in Baghdad in which 11 Iraqis died , an incident that sparked outrage among Iraqis who see the firm as a private army which acts with impunity .
In Washington , a House of Representatives committee heard in testy hearings on Tuesday that Blackwater guards had been involved in 195 shooting incidents in Iraq from the start of 2005 until September 12 this year , an average of 1.4 a week .
In those shootings there were 16 Iraqi casualties and 162 cases of property damage .
Blackwater fired first in 84 percent of the incidents , said a report given to the House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Government Reform .
“ I believe the big numbers of accusations directed against ( Blackwater ) do not make it valid to stay in Iraq , ” Maliki told a news conference in Baghdad .
Blackwater , which has received U.S. government contracts worth more than a billion dollars , is one of the biggest security contractors in Iraq .
It employs about 1,000 people in Iraq , where it guards the U.S. embassy and its staff .
The North Carolina - based company has said its guards reacted lawfully to an attack on a convoy they were protecting during the September 16 incident in western Baghdad .
Maliki ’s government was harshly critical of Blackwater immediately after the incident , which it called a crime , and vowed to freeze its work and prosecute those involved .
But Maliki ’s government later appeared to soften its stand , saying no action would be taken against it until after a joint investigation of the incident with U.S. officials .
Its comments came after U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice promised a full review of how U.S. security details are conducted in Iraq .
At least four separate investigations into the incident are under way .
Estimates of the number of private security contractors working in Iraq vary between 25,000 and 48,000 .
They are immune from prosecution under an order drafted after the 2003 U.S. - led invasion to topple Saddam Hussein .
TiVo has announced a new service for advertisers and those interested in tracking commercial viewership , the Top Commercial Rankings reports , which is based on info gleaned using TiVo 's StopWatch feature that tracks viewer behavior second - by - second .
The feature has TiVo compiling reports for April and May on metrics like the top commercials watched overall ( Disturbia and Ford trucks ) , or the least fast - forwarded campaigns ( FedEx and Samsung Jitterbug ) .
The report includes interesting insight into how viewers watch television , even timeshifted programs , and should provide advertisers more information about how to maximize their impact .
Now to get this report to studio execs to keep them from blaming DVRs for the downfall of their industry .
Numbers for November and December suggest real OPEC production cuts in Algeria , Libya , Qatar and UAE .
The total cut could be 230 kb/ d which knocks around 50 kb / d off annual average production .
I did not expect to find evidence for cuts , but that 's how the data looks to me - four small cuts made at the same time by countries that otherwise increased their production last year through announced projects .
Thus , I believe those four OPEC members , but only those four , have the ability to restore that production .
Without those cuts , crude and condensate production would still be clearly down , but total liquids would have shown a somewhat more significant increase .

To establish the potential for 2007 , for each country identified by the EIA , I have estimated the balance between depletion of fields in production and new project capacity expected this year .
Not yet having mastered Hubbert Linearization , I have used simpler mathematical techniques : addition and subtraction .
To estimate underlying decline , I have considered the net change between 2005 and 2006 , and also the production trend in 2006 .
Countries on a rising trend in the last twelve months start the year above their average last year .
They stand a better chance of achieving the same average even without new projects this year ( the rising trend is often due to fields developed recently that may still be expanding production ) .
Conversely , countries on a declining trend start the year handicapped below their average for 2006 .
New projects would need to come on stream early for them to achieve or improve on their 2006 average .
Expected project capacity is based on Chris Skrebowski's Megaprojects report " New capacity fails to boost 2006 production - delays or depletion ? " , Petroleum Review , February 2007 ( should be available at ODAC soon ) .
Summary 15 countries contribute to a gross decline of 1.1 Mb/d. 15 identified countries plus ' Others ' and ' NGLs ' contribute to a gross increase of 1.7 Mb/d .
The net result is a possible increase in capacity of nearly 600 kb/d .
Do n't get excited about the final figure suggesting an increase this year .
This represents what we might call ' increased capacity ' , but that level of production could only be achieved in an almost ideal world .
There is very little upside here , but many risks .
If peace breaks out in Nigeria or Iraq , production could improve significantly .
Neither appears very likely .
Brazil , Angola and Canada have the potential to exceed the estimates listed here .
But potential downsides are everywhere .
Disruption in Iran or perhaps just the impact of sanctions , hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico or other producing regions , accelerating declines in Saudi Arabia and Mexico - any one of these could wipe out most of this net production gain .
Production could easily fall short of the significant gains estimated for the aforementioned Brazil , Angola and Canada .
New capacity , while substantial , may not be enough to offset increasing declines and real world performance .

Some comments on key countries :
Russia
Russia provided the largest single production increment in 2006 of 200 kb/d.
Production in December was close to the maximum for the year so they begin 2007 in a strong position to maintain their average , but posting another similar gain seems less likely .
Clearly one to watch .
Brazil
With 610 kb/d of new projects on the books , Brazil looks set to post by far the most significant gain for the year .
Many of the projects are expected in the first half and at least one has already started .
300 kb/d as estimated here would be a huge annual increase but they could even exceed that .
They also start the year above their average for last year .
Without Brazil , peak oil would already be moving clearly into sight in the rear view mirror .
Angola
With another two megaprojects expected , one in each half of the year , Angola looks set to repeat last year 's strong performance and should post the second largest gain in 2007 .
Again , we will need it .
Natural Gas Liquids
Strong growth looks set to continue in this category as well .
Saudi Arabia
The decline of 400 kb/d compared to 2005 had nothing to do with quota cuts and was not anticipated by any energy agency .
Stuart 's post shows that the massive Haradh III project presented itself as a little bump on the ski slope .
The Khursaniyah / Abu Hadriya / Fadhili developnent is larger again but not expected until the end of the year and will therefore not impact the figures much .
Until then , we should get a long clear look at decline .
Surely , sometime this year , the world will make a strong call on Saudi ' spare capacity ' , which could finally put that notion to bed .
Or perhaps we will be proven wrong ?
In their defense , Saudi Aramco have delivered and continue to work on the world 's largest oil and gas projects .
They have an enviable project delivery reputation within the industry .
The economists , however , will show little gratitude .
Expect to hear the phrase ' lack of investment ' soon .
Mexico
Decline here is estimated at 300 kb/d .
It could be worse .
Project Notes : Figures in brackets are maximum capacity and not necessarily what could be achieved this year .
Saudi Arabia Khursaniyah : Not expected until end of 2007 .
Reading between the lines suggests even that may be a challenge .
( 500 kb/ d plus 250 kb / d NGLs ) .
Venezuela Corocoro : Expected mid-2007 .
Angola Greater Plutonio : Expected first half of 2007 ( 240kb/d ) Rosa : Expected second half of 2007 ( 250 kb/d ) Brazil Espadarte : Started production in January ( 100 kb/ d ) .
Golfinho : Production to expand 100 kb/d in June with arrival of additional FPSO .
Polvo : FPSO expected to arrive in February .
China Bohai Bay : Production expected at low levels in 2007 .
Malaysia Kikeh : Production started in January .
United States Atlantis : Expected end of 2007 ( 150 kb/d ) .
NGL Projects
Are counted under corresponding EIA column and not allocated explicitly to country columns , which are crude and condensate projections only .
Two main projects in 2007 are Saudi Aramco and QatarGas .
Updates on particular projects or the potential in specific countries are of course welcome .
The net positive result achieved in this analysis is not all that surprising .
The Megaprojects report identifies 3.2 Mb/d of capacity arriving in 2006 , while EIA data show the net result was a slight loss ( for crude and condensate and NGLs ) .
After allowing for project delays and production below capacity , an approximate guess would suggest that net new production for the year was around two million barrels per day .
Production declines absorbed all of that .
For 2007 , new project capacity rises to a massive 4.6 Mb/d , more than 40 % higher again than last year ( some of that is from last year 's projects that are still expanding ) .
Even allowing that several of the largest projects only arrive late in the year , it is possible that net new production will increase , even above last year 's historically high levels .
For 2007 production to fall relative to 2006 , depletion must also increase substantially .
Plenty of evidence supporting that notion has been presented on TOD .
This analysis is somewhat conservative in that regard .
If Saudi Arabia continues declining at 8 % as in Stuart 's analysis , then they will lose 700 kb/d .
The extra 300 kb/d compared to my estimate would wipe out half of my net ' possible ' gain .
A similar case for Mexico could wipe out the rest , and that 's before allowing for major disruptions anywhere else .
Khebab 's analysis of countries already suffering Type III depletion is another , more refined way of illustrating the challenge outlined above .
It will be interesting to see an update of that with 2006 data .
But I also know Khebab has lots of other requests and no doubt ideas of his own to work on :-) .
Let me finish with a chart of EIA Total Liquids for the last three years .
The obvious feature is the 1.5 Mb/d jump from June to July last year .
This set some alarm bells ringing but reviewing the data , it is hard to fault .
The month - to - month increase was provided by UK and Norway ( 270 ) , Angola ( 180 ) , Australia ( 120 ) , Brazil ( 100 ) , Canada ( 170 ) , NGLs ( 300 ) , OPEC ( 200 ) and ' Other Liquids ' ( 190 ) .
It seems remarkable that all these increases should arrive at once , although it did occur as prices were approaching their record highs .
The jump in production helps to explain why prices steadily retreated afterwards - a world that had learned to live with 84 million barrels per day suddenly had another 1.5 to play with .
So , despite the large jump , average changes for the year for all these countries look reasonable in the context of delivered projects , so I do n't believe it is an attempt to delay peak oil by massaging the figures .
We started 2007 with production just slightly higher than the average for 2006 .
A few steps upwards early this year would put us within striking distance of matching the average again .
But , will those steps materialize or will the line continue the downward trend ?
cheers !

Apple said today that a firmware update to the iPhone due to be released later this week " will likely result " in SIM - unlocked iPhones turning into very expensive bricks .
" Apple has discovered that many of the unauthorized iPhone unlocking programs available on the Internet cause irreparable damage to the iPhone 's software , which will likely result in the modified iPhone becoming permanently inoperable when a future Apple - supplied iPhone software update is installed , " said Apple in a statement issued this afternoon .
Apple CEO
Steve Jobs last week reiterated the company 's stance on unlocked iPhones : Apple will work against them .
" It 's a constant cat and mouse game , " Jobs said .
At that time , we also said that we had reason to believe that the next update to the iPhone would brick iPhones that had been unlocked to use SIM cards from other GSM carriers , which Apple 's press release has confirmed .
Sources familiar with the matter have told Ars that the company did not decide to cause such irreparable damage to the iPhone intentionally , however , and Apple 's statement appears to confirm this as well .
Apple says that it " strongly discourages " users from installing these unlocking programs , and that doing so violates users '
iPhone software license agreements as well as voids their warranties .
This is corroborated by individual user accounts of being turned away at Apple Stores after having various hacks installed on their iPhones .
" The permanent inability to use an iPhone due to installing unlocking software is not covered under the iPhone 's warranty , " warns Apple .
So what are users of SIM - unlocked iPhones to do ?
Not run the latest software update , that 's for sure .
Users can instead pray to the hacking deities — the famed iPhone Dev Team that released the free software unlock , and iPhoneSIMfree , which released a commercial software unlock — to write applications that will undo the unlocks , as it were , if those users want to run the latest iPhone software .
And then the teams get to start anew with their hacking efforts on the new firmware .
What was that about a cat - and - mouse game again ?
At CitiGroup 's Technology Summit in New York this week , Google 's Business Product Manager for Ads Quality Nicholas
Fox said the company will be moving ahead with integration of video and image ads within sponsored search results .
Does that mean you will soon be seeing TV commercials at the top of Google search results page ?
Maybe .
" It 's a topic that 's come up in a lot of internal discussions , " said Fox during a Q&A session about Google 's search usage and trends .
We want to do the best job of conveying information to the user .
In many cases that 's a text ad .
In some cases it may not be a text ad .
It may be an image , it may be a video , it may be something else .
The risk , though , is that we do n't want to show things that are garish or flashy , or other things that might cause users to become blind to the ads .
Fox elaborated by giving what he claimed was one of the best use case examples :
You could think of a local butcher .
Maybe a 10 - word text ad explaining that local butcher 's business probably is not going to be enticing and get the user to click on the ad .
But if you could have a video of the butcher explaining his business and showing all this fresh meat ... then maybe the user would get much more value out of that .
And the advertiser would also get more value as well .
Fresh meat , huh ?
Google , of course , has already made steps in this direction with universal search , blending listings from its images , news and video search engines among those it gathers from crawling web pages .
In the case of universal search , however , the images and video it supplies are search results , not ads .
The trick for the company , as Fox notes , will be finding a way to capitalize on the information element of such ads ... like those glistening tenderloin cuts ... without alienating users .
" I think you might see things along those lines , " Fox continued .
" My expectation is that we 'll do some more thinking around this area and potentially some experiments .
Expect a scenario where we 'll move extremely cautiously , though . "

This is the beginning of a new day .
God has given me this day to use as I will .
I can waste it or use it for good .
What I do today is important , because
I am exchanging a day of my life for it .
When tomorrow comes ,
this day will be gone forever ,
leaving in its place something
that I have traded for it .
I want it to be gain , not loss ;
good not evil ; success not failure ;
in order that I shall not regret
the price I paid for it .

Kary Mullis goes surfing after learning that he has won the Nobel Prize .
THE QUIRKY GENIUS WHO IS CHANGING OUR LIVES
by Jim Dwyer
Kary Mullis is not likely to fit most people 's profile of a serious scientist .
He is a man who quit the lab to work in a restaurant a man who had a midnight brawl on a beach with a fellow researcher , a man who elicits both giggles and awe from other scientists .
Yet Mullis , a slightly built man with thinning blond hair , is responsible for what many consider the most important advance in genetic research since the discovery of DNA 's double helix four decades ago .
Many expect him to be named when the Nobel Prizes are announced this week ( or at least in the next few years ) , because his invention - the polymerase chain reaction , or PCR has revolutionized microbiology , medical diagnostics , criminal investigation , even evolution ( see box ) .
His invention , in fact , made the idea behind Jurassic Park that people can manipulate tiny fragments of ancient DNA to create full - grown dinosaurs at least scientifically plausible .
The procedure devised by Mullis makes it possible to reproduce a single gene or DNA fragment a billion times in a few hours .
It has become a standard tool in most important biological laboratories in the world .
" What he has going for him to get the Nobel is that PCR is a revolutionary technique with vast impact on medicine and basic science , " says Thomas White , head of research and development at Roche Molecular Systems , which paid $ 300 million , a record in the health - care field - - for the PCR patent and associated technology .
White pauses a beat .
" What he has going against him is his outlandishness . "
I was curious to learn more about this man who some think is too weird to win a Nobel .
" The later at night , the better , " Mullis said , agreeing to see me .
" I 'm a night person .
I talk better then . "
His home , a ranch named The Institute for Further Study ( after the words that follow most scientific papers : " This calls for further study " ) , is in the Anderson Valley , twisting from the Napa Valley to the Pacific Ocean near Mendocino .
It is four miles up a dirt road , and no lights shine in his windows on this moonless night .
" Ssshh , " someone whispers .
" We 're being watched . "
Pause .
" The satellites , " says the voice .
" They 're watching us , so we have all the lights out .
That way , we can see them before they see us . "
The voice is that of Mullis , and he is with four others in a hot tub , watching the skittering light of satellites across the sky .
Sipping red wine from a nearby vineyard , served in mugs , Mullis and guests discuss the nature of space junk , how a green tinge in a light passing overhead probably means there 's a lot of copper wire on board that manmade asteroid , and when exactly science replaced religion in some people 's lives .
Later , he talks about his discovery .
" PCR was my road into the world , " he says in the soft accent of his Columbia , SC , childhood , fidgeting like a bashful country boy .
" It 's as if your fairy godmother said , " Hey , this invention will make your life a lot easier . "
People started recognizing I was a bright guy . "
At the time , Mullis was working as a chemist for one of the first big biotech firms , the Cetus Corporation in Emeryville , Calif .
( the company was bought out in 1991 ) , synthesizing chemicals that were used by other scientists in genetic cloning .
The work bored him .
In fact he spent most of his time sunning himself on the roof or puttering in the lab , even writing computer programs to automatically answer his colleagues ' requests .
" I was playing , " he says .
" I think really good science does n't come from hard work .
The striking advances come from people on the fringes , being playful . "
Mullis was being playful on an April evening in 1983 as he drove up to his ranch .
" My hands were occupied , but my mind was free , " he says .
He remembers the fragrance of the flowering roadside buckeye that washed in the car windows as its white stalks bobbed in the headlights .
How , he was pondering , could you find a single spot on the long , fragile DNA molecule ?
In a series of acrobatic chemical leaps , he realized that a section of DNA containing a gene or fragment could be marked off , then forced into copying itself using replicating techniques similar to those DNA employs when a cell divides .
Then he realized something so startling , he had to pull the car to the side of the road .
When he had been messing with computer programs , he had been impressed by the power of a reiterative computer loop , in which the same process is repeated over and over .
He saw how fast numbers can climb when they increase exponentially .
Replicating DNA could work about the same way :
By adding the right chemicals , the little section of DNA could keep reproducing itself automatically and exponentially -- so that the fragment would double , from two pieces , to four , to eight ... and ever onward .
In practical terms , he saw that , after eight doublings , he would have 256 copies of the gene .
By the 20th cycle , he'd have 1,048,576 .
By the 30th , he'd be up to 1,073,741,824 -- a billion copies of a single gene in three hours .
Bottomless vats of DNA , and easy to find .
Ten years later , scientific papers using PCR or a variation of it are being published at the rate of 500 a month .
Mullis speaks with some bitterness about the years that followed his discovery .
He was turned down flat by prestigious journals when he tried to publish his findings .
He remembers the reception to his idea by colleagues at Cetus as ice cold .
Then , he maintains , as PCR was taking off , they sought to attach themselves to its development .
" PCR was rapidly developed by all kinds of people , " he says .
" The people at Cetus were the lucky ones who got first crack .
Instead of appreciating that , and appreciating me , they overstated the role they played . "
Mullis crafts his lab assistant , Fred Faloona , as being his primary collaborator .
Others who were at Cetus maintain that PCR would not have developed as quickly from off - the - wall brainstorm to off - the - shelf technology without the backing of other scientists .
Just as Mullis is acknowledged to be PCR 's intellectual author , they feel entitled to credit for serving as midwives .
Mullis left Cetus with a $ 10,000 bonus for his invention .
Financially , there 's also the $ 400,000 he received for winning this year 's Japan Prize , one of international science 's highest honors .
But PCR has not made him wealthy .
The main patent for the process is in his name but was owned by Cetus , as his employer , which sold it to Roche .
Mullis now works as a consultant and writer .
He spends time at his ranch and an apartment in La Jolla , where he rollerblades at sunset and surfs at dawn .
He is playing with some new ideas .
The most exciting is called " atomic tags , " a proposed test of multiple blood factors for serum , viruses , enzymes , cell counts -- done with a small blood sample and kept in a database that would provide quick diagnosis and treatment .
More offbeat is " star genes , " in which bits of celebrity DNA would be embedded in trading cards and jewelry , then sold .
" Suppose you had some gene that had to do with Mick Jagger 's lip , " Mullis suggests .
But most of his ideas are still on the drawing board .
" There 's two kinds of stuff in science , " he says , " the thinking and the doing .
I 'm not good at accomplishing things . "
Mullis has been having fun with science since he was a boy .
At 17 , using a rocket fuel he made out of potassium and sugar , he sent a frog into the sky and brought it down safely with a parachute .
He studied biochemistry at graduate school at the University of California at Berkeley and later moved to Kansas .
After his second marriage failed ( he has been married and divorced three times and is the father , he says , " of three children that I know about and a bunch more from the artificial insemination program in Kansas City " ) , he moved back to Berkeley , where -- disheartened with a lot of things , including science - - he took a job in a restaurant .
One day , he says , his graduate school adviser came to see him .
" He said , " Mullis , we put a lot of effort into you . "
After a while , his argument convinced me it was harder working in a restaurant than in a lab . "
That brought him to Cetus and put him on the road to his thrilling discovery .
" People ask me what 's the future of PCR , " Mullis says .
" I tell them , ' What 's the future of the screwdriver ? '
As long as people use screws in wood , they 'll be using the screwdriver .
PCR is to DNA as the screwdriver is to carpentry . "
UNLOCKING THE PAST , IMPROVING THE FUTURE
With PCR , scientists can roll , back the stone from the tomb of extinction and read genes from creatures that died 120 million years ago .
Even if it does n't mean recreating dinosaurs , this ability is solving old mysteries .
For example , the remains of Russia 's last czar , Nicholas II -- executed in 1918 -- were positively identified this year using a PCR test that matched DNA in the bones with DNA of members of the British royal family , who are distant relatives of the czar .
PCR also has helped free at least a dozen men wrongly convicted of rape .
It can be used to decipher parts of chromosomes at the earliest stages of life .
Will a child have cystic fibrosis ?
Does he or she carry a gene that might be associated with homosexuality ?
And , by the way -- is it he or she ?
Adults can learn if they 're doomed to a fatal disease , such as Huntington 's chorea .
PCR can tell within hours if a person is infected with the HIV virus .
Before , the standard test looked for antibodies produced in response to the virus ; now , doctors can look for HIV directly by searching for genetic codes unique to it .
And there is a new PCR - based test for chlamydia a venereal disease that can cause infertility .
Instead of the uncomfortable old test a urine sample now provides the same information .

Clumps of mutant sperm - making cells help to explain Apert syndrome .
An Apert syndrome mutation is seen in sperm 100 - 1,000 times more frequently than would be expected .
Getty
Researchers have delved into the human testis to help explain why fathers are so likely to pass a disease - causing mutation to their children .
Apert syndrome , which causes an abnormal formation of the skull , fingers and toes , affects roughly 1 in 150,000 live births .
Affected men are unlikely to go on to have children , so the vast majority of cases are n't inherited ; instead , they arise from spontaneous mutations .
It has been a puzzling mystery to scientists why one particular mutation that causes Apert syndrome – a tiny change in the DNA sequence of a gene involved in bone development — is seen in sperm 100 - 1,000 times more frequently than would be expected if it were the result of random mutation .
Geneticists have offered two different explanations for why this unusually common error , called C755G , crops up so often : either the C755G site is unusually prone to errors when DNA is copied ( the ' mutation hotspot ' theory ) ; or this mistake gives cells a growth advantage , so if it happens by chance in a sperm - making cell , the mutant cell out - competes other cells and starts to take over sperm production ( the ' selfish sperm ' model ) .
In 2003 , Andrew Wilkie at the University of Oxford and colleagues tracked how older men were more likely than young ones to pass on the mutation .
This seemed to support the ' selfish sperm ' model , because continually expanding mutant sperm factories within the testes would increase as a man ages1 .
Now , researchers working with Norman Arnheim at the University of Southern California , Los Angeles , say they have definitely crossed the ' hotspot ' theory off the list by using used a novel approach — chopping up human testes into nearly 200 pieces .
Sperm map
Despite sounding crude , not to mention messy , careful analysis of the DNA in these tiny portions of tissue enabled the biologists to construct a three - dimensional map of where in the testes of two men the sperm - making cells with the C755G mutation were situated .
Instead of being scattered throughout the organ , as would be expected if the mutation occurred randomly , the C755G cells were knotted together in clusters , the researchers report in PLoS Biology2 .
Computer modelling confirmed that this would n't happen if the gene site was simply prone to mutation .
" We have rejected the mutation hotspot model , " says Arnheim .
ADVERTISEMENT
Instead it fits nicely with the ' selfish sperm ' theory — if C755G gives a sperm progenitor cell a boost to copy itself , a group of mutants will start to grow and churn out thousands of Apert - causing sperm .
Wilkie says the new study " adds another dimension " to the evidence supporting the idea of ' selfish ' cells expanding in the testis .
He adds that what is happening in the testis seems to have parallels with cancer , where critical mutations cause cells to multiply unchecked .
In fact the C755G mutation has recently been spotted in endometrial tumours in the uterus , though what it is doing there is not yet known .

For glue the sex rubber mat
Would you buy a data switch whose assembly instructions include the phrase " For glue the sex rubber mat " ?
If your answer is " yes " , [ insert joke about Senate Republicans ] .
The datasheet that shipped with a Cisco switch , reported by Jake Vinson at Worse Than Failure , provides yet another example of translation from the Chinese by dictionary look - up .
Some of the items are terms that might be English in some alternative universe , like " commutation machine " in place of " switch " .
Others are amusing mistakes that we 've seen before , like " sex " in place of " type " , which turned " one - time - type item " ( i.e. " disposable item " ) into " a time sex thing " on an aisle sign at the Beijing Century Mart .
Here it 's " for glue the sex rubber mat " , which I surmise might be a rubber - type pad to be attached in one of the machine 's configurations :
( What do you suppose those " cones " are ?
" Modules " , maybe ? )
This next section features another old friend , in the phrase " a fast ether lord fucking net ascending " .
This learned discussion by Professor Victor Mair will give you a clue about how the f - word snuck in there -- and I suspect that the evocative " fast ether lord " is just a prosaic old " fast ethernet controller " :
A larger sample of the datasheet is here :
Can it really be true that this is shipped with a Cisco product ?
It 's understandable to see this kind of thing on a label or menu in a restaurant ; it 's more surprising to see it in the aisles of a hypermarket ; but you 'd think that a big - time multinational technology company would pay a little more attention .
Richard Eng needs to point his Murciélago northwards , right away !
If you happen to have a copy of the Chinese original of this data sheet ( unfortunately Jake Vinson 's post does n't specify the model number ) , please let me know .
[ Update -- a google search for " give cones change the machine " turns up a number of things , including this .
But " glue the sex rubber mat " comes up empty . ]
[ Update # 2 -- Mel Wilson has a better idea about those " give cones " :
It seems as though the product is one of a family of ethernet hubs or switches , with variants having 5 , 8 , 16 or 24 ports ; so 5 / 8 / 16 / 24 give cones change the machine would refer to the switch with the appropriate number of ports .
' Change ' might have meant something like ' version ' , and ' give cones ' somehow comes from ' sockets ' or ' ports ' .
I imagine the product comes with a sheet of pre-punched adhesive rubber feet to stick on the bottom .
Yes , but only for 16 / 24 give cones change the machine ...
Seriously , I 'm sure that Mel is right -- " 16/24 give cones change the machine " must mean " the 16/24 - port version of the machine " .
Florian Weimer adds another piece of evidence :
I think the phrase " 16/24 give cones change the machine " means " 16 or 24 Ethernet ports " .
The smaller models with just 5 or 8 ports have got external power supplies ; only the larger ones need an AC power cable .
Indeed -- add the insight that " change " means " version ( of ) " and the found poetry becomes a sensible and prosaic observation . ]
[ Update # 3 -- Brent Eades tries a clever experiment :
Use Google Translate , translate ' For glue the sex rubber mat ' into Chinese ( Simplified . )
Take the Chinese characters returned , then translate them back into English .
We get : " For adhesion of the rubber pad " As for " give cones change the machine " , repeating the above steps gives us " To change the tube machine " .
This is surprising ; I would have thought Cisco had discovered semiconductors by now .
Finally , " fast ether lord fucking net ascending " gives us " Fast Ethernet main net or hell " .
Also surprising .
And worrisome .
]
[ Update 1/10/2008 - Lewis Jardine writes :
I think you 've misread something : DailyWTF describes it as a ' Crisco switch ' - i.e. a cheap generic one ( Crisco being a brand of cooking oil ) .
The same joke as when Homer goes to buy a ' Panaphonics ' TV .
Maybe so -- in any case it has always bothered me that the scans did not include any brand indication .
But just for the record , Crisco was basically and originally a brand of solid vegetable shortening , a lard substitute made by hydrogenating vegetable oil . ]

CANBERRA ( Reuters ) -
An Australian barmaid has been fined for crushing beer cans between her bare breasts while an off - duty colleague has been fined for hanging spoons from her friend ’s nipples , police said Wednesday .
Police in Western Australia said the 31 - year old barmaid pleaded guilty in the local magistrate ’s court to twice exposing her breasts to patrons at the Premier Hotel in Pinjarra , south of the state capital , Perth .
The woman “ is alleged to have also crushed beer cans between her breasts during one of the offences , ” in breach of hotel licensing laws , police from the Peel district of Western Australia said in a statement .
The barmaid and the hotel manager were both fined A$ 1,000 ( $ 900 ) , while an off - duty barmaid was fined A$ 500 for helping to hang spoons from the woman ’s nipples , police said .
“ It sends a clear message to all licensees in Peel that we will not tolerate this type of behavior in our licensed premises , ” local police superintendent David Parkinson said .
- An advisory measure calling for the immediate withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq will not appear on the February ballot after Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger vetoed it early today .
With the regular legislative session set to conclude Friday but lawmakers looking to wrap up early , hundreds of bills moved furiously between the two houses and the governor 's office in an attempt to meet the deadline .
Among the bills already signed by the governor is legislation from state Sen.
Carole Migden , D - San Francisco , that would end California 's ban on donations of sperm from HIV - positive men in recognition of new technology that can safely cleanse sperm of the virus .
Meanwhile , a bill by Assemblywoman Fiona Ma , D - San Francisco , that authorizes San Francisco to install video cameras on its municipal buses and street sweepers to help catch illegally parked vehicles was sent to the governor 's desk for his signature .
Also pending before the governor :
-- A ban on smoking in cars with kids ; Senate Bill 7 by Sen. Jenny Oropeza , D - Long Beach .
-- A requirement that chain restaurants make nutritional information available for all standard menu items ; SB120 by Sen. Alex Padilla , D - Pacoima ( Los Angeles County ) .
-- A measure creating a pilot program allowing farmers to grow industrial hemp in several California counties ; Assembly Bill 684 by Assemblyman Mark Leno , D - San Francisco .
-- A measure prohibiting hospitals from patient dumping ; SB275 by Sen. Gil Cedillo , D - Los Angeles .
-- A measure that requires all children under the age of 8 years old to be in a backseat of a car , strapped in a car seat ; AB881 by Assemblyman Gene Mullin , D - South San Francisco .
Although the regular legislation session is set to end Friday , lawmakers are not expected to resume formal activity this week because of the Rosh Hashanah holiday .
Lawmakers have also convened a special session that began Tuesday and will run indefinitely but only to consider health care and water - related legislation .
The Iraq war measure , put before the Legislature by Senate President Pro Tem Don Perata , D - Oakland , was intended to make California voters the first in the nation to consider a withdrawal resolution .
But Schwarzenegger said in his veto message that while all Californians want the troops to come home , the question is not one for state voters to consider .
" The decision to engage in or withdraw troops from war is a federal issue , not a state issue , " the governor said .
The governor noted that Californians already have the means to express themselves on the war in the upcoming presidential primary , moved up to February to give state voters a larger voice in the race .
" Placing a non-binding resolution on Iraq on the same ballot , when it carries no weight or authority , would only further divide voters and shift attention from other critical issues that must be addressed , " Schwarzenegger said .
Some critics said the governor should have allowed the measure to go forward given the strong opposition to the war among many voters statewide .
" The self - proclaimed ' People 's Governor ' owed nothing less to the people of California and our troops overseas than to let the voice of the voters be heard on this disastrous war in Iraq , " Art Torres , chairman of the California Democratic Party , said in a statement .
" Instead , even as General Petraeus presents statistics this week that have raised more questions than answers about progress in Iraq , Schwarzenegger has ignored that message and effectively muzzled California voters on this critical issue , " Torres said .
To succeed at your online business you need a Web design must be just for that – a simple , focused site .
One that is easy to build , maintenance - free , low cost , credible , and a powerful traffic - builder and customer - converter .
Having the right tool and the right product alone does n't insure the success of your website .
There are many factors to be considered in effective website design
1. Build It for Speed
It 's a fact of modern life – people are in a hurry .
This means that you have between 10 and 30 seconds to capture your potential customer 's attention .
To minimize your load time , keep graphics small .
Compress them where possible .
Use flashy technology ( java script , Flash , Streaming Audio / Video , animation ) sparingly and only if it is important to your presentation .
2. Target your Market
Know who your market is and make certain that your site caters to their needs .
It is critical that your site reflect the values of your potential customers .
Then your site could be more informal and relaxed .
The key here is to know your market and build the site to their preferences .
3. Focus the Site
Make certain your web site is focused on the goal , selling your product or service .
A site offering many unrelated products is not necessarily unfocused , but this is often the case .
If your business does offer many products , dedicate a unique page for each instead of trying to sell them all from one page .
4. Credibility Is Crucial
The most professionally designed site wo n't sell if your customers do n't believe in you .
A clear privacy statement is one way to build your credibility .
Provide a prominent link to your privacy statement from every page on the site as well as from any location that you are asking your visitors for personal information .
Provide legitimate contact information on line .
5. Navigation should be simple
Make site navigation easy and intuitive .
Simple and smooth navigation adds to the convenience of the visitors .
Add powerful search and catalog features .
Many times a lot of visitors do not have the patience to navigate through the whole website to find what they are looking for .
6. Consistency is the key
Make sure the site is consistent in look , feel and design .
Nothing is more jarring and disturbing to a customer than feeling as if they have just gone to another site .
Keep colors and themes constant throughout the site .
7 . Make your site interactive
Make your website interactive .
Add feedback forms as well as email forms that allow your prospective customers to ask you any questions they might have pertaining to a product .
Personalization of your website is another key element that can lead to customer delight and can increase your sales .
Personalization technology provides you the analytic tools to facilitate cross-selling and up - selling when the customer is buying online .
It would give you an idea of what products to cross -sell and up - sell .
8. Content is King
Good content sells a product .
Ask yourself the following questions .
Does your copy convey the message you wish to get across to your visitors ?
Is it compelling ?
Does it lead your visitor through the sales process ?
Have others review , critique and edit your copy to insure it is delivering the intended message .
Always double check your spelling and grammar .
These eight , simple rules will go a long way toward an effective website design , and most importantly , turning visitors into customers .
WHO , WHAT , WHY ?
The Magazine answers ...
The car boot is targeted first
An explosion would seem , by nature , to be uncontrolled .
But in the past few days officers have carried out several " controlled explosions " in the investigation into the failed car bombings in Glasgow and London .
It was also a method used two years ago on a car left by the 7 July bombers in Luton .
The vehicle had a rucksack filled with explosives and the police subjected it to two controlled explosions .
So what happens ?
After suspicions are raised that a vehicle may contain explosives , a cordon will be placed around the car and all members of the public moved outside it .
THE ANSWER
Clear the area Safely gain access to the vehicle Use a robot and a small charge to destroy the initiating circuit and detonator
See how it works
" The aim is to recover the explosives device intact and get as much [ evidence ] out of it . "
First , the inside of the car must be accessed .
Opening the boot by hand would be dangerous because of a potential booby trap , so a robot is used to minimise the risk to the bomb disposal officers , says Sidney Alford , an explosives expert .
WHO , WHAT , WHY ?
A regular part of the BBC News Magazine , Who , What , Why ?
aims to answer some of the questions behind the headlines
If the car has been parked for a few days and presents a very low risk , the explosives could be placed on the vehicle by hand .
Once the vehicle has been accessed , officers prepare for the main controlled explosion .
The robot can use its camera to give experts standing at a distance a sight of what is inside .
The robot has a camera and a gun
" The British approach is almost always to try to get the initiating mechanism [ eg a mobile phone ] and disable it , " says Mr Alford .
A policy used in Iraq is to block all mobile phone signals in the immediate area to prevent such devices being detonated remotely .
What the controlled explosion does is remove the initiating circuit and the detonator , says Hans Michels , a professor of safety engineering .
If the main charge goes off then the car would be destroyed
Dr Hans Michels
" If you have a device that is completely assembled and ready to go , it has an initiating circuit , either electrical or mechanical , which gives a high temperature or shock to set off the detonator and the detonator charge will set off the main charge . "
A screen such as a heavy steel plate is placed between the initiator and the main charge , to minimise the damage , says Dr Michels .
A successful controlled explosion will leave the main charge intact and blow only the sensitive part of the device away .
The whole exercise can be carried out by the robot , which can also shoot the detonator and disrupt the device that way .
That would still be classed as a controlled explosion .
Older men who shack up with much younger women keep the grim reaper at bay for the human population and extend our species ' lifespan , new research claims .
Even beyond movie stars and Playboy 's Hugh Hefner , there is a tendency for older men to partner with younger women , according to the study , published in the Aug. 29 edition of PLoS ONE .
In less developed , traditional societies , males are about 5 to 15 years older than their female partners .
In the United States and Europe , guys are an average of two years senior to their partners .
More interesting , when old men father children , their genes seem to increase the lifespan of both sexes over evolutionary time .
How it works
Women often lose their reproductive capacity around age 50 , but if men can still reproduce into their 70s , Darwin would say it 's advantageous for males to live longer lives providing they can hook up with a woman capable of reproducing .
Natural selection should favor longevity - boosting genes , which would get passed down from fathers to both sons and daughters .
So women would benefit as well in future generations , the scientists say .

Over time , the older - guy - with - younger - gal lifestyle would lift the lifespan ceiling for both men and women in the next generations and so on .
" By increasing the survival of men you have a spillover effect on women because men pass their genes to children of both sexes , " said study team member Cedric Puleston , a doctoral candidate at Stanford University .
Anthropologist Cheryl Jamison of Indiana University , who was not involved in the research , called the results " fascinating . "
Wall of death
From an evolutionary perspective , women who can no longer reproduce are non-players , and since " it takes two , " men partnered with menopausal women are also irrelevant .
Following that idea , natural selection should select for harmful mutations that impact women after menopause .
Over time , the discriminating genes would accumulate in the population causing what evolutionary biologist William Hamilton called the " wall of death , " in which mortality of women spikes at the onset of menopause .
Population records and everyday observations indicate that 's not the case .
Life expectancy for men and women in today 's industrialized countries is 75 to 85 years , with mortality increasing gradually , not abruptly , following female menopause .
Men matter
To figure out whether male fertility could help explain human longevity , Shripad Tuljapurkar of Stanford University and his colleagues examined lifespan and fertility data from both men and women .
They studied four societies thought to closely mimic lifestyles of our ancestors , including two hunter - gather groups , the Dobe ! Kung of the Kalahari and the Ache of Paraguay ( one of the most isolated populations in the world ) , as well as the Yanomamo forager - farmers and an indigenous group in Bolivia called the Tsimane .
The research team also looked at farming villages in Gambia and a group of modern Canadians .
In all six groups , women stopped having children on average by their 50s , while some men continued to reproduce .
The age after which men showed no reproduction varied among the groups and included :
Canada — Men showed fertility until 55 years old .
! Kung — 55 years old
Gambia — 75 years old
Yanomamo — 70 years old
Ache — 65 years old
Tsimane — 60 years old
Mate choices
Until now , the most popular explanation for the bounty of over - 55s , called the " grandmother hypothesis , " suggested women get a life extension in order to care for their children and grandchildren .
The new findings do n't contradict that hypothesis , but help explain how men give women another boost over the " wall of death . "
" I do n’t think the finding conflicts with the grandmother hypothesis but rather that it can be considered along with it as explanations for human longevity — there does n’t have to be a single gene or single selective factor , " Jamison told LiveScience .
But why do men choose younger mates and females prefer older men ?
" There is a lot of evidence from evolutionary psychology that men are seeking younger women and women are seeking older men , " said anthropologist Martin Fieder of the University of Vienna , who was not involved in the current study .
Cases in point :
At the age of 26 , Anna Nicole Smith married 89 - year - old Jeremiah Howard Marshall II .
And in 1995 , actor Tony Randall , then 75 , married and had two kids with Heather Harlan , who was 24 at the time .
Last month , 90 - year - old Nanu Ram Jogi from India reportedly became the world 's oldest father when he announced his 21st child .
Evolutionary psychologists argue that older men have more resources to protect and care for the family , while younger , more fertile women give their male partners better means of passing along genes .
In a study of about 10,000 Swedish men and women , Fieder and his colleagues have found that men had the most children if they were partnered with women about six years younger than themselves .
So the benefits of " age - defying " couples go both ways .
Plus , the human species gets a boost .

The MySpace generation is a " somewhat alien life force , " a Navy recruiting presentation contends — with a language and lifestyle that ’s almost unrecognizable to adults .
And because the kids are such " coddled , " " narcissistic praise junkies , " they ’ll be beyond tough to bring into the military .
Propensity to join the armed forces among these so - called " millennials " has dropped to as little as 3 % ; that ’s down from 26 % in 2001 .
Entropic Memes uncovered the bleak , often unintentionally hilarious report from the Annual Navy Workforce Research and Analysis Conference , which also glumly notes that the Iraq war has brutalized recruiting efforts .
Up to two - thirds of millennials are " less likely to join the military " because of the war , according to the presentation .
The typical kid today " has always been online , " and " has never known a world without digital phones . "
Because of that , he a worldwide social network ; his " best friend may be Chinese , " the report says .
" Teens are creating new forms of social behavior that blur the distinction between online and real - world interactions — and largely ignore the difference between the two . "
The dual life is " creating a whole new language . "
The presentation warns recruiters that they ’re liable to experience more than " just a generation gap " with today ’s kids .
To older military types , the youngsters will appear to be " a somewhat alien life force . "
To be able to speak to these creatures , the presentation offers some handy translations , like " suuuuuuup !!!
( Translation : What ’s up ? ) . "
It also invites recruiters to make sure they know about emoticons , Napoleon Dynamite , Bolt , " Brangelina ’s baby , " and the Black Eyed Peas .
The report also notes important cultural distinctions between the youth of today and the youth of yesteryear .
Kids live such busy , structured life , that they often use " planner [s ] before middle school . "
They are also unusually tight with their " active , involved , ‘ helicopter ’ parents . "
These " kids grew up hearing nothing but praise , all the time , everywhere .
Recent childhood has been defined by ego - stroking …
[ They ] can get disgruntled if not praised for simply ‘ showing up ’ at work , " according to the report , which calls the millenials " a ‘ coddled ’ generation . "
All of which makes today ’s youth particularly unlikely to join the armed forces .
The " military [ is ] not on kids ’ radar , " according to the presentation — college is .
The report quotes an unnamed teenager , as saying " ( If I join the Navy ) I ’d miss out on having the excuse of being a college kid and being irresponsible . "
The Iraq war has only discouraged millennials further .
Up to 32 % say it has made them " less patriotic , " and up to 67 % say they are " less likely to join the military . "
UPDATE : Navy
Times hops aboard .
In the slides a Navy presenter described the patios [ sic ] of the young , a mishmash of acronyms and nonwords used in text messages and social networking sites ; in one sample exchange a hypothetical young person asks “ wat up dude ” and another responds “ nmu ( Translation : Not much .
You ? ) . ”
Potential Navy recruits are “ coddled ” and
“ unrealistically impatient , ” the presentation says , and would “ expect an open and transparent environment ” if they enlisted .
It also advises commanders to expect young people linked together by the Web and cell phones to “ share their Navy experiences ” and that “ some of them may not be worth bragging about . ”
So does Boing Boing .
Yeah , these darn kids today , with their weird abbreviations , acronyms — all that impenetrable insider jargon .
That ’s alien , all right .
Not like the military at all .
And so does Wonkette .
The voice on the other end of my cellphone was oddly calm , but intent .
“ Abukar , I am calling to inform you that we have decided to take your life , ” the caller said .
I glanced down at my phone to see the caller ID , which read “ private . ”
“ You ’re not worthy to live , ” the man continued .
“ You have three hours to tell your family and say your last words . ”
“ Who is this ? ” I demanded .

“ I am a man , ” was the reply .
It was n’t my first death threat .
As a journalist in Somalia , I ’ve received more than I ’d care to count .
In some , angry callers curse me as a “ puppet ” of the U.N. - backed transitional government in Baidoa and the Ethiopian troops that support it .
Others accuse me of being a “ terrorist ” supporting the Islamic insurgents .
But this call came at the end of one of the darkest days of my life .
Just a few hours earlier , I ’d attended the funeral of a friend and colleague , Mahad Ahmed Elmi , a radio host gunned down that August morning .
Then , as my fellow journalists and I drove back from the burial , a roadside bomb struck our convoy , killing Ali Iman Sharmarke , another prominent media figure in Mogadishu .
This month , gunmen shot another friend , Bashir Nur Gedi , acting manager of Shabelle Radio , who had been arrested and detained by government forces in September .
Advertisement
International journalist organizations say at least seven reporters have been killed in Somalia this year .
No one has been caught or punished in any of these attacks .
After I hung up , dozens of questions ran through my mind :
What am I guilty of ?
Who is my enemy ?
Why am I being targeted ?
But for the first time , one question would not go away : Should I leave Somalia ?
Many times I ’d stood over the graves of friends .
Now I imagined friends and family weeping over mine .
Advertisement
I began working as a journalist 10 years ago , at age 19 , because I wanted to alert the world to the untold stories of Somalia .
I had always admired an older cousin who had worked as a radio correspondent during the Mohamed Siad Barre regime , which fell in 1991 .
As a journalist in the capital , Mogadishu , I ’ve covered street battles , assassinations and public executions .
I ’ve had guns pointed at my head and I ’ve stepped over twisted bodies on the road .
I ’ve been summoned to news conferences in the presidential palace only to be detained by corrupt officials who demanded a bribe .
Over the years , I ’ve watched governments and authorities come and go .
Warlords , Islamic courts , transitional governments .
One thing stays the same :
When new groups rise to power , they attack the media .
Today journalists who have dedicated their lives to telling the stories of Somalia find themselves caught between suicidal insurgents and the blazing guns of the transitional government ’s mad soldiers .
Each is trying to make the media its puppet .
Advertisement
This year the government has arrested more than 50 journalists ; eight remain behind bars .
Officials have attempted to close media outlets and have imposed laws that restrict the activities of reporters .
Somalia is the second deadliest country in the world for journalists , after Iraq , according to the Committee to Protect Journalists .
At the same time , insurgents have attacked and harassed us , distributing leaflets in many neighborhoods threatening to kill any journalist perceived as supporting the government .
This summer we were flatly warned that we faced attacks if we covered the government ’s reconciliation conference .
I used to think that with commitment , dedication and a strong heart , I could survive .
Now I ’m not so sure .
This job can be rewarding .
But sometimes it feels like a curse .
During the reign of the Islamic Courts Union in 2006 , I watched a guard tie a 50 - year - old man to a stake after he was found guilty of stabbing another man to death .
Then , in accordance with the regime ’s interpretation of Islamic law , the son of the victim stepped forward and cut the accused from his groin to his collarbone .

Some women began to ululate in support , but many spectators vomited or passed out .
I turned away .
The scene took place outside a primary school , as students peered over the wall .
I thought to myself :
What is happening to my country ?
It got worse :
In March angry crowds dragged the bodies of government soldiers and burned them on the streets .
With bullets and missiles flying , I decided to take a couple of photographs , scrawl some quick notes and get away .
As I was getting ready to leave , I felt a gun at my head .
A militiaman ordered me to drop my camera .
I did .
I emptied my pockets , raised my hands and pleaded for my life .
He took my camera and cellphone , then turned to an angry , questioning crowd and declared me a spy .
The crowd began cursing me and chanting .
“ I ’m a journalist .
I ’m a journalist , ” I shouted , showing my press card .
Sweat poured from my body .
I feared I would end up like the government soldiers .
Advertisement
The militiaman , however , had a different punishment in mind .
He led me away to his leaders , eager to show off his captive .
I was lucky .
The militia leaders knew me , and vouched for me .
They let me go .
Still , those experiences were not a turning point .
It was the killings of my two colleagues in August .
But it was not an easy decision .
I was born and raised in Mogadishu .
To leave would feel as if I were giving up .
Instead I went into hiding , leaving my house , suspending my work and limiting my movements .
Advertisement
I grew suspicious .
I viewed every passerby as a potential assassin .
One day , a friend and I were moving from one of our hide - outs to another when three young men came up behind us .
We started walking faster .
They walked faster .
My heart raced .
We stopped to let them pass , and one of them muttered something as they went by .
We thought we were safe .
But a few minutes later , as we arrived at our destination , we saw the same three men approaching from the road ahead .
We froze .
I began praying and asking for God ’s forgiveness .
My friend said something to me , but I could n’t hear his words .
I closed my eyes and waited for the bullets .
I remembered the man on the phone days earlier , the chilling hatred in his voice .
Advertisement
Then the young men passed us by , with a simple nod and hello .
Were they just trying to intimidate us ?
Had something distracted them from their attack ?
Were they simply three men taking a walk ?
It did n’t matter anymore .
My decision was made .
Five days later I left the country .

Albadri has worked as a journalist for several Western media outlets , including the Los Angeles Times .
He is currently living in Djibouti and hopes one day to return home .
THE American legal system has rediscovered the virtue of one of the most ancient forms of punishment — public humiliation .
Prostitutes ' “ Johns ” can now have their names aired on television .
Mail thieves can find themselves wearing a sandwichboard giving full details of their crime .
And people who deface Nativity scenes can end up parading through town accompanied by a donkey .
And neoconservatives ?
These too , it seems , are now being subjected to a grand exercise in public humiliation .
Paul Wolfowitz is hanging on to his job at the World Bank by his fingernails ( see article ) .
Lewis “ Scooter ” Libby , a Wolfowitz protégé , is facing prison ; Douglas Feith , who worked with Mr Wolfowitz at the Pentagon , is an “ untouchable ” who is floating around the margins of academia .
As for their patrons , Donald Rumsfeld , Mr Wolfowitz 's patron , was sacked from the Pentagon amid accusations that he had lost the Republicans their majority .
Dick Cheney is so unpopular that he has provoked protests even at Brigham Young University , a Mormon redoubt which is as conservative as they come .
Conrad Black , one of the movement 's most generous sugar daddies , is on trial for fraud .
It seems that those whom the gods wish to punish they first make neocons .
Not all the neocons have been humiliated quite as badly as Mr Wolfowitz , let alone Mr Libby .
Many of them — including Richard Perle , who is widely known as the Prince of Darkness , and David Frum , the man who co-coined the phrase “ axis of evil ” — are safely on board the starship American Enterprise Institute .
Charles Krauthammer and Bill Kristol are as ubiquitous as ever in the media ; indeed , Mr Kristol has been given a column in Time magazine to go along with his self - constructed platform at the Weekly Standard .
Robert Kagan is in the middle of writing an ambitious history of American foreign policy .
And neoconservativism is not entirely finished as a political force .
George Bush rejected the Baker - Hamilton report on Iraq , which favoured early withdrawal and diplomacy , in favour of the neocon - designed “ surge ” .
Elliott Abrams is a deputy at the National Security Council .
Mr Cheney is proving no more destructible than Lord Voldemort .
John McCain is blowing loudly on the neocon trumpet ; Rudy Giuliani , having flirted with “ realists ” , has decided to stick with neocon foreign - policy advisers .
But the movement 's implosion is nevertheless astonishing .
One neocon sums up the prevailing mood in the movement .
The neocons are a “ laughing stock ” .
Their “ embrace of power ” has been “ a disaster ” .
Once upon a time they commanded an audience among Arab democrats and European conservatives .
But now they cannot make themselves heard above the din of criticisms of Iraq .
The “ surge ” is a desperate response to failure .
Many people see Messrs Kristol and Krauthammer as exhibits in a Ripley 's Believe It or Not exhibition : they marvel that they can ever have been so influential , rather than want to follow their advice again .
The neocons are being relentlessly marginalised in Washington .
Condoleezza
Rice is returning to her “ realist ” roots at the State Department , now that Mr Rumsfeld is out of her hair and Mr Cheney is weakened .
She has embraced “ shuttle diplomacy ” in Israel - Palestine , signalled her willingness to talk to Syria and Iran , and has even been polite about the United Nations .
The rising generation of policy intellectuals regards a reputation for neoconservatism as professional death .
They are also being marginalised — or at least slapped down a bit — within the conservative movement .
The “ paleocons ” have always disliked the neocons , sometimes ( disgracefully ) just because they are Jewish .
But now they are being joined by conservatives of almost every other stripe .
Realists dislike them for their destabilising foreign policy .
Small - government types dislike them for their indifference to government spending .
Libertarians dislike them for their preoccupation with using the state to impose virtue .
Neoconservatism could well return to where it started — the intellectual property of a handful of families called Kristol , Podhoretz and Kagan .
Why does the movement seem so discredited ?
Partly for practical reasons .
They misread intelligence about WMD and links between al - Qaeda and Saddam ( though some still believe in both notions ) .
They bungled the war in Iraq .
They had little real experience of either the Arab world or soldiering .
Many of them were even poor managers .
Gary Schmitt , a fellow neocon , complained of Mr Feith that he “ ca n't manage anything , and he does n't trust anyone else 's judgment ” .
General Tommy
Franks describes him as the “ dumbest fucking guy on the planet ” .
Betraying the founders
But , more important , neocons have been discredited for ideological reasons .
Most of the recent mistakes can be traced back not just to flawed execution but to flawed thinking .
The neocons argued that democracy might be an antidote to the Middle East 's problems : but democracy proved too delicate a plant .
They claimed that the assertion of American power might wipe out “ Vietnam syndrome ” : but it has ended up making America more reluctant to intervene abroad .
They talked about linking American power with American ideals : but it turned out , at Abu Ghraib and Guantánamo , that power can corrupt those ideals .
The tragedy of neoconservatism is that the movement began as a critique of the arrogance of power .
Early neocons warned that government schemes to improve the world might well end up making it worse .
They also argued that social engineers are always plagued by the law of unintended consequences .
The neocons have not only messed up American foreign policy by forgetting their founders ' insights .
They may also have put a stake through the heart of their own movement .
More than 200 people died in a previous outbreak in Kikwit
Blood samples from the southern province of Kasai were sent to laboratories specialising in haemorrhagic fever .
More than 100 people have died and many more have fallen sick in a recent fever epidemic in central DR Congo .
Scientists say some deaths could have been from a bacterium called Shigella .
Three months ago , people started falling sick from a mystery virus in several villages around Kananga , the capital of West Kasai region .
Emergency response teams are now being sent to DR Congo to try to contain the outbreak .
Ebola is untreatable and almost always fatal .
It is thought to be transmitted through the consumption of infected bush meat and can also be spread by contact with the blood secretions of infected people .
DR Congo's last major Ebola outbreak killed more than 200 people in 1995 in Kikwit , about 400 km ( 249 miles ) west of the current outbreak .
The last major incidence of the disease was in Uganda in 2001 when more than 400 cases were reported and more than half of the patients died .
Waxman requests missing e-mail information Nick Juliano
Published : Thursday August 30 , 2007
Print This Email This
The chairman of Congress 's investigative committee is requesting information from the White House about up to 5 million missing e-mails after the Bush administration rebuffed an independent group 's attempt to learn about the White House 's record - keeping practices .
Rep. Henry Waxman , chairman of the House Oversight Committee , wrote to White House Counsel Fred F. Fielding requesting reports produced within the White House about the missing e-mails .
Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington , a private watchdog , previously requested the reports under the Freedom of Information Act , but the White House denied it request with an unorthodox -- and precedent reversing -- claim that the Office of Administration , which maintained the records , was not subject to the public records law .
In his letter , Waxman ( D - CA ) said the denial of CREW 's request was " an apparent effort to keep the public from learning the extent of missing White House e-mails . "
Waxman gives the White House until Sept. 10 to turn over the requested information , which he first requested three months ago , though he does not specify consequences if they refuse .
If White House fails to hand over the information , Waxman could issue a formal subpoena and eventually pursue contempt of Congress charges if the administration does not cooperate .
In its report on the missing e-mails in April , CREW said top White House officials , including political adviser Karl Rove , used e-mail accounts provided by the Republican National Committee to conduct official government business without leaving behind a public record , in violation of federal law .
Waxman 's letter is reprinted below : Mr. Fred F. Fielding
Counsel to the President
The White House
Washington , DC 20500
Dear Mr. Fielding : Last week , in an apparent effort to keep the public from learning the extent of missing White House e-mails , the White House took the unusual position that the Office of Administration is not subject to the Freedom of Information Act .
Because Congress also has an interest in this issue , I am writing to request information about the reports that millions of e-mails may have been lost from the White House e-mail system .
On May 29 , 2007 , Keith Roberts , the Deputy General Counsel of the White House Office of Administration , and Emmet Flood , Special Counsel to the President , briefed Committee staff on the White House e-mail system and the missing e-mails .
At the briefing , Mr. Roberts informed Committee staff that the White House had discovered in 2005 that an unknown number of e-mails may not have been preserved in the White House archive , as required by the Presidential Records Act.
According to Mr. Roberts , the Office of the Chief Information Officer then conducted a review of the e-mail system to determine the scope of the potential loss .
He said that this review apparently found some days with a very small number of preserved e-mails and some days with no e-mails preserved at all .
He also stated that a report summarizing these findings had been presented to the White House Counsels office .
In addition , Mr. Roberts informed the Committee that an unidentified company working for the Information Assurance Directorate of the Office of the Chief Information Officer was responsible for daily audits of the e-mail system and the e-mail archiving process .
Mr. Roberts was not able to explain why the daily audits conducted by this contractor failed to detect the problems in the archive system when they first began .
At the conclusion of the briefing , Committee staff requested a copy of the analysis presented to White House Counsel and the identity of the contractor responsible for daily audits and archiving .
Mr. Flood told Committee staff that he would take the two requests under consideration .
Since then , Committee staff have repeatedly requested that the White House provide this information without success .
Given that three months have passed since your office first received this request , I am writing to ask that you provide the information to the Committee by September 10 , 2007 .
The Committee on Oversight and Government Reform is the principal oversight committee in the House of Representatives and has broad oversight jurisdiction as set forth in House Rule X .
An attachment to this letter provides additional information on how to respond to the Committees request .
If your staff has any questions about this request , they should contact David Rapallo with the Committee staff at ( 202 ) [ XXX - XXXX ] .
Sincerely ,
Henry A. Waxman
Chairman
Merrill Lynch joins other institutions hit by sub - prime loans woes
The brokerage giant reported a net loss of $ 2.3 bn from continuing operations , against a $ 3bn profit a year ago .
The losses were caused by exposure to bad mortgage - related debt , such as that in the crisis hit US sub - prime sector .
Merill is the latest bank to reveal its exposure to bad debt , with a write - down much larger than initially forecast .
' Difficult markets '
Merrill 's admission follows similar warnings from Citigroup , Credit Suisse and UBS as the extent of the crisis in the US sub - prime loans sector becomes known .
This is a bloodbath for certain
Bill Fitzpatrick , Johnson Family Funds
" In light of difficult credit markets and additional analysis by management during our quarter - end closing process , we re-examined our remaining CDO [ collateralised debt obligations ] positions with more conservative assumptions , " said Merrill chief executive Stan O'Neal .
" The result is a larger write - down of these assets than initially anticipated . "
Analysts were taken aback at the size of the loss .
This is a bloodbath for certain , " said Bill Fitzpatrick , analyst at Johnson Family Funds .
" It speaks very poorly to Merrill 's risk management practices . "

This paper , Faster laziness using dynamic pointer tagging , came through my queue and though I did n't think much of it the first time through , it turns out to be more interesting than I had thought when I first read it .
First , some background on pointer tagging .
In the implementation of a dynamic language you need to be able to figure out what exactly a given value ( thinking concretely at the machine level here , like a value in a register ) holds .
One easy way to do this is to make everything a pointer to a known layout of an object , but that means that even integers are pointers and that 's inefficient .
A common trick is this : because pointers are word - aligned , the low bits are zero , so you can use the lowest bit(s ) as a tag on a word to indicate that the integer is stored " inline " : that is , if bit 0 is set , then bits 1 - 31 are the integer 's value , while otherwise it 's a pointer to some other sort of object .
( If this is unfamiliar to you , read this overview of Ruby 's VALUE datatype ; I did n't know Ruby did this until I looked up that article but I expected that was their design . )
I believe Lisps do something similar as well .
I made an old post¹ on here about O'Caml does this -- it 's the same thing , or at least it was in 2003 -- but the cute bit with O'Caml is in their implementation .
Since they 're compiling to native code , they can actually use the x86 addressing hardware to add integers in a single instruction .
That is : when you have two integers A and B that are represented in registers asand , they can compute their representation of the sum , , without doing all the bit math .
Ok , then : Haskell .
Haskell² instead has this hideously inefficient - seeming implementation where all variables³ are -- get ready , it 's a bit freaky -- pointers to code that is executed whenever the value of the variable is needed .
This is a cute trick for lazy evaluation : the first time the value is actually needed , only then does the code for computing its value run ; at the end of its run , this code overwrites itself with code that just quickly returns the result of its computation .
So all subsequent accesses to that value ( which again execute that code ) can return the computed value instantly .
But this design is also terrible , because any time you access any of these variables you 're doing a couple of jumps and ( as this paper 's introduction observes ) you screw branch prediction and cause pipeline stalls .
To me this design is very Haskell -y : sacrificing performance for internal purity and consistency .
( For all of that , it still performs well in microbenchmarking contests -- why ? )
Haskell 's got the same two low bits on these pointers ( 3 bits , even , on 64 - bit architectures ) that are unused just like in these other languages .
The paper says : let 's use those bits to tag pointers to maybe avoid doing these jumps and speed things up !... and right there was my understanding when I first skimmed through this paper -- which also has nice architectural descriptions about GHC and is pretty easy to follow -- and it seemed straightforward enough to not warrant posting about here .
But here 's actually something more interesting going on .
( As common when I post here , I 'm embarrassing myself in writing this because I clearly did n't understand the paper at in depth on my first - read through . )
The thing about Haskell is that it 's statically typed : you do n't need to use the tag bits to represent information about what type of data you 're looking at , because that 's known at compile - time -- so not only can you use these bits , you can use them differently and specifically depending on what type of data you 're considering !
So for a list , the pointer can encode whether you 've got a cons cell or the end of the list .
Or for a boolean , the pointer directly encodes whether it 's pointing at true or false .
( Due to the way Haskell 's implemented , these are both specific examples of the underlying implementation of this feature . )
When it 's time to use the value you do n't need to follow the pointer at all .
There 's still lazy evaluation to support : if the bottom bits are 00 , that encodes that you still need to do the jump to code to compute the value .
But once the value has been computed , for data types that have three or fewer cases for their value ( including booleans and lists ) , that value be encoded directly into the pointer .
For types that have more than three cases , you can still encode whether they 've been evaluated already or not ( which allows the implementation to read the value behind the pointer without executing code ) .
And again , you can encode all of this information in just two bits because , as a statically - typed language , you can have different behavior for different types .
The paper claims this change is a few hundred lines to the Haskell compiler and produces a 10 - 14 % speedup over their benchmarks suite .
( PS : What about O'Caml ?
They 're statically typed too , so why do they need the this - is - an - integer tagging in the first place ?
Totally guessing here , but maybe it's so the garbage collector can know that integer values ( indicated with a low bit of 1 ) are not to be followed as pointers .
But that 's totally a guess ... ) 1
I tracked it down to discover all of the links were dead . :( 2
Here by " Haskell " I mean " the GHC implementation of Haskell " .

Haskell does n't really have variables , because values can't change .
But hopefully you get what I 'm saying .
Clueless Congressmen .
Shifty corporate chiefs .
And a rather reckless disregard for the big issues at hand .
Welcome to the Blackwater hearings , people .
P.W. Singer documents the atrocities .
Today , the House Committee on Oversight and Reform held a hearing on private security contracting in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Given recent events in Iraq ( the shooting involving Blackwater contractors that left as many as 20 dead ) and the hearings ' star witness ( Erik
Prince , chairman of the controversial firm ) it was expected to be an important and even heated event .
Indeed , the line of people waiting to attend the session this morning wrapped down the entire hallway corridor , like it was the premiere of a hit movie .
I was fortunate enough to be able to attend , and even scored a seat on the front row .
I should have gone to see Superbad instead .
Writing now a few minutes after the first panel of the hearing has ended ( some 4 hours later ! ) , below are a few of my quick - hit observations .
The best encapsulation of the entire hearings on this important matter of national security was that offered by Rep. Darrell Issa ( R - CA ) .
He led his remarks by saying , " Hopefully , we will get to serious discussion . "
Then he proceeded to talk about everything from diabetes drugs to Moveon.org – as opposed to the issues at hand .
Much of the air was taken out of the hearing by the decision made to restrict from discussion the events of September 16th .
There was a sensible reason for this :
The FBI opened an investigation the day before ( coincidentally or not , depending how much of a conspiracy theorist you are ) .
No one wanted to say anything to contaminate an ongoing investigation .
But it sure made things less exciting and less important , since September 16th was what had prompted the hearings in the first place .
The hearing revealed a fascinating , but also disturbing , lack of awareness in Congress about the private military industry .
Members on both sides repeatedly struggled with the most basic facts and issues that surround the over 160,000 - person contractor force in Iraq :
Everything from the number and roles of contractors to their status and accountability , or lack thereof .
It was quite clear that this was the first time that many had been forced to think much about the issue
( even though the industry is over a decade old and the supplemental funds have been paying for the use of contractors in Iraq , year after year ) .
What I found especially telling , given the consistently weak grasp of the issues , was that multiple representatives opened their remarks by talking about how Blackwater contractors protected them while on visits to
Iraq .
They often meant this as a compliment to the firm , and also a way of establishing their credentials on the issue .
But it usually backfired , revealing a lack of simple curiosity .
It showed that they 've known about the massive use of contractors for years - they just did n't bother to ask any questions , even when the issue was in their faces .
Many representatives questioned the issue of legal status of contractors and why they were n't being held accountable .
No one had a good handle on this .
Prince , for one , frequently mentioned how he had fired employees who may have violated some law , but could not go beyond such an action .
And no one was there from the Department of
Justice to explain why they have avoided prosecuting these same employees .
The lack of clarity on the legal issues was perhaps illustrated best in an odd exchange between Representative Rep. Bruce Braley ( D - Iowa )
and Mr. Prince .
The Congressman pressed Prince about what laws contractors might be held accountable under ; the chairman of one of the leading firms in the industry found himself unable to give an immediate reply .
( Note : This discussion also left aside the cold , hard fact that none of the various laws they pondered have actually been used for a battlefield contractor in Iraq . )
Time and again , there were exchanges over whether contracting our military services to firms like Blackwater was saving money .
Prince forcefully argued it was cost efficient ; many representatives cited payment and profit figures that cast doubt on such a claim .
That
Prince could not ( or would not ) give even a ballpark figure for the overall profits his firm was making did n't exactly help his cause .
Those exchanges had a bigger problem .
The comparisons were often of the apples - and - oranges type , so they were never fully resolvable .
One side would discuss overall pay versus contracted pay – ignoring the differences between sunk costs of training , who ends up paying benefits , etc. , etc .
Second , the use of private military contractors has never really been about financial cost savings .
Rather , it 's been about political cost savings .
No one was able to point to a single decision to outsource some function to Blackwater that happened because of a cost differential analysis .
Instead , each of these choices was made because a policymaker wanted to try to avoid spending political capital on an otherwise difficult decision , and a contractor was now there to enable this political cost avoidance .
Finally , the hearings did not deal with the crucial question , which is not one of oversight , of money savings , or even of legal accountability .
It is becoming clear that many roles now outsourced , including the armed escort of government officials , assets , and convoys in a warzone , not only are inherently government functions , but that the outsourcing of them has created both short and long - term negative consequences .
I found several statements of Prince intriguing in this light .
For example , he assiduously claimed , " We are part of the ' total force ' in trying to get the mission done . "
But then he went on to discuss how his contracted mission was often at odds with the military 's counterinsurgency mission , for example , discussing how his employees explicitly avoid stopping for Iraqis who may have been mistakenly shot .
" Our job is to get them off the X , " referring to getting client away from a potential danger site .
Again , even if the firm was performing its roles properly and there was perfect oversight and accountability , that different sense of " our job " and " the mission " is the fundamental disconnect between a private vs. public mission , which everyone seems to be avoiding .

In C# and the Compilation Tax , several commenters noted that they have " fast dual - core computers " , and yet background compilation performance was unsatisfactory for them on large projects .
It 's entirely possible that this is Visual Studio 's fault .
However , I 'd like to point out that not all dual core computers are created equal .
Not by a long shot .
Take a look at this Visual C++ compilation benchmark .
Details of the benchmark methodology are available on this page , but for now let 's assume this is typical compilation performance in a typical IDE .
The baseline score of 100 represents a 2.6 GHz Pentium D 805 CPU .
Clearly the multiple core future has already arrived -- every CPU you see here is a dual - core model .
Many Pentium 4 models come in dual - core flavor .
The CPU at the bottom of the benchmark results is n't just any garden variety Pentium 4 , though .
It 's the Pentium 965 " Extreme Edition " , the absolute pinnacle of the Pentium 4 CPU family .
It 's a 3.73 GHz dual - core , dual - hyperthreaded CPU that originally retailed for almost a thousand dollars .
The fastest possible Pentium 4 is nearly 50 percent slower at compilation than a midrange Athlon 64 or Core 2 Duo CPU .
But wait !
It gets worse !
Consider WorldBench - Mozilla 1.4 results .
The times shown are in seconds ; lower scores are better .
Bringing up the rear , by a large margin , are two members of the Pentium 4 CPU family .
The 3.6 GHz Pentium D 960 is almost twice as slow as the 2.6 GHz Core 2 Duo E6700 in Mozilla .
Perhaps this is why Tech Report called the Pentium 4 " [ a ] CPU based on a lame - duck microarchitecture . "
If you 're running a Pentium 4 CPU -- even a " fast " 3.4 GHz+ dual - core model -- you could more than double your performance by upgrading to a middle - of - the - road Core 2 Duo CPU .
And I 'm not talking about meaningless synthetic performance benchmark numbers ; I 'm talking about performance in real world apps that software developers use every day , meat and potatoes stuff like web browsers and compilers .
If you 're using a Pentium 4 CPU of any kind , consider upgrading at the earliest possible opportunity .
Given how much software developers are paid , it makes no economic sense to hobble them with old , slow PCs based on the underperforming Pentium 4 CPU .
Demand your rights .
You can pick up a midrange Core 2 Duo system , sans monitor , for under a thousand dollars .
Is n't the value of your time worth at least that ?
You may be hard - pressed to recall events after a night of binge drinking , but a new report suggests that low to moderate alcohol consumption may actually enhance memory .
" There are human epidemiological data of others indicating that mild [ to ] moderate drinking may paradoxically improve cognition in people compared to abstention , " says Maggie Kalev , a research fellow in molecular medicine and pathology at the University of Auckland in New Zealand and a co-author of an article in The Journal of Neuroscience describing results of a study she and other researchers performed on rats .
" This is similar to a glass of wine protecting against heart disease , however the mechanism is different . "
Kalev and Matthew During , a professor of molecular virology , immunology and medical genetics at The Ohio State University College of Medicine and a principal investigator of gene therapy at Auckland , initially set out to study the role of N - methyl - D- aspartic acid ( NMDA ) receptors in the neuronal processes of normal and diseased animals .
( NMDA receptors are critical to memory , because they regulate the strength of synapses ( spaces ) between nerve cells through which the cells communicate . )
But during their research , they discovered that memory was enhanced when one of its subunits , known as NR1 , was strengthened in the hippocampus ( a central brain region implicated in episodic memory ) .
They then reviewed previous experiments , which had turned up a link between alcohol consumption and NR1 activity .
" We decided to study if beneficial effects of low - dose alcohol drinking already shown by others , " Kalev says , " could be mediated through the mechanism of increasing NR1 expression .
We thought it was worth pursuing , since ethanol drinking is such a common pattern of human behavior . "
The researchers created two strains of transgenic rats , one that had an abundance of NR1 subunits in their hippocampi and one in which it was suppressed .
A group of normal rats and those with the suppressed NR1 action were fed a diet consisting of 0 , 2.5 or 5 percent ethanol .
According to Kalev , it is hard to relate the alcohol the rats consumed to human quantities , but " based on their blood alcohol levels , the 2.5 percent ethanol diet was equivalent to a level of consumption that does not exceed [ the ] legal driving limit .
This may be approximately one to two drinks per day for some people or two to three for others , depending upon their size , metabolism or genetic background . "
The rats stayed on these diets for eight weeks ; behavioral testing to assess cognitive function began after four weeks .
One test involved novel object recognition , where rats were placed in a cage with two small objects inside multiple times over a two - day period .
Then , one object was swapped for a new toy and rats were scored based on how quickly they explored the unfamiliar piece .
In a second paradigm , rats were trained to expect a shock when they crossed from a white compartment to a black one inside a cage ; a day after training , the rats were put back in the cage to see if they remembered that the black side was dangerous .
Among the normal rats , the animals that consumed moderate amounts of alcohol fared better on both tests compared with the teetotalers .
Rats on a heavy alcohol diet did not do well on object recognition ( and , in fact , showed signs of neurotoxicity ) , but they performed better than their normal brethren on the emotional memory task .
" People often drink to ' drown sorrows , ' " Kalev says .
" Our results suggest that this could actually paradoxically promote traumatic memories and lead to further drinking , contributing to the development of alcoholism . "
Overstimulating the NR1 subunits of the NMDA receptor showed effects similar to those from moderate drinking , whereas suppressing the NR1 subunits canceled out the effect of low , but steady consumption .
These findings indicate that the NMDA receptor must be intact for the positive effects of alcohol to manifest , Kalev says .
They speculate that the NMDA receptor is initially blocked by alcohol , causing the activity of the NR1 subunit to elevate as a compensatory response ( thereby conferring heightened cognition ) .
Meir Stampfer , a professor of nutrition and epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health in Boston , says that the new work provides a stronger biological basis for studies that he and others have undertaken linking improved memory to moderate alcohol intake .
" [ This study ] provides interesting evidence for a mechanism that may be operating at the NMDA receptor , " he says , but quickly cautions : " It 's better not to drink at all than to drink too much , " as is also demonstrated by this study .
You simply must be kidding me .
Justice Dept official resigns over investigation connected with Abramoff
by Marisa Taylor and David Whitney
McClatchy Newspapers
WASHINGTON – A senior Justice Department official has resigned after coming under scrutiny in the Departmentâ€™s expanding investigation of convicted super - lobbyist Jack Abramoff , according to a Justice Department official with knowledge of the case .
Making the situation more awkward for the embattled Department , the official , Robert E. Coughlin II , was deputy chief of staff for the criminal division , which is overseeing the Departmentâ€™s probe of Abramoff .
He stepped down effective April 6 as investigators in Coughlinâ €™s own division ratcheted up their investigation of lobbyist Kevin Ring , Coughlinâ € ™s long - time friend and a key associate of Abramoff .

As night fell in the horror film 28 Days Later , I assumed my standard horror - movie fetal position : knees to chest , eyes closed , heart pounding .
Then the zombies broke through the window .
As I plucked popcorn from my hair and my pulse slowed slightly , I promised to never , ever watch such a scary movie again .
But this summer 28 Weeks Later hit the theaters .
My friends told me it was even scarier .
Of course I could n't resist .
And that night , as I tried to fall asleep with the windows locked and the lights on and the TV blaring , I wondered ... why do I do this to myself ?
If the half - billion dollars spent by Americans on horror movies last year is anything to go by , I 'm not the only one to ask that question .
Scientists believe the answer is that humans have evolved to enjoy fear .
" There 's a substantial overlap between those brain areas involved in processing fear and pleasure , " said Allan Kalueff , a neuroscientist at the University of Tampere in Finland .
As Halloween approaches , the latest research into fear suggests that the neurological systems in our brains that are stimulated by fear are the same as those associated with pleasure .
So while you 're watching Saw IV or playing Resident Evil , you get the gratification of real fear without any of the danger .
Scientists say that while watching a scary movie , or playing popular games like Bioshock and Dementium , information runs from your eyes and ears to an almond - shaped clump of neurons called the amygdala .
Located front - and - center in your brain , the amygdala has long been understood as vital to instantaneous emotional processing , especially of love and pleasure .
Experiments on rats have also shown that damaging their amygdalae interferes with their capacity to feel fear , suggesting an overlap between such seemingly opposite emotions as pleasure and fright .
So as the zombie breaks through the door or the murderer leaps from the closet , your amygdala gets juiced just as it would by a home run in the bottom of the ninth , unleashing a brain - and body - energizing cocktail of hormones .
But while this is happening , information also travels to your prefrontal cortex , the part of the brain responsible for consciously evaluating danger .
It tells you that the movie is just a movie .
Remove that part of the equation , and you likely would n't remember 28 Weeks Later any more fondly than the time you thought you were being followed down a dark alley .
" The amygdala gets just as activated by fear as it would in the real world , but because your cortex knows you 're not in danger , that spillover is rewarding and not frightening , " said Yerkes National Primate Research Center neuroscientist Kerry Ressler .
Like the amygdala , the nucleus accumbens also processes both pleasure and fear .
It is a collection of neurons located just behind your forehead .
Its dual role may explain why deep - brain stimulation , an electrical therapy used to treat psychiatric disorders and Parkinson 's disease , sometimes causes feelings of panic .
Why would our brains work this way ?
It seems it would make more sense to separate the two forms of stimulation .
But Kalueff thinks the arrangement is genius .
" If arousal is only pleasant or only unpleasant , that does n't make sense .
Situations change all the time .
What 's pleasant now could be unpleasant tomorrow , " he said .
" It 's up to the brain to decide , to the individual to decide , whether it 's danger or pleasure . "
It 's also possible , however , that it 's just an evolutionary quirk , a bit of crossed wiring produced by fitting a mind more powerful than any supercomputer into a melon - sized chassis .
Scientists are n't sure , nor can they explain , why one person falls asleep easily after watching The Silence of the Lambs while another lies in bed for hours , eyes open and lights on .
Scientists also admit that the focus on basic neurobiology does n't explain other aspects of pleasurable fear .
As Ressler noted , experiencing fear and coming out unscathed is itself satisfying � an observation that stems more from psychology than neuroscience .
Psychologists say that watching scary movies is a way of testing and overcoming our limitations , similar to bungee jumping and other extreme sports .
" That could be why scary movies and games are so popular with children .
They 're at a point in their lives when they 're testing their boundaries , " said Kansas State University psychologist Leon Rappoport .
" By the time they get to college age or later , they 've had enough of them .
Their development proceeds in more substantial directions . "
But plenty of adults enjoy scary movies .
For them , the horror films may be a form of therapy , a way of dealing with ambient fear in a society where war and disaster and crime are broadcast around the clock , and the contents of an aerosol can may cause cancer .
" It is gratifying to confront and overcome a fear , " said Rappoport .
" Many therapies are exposure therapies .
It allows the individual to gain a sense of mastery over their anxieties , whatever they may be . "
In 1985 , a geography researcher called Atsumu Ohmura at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology got the shock of his life .
As part of his studies into climate and atmospheric radiation , Ohmura was checking levels of sunlight recorded around Europe when he made an astonishing discovery .
It was too dark .
Compared to similar measurements recorded by his predecessors in the 1960s , Ohmura 's results suggested that levels of solar radiation striking the Earth 's surface had declined by more than 10 % in three decades .
Sunshine , it seemed , was on the way out .
The finding went against all scientific thinking .
By the mid-80s there was undeniable evidence that our planet was getting hotter , so the idea of reduced solar radiation - the Earth 's only external source of heat - just did n't fit .
And a massive 10 % shift in only 30 years ?
Ohmura himself had a hard time accepting it .
" I was shocked .
The difference was so big that I just could not believe it , " he says .
Neither could anyone else .
When Ohmura eventually published his discovery in 1989 the science world was distinctly unimpressed .
" It was ignored , " he says .
It turns out that Ohmura was the first to document a dramatic effect that scientists are now calling " global dimming " .
Records show that over the past 50 years the average amount of sunlight reaching the ground has gone down by almost 3 % a decade .
It 's too small an effect to see with the naked eye , but it has implications for everything from climate change to solar power and even the future sustainability of plant photosynthesis .
In fact , global dimming seems to be so important that you 're probably wondering why you 've never heard of it before .
Well do n't worry , you 're in good company .
Many climate experts have n't heard of it either , the media has not picked up on it , and it does n't even appear in the reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) .
" It 's an extraordinary thing that for some reason this has n't penetrated even into the thinking of the people looking at global climate change , " says Graham Farquhar , a climate scientist at the Australian National University in Canberra .
" It 's actually quite a big deal and I think you 'll see a lot more people referring to it . "
That 's not to say that the effect has gone unnoticed .
Although Ohmura was the first to report global dimming , he was n't alone .
In fact , the scientific record now shows several other research papers published during the 1990s on the subject , all finding that light levels were falling significantly .
Among them they reported that sunshine in Ireland was on the wane , that both the Arctic and the Antarctic were getting darker and that light in Japan , the supposed land of the rising sun , was actually falling .
Most startling of all was the discovery that levels of solar radiation reaching parts of the former Soviet Union had gone down almost 20 % between 1960 and 1987 .
The problem is that most of the climate scientists who saw the reports simply did n't believe them .
" It 's an uncomfortable one , " says Gerald Stanhill , who published many of these early papers and coined the phrase global dimming .
" The first reaction has always been that the effect is much too big , I do n't believe it and if it 's true then why has nobody reported it before . "
That began to change in 2001 , when Stanhill and his colleague Shabtai Cohen at the Volcani Centre in Bet Dagan , Israel collected all the available evidence together and proved that , on average , records showed that the amount of solar radiation reaching the Earth 's surface had gone down by between 0.23 and 0.32 % each year from 1958 to 1992 .
This forced more scientists to sit up and take notice , though some still refused to accept the change was real , and instead blamed it on inaccurate recording equipment .
Solar radiation is measured by seeing how much the side of a black plate warms up when exposed to the sun , compared with its flip side , which is shaded .
It 's a relatively crude device , and we have no way of proving how accurate measurements made 30 years ago really are .
" To detect temporal changes you must have very good data otherwise you 're just analysing the difference between data retrieval systems , " says Ohmura .
Stanhill says the dimming effect is much greater than the possible errors ( which anyway would make the light levels go up as well as down ) , but what was really needed was an independent way to prove global dimming was real .
Last year Farquhar and his group in Australia provided it .
The 2001 article written by Stanhill and Cohen sparked Farquhar 's interest and he made some inquiries .
The reaction was not always positive and when he mentioned the idea to one high - ranking climate scientist ( whose name he is reluctant to reveal ) he was told : " That 's bullshit , Graham .
If that was the case then we 'd all be freezing to death . "
But Farquhar had realised that the idea of global dimming could explain one of the most puzzling mysteries of climate science .
As the Earth warms , you would expect the rate at which water evaporates to increase .
But in fact , study after study using metal pans filled with water has shown that the rate of evaporation has gone down in recent years .
When Farquhar compared evaporation data with the global dimming records he got a perfect match .
The reduced evaporation was down to less sunlight shining on the water surface .
And while Stanhill and Cohen 's 2001 report appeared in a relatively obscure agricultural journal , Farquhar and his colleague Michael Roderick published their solution to the evaporation paradox in the high - profile American magazine Science .
Almost 20 years after it was first noticed , global dimming was finally in the mainstream .
" I think over the past couple of years it 's become clear that the solar irradiance at the Earth 's surface has decreased , " says Jim Hansen , a leading climate modeller with Nasa 's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York .
The missing radiation is in the region of visible light and infrared - radiation like the ultraviolet light increasingly penetrating the leaky ozone layer is not affected .
Stanhill says there is now sufficient interest in the subject for a special session to be held at the joint meeting of the American and Canadian geophysical societies in Montreal next May .
So what causes global dimming ?
The first thing to say is that it 's nothing to do with changes in the amount of radiation arriving from the sun .
Although that varies as the sun 's activity rises and falls and the Earth moves closer or further away , the global dimming effect is much , much larger and the opposite of what would be expected given there has been a general increase in overall solar radiation over the past 150 years .
That means something must have happened to the Earth 's atmosphere to stop the arriving sunlight penetrating .
The few experts who have studied the effect believe it 's down to air pollution .
Tiny particles of soot or chemical compounds like sulphates reflect sunlight and they also promote the formation of bigger , longer lasting clouds .
" The cloudy times are getting darker , " says Cohen , at the Volcani Centre .
" If it 's cloudy then it 's darker , but when it 's sunny things have n't changed much . "
More importantly , what impact could global dimming have ?
If the effect continues then it 's certainly bad news for solar power , as darker , cloudier skies will reduce its meagre efficiency still further .
The effect on photosynthesis , and so on plant and tree growth , is more complicated and will probably be different in various parts of the world .
In equatorial regions and parts of the southern hemisphere regularly flooded with light , photosynthesis is likely to be limited by carbon dioxide or water , not sunshine , and light levels would have to fall much further to force a change .
In fact , in some cases photosynthesis could paradoxically increase slightly with global dimming as the broken , diffuse light that emerges from clouds can penetrate deep into forest canopies more easily than direct beams of sunlight from a clear blue sky .
But in the cloudy parts of the northern hemisphere , like Britain , it 's a different story and if you grow tomatoes in a greenhouse you could be seeing the effects of global dimming already .
" In the northern climate everything becomes light limiting and a reduction in solar radiation becomes a reduction in productivity , " Cohen says .
" In greenhouses in Holland , the rule of thumb is that a 1 % decrease in solar radiation equals a 1 % drop in productivity .
Because they 're light limited they 're always very busy cleaning the tops of their greenhouses . "
The other major impact global dimming will have is on the complex computer simulations climate scientists use to understand what is happening now and to predict what will happen in the future .
For them , global dimming is a real sticking point .
" All of their models , all the physics and mathematics of solar radiation in the Earth 's atmosphere can't explain what we 're measuring at the Earth 's surface , " Stanhill says .
Farquhar agrees : " This will drive what the modellers have to do now .
They 're going to have to account for this . "
David Roberts , a climate modeller with the Met Office 's Hadley Centre , says that although the issue of global dimming raises some awkward questions , some of the computer simulations do at least address the mechanisms believed to be driving it .
" Most of the processes involving aerosols and formation of clouds are already in there , though I accept it 's a bit of a work in progress and more work needs to be done , " Roberts says .
Another big question yet to be answered is whether the phenomenon will continue .
Will our great grandchildren be eating lunch in the dark ?
Unlikely , though few studies are up to date enough to confirm whether or not global dimming is still with us .
" There 's been so little done that nobody really understands what 's going on , " Cohen says .
There are some clues though .
O hmura says that satellite images of clouds seem to suggest that the skies have become slightly clearer since the start of the 1990s , and this has been accompanied by a sharp upturn in temperature .
Both of these facts could indicate that global dimming has waned , and this would seem to tie in with the general reduction in air pollution caused by the scaling down of heavy industry across parts of the world in recent years .
Just last month , Helen Power , a climate scientist at the University of South Carolina published one of the few analyses of up - to - date data for the 1990s and found that global dimming over Germany seemed to be easing .
" But that 's just one study and it 's impossible to say anything about long - term trends from one study , " she cautions .
It 's also possible that global dimming is not entirely down to air pollution .
" I do n't think that aerosols by themselves would be able to produce this amount of global dimming , " says Farquhar .
Global warming itself might also be playing a role , he suggests , by perhaps forcing more water to be evaporated from the oceans and then blown onshore ( although the evidence on land suggests otherwise ) .
" If the greenhouse effect causes global dimming then that really changes the perspective , " he says .
In other words , while it keeps getting warmer it might keep getting darker .
" I 'm not saying it definitely is that , I 'm just raising the question . "
Ultimately , that and other questions will have to be considered by the scientists around the world who are beginning to think about how to prepare the next IPCC assessment report , due out in 2007 .
" The IPCC is the group that should investigate this and work out if people should be scared of it , " says Cohen .
Whatever their verdict , at least we are no longer totally in the dark about global dimming .

Such a correlation does not prove that lead had any effect on crime levels .
But in an article published this month in the B.E. Journal of Economic Analysis and Policy , Reyes uses small variations in the lead content of gasoline from state to state to strengthen her argument .
If other possible sources of crime like beer consumption and unemployment had remained constant , she estimates , the switch to unleaded gas alone would have caused the rate of violent crime to fall by more than half over the 1990s .
If lead poisoning is a factor in the development of criminal behavior , then countries that did n’t switch to unleaded fuel until the 1980s , like Britain and Australia , should soon see a dip in crime as the last lead - damaged children outgrow their most violent years .
According to a comparison of nine countries published this year by Rick Nevin in the journal Environmental Research , crime rates around the world are just starting to respond to the removal of lead from gasoline and paint .
“ It really does sound like a bad science - fiction plot , ” says Nevin , a senior adviser to the National Center for Healthy Housing .
“ The idea that a society could have systematically poisoned its youngest children with the same neurotoxins in two different ways over the same century is almost impossible to believe . ”
The magnitude of these claims has been met with a fair amount of skepticism .
Jeffrey Miron , a Harvard economist , wonders how lead could have had such a strong effect on violent crime while , according to Reyes , it showed almost no effect on property crimes like theft .
He also doubts that the hypothesis could explain the plunge in the U.S. murder rate from the 1930s through the 1950s .
“ I certainly think it ’s a reasonable exercise , ” Miron says .
“ We just have to be appropriately suspicious of how much you can actually show . ”
The theory will be put to the test as children grow up in Indonesia , Venezuela and sub-Saharan Africa , where leaded gasoline has just recently been phased out .
Meanwhile , the list of countries that still use lead in gas — Afghanistan , Serbia and Iraq , as well as much of North Africa and Central Asia — does not rule out a connection with violence .
No matter how suggestive the economists ’ data , it takes a doctor to show that some of the people most damaged by lead are out there breaking the law .
Herbert Needleman , the University of Pittsburgh psychiatrist and pediatrician whose work helped persuade the government to ban lead in the 1970s , recently studied a sample of juvenile delinquents in Pittsburgh ; the group had significantly more lead in their bones than their peers .
And lead may not be the only source of damage .
The National Children ’s Study will soon begin to track more than 100,000 children to determine the effects of exposure to common pesticides , among other chemicals .
( CNN ) --
It 's an illusion , William Gibson says .
A trick .
Fiction is a construct that plays with your mind , creating a world within .
William Gibson 's recent books take place in a murky , techno - infused present .
" A high - res realism , " the author calls it .
" It 's a trick , but I love it . "
That shared illusion of author and reader fascinates him .
" One human being sits down and makes black marks on white paper , and somewhere on the other side of the world someone sits down and interprets black marks on white paper .
...
It 's an amazing thing , " he says in a phone interview .
" It 's like the movies without the projector .
It 's like the movies without the screen .
And it 's kind of immortal in some weird way .
You can sit down and get the ... experience direct from Charles Dickens . "
* * * * *
Like Dickens , Gibson is an author - magician in the world - creating business .
He first gained renown for " Neuromancer " in which he coined the word " cyberspace , " later with " Mona Lisa Overdrive , " " All Tomorrow 's Parties " and " Pattern Recognition . "
His latest is " Spook Country " ( Putnam ) .
" Spook Country " primarily revolves around three characters : Hollis Henry , a journalist and former member of a cult rock band ; Tito , a Chinese - Cuban tech specialist who becomes involved with a small family of smugglers ; and Milgrim , a junkie translator working for alleged government agent Brown .
The three characters ' stories converge in the pursuit of a mysterious shipping container .
Gibson is big on technological and pop cultural details , and he drops them into " Spook Country " like silicon chips into a murky stream .
Hollis tries on a virtual - reality helmet that shows the death scenes of notables .
IPods carry encrypted knowledge .
Milgrim is hooked on a drug called Rize , usually -- if not readily -- supplied by Brown .
Hubertus Bigend , the tycoon from " Pattern Recognition , " is back , offering rides in Volkswagen Phaetons and sleep on maglev beds .
It 's all shadowy , conspiratorial , Thomas Pynchonesque .
The Los Angeles Times compared Hollis to Pynchon 's Oedipa Maas , from " The Crying of Lot 49 " ; the Guardian offers the same assessment .
Gibson says he does n't mind .
" I had a decade or more of being called Chandleresque , " he says , referring to hard - boiled detective writer Raymond .
" I think I prefer Pynchonesque any day . "
* * * * *
Gibson 's subject matter has often involved technology and its impact on humans .
Inevitably , humanity gets lost in technology -- or perhaps it 's the other way around .
He notes that it 's always been so .
Television changed us ; so did radio before that , and the telegraph before that , and transportation improvements and agriculture and running water .
" What we call technology in our science is almost always emergent technology .
...
They do n't mean the technology we 've had for 50 years , which has already changed us more than we 're capable of knowing , " he says .
" When I say technology , I 'm sort of thinking of the whole anthill we 've been heaping up since we came out of the caves , really .
" So we 're living on top of a quite randomly constructed heap of technologies that were once new , and that now we do n't even think of as technology , " he continues .
" People think technology is something we bring home in a box from some kind of future shop . "
* * * * *
He calls himself a technology " agnostic . "
Whatever the innovation , it 's generally morally neutral , he says , " until we do something with [ it ] . "
Sometimes , that human action ends up changing -- or at least amplifying -- his own opinions .
" I do n't write books to express any political philosophy I might have .
Partly , I write them to discover what I do think about things .
... I do n't want people to believe what I believe , but I love it if I 'm encouraging people to ask questions and find their own answers . "

Who is William Gibson ?
He was born in coastal South Carolina , according to the bio page on his Web site .
His father was in construction and moved the family from suburb to suburb .
He died when Gibson was 6 ; his mother took William back to her small hometown in Virginia .
She died suddenly when he was 18 .
Gibson evaded the draft , relocated to Toronto , Ontario , and later moved to Vancouver , British Columbia , where he lives today .
He started writing in the late ' 70s and has n't stopped .
Neither have the misconceptions .
" Google me and you can learn that I do it all on a manual typewriter , something that has n't been true since 1985 , " he writes .
" I did avoid the Internet , but only until the advent of the Web turned it into such a magnificent opportunity to waste time that I could no longer resist . "
He loves his fans , but he keeps his distance .
" I do have an e-mail address , yes , but , no , I wo n't give it to you .
I am one and you are many , and even if you are , say , 27 in grand global total , that 's still too many .
Because I need to have a life and waste time and write . "
He takes neither himself nor his celebrity seriously .
He sees no need to tinker with the voluminous Wikipedia pages devoted to his work .
" I think of Oscar Wilde 's remark that cats and mirrors are both inherently unhealthy to spend too much time with .
I would include one 's Wikipedia entry and one 's most rabid fans [ in that ] , " he says .
* * * * *
Gibson recently gave a reading in Second Life , uniting emergent technology with old - fashioned storytelling .
" That was very strange , " he says .
Because of limits with Second Life servers , his immediate audience was limited to 50 people .
Audience members ' avatars flew around the room .
Questions came in via instant messaging .
But Gibson , in the end , was unfazed .
" I think what struck me most about it was how normal it felt .
I was expecting it to be memorably weird , and it was n't , " he says .
" It was just another way of doing a reading . "
* * * * *
" Pattern Recognition " and " Spook Country " are set in the present .
Gibson 's previous books were set in the future .
But they 're all about today , of course ; the best science fiction usually is .
He does n't mind watching reality outstrip his futures .
" When I watch my work sort of travel down the timeline of the real future , I just see it acquiring that beautiful , absolutely standard patina of wacky quaintness that any imaginary future will always acquire , " he says .
" That 's where your flying car and your food pills all live -- and all the other stuff they promised our parents , " he chuckles .
Gibson speaks with a voice of wonder , as if he 's continually surprised at what emerges from his brain -- and , for that matter , the raw material with which the world supplies him .
" I 've been writing stuff set in the 21st century since 1981 .
Now that I 've actually arrived into the 21st century the hard way , the real 21st century is so much wackier and more perverse than anything I 've been able to make up .
I wake up in the morning , look at the newsfeed on my computer and away I go . "
In the case of " Spook Country , " he even surprised himself .
Gibson admits he had no idea what was in the container until he was well into the novel .
He made lists ; he played with ideas .
In the end , he says , " I feel like I found the punch line . "
The reader in him was pleased by the trick .
" It came as kind of a surprise for me and I actually enjoyed it , " he says .
" I usually do n't enjoy writing the ending of a book as much as I enjoyed writing the end of this one . "

WASHINGTON , Oct. 18 - The special counsel in the C.I.A. leak case has told associates he has no plans to issue a final report about the results of the investigation , heightening the expectation that he intends to bring indictments , lawyers in the case and law enforcement officials said yesterday .
The prosecutor , Patrick J. Fitzgerald , is not expected to take any action in the case this week , government officials said .
A spokesman for Mr. Fitzgerald , Randall Samborn , declined to comment .
A final report had long been considered an option for Mr. Fitzgerald if he decided not to accuse anyone of wrongdoing , although Justice Department officials have been dubious about his legal authority to issue such a report .
By signaling that he had no plans to issue the grand jury 's findings in such detail , Mr. Fitzgerald appeared to narrow his options either to indictments or closing his investigation with no public disclosure of his findings , a choice that would set off a political firestorm .
Ott — a tool for writing definitions of programming languages and calculi .
Ott is a tool for writing definitions of programming languages and calculi .
It takes as input a definition of a language syntax and semantics , in a concise and readable ASCII notation that is close to what one would write in informal mathematics .
It generates LaTeX to build a typeset version of the definition , and Coq , HOL , and Isabelle versions of the definition .
Additionally , it can be run as a filter , taking a LaTeX / Coq / Isabelle / HOL source file with embedded ( symbolic ) terms of the defined language , parsing them and replacing them by target - system terms .
For a simple example , here is an Ott source file for an untyped call - by - value lambda calculus ( test10.ott ) , and the generated LaTeX ( compiled to pdf ) and ( compiled to ps ) , Coq , Isabelle , and HOL definitions .
Most simply , the tool can be used to aid completely informal LaTeX mathematics .
Here it permits the definition , and terms within proofs and exposition , to be written in a clear , editable , ASCII notation , without LaTeX noise .
It generates good - quality typeset output .
By parsing ( and so sort - checking ) this input , it quickly catches a range of simple errors , e.g. inconsistent use of judgement forms or metavariable naming conventions .
That same input can be used to generate formal definitions , for Coq , HOL , and Isabelle .
It should thereby enable a smooth transition between use of informal and formal mathematics .
Additionally , the tool can automatically generate definitions of functions for free variables , single and multiple substitutions , subgrammar checks ( e.g. for value subgrammars ) , and binding auxiliary functions .
( At present only a fully concrete representation of binding is supported , without quotienting by alpha equivalence . )
The distribution includes several examples , in varying levels of completeness : untyped and simply typed lambda - calculus , a calculus with ML polymorphism , the POPLmark Fsub with and without records , an ML module system taken from ( Leroy , JFP 1996 ) and equipped with an operational semantics , and LJ , a lightweight Java fragment .

Anti-War Protest Group Fined $ 10,000
Nathan Burchfiel - Staff Writer
( CNSNews.com ) –
The anti-war activist group Act Now to Stop War and End Racism ( ANSWER ) faces a $ 10,000 fine from the city of Washington if it fails to remove thousands of fliers it has posted to advertise a September anti-war march .
“ They have told us that we have 72 hours to remove every poster , or the fines will go into effect , ” the group said in a statement Tuesday .
“ Tens of thousands of dollars in additional fines are expected in the coming days . ”
The group accuses “ Bush ’s Interior Department ” of using “ intimidation tactics to slow our outreach or silence ” the antiwar movement .
“ This is part of a systematic effort to disrupt the organizing for the September 15 Mass March that is timed to coincide with the report of General Patraeus and the debate in Congress on the Iraq War , ” the statement said , referring to a progress report set to be delivered by the commander of the Multi-National Force in Iraq .

A federal prosecutor from Florida was ordered held in custody Monday after he appeared in U.S. District Court in Detroit on a charge that he flew to Detroit intending to have sex with a 5 - year - old girl .
John David R. Atchison , 53 , of Gulf Breeze , Fla. , an assistant U.S. Attorney in Florida 's northern district , is expected to appear again in court for a detention hearing on Tuesday .
According to the complaint , Atchison reassured the sheriff 's deputy who was posing as the child 's mother that he would not hurt the 5 - year - old because he goes " slow and easy , " and " I 've done it plenty . "
This charming fella was arrested over the weekend when he arrived at Detroit Metropolitan Airport after conversing with a sheriff 's deputy posing online as " a mother who was interested in finding someone to have sex with her children .
" Gross .
Given the enormous scandal that erupted over the administration 's insistence that every federal prosecutor 's office be staffed with administration lackeys , it 's probably safe to assume that Atchison is a Republican .
Just saying .

Among the most durable myths of American public life is that conservatives are more authentic in their religious faith than liberals and progressives .
Certainly this arrogant presumption prevails on the religious right , where commentators and politicians routinely denigrate the sincerity of Christians such as Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama , whose irredeemable sin is that they also happen to be Democrats and candidates for president .
With characteristic condescension , an editor of the right - wing Weekly Standard dismissed public expressions of faith from the left as both pointless and worthless .
He declared that the Democrats can only attract Christians who are “ religious in the way that Hillary Clinton is religious , which is to say a very liberal Protestant sort of view , in which they believe in everything but God . ”
That quip is quite mild compared with typical fiery denunciations from the religious right , branding the Clintons as instruments of Satan and Obama as an Islamist in disguise .
Both senators are fully capable of expressing their personal beliefs and defending their theological views whenever that seems appropriate .
Like other presidential candidates on both sides of the partisan aisle , they can offer substantial evidence of their religiosity to churchgoing voters .
Of course , that wo n’t discourage conservative critics from noisily denigrating them ( and all Democrats ) as apostates and heretics .
In these endless squabbles over the faith of politicians , however , it is striking how rarely right - wing officials and preachers find themselves on the defensive about their faith — no matter how hypocritical and even hateful their behavior may be .
These supposed men of God may be adulterers ; they may be crooks and liars ; they may cultivate the wealthy and corrupt while despising the poor and lame ; yet somehow , their adherence to Scripture is n’t subject to doubt .
It is time to stop being so damned polite — and to start asking them a few hard questions .
The lucrative business known as “ Christian broadcasting , ” for instance , is also the source of the most fervent , widely heard attacks on the sinfulness and apostasy of liberals , progressives and Democrats .
Now may be the time to ask :
What exactly is so “ Christian ” about these multimillionaire Republican televangelists , who plainly look upon their flocks as so many fat sheep to be fleeced ?
From the preeminent Pat Robertson of Christian Broadcasting Network to Paul Crouch of Trinity Broadcasting Network to lesser but rising figures such as Rod Parsley and John Hagee , these mountebanks persuade their hopeful viewers to send in checks , frequently promising that the Lord will bring prosperity to the poor and restore health to the ill if only those “ tithes ” are sufficiently generous .
When the expected miracles fail to materialize , say the preachers , it is only because the faithful did n’t believe strongly enough — or did n’t donate enough money .
Contributions are routinely misused to purchase luxury estates , private jets and lavish vacations in Vegas , rather than to propagate the Gospel in Asia or to relieve suffering in Africa , as advertised .
Meanwhile , these fundamentalist shepherds promote hostility toward homosexuals , liberals , feminists and Muslims and toward Christians who do n’t share their dogmas , all in the name of the Prince of Peace .
They steer their followers toward right - wing ideology and Republican candidates , skirting or ignoring the laws that prohibit churches from engaging in partisan politics .
They abhor Social Security , Medicare , national health insurance and every kind of government assistance to families , even while they eagerly cash in on “ faith - based ” federal handouts .
Now presumably the faith healers and prosperity preachers can cite biblical verses to justify their dubious behavior , but it is hard to imagine that any of this is what Jesus would really do .
Too many times in recent years the blustering enforcers of family values and public piety have turned out to be frauds .
The unhappy examples range from Ralph Reed ’s gambling connections and Newt Gingrich ’s infidelities to Ted Haggard ’s secret gay lifestyle .
The latest episode involves Sen. David Vitter ( R - La. ) , another conservative Christian moralist , whose name just turned up in the phone book of the “ D.C. Madam . ”
( He once said that Bill Clinton deserved to be removed from office for his sexual infidelity , but now shows no sign of resigning his own seat . )
When these Christian gentlemen are caught with their pants down or their hands in the cookie jar , they invariably claim that they have repented and prayed for forgiveness .
In a spirit of generosity that they often lack , let us hope that they can cleanse themselves of wrongdoing .
But let us remain skeptical whenever an ostentatiously pious conservative presumes to judge the faith of liberal Christians — including candidates for president .
Joe Conason writes for The New York Observer .
I probably wrote this a couple of years ago when I was studying polymorphic types .
What happens if we have only monomorphic type when we define church numerals ?
Let us represent church numerals by the type ( a -> a ) -> a -> a for some monomorphic a :
> import Prelude hiding ( succ , pred ) > type N a = ( a -> a ) -> a -> a
Zero and successor can still be defined .
Their values do not matter .
> zero :: N a > zero = error " " > succ :: N a -> N a > succ = error " "
Also assume we have pairs predefined :
> pair a b = ( a , b )
We can even define primitive recursion , only that it does not have the desired type :
primrec :: ( N -> b -> b ) -> b -> N -> b
Instead we get the type below :
> primrec :: ( N a -> b -> b ) -> b -> N ( N a , b ) -> b > primrec f c n = > snd ( n ( \z -> pair ( succ ( fst z ) ) > ( f ( fst z ) ( snd z ) ) ) > ( pair zero c ) )
Therefore , predecessor does not get the type pred :: N a -> N a
we want .
Instead we have :
> pred :: N ( N a , N a ) ->
N a > pred = primrec (
m -> n ) zero

Depression can do more physical damage to a person 's health than several long - term diseases , according to a study .
Saba Moussavi of the World Health Organisation led the largest population - based study on the physical effects of several illnesses by analysing data from more than 245,000 people in 60 countries .
His results , published today in the Lancet , showed that depression had more impact on sufferers than angina , arthritis , asthma , and diabetes .
" On the basis of our results , addressing the further exacerbation of disability due to depression needs to be a priority of health systems worldwide , " wrote Dr Moussavi .
" Primary care providers must be taught not to ignore the presence of depression when patients present with a chronic physical condition . "
He said that this would only be achieved by reducing the stigma around mental illness and alerting doctors and the public at large that depression was a disease at least on a par with physical chronic diseases in damaging health .
Depression was the fourth leading cause of " disease burden " in 2000 , a measure of the number of years of full health lost due to an illness .
Projections by scientists at the Harvard School of public health suggest that , by 2020 , depression will rise to become second only to heart disease in terms of disease burden .
On a scale of 0 to 100 , with 0 indicating worst health and 100 indicating best health , sufferers of depression had an average score of 72.9 in Dr Moussavi 's study .
This compared with 80.3 for asthmatics , 79.6 for angina sufferers , 79.3 for arthritis sufferers and 78.9 for those with diabetes .
" Our main findings show that depression impairs health state to a substantially greater degree than the other diseases , " Dr Moussavi said .
In addition , suffering from depression along with another chronic disease produced significantly worse health than having one or more of the chronic diseases alone .
" The need for timely diagnosis and treatment of depressive disorders to reduce the burden on public health is imperative , " wrote Dr Moussavi .
" In many primary care settings patients presenting with multiple disorders that include depression often do n't get diagnosed , and if they do often treatment is focused towards the other chronic diseases . "
In an accompanying article in the Lancet , Gavin Andrews , of the University of New South Wales , said : " In Australia less than 30 % of patients receive good treatment with antidepressants , cognitive behavioural therapy , and proactive maintenance care .
By contrast , 80 % of patients with arthritis and 90 % of patients with asthma receive an acceptable standard of care . "
Dr Moussavi said mental disorders often came hand - in - hand with other chronic illnesses and would become more common as the world 's population lived longer .

Two black women who worked as security supervisors at Madison Square Garden are set to hit their former employer with a discrimination lawsuit , claiming they were denied advancement while young white interns who slept with management quickly rose to the top .
“ It ’s definitely a boys ’ club there , ” charged Diane Henson , 50 , who said she worked at the Garden for 11 years only to get pushed out this summer once she complained about the unfair treatment of blacks , and women in particular .
Henson and a second woman participating in the lawsuit – who asked that her name be withheld – claim they were forced to resign after their complaints about discrimination were met with retaliation , an atmosphere they blame on Garden boss James Dolan .
When it comes to Dolan , employees are taught to live in fear , the women said .
“ We were told , ‘ Do n’t look at him .
You ’ll get fired , ’ ” Henson said .
Henson and her former co-worker described the discrimination they endured in an interview with The Post just days after a Manhattan federal jury awarded former Knicks executive Anucha Browne Sanders a stunning $ 11.6 million for sexual harassment and retaliation by the Garden organization and Dolan .
Another former Garden employee , Ranger City Skaters captain Courtney Prince , is also pushing forward with a sexual - harassment suit .
Henson said that during her first nine years at the Garden , she received regular raises and promotions .
But when the new vice president of event operations , Kirk Randazzo , took charge in 2005 , the writing was on the wall , she said .
“ I did n’t seem to get the same opportunities everyone else got , ” Henson said .
“ It ’s because we ’re women and we ’re black , ” said the second woman , who is in her 50s and who worked at the Garden for five years until she quit last month .
Both women said they were relegated to posts in the nose - bleed sections of the Garden and areas with high rates of security problems , while their white – and in some cases less experienced – counterparts got plum positions in high - visibility sections where celebrities sit .
The women ’s repeated requests for promotions were denied .
Meanwhile two female interns , who were white and in their 20s , had “ open affairs with managers ” and were quickly promoted , Henson said .
Soon , the two women ’s bosses were writing them up for every minor infraction – ranging from tardiness to singing on the job , they said .
MSG officials declined comment on the charges , saying they were unaware of a possible lawsuit .

Three teenage girls from Paterson have been arrested on arson charges after they allegedly set minor fires at their high school , apparently to protest longer class periods , police said today .
The three students at John F. Kennedy High School - who are 15 and 16 years old - were taken into custody on Monday , Paterson police spokesman Lt. Anthony Traina said tonight .
The girls are accused of placing burning toilet paper on fire alarms and pulling the alarms at about 10 a.m.
Monday , setting off the alarms and causing fellow students to be evacuated , Traina said .
Their fellow students were returned to classes shortly afterward , but the girls were arrested .
They were also charged with causing a public alarm , and taken to the Passaic County Juvenile Detention Center in Haledon .
Their names were withheld by police because of their ages .
Police suspect the motive for the fires was unhappiness over longer class periods , which have been lengthened from 45 to 90 minutes , Traina said .

It 's a classic tale of failure and redemption , the kind of story Hollywood loves to tell .
Fresh off his second successful movie , an up - and - coming director takes a chance on a dark tale of a 21st - century cop who hunts humanlike androids .
But he runs over budget , and the financiers take control , forcing him to add a ham - fisted voice - over and an absurdly cheery ending .
The public does n't buy it .
The director 's masterpiece plays to near - empty theaters , ultimately retreating to the art - house circuit as a cult oddity .
That 's where we left Ridley Scott 's future - noir epic in 1982 .
But a funny thing happened over the next 25 years .
Blade Runner 's audience quietly multiplied .
An accidental public showing of a rough - cut work print created surprise demand for a re-release , so in 1992 Scott issued his director 's cut .
He silenced the narration , axed the ending , and added a twist — a dream sequence suggesting that Rick Deckard , the film 's protagonist , is an android , just like those he was hired to dispatch .
But the director did n't stop there .
As the millennium turned , he continued polishing : erasing stray f/x wires , trimming shots originally extended to accommodate the voice - over , even rebuilding a scene in which the stunt double was obvious .
Now he 's ready to release Blade Runner : The Final Cut , which will hit theaters in Los Angeles and New York in October , with a DVD to follow in December .
At age 69 , Ridley Scott is finally satisfied with his most challenging film .
He 's still turning out movies at a furious pace — American Gangster , with Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe , is due in November — building on an extraordinary oeuvre that includes Alien , Thelma & Louise , Gladiator , and Black Hawk Down .
But he seems ready to accept Blade Runner as his crowning achievement .
In his northern English accent , he describes its genesis and lasting influence .
And , inevitably , he returns to the darkness that pervades his view of the future — the shadows that shield Deckard from a reality that may be too disturbing to face .
__ Neil Gaiman__
Novelist " Kurt Vonnegut believed that what science fiction and pornography have in common is that they 're both visions of impossibly hospitable worlds .
But what Blade Runner did was create a dystopic , inhospitable world .
It 's dark and it 's grungy and you would n't want to live there — but you 'd love to go there .
" Wired :
You started working on this movie more than 25 years ago .
How does it feel to be talking about it again ?
Scott :
It never went away , so I 'm used to it .
It kept reemerging , and that 's when I realized that it had really unusual staying power .
It 's all very well to say , " Well , I knew it had . "
But I did n't , really , at the time .
I knew I 'd done a pretty interesting movie , but it was so unusual that the majority of people were taken aback .
They simply did n't get it .
Or , I think , better to say that they were enormously distracted by the environment .
Wired :
What do you mean by that ?
__Scott :__I was touching on possibilities like replication .
It 's now quite commonplace , but 25 years ago they were barely discussing it in the corridors of power .
Now , the film is not really about that at all , it 's simply leveraging that possibility into one of those detective film - noir kinds of stories .
People were familiar with that kind of character , but not with the world I was cooking up .
I wanted to call it San Angeles , and somebody said , " I do n't get it . "
I said , " You know , San Francisco and Los Angeles . "
It 's bizarre : People only think about what 's under their noses until it comes and kicks them in the ass .
Wired :
How did you decide to tell a 21st - century story in a 1940s style ?
__Scott :__Well , people want a comfortable preconception about what they 're seeing .
It 's a bit like 20 years of Westerns and , now , 45 years of cop movies .
People are comfortable with the roles .
Even though every nook and cranny has been explored , they 'll still sit through endless variations on cops and bad guys , right ?
In this instance , I was doing a cop and a different bad guy .
And to justify the creation of the bad guy , i.e. , replication , it had to be in the future .
__Zack Snyder __
Director " I first saw Blade Runner when I was 16 .
It rocked my world .
All those incredible images were burned into my psyche .
It 's one of those movies you can't help but quote , an involuntary reference source that will be recycled throughout cinema forever .
It 's like a lesson from the master saying , ' Go out into the world and do good . '
__Scott : __It 's the same as trying to do a monster movie .
You know , Alien is a C film elevated to an A film , honestly , by a great monster .
In this instance , my special effect was the world .
That 's why I put together people like [ industrial designer ]
Syd Mead who were actually serious futurists .
The big test is saying , Draw me a car in 30 years ' time , without it looking like bad science fiction .
Or , Draw me an electric iron that will be pressing shirts in 20 years without it looking silly .
I wanted the world to be futuristic and yet feel — not familiar , because it wo n't be — but feel authentic .
One of the hardest sets to design was the kitchen .
It 's easy to fantasize about Tyrell 's giant neo -Egyptianesque boardroom , but imagining a bathroom and kitchen in those times , that 's tricky .
Nevertheless , fascinating .
I love the problem .
Wired : Dream kitchens aside , it 's a rather bleak vision of the future .
__Scott :__I was always aware that this whole Earth is on overload .
I 've been that way for 30 years .
People used to think I was — you know , not exactly depressive , but dark .
And I 'd say , " It 's not dark , mate , it 's a fact .
It 's going to come and hit you on the head . "
Wired :
You made a director 's cut in 1992 .
Why was n't that the final word ?
Scott :
The director 's cut removed the voice - over and that silly ending and put in the unicorn daydream , but the disc did n't look that great .
And it should look great , because Blade Runner at the time was pretty formidable — it 's pretty formidable even now , actually .
A lot of people do n't notice whether they 're watching something beautifully technical or not , but it 's important to me .
So that always got in the way of the director 's cut being the final version .
I think it 's final now because I 've done all the nips and tucks and tidied up one or two of the visual areas that we could n't do properly at the time because we did n't have the technology .
Raymond Kelly
New York City Police Commissioner
" Though it was set in LA in 2019 , Blade Runner resonated with many people who , in 1982 , foresaw an irreversible downward spiral for American cities .
Police and other government agencies were behind the curve .
Large corporations had the technological edge .
In that respect , the film was prescient . "
Wired :
Did you reinstate any material you had previously cut ?
__Scott :__I tried , because 25 years later you think , " Let me look at those scenes that were removed . "
But there was a good reason those scenes were n't in the film .
What 's great about the upcoming five - disc set is that it covers every piece of ground , from the original version to this final cut to a whole disc of discussions between all the people who helped make the movie .
Wired : Would you describe some of those deleted scenes ?
__Scott :
__In the opening scene , there 's a guy who 's interviewing one of the replicants , and he gets shot .
Deckard goes to see him in the hospital , where the character explains who these replicants are and where they 're coming from .
But , in a way , it repeated the meeting between Deckard and his boss at the police station .
It was a bit of overexplaining , although it was fascinating to see the hospital room and the breathing machine they 'd put him in because he'd taken it through one of his lungs .
Also , there was a bit more sexuality between Rachael and Deckard .
It got a bit rough , and I needed Deckard to be sympathetic .
Harrison Ford was playing a character opposite to what people expected from him .
Also , the hero , or antihero , finally gets his butt kicked by the so - called bad guy — who turns out not to be a bad guy .
That 's what 's interesting about the movie , right ?
Otherwise it's all down to bad guys and good guys , which is really boring .
Wired : Some of that ambiguity got squeezed out of the original version .
It seems like you 've been making up for it ever since .
__Scott :__I read an article recently saying that one of the reasons the film has found an ongoing audience is that it was incomplete .
That 's absolute horseshit .
The film was very specifically designed and is totally complete .
In those days , there was more discussion than was welcome , as far as I 'm concerned .
[ Screenwriter ] Hampton Fancher , [ producer ]
Michael Deeley , and I talked and talked and talked — every day for eight months .
But at the end of the day , there 's a lot of me in this script .
That 's what happens , because that 's the kind of director I am .
The single hardest thing is getting the bloody thing on paper .
Once you 've got it on paper , the doing is relatively straightforward .
J. Craig Venter
__Geneticist __
" The movie has an underlying assumption that I just do n't relate to : that people want a slave class .
As I imagine the potential of engineering the human genome , I think , would n't it be nice if we could have 10 times the cognitive capabilities we do have ?
But people ask me whether I could engineer a stupid person to work as a servant .
I 've gotten letters from guys in prison asking me to engineer women they could keep in their cell .
I do n't see us , as a society , doing that . "
Wired :
It was never on paper that Deckard is a replicant .
__Scott : __It was , actually .
That 's the whole point of Gaff , the guy who makes origami and leaves little matchstick figures around .
He does n't like Deckard , and we do n't really know why .
If you take for granted for a moment that , let 's say , Deckard is a Nexus 7 , he probably has an unknown life span and therefore is starting to get awfully human .
Gaff , at the very end , leaves an origami , which is a piece of silver paper you might find in a cigarette packet , and it's a unicorn .
Now , the unicorn in Deckard 's daydream tells me that Deckard would n't normally talk about such a thing to anyone .
If Gaff knew about that , it 's Gaff 's message to say , " I 've read your file , mate . "
That relates to Deckard 's first speech to Rachael when he says , " That 's not your imagination , that 's Tyrell 's niece 's daydream . "
And he describes a little spider on a bush outside the window .
The spider is an implanted piece of imagination .
And therefore Deckard , too , has imagination and even history implanted in his head .
Wired :
You shot the unicorn dream sequence as part of the original production .
Why did n't you include it in either the work print or the initial release ?
__Scott : __As I said , there was too much discussion in the room .
I wanted it .
They did n't want it .
I said , " Well , it 's a fundamental part of the story . "
And they said , " Well , is n't it obvious that he 's a replicant ? "
And I said , " No more obvious than that he 's not a replicant at the end . "
So , it 's a matter of choice , is n't it ?
Wired :
When Deckard picks up the origami unicorn at the end of the movie , the look on his face says to me , " Oh , so Gaff was here , and he let Rachael live . "
It does n't say , " Oh my God !
Am I a replicant , too ? "
__Scott:__No ?
Why is he nodding when he looks at this silver unicorn ?
I 'm not going to send up a balloon .
Doing the job he does , reading the files he reads on other replicants , Deckard may have wondered at one point , " Am I human or am I a replicant ? "
That 's in his innermost thoughts .
I 'm just giving you the fully fleshed - out possibility to justify that look at the end , where he kind of glints and looks angry .
To me , it 's an affirmation .
He nods , he agrees .
" Ah hah !
Gaff was here .
I 've been told . "
Wired : Harrison Ford is on record saying Deckard is not a replicant .
__Scott :__Yeah , but that was , like , 20 years ago .
He 's given up now .
He said , " OK , mate .
You win !
Anything !
Just put it to rest . "
Wired : You 've called Blade Runner your most complete and personal film .
How so ?
__Scott : __I just finished American Gangster .
It 's about two real guys who are still alive , so you want to make it absolutely accurate .
It 's not a documentary , but it feels awfully real .
For Black Hawk Down , I went to the location and shot it .
Legend was more imaginative , but it borrowed from Jean Cocteau 's Beauty and the Beast and the best of Disney .
Blade Runner involved full - bore imagination .
Deckard 's universe had to be expanded into credibility .
That 's probably the hardest thing I 've done , because there was nothing to borrow from .
Wired : Did you draw on specific personal experiences ?
__Scott :__I went to art school in west Hartlepool in the north of England , alongside the Durham steel mills and the Imperial Chemical Industries plant .
The air smelled like toast .
Toast is quite nice , but when you realize it 's steel , and it 's probably particles , it 's not very good .
Crossing the footbridge at night , you'd be walking above the steel mill , crossing through the smoke , dirt , and crap , looking down into the fire .
Later , I spent a little time in New York , which always seemed to be a city on overload , and Hong Kong at the time it was wonderfully medieval — pre-skyscraper , when the harbor was filled with junks .
When it came to deciding whether to go Hispanic or Asian for what seems to be the majority culture on the streets in San Angeles , I opted for Asian .
And I felt I knew what it would be like to ride in a spinner .
In the years when I was doing a lot of TV commercials , once a month I 'd fly into New York .
I 'd get off the plane at JFK and take a helicopter , which cost $ 20 , to the top of the Pan American building .
Winter or summer , high wind or balmy evening — it was hairy .
I did that for almost two years .
Then , one stormy winter evening , a chopper nearly missed the top of the building because of the wind gusts .
It perched perilously on the edge , and they nearly lost it .
And that was the end of that .
There were no more helicopters ; they just closed them down .
But I always remembered that .
Thom Mayne
Architect "
Blade Runner anticipated the conception of the metropolis that we have now , as a global phenomenon .
It 's so thorough in this depiction that it 's incredibly useful to anyone making environments .
It reminded architects to think about the physical environment in cultural terms , as something ephemeral and chaotic .
Twenty - five years later , it 's still contemporary . "
Wired :
Is it true that you did n't read Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep ? , the book on which Blade Runner was based , before making the movie ?
__Scott :__I honestly could n't get into it .
It 's so dense , by page 32 there 's about 17 story lines .
So one of the problems is distilling it down into a three - act play that can be filmed .
Fancher did that with a script he called Dangerous Days .
Deeley came to see me when I was mixing Alien and said , " Do you want to do another science fiction ? "
I said , " I do n't really want to go down that route if I can avoid it . "
But , to cut a long story short , eight months later , the script stayed with me .
So I went back to Deeley saying , " You know , we can expand this into something more spectacular if we push it outside onto the street and create a futuristic urban universe . "
I could never shake loose the fact that I was a designer — which I 'm constantly criticized for , and I really do n't give a shit .
At the end of the day , it has proved to be quite useful .
In fact , I 've been painting again seriously for a while now .
My favorite painter is George Stubbs , an 18th - century artist , one of the great ones .
The target is to paint like him .
I 'm getting there .
Wired :
Part of your work in making the new version was eliminating visible wires .
Given your legendary attention to detail , how did flaws like that get into the original print ?
__Scott : __Because you can't make a spinner fly without a crank .
That 's why it was raining in the shot , to hide the cables .
Today we assume it 's all digital .
It 's not — it 's a 2 - ton spinner being hoisted around the corner by a large crank that literally brought it down , landed it , and took it off again .
Bloody good crane driver , right ?
You have four points on the cable that keep it steady .
When I watched the movie , I always used to sit there staring at the cables .
Then eventually one or two of the geeks spotted them .
So we took them out .
Ray Kurzweil
Futurist " The scenario of humans hunting cyborgs does n't wash because those entities wo n't be separate .
Today , we treat Parkinson 's with a pea-sized brain implant .
Increase that device 's capability by a billion and decrease its size by a hundred thousand , and you get some idea of what will be feasible in 25 years .
It wo n't be , ' OK , cyborgs on the left , humans on the right . '
The two will be all mixed up . "
Wired :
Some might say that scrubbing out those wires was defacing a masterpiece .
__Scott :__I was tempted not to , because I thought it was quite charming that there were cables in the shot .
And when Roy Batty came out of the phone booth , for some bizarre reason we never noticed that somebody 's thumb was in the bottom left - hand corner .
The phone booth had an automatic door and I could n't de-automate it , and I was getting really beaten up ' cause we were up against the gun , so I just shot .
And there was the bloody thumb in the frame .
It 's little mistakes like that that you 're tempted to leave in .
It 's a signature that says , yes , it is fiction , it is moviemaking .
Mamoru Oshii
Anime Director
" Twenty - five years ago , I was becoming dissatisfied with Japanese animation 's focus on characters and stories at the expense of environments .
Suddenly , the world I vaguely imagined appeared in front of me .
I felt overwhelmed — but at the same time I realized that what I was attempting was not wrong at all . "
Wired : Today it would all be done with computers .
Scott :
Oh yeah , you would n't even think about it .
Wired :
And there would be no thumb on the door .
Scott :
Oh , it 's become too easy .
Wired :
Do you prefer physical effects to digital effects ?
__Scott :__Not necessarily .
I mean , otherwise I 'll sound like an old fart .
When you see an explosion that no one could have survived and the person is still running , then it 's bullshit .
And that 's frequently why digital effects are not as good .
Whereas when you do it physically , you 've got to be careful — like , really careful .
With digital , the painting book is unlimited ; the world in , say , Lord of the Rings would not have been nearly as impressive 30 years ago as it is today .
Star Wars was the beginning of some interesting digital thinking .
[ Stanley ]
Kubrick really showed the way with 2001 , where Douglas Trumbull did some very simple computer - driven shots .
That was the first of the really great science fiction films , where I went , " Wow , that works . "
Everything up to that one was a bit too much fantasy and not enough reality .
There are films where digital effects are massive overkill — and that 's OK , because there are audiences that want that .
But I still have to have the story .
So the digital is not the end , it 's the means to the end .
Moby
Musician
" The contrast makes it : a relentlessly gritty film with this ethereal music on top of it .
Without the music , the movie would have been good .
But with the music , it was close to perfect . "
Wired : Blade Runner was prescient in many ways , anticipating globalization , genetic engineering , biometric security .
How do you gauge the movie 's influence ?
Scott : Enormous .
One of the top architects in the world told me he used to run it in his office once a month .
Architecture would have been my game if I had n't done movies .
Frequently an architect will design a building and then walk , and not care about what 's put inside it , which is a pity .
If I were an architect I 'd say , you know , " You ca n't have that chair . "
And I think of Charles Knode 's wardrobe , which people do n't talk about often enough .
Usually you get bad futuristic suits , right ?
Deckard 's was very well done .
And Rachael 's clothes were stunning .
I think there was a lot of influence from the film in that direction .
And interiors , definitely .
A big clothing designer sent me pictures of the interior of his place , and the factories looked like Blade Runner .
Hotels in New York started to look like the movie .
Wired :
What have you learned about Blade Runner — the story , the characters , the ideas — that you did n't know when the production began ?
__Scott :__I always knew everything !
I knew all the characters .
Of course , I got more experience as a filmmaker .
But the more experience you get , the less you know — because the more you know , the more you know can go wrong .
It can make you insecure .
But I do n't worry much about that .

Feature Explore Cultural Influences Before and After the Film in the Blade Runner Nexus Full Transcript and Audio of Wired 's Interview with Ridley Scott
Since the beginning of Sonyâ€™s now - fading dominance of the video game industry more than a decade ago , third - party publishers have consistently treated Nintendo consoles as Hyrulians do the scorching sands of the Gerudo Desert .
They avoid them altogether .
This unfortunate trend began with the Nintendo 64 , when a series of controversial decisions made by Nintendo prompted many developers to shift support to competing consoles .
For the first time since the emergence of the home console business , a Nintendo platform was not the dominate one , and the inevitable exodus of third - parties led to devastating consequences for Nintendo .
Most consequential were the increasingly frequent software droughts that left Nintendo fans and their three - pronged Nintendo 64 controllers idle , parched by excruciating voids of quality software .
This would have been difficult enough , but the migration of hit titles away from the Nintendo 64 made a bad situation only more difficult for Nintendo supporters .
Square had originally planned its epic Final Fantasy VII – widely considered one of the finest games ever made – for the Nintendo 64 , but moved it to Sonyâ€™s new PlayStation before development began .
Prominent companies such as Konami and Capcom also dramatically scaled back support for the Nintendo 64 , shifting the bulk of their support to Sony and leaving Nintendo alone to support its console , a pattern which would continue on the GameCube despite Nintendoâ €™s best efforts .
But with Wii , things were supposed to be different .
Consumers were promised , due to the affordability of Wii software development and the unique options for interface and control encouraged by the hardware , that third - parties would provide substantially more software for Nintendo fans .
Certainly , it could be argued that the promise of â€œmoreâ€ has been kept .
More than 20 games launched with the Wii in North America , and only three of them were developed by Nintendo .
Almost a year later , third - parties are still churning out Wii games at a surprising rate , and many companies have created dedicated teams specifically for Wii software development .
While third - parties have been successful in getting more of their games on the shelf , however , they have failed to get those games into the hands of Nintendo fans .
The recently released Madden NFL 2008 exemplifies this phenomenon .
The multi-platform football game , published by third - party behemoth Electronic Arts , sold a staggering 896,600 copies on the Xbox 360 in August , according to NPD sales data .
The PlayStation 2 version sold 643,600 copies in the same month , and even the struggling PlayStation 3 managed a respectable 336,200 units sold .
The Wii version sold little more than 100,000 copies .
Third - party difficulties on Wii are perhaps even more clearly illustrated in examination of the consoleâ€™s best - selling software .
According to VGChartz.com , a Web site dedicated to tracking video game sales figures , eight Wii titles have sold more than one million copies worldwide to date .
Only two , Ubisoftâ€™s Rayman Raving Rabbids and Red Steel , were developed by a company other than Nintendo .
Speculation varies on the reasons behind third - party sales difficulties on Wii , but many share a bold theory : their games simply arenâ€™t worth buying .
In an interview with Newsweekâ€™s Nâ€ ™Gai Croal in March , Nintendo development guru Shigeru Miyamoto expressed concerns that third - party developers are not committing their best efforts to software intended for Nintendo systems .
When questioned about third - party struggles on Wii , Miyamoto said â€œ … a lot of times , it seems that when ( third - parties ) are putting games out on Nintendo hardware , those games are being developed by their third - string team or their fourth - string team.â€ 
â€ œBut when Nintendo puts out a title , â€ continued Miyamoto , â€ œthat title is always developed by one of our number one teams.â€ 
Though Miyamoto garnered some criticism for his comments , he pointed out a simple truth : Nintendo puts its best teams behind first - party Wii software .
Most Nintendo games on Wii – think Legend of Zelda : Twilight Princess , Metroid Prime 3 : Corruption and Super Paper Mario – emphasize his point .
These titles have achieved not only universal critical acclaim , but healthy sales figures and overwhelmingly positive reception from Wii owners .
Finding a third - party Wii game of comparable quality , polish and customer satisfaction can be a daunting task .
According to many third - parties , however , their development efforts are not to blame for their low sales on Wii .
Rather , the problem lies with the Nintendo audience .
Interview snippets and developer commentaries occasionally reveal that third - parties feel slighted by Nintendo supporters , and interestingly , journalists often sympathize , effectively portraying third - parties as the â€œvictim , â€ a label they so frequently pine for .
Kevin Cassidy , founder of the popular Nintendo news blog GoNintendo.com , claimed in March that â€œwhen it comes to third - party games , Nintendo fans are almost impossible to pleaseâ€  and that they â€œturn their backsâ€ on third - party software .
Two months prior to the release of the Wii , Game Informerâ€™s Billy Berghammer justified third - partiesâ€™ avoidance of Nintendo platforms , claiming â€ œthe industry ( has ) witnessed Nintendo fans only really purchasing Nintendo titles.â€ 
Researchers also place blame on Nintendo fans .
In April , an analyst with Kaufman Bros .
Equity Research suggested that Nintendoâ €™s expansion of the video game market in recent years has actually had a negative effect on third - parties , suggesting that Nintendo is â€œleaving the publishers with a smaller slice of an only somewhat incrementally larger pieâ€  and keeping them â€œin a permanent catch - up mode.â€ 
There are two distinct sides to this debate : the third - party developers who feel their work is unfairly ignored , and the Nintendo audience who feels their work deserves the cold - shoulder .
While both sides offer reasonable arguments , a simple truth can be uncovered in honest analysis of third - party Wii software and its sales :
Most third - parties simply are not â€œgettingâ€  what the console is about , and on the rare occasion that they do , Nintendo fans are not embracing those titles as they should .
One issue most Nintendo supporters and game critics seem to agree on is that Ubisoft deserves the distinction of the number - one offender of awful Wii games .
Since their much - hyped Red Steel succeeded in becoming one of the most disappointing games of the last decade , Ubisoft has continued releasing forgettable software on Wii .
They plastered a Teen - rated facade over the conclusion of their Prince of Persia trilogy , The Two Thrones , and tacked - on motion controls for their renamed port , Rival Swords .
Instead of correcting its missteps , Ubisoft continued to pollute the Wii with â€œshovel - wareâ€ like Driver : Parallel Lines and the abysmal Far Cry Vengeance .
If Ubisoft deserves commendation for anything it has done on Wii , it is the consistency with which it disappoints .
While it seems like Electronic Arts has at least put some creative effort into their Wii software , as evident in games like Boogie and their Madden titles , their games have failed to entice the majority of Wii owners .
Boogie , in particular , fell victim to extremely harsh reviews – Jenn Frank of 1up.com called it a â€œjack - of - all - trades , master - of - none moment of fluffâ€  that is â€œfun for exactly 20 minutesâ€ – and disappointing sales .
Things havenâ€™t faired well for Eidos on Wii , either .
Cheat Code Central claimed their universally - maligned Escape From Bug Island â€œset a new low point for …video games , â€ and their shooter Bionicle Heroes was also a critical and sales bomb .
And what of Activision ?
Hudson ?
Sega ?
None of these companies have been able to captivate the Wii audience as a whole , and the majority of their software has been poorly received by critics and gamers alike .
While perceptions of video games are subjective , it is difficult to argue that the aforementioned third - party titles have not deserved the negative reception they have received .
These games are nothing more than generic attempts to profit from the fastest growing gaming audience in the business , and they contradict the very spirit with which Nintendo envisioned its industry - wide â€œrevolution.â€ 
For their refusal to buy these games , Nintendo fans can hardly be faulted .
While breezing past these games in GameStop or Wal - Mart , however , an enormous segment of Wii owners is simultaneously committing an absolute crime : it is also ignoring some of the most innovative software on the market , developed with care and imagination comparable to that of even the best first - party Nintendo efforts .
With the release of the charming Elebits , Konami created a fresh gameplay experience that delivered on the revolutionary premise of Wii .
In addition to its addictive gameplay , frantic multiplayer mode and stylized visuals , Elebits was also a success from a technical standpoint ; it was the first Wii game to utilize WiiConnect 24 online functionality .
Elebits allows players to edit their own levels with remarkable detail and take screenshots in - game , both of which can be traded with friends online .
The game has sold only 220,000 copies worldwide to date , and there have been other third - party gems on Wii that have not sold as well as they perhaps should have .
While swallowed by the immense hype surrounding Wii Sports and Legend of Zelda : Twilight Princess during the Wii launch , most gamers wrote off Trauma Center : Second Opinion , a reinvention of Atlusâ€™ dramatic â€œsurgery simâ€ for the Nintendo DS , as a quick port .
What these gamers missed out on , however , was one of the best launch titles for the system .
Almost a year later , Trauma Center remains one of the finest examples of the smooth , precise control and inventive ideas afforded by Wii .
Clearly , not all third - party games have been stinkers .
So why have so many Nintendo fans passed on them , ignoring even the good ones ?
The Wii software line - up for Q4 2007 is almost flawless , featuring some of the most highly - anticipated games in years .
Hundreds of thousands of Wii owners are collectively holding their breath for Super Mario Galaxy and Super Smash Bros .
Brawl , two games set to redefine and perfect their respective franchises .
Though their audiences are smaller in size , games like Battalion Wars II and Donkey Kong Barrel Blast will almost certainly captivate Nintendo fans and achieve impressive sales .
Yet in the midst of their excitement , will Wii owners notice Capcomâ€™s new Resident Evil shooter , Umbrella Chronicles , or its addictive adventure game , Zack & Wiki ?
On their way to the store to pick up their long - reserved copy of Super Mario Galaxy , will they stop at a demo of Activisonâ€™s Guitar Hero III on Wii or perhaps purchase EA ’s 32 - person online multiplayer title , Medal of Honor : Heroes 2 ?
And as Smash Bros. mania sends countless Nintendo characters to the recovery room , will the gamers who sent them there stop by the emergency room for Atlusâ€™ brand new Trauma Center : New Blood ?
And when will other third - parties finally bring their â€ œA - gameâ€ to Wii projects ?
Blame can be unfairly placed on both developers and gamers .
Certainly , most of the software released by third - parties on Wii hasnâ€™t been worth the plastic it is made of , let alone 49.99 US dollars .
But when more than 10 million people around the world own a Wii , it is a shame that only two third - party games – neither of which are as captivating or innovative as other third - party gems – have sold more than a million copies .
Reaching a conclusive end to this debate may prove impossible , and ultimately , any conclusion would be irrelevant .
If Wii owners and developers hope to see the promise of Wii fulfilled , a reality in which both parties would certainly reap benefits , changes are necessary within both .
Instead of playing the victim , third - parties should take note of why Metroid and Zelda achieve such high praise and sales figures .
They should decipher what exactly makes Nintendo fans drool before accusing them of ignoring their products , or at the very least , give their Wii development teams some talent and budget to work with .
And as wild as the idea seems , Nintendo fans would certainly benefit from buying games that donâ€™t feature Mario on the cover once in a while .
For gamers and developers alike , a little effort would go a long way .

The city of San Fernando City Council passed an impeachment resolution for President Bush with a unanimous vote on August 20 , 2007 .
San Fernando
Valley became the 87th city or township in the nation to pass a resolution calling for the impeachment of President Bush .
The city of San Fernando became the second city in Los Angeles County , West Hollywood being the first , to adopt an impeachment resolution .
At the Monday night San Fernando Valley City Council meeting eleven members of the LANIC - SFV group presented to the City Council evidence of impeachable offenses committed by President Bush .
The Los Angeles National Impeachment Center “ “ SFV Chapter is actively working with the Studio City Council to pass an impeachment resolution .
After the Council had heard the impeachable offenses committed by President Bush , Councilman Jose Hernandez , whom was the first elected officials to speak quipped , “ Why stop at Bush ?
We should impeach Congress too . ”
Mayor Julie Ruelas piped up , “ What about Cheney ? ” Councilman Steve Veres said the Iraqi war hits home in San Fernando because the first casualty of the war was a San Fernando High School graduate .
Veres said the public comment was , “ Right On . ”
The city of San Fernando City Council plans on delivering the city ’s impeachment resolution to Congressman Brad Sherman . … ( Read more )
It was early afternoon and still uncomfortably hot when the convoy rolled up , sirens wailing , outside the town hall .
Machine - gun toting Palestinian policemen in blue mottled camouflage gear surrounded a white four - wheel drive as the VIP stepped out , his familiar features creased into a broad grin of welcome for the waiting dignitaries .
" Welcome to Hebron , Mr Blair , " declared the mayor , Khaled Osaily , before they disappeared into the sand - coloured building , screened by security men as headscarved schoolgirls giggled their way past Ramadan fairy lights .
The Israeli army jeeps that escorted the visitor in had hung back discreetly for the final stretch .
Large parts of the West Bank's " city of the patriarchs " were ceded to Palestinian control a decade ago when Yasser Arafat was enjoying the mixed blessings of the Oslo self - rule agreement - which left 400 hardline , armed Jewish settlers in Hebron 's ancient centre .
Mr Blair , the representative of the Quartet group of Middle East peacemakers , heard a good deal about their violent provocations .
" Our briefing on the problems caused by the settlers was not brief , " Mr Osaily quipped afterwards .
" Mr Blair was appalled by what we told him , " said Mats Lignell , spokesman for the international observers stationed here " temporarily " in 1994 after a Jewish extremist from the nearby settlement of Kiryat Arba massacred 29 Palestinians praying in the Ibrahimi Mosque .
Wednesday 's visit provided a rare glimpse of the former prime minister as he goes about what some have called his " mission impossible " .
It might also be described as a mission invisible - his profile so uncharacteristically low he has all but disappeared , apart from a couple of bland interviews with Palestinian and Israeli media .
Khaled Amayreh , a Palestinian journalist sympathetic to the Islamist movement Hamas , is unlikely to be granted one .
" I wanted to ask Mr Blair what future Muslim generations will think of him after what he did in Iraq , " he fumed in vain outside the town hall .
" I wanted to ask if he believes economic prosperity will bribe Palestinians to give up Jerusalem and their right of return . "
Despite his low profile , Mr Blair has had to learn fast since starting work in July .
The outward silence shrouds a learning curve that has been steep and shocking since the envoy began work in July .
Angry
" Blair was really astonished and angry , " says the UN official who gave him a presentation on the devastating effects of Israel 's " security barrier " , settlements , checkpoints , and closures on the lives of Palestinians in the occupied territories .
" He asked very smart questions , though I did think that someone who was prime minister for so long should already have known these facts . "
Unlike his many British , western and Arab critics , the Palestinian government at least seems pleased that Mr Blair is on the case .
He told Mahmoud Abbas , the president , that he faced opposition because he was too close to the Americans and Israelis .
" That 's the point in having you here , " Abbas replied .
Ordinary people are largely indifferent .
Mr Blair 's pitch is that it is vital to quickly build up the capacity of the Palestinians to run their state , and boost an economy hobbled by Israeli restrictions - however difficult the political track of the peace process and whatever the outcome of the Annapolis conference Condoleezza Rice , the US secretary of state , is convening next month .
He is being careful to stick to his Quartet mandate of economic development and governance - leaving the core political issues such as settlements , Jerusalem and final borders to Ms Rice , who he believes is committed to working intensively for a peace deal .
" Condi 's got religion , " he has told friends .
Unsurprisingly , he sees himself as a big player , impatient with lawyerly arguments about the small print and diplomatic turf wars .
" We cannot separate the politics and security issues , which interact and overlap , " he said in an interview with the Palestinian newspaper Al - Quds on his third visit this week .
" Blair can certainly do something useful if someone else is trying to push the political agenda forward , " says Ghassan Khatib , a former Palestinian minister .
" Economics and security are the two things that will make or break any Palestinian government .
These are the only possible areas for progress - apart from the politics . "
With memories of Downing Street fading , Mr Blair now spends about a week a month working from East Jerusalem 's lovely old American Colony hotel .
Its whitewashed walls are covered with sepia - tinted pictures of the British general Sir Edmund Allenby , who defeated the Turks in Palestine 90 years ago - months after the Balfour Declaration promising a " national home " for the Jewish people set in train the events that created today 's conflict .
Instead of policemen there are blue - uniformed UN guards at the door - and a steel grille .
Visitors to his offices sit on a spacious roof terrace screened from view by newly - planted olive and fir saplings .
A running machine has been brought in to ensure the boss can keep fit in days packed with meetings .
The sofas are ornate , gilded and appropriately Ottoman - looking .
Secrets , though , may be hard to keep : the evening Mr Blair arrived I spotted Ehud Barak , the Israeli defence minister , slipping quietly out of the back door .
Palestinian journalists were intrigued to see allies of the popular jailed Fatah leader Marwan Barghouti leaving after talks .
Policy advice comes from a 14 - strong multinational team .
A US state department official , a Spaniard loaned from the European commission , a Dutch economist and a Norwegian work alongside UN experts and a couple of FO Brits .
The British embassy organised the first visit , but now the mission is self - supporting .
" He works as much for the Poles as for us , " sniffed a UK diplomat .
Projected first - year costs for the Jerusalem office , staff and security ( including armoured cars ) are around $ 8 m ( £ 3.9 m ) , and met from a UN - administered trust fund .
Attention is focused on plans for a detailed Palestinian " national economic and development agenda " to be presented to an international donor conference in December .
The " ownership " will be Palestinian but Mr Blair is driving it .
" He knows he has to produce some quick results , " says an official .
" He does n't have long to make an impact . "
Japanese investment
Work is being done on linking up several existing projects .
The headline concept , dear to the heart of the Israeli president , Shimon Peres , is a " secure economic zone " for the Jericho area , where there is already a Japanese - financed plan for an agribusiness park and improved export access across the ( Israeli - controlled )
Allenby bridge to Jordan , en route for Gulf markets .
Jericho is easy because it is small and quiet and there is no Israeli security presence in town .
The downside , says Mr Khatib , is that it is simply too small to make a difference .
Salam Fayyad , the Palestinian economist appointed prime minister after the Hamas takeover of Gaza in June , had been keen to see an ambitious initiative in Nablus , the West Bank 's commercial capital and largest city .
But Mr Blair 's view is that is too tough a nut to crack : the city is surrounded by Israeli checkpoints and there are regular raids by the Israeli army and Shin Bet security service .
His conclusion reflects intensive talks with the key Israeli players : Ehud Olmert , the prime minister ; Mr Barak , and the army chief of staff .
He has also met Olmert 's coalition partner , the far - right Yisrael Beitenu leader Avigdor Lieberman , who opposes any concessions , wants to remove Israel 's Arab citizens - and is threatening to bring the government down .
In the words of Zahi Khouri , one of several Palestinian businessmen advising Mr Blair : " He 's trying to find ways to revitalise the Palestinian economy while being sensitive to the Israeli paranoia about security . "
That apparently also means not tackling the West Bank barrier either - at least for now .
Many Palestinians say they are not remotely surprised .
" Why should Blair suddenly become bold when he was so timid when he was in power ? " asks Salim Tamari , a professor at Bir Zeit university near Ramallah .
The Blair team is also pushing plans - training , financing , restructuring - to ensure the ramshackle Palestinian security forces operate more effectively .
Legal and judicial reforms are needed too .
The theory is that more professional troops and police will be able to tackle militant groups such as the al - Aqsa Martyrs Brigades .
That done , Israel could allow goods to move freely , creating jobs , attracting investment and loosening the stranglehold of occupation .
In practice , the key question is whether Mr Barak , more hawkish than Mr Olmert , will deliver the goods that were denied to Jim Wolfensohn , Mr Blair 's predecessor as the Quartet envoy , who failed because Israel would never respect the key agreement on " movement and access " negotiated by Ms Rice .
Personal chemistry
Mr Barak and Mr Blair get on well , but personal chemistry is not enough .
" If the Israelis wo n't even move one roadblock near Nablus what hope is there that they will give us East Jerusalem and 90 % of the West Bank ? " shrugs a leading Abbas aide .
Crucially , Mr Blair is keeping away from the Gaza Strip , which is under international boycott and cut off from the West Bank since Hamas took over .
He has said privately that Israel and the Palestinian Authority will eventually have to talk to the Islamists .
The hope is that success in the West Bank will demonstrate the achievements of the moderates and weaken Hamas - ignoring evidence , from Iraq and elsewhere , that sanctions and collective punishment do not work .
The obvious danger is that an already disastrous humanitarian situation in Gaza will continue to deteriorate ( with Qassam rockets inviting Israeli retaliation at any moment ) ; that Mr Abbas and Mr Fayyad will not have enough to show for their efforts ; and that the Annapolis conference will crash in flames .
It does not seem too gloomy to predict that Mr Blair 's low - profile Middle Eastern honeymoon may not have much longer to run .
" It 's difficult for him to present a detailed plan because that 's the point both sides will start pelting him with rotten eggs and tomatoes since neither will like what he 's suggesting , " says a senior Israeli official .
" He 's in a terrific position as long as he 's just working quietly , consulting and listening .
The moment he puts something on the table is the moment his problems begin . "
Rocky road to Annapolis
Annapolis , Maryland , home to the US naval academy , will be the scene of a closely watched Middle Eastern event hosted by Condoleezza Rice next month .
Beyond those facts , no one knows what to expect from what has been called both a " meeting " and a " conference " on the search for peace between Israelis and Palestinians .
No invitations have yet been sent , though negotiating teams from both sides have been trying to agree on a " declaration of principles " that would probably gloss over the " final status " issues of borders , Jerusalem and refugees .
Saudi Arabia says it will not attend if it is going to be just another photo opportunity .
Syria is unlikely to be there because there will be no talks about the Golan Heights .
Hamas has warned it is a trap .
And while it is not clear what will constitute success , failure could have grave consequences .
The second intifada broke out after the collapse of the Camp David talks Bill Clinton convened in 2000 .
Saeb Erekat , the veteran Palestinian negotiator , said this week : " If Mr Olmert and Mr Abbas reach agreement on the end - game they 'll be the most important people in this holy land since Jesus . "
Ian Black
Some of the planned sites , like the Sixth & I Historic Synagogue , a cultural center in Washington , would have been host of an event if Mr. Mearsheimer and Mr. Walt appeared with opponents , said Esther Foer , the executive director .
Mr. Walt said , “ Part of the game is to portray us as so extreme that we have to be balanced by someone from the ‘ other side . ’ ” Besides , he added , when you ’re promoting a book , you want to present your ideas without appearing with someone who is trying to discredit you .
As for City University , Aoibheann Sweeney , director of the Center for the Humanities , said , “ I looked at the introduction , and I did n’t feel that the book was saying things differently enough ” from the original article .
Ms. Sweeney , who said she had consulted with others at City University , acknowledged that they had begun planning for an event in September moderated by J. J. Goldberg , the editor of The Forward , a leading American Jewish weekly , but once he chose not to participate , she decided to pass .
Mr. Goldberg , who was traveling in Israel , said in a telephone interview that “ there should be more of an open debate . ”
But appearing alone with the authors would have given the impression that The Forward was presenting the event and thereby endorsing the book , he said , and he did not want to do that .
A discussion with other speakers of differing views would have been different , he added .
“ I do n’t think the book is very good , ” said Mr. Goldberg , who said he read a copy of the manuscript about six weeks ago .
“ They have n’t really done original research .
They have n’t talked to the people who are being lobbied or those doing the lobbying . ”
Overall Mr. Mearsheimer said he thinks the response to their views will be “ less ferocious than last time , because it ’s becoming increasingly difficult to make the argument in a convincing way that anyone who criticizes the lobby or Israel is an anti-Semite or a self - hating Jew . ” Both Mr. Mearsheimer and Mr. Walt pointed to the growing dissatisfaction with the war in Iraq , criticism of Israel ’s war in Lebanon and the publication of former President Jimmy Carter ’s book “ Palestine : Peace Not Apartheid ” as making it somewhat easier to criticize Israel openly .
“ This is n’t a cabal ; this is n’t anything secretive , ” Mr. Walt said .
American Jews who lobby on Israel ’s behalf are not all that different from the National Rifle Association , the anti-tax movement , AARP or the American Petroleum Institute , he said , “ They just happen to be really good at it . ”
“ It ’s the way American politics work , ” he continued .
“ Sometimes powerful interest groups get what they want , and it ’s not good for the country as a whole .
I would say that about the farm lobby and about the Cuba lobby . ”

Both Apple and Microsoft have revealed possible future directions their respective music players by filing for patents that will allow the devices to share music wirelessly , but in different ways .
The two patents disclose plans from both companies that will bring different wireless sharing capabilities to both the iPod / iPhone and the Zune .
Paid squirting
On the Microsoft side , the patent takes the Zune 's currently - limited music - sharing capabilities a step further and offers more options to Zune users looking to participate in " the social . "
Microsoft is taking the commerce - driven approach to music sharing with this patent , believing that there is an entire " offline economy " that could benefit both the copyright holder and the user when Zune users squirt music to one another .
Under the system described by the patent , users would be able to essentially purchase copies of songs off of other users without the involvement of a Microsoft media server at all .
The original sharer 's device would store the purchase information until the next time he or she syncs up with a computer , for example , and proceeds from the sale would go to both the copyright holder , with a ( presumably small ) cut the person who squirted the music .
This would offer a huge incentive for Zune users to start walking around , squirting music to everybody in sight .
And according to the patent , the sale system would even " work " in the case of sharing pirated music , which would allow the copyright owner to still recoup the costs of his or her music being shared .
Music labels should n't worry just yet , though , as the patent describes at least one implementation that would involve the attachment of an advertisement to the pirated content .
How the device will be able to tell the difference between truly pirated content and files ripped from the user 's home collection of CDs , however , is very unclear .
Such a system looking that carefully into the content on the device could also raise privacy concerns .
The iPod goes wireless
Apple 's patent describes a wireless sharing system oddly similar to that already built into the Zune .
Under the patent , a device with wireless capabilities , such as the iPhone or future iterations of the iPod , would be able to wirelessly detect similar devices on the same network .
These similar devices do not have to be other iPods , either , as Apple specifies that it could be a media player , PDA , or some other type of wireless device .
The users would be able to share various types of data , which naturally includes music and other media files , but also entire albums , photos , computer games , audio / video presentations , news reports , and more .
The media could be transferred to the second device either by full transfer ( making a copy of the file on the new device ) or by streaming .
Apple 's patent also addresses part of the system that would allow the user to purchase media from a server directly from the device .
The user could either purchase something on the spot or mark it for purchase later ( like when he or she gets home to sync with a computer , for example ) .
It could even involve a " shopping list , " which would function as a sort of wish list that can be synced with multiple devices and computers .
For those of us who have been looking forward to buying directly from iTunes on our iPods or iPhones , the patent sounds very promising .
Apple 's patent is a curious one , as it seems to directly overlap some of the Zune 's functionality .
Apple 's patent cites several other patents ranging from media sharing to wireless communications to media players , with application dates falling as early as 2003 .
Companies are obligated to search for prior art before filing patent applications , and so this could be a case where Apple 's patent differs enough from Microsoft 's that there is no technical overlap .
Another possibility is that a patent examiner will determine that Apple 's filing is too similar to Microsoft 's and therefore will have to pay to license the content from Microsoft , like it does with Creative over the iPod UI .
Similarly , under the first - to - invent system used in US patent filings , Apple may be end up controlling the IP used in the Zune .
Possible patent fights aside , both companies seem to acknowledge that sales of their respective devices ( and the music that goes on them ) will benefit from much more wireless sharing than either currently provide .
And despite Steve Jobs ' comments late last year dissing the Zune 's wireless sharing technologies —
" It takes forever .
By the time you 've gone through all that , the girl 's got up and left !
You 're much better off to take one of your earbuds out and put it in her ear .
Then you 're connected with about two feet of headphone cable , " he told Newsweek — Apple apparently believes that tethered sharing will be going the way of the dodo someday .
The June fundraising reports paint a desperate picture for the Republican Party 's committees , falling increasingly behind their Democratic counterparts in the money race .
In the House , the Rep. Chris Van Hollen 's DCCC simply crushed his Republican counterpart .
( In millions )
DCCC NRCC June 2007 10.4 5.9
All 2007 36.4 29.5
Cash on Hand 19.5 2.0
Debts 4.1 4.35
That 's not a typo .
The NRCC has effectively a negative $ 2.35 million account balance including debts , compared to the DCCC 's positive $ 14.4 million .
And unlike House Republicans , who have bailed on their party , House Democrats are contributing lavishly in order to extend their advantages next year .
Charles B. Rangel of New York , chairman of the tax - writing Ways and Means Committee , transferred $ 250,000 last month from his campaign account to the DCCC , bringing his total contributions to the committees this year to $ 485,000 .
James E. Clyburn of South Carolina , who ranks third in the Democratic hierarchy as majority whip , transferred $ 200,000 , bringing his year - to - date contributions to the DCCC to $ 585,000 .
Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California also transferred $ 200,000 to the DCCC last month ; her campaign committee has sent the committee $ 385,000 so far this year .
So two quarters and change into the 2008 cycle , our House committee already has a nearly $ 17 million advantage on the GOP , and its fundraising pace and advantage has increased over the year as well .
The more Republican donors see 2008 as a lost cause ( and for a party that has depended on mountains of cash to win elections , these numbers are a serious hit ) , the less they are likely to ante up .
Democratic donors , on the other hand , appear increasingly motivated .
A total of 57 individuals gave $ 28,500 to the DCCC last month , the maximum annual individual contribution allowed by law .
Just three individuals donated the maximum $ 28,500 to the NRCC in June .
In the Senate , the NRSC is in the same bind as their House colleagues .
DSCC NRSC June 2007 8.6 3.4
All 2007 31.3 15.8
Cash on Hand 20.4 5.8
Debts 4.5 0
Sen .
John Ensign , who is making Liddy Dole 's disastrous reign as head of the NRSC look good in comparison , is sounding the alarm ( subscription only ) :
National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman John Ensign ( Nev. ) said last week he will spend the next two weeks holding individual meetings with his GOP Senate colleagues to personally press them to raise and contribute more to the party ’s 2008 effort [...]
Last month , the NRSC received nothing in transfers from Senators ’ campaign committees .
GOP Senators chipped in $ 55,000 in June from their leadership political action committees , and only one Member wrote a personal check to the committee — $ 28,500 from Sen. Elizabeth Dole ( N.C. ) .
According to figures compiled by Democrats , the NRSC collected $ 292,500 in contributions from GOP Senators through the end of May .
By contrast , the DSCC took in $ 820,000 from Senators through May , and committee officials estimate that the number topped $ 1 million by the end of June [...]
Ensign set an ambitious goal to raise $ 119 million over the next two years , the same amount collected in the 2006 cycle by his counterpart , DSCC Chairman Charles Schumer ( N.Y . ) .
He has said he hopes $ 30 million of that will come from Senator giving and fundraising .
But so far , meeting that mark has proved daunting , as the NRSC trailed the DSCC in overall fundraising by a nearly 2 - 1 margin in the first six months of the cycle .
Over that period , the DSCC raised $ 31.2 million compared to the $ 15.7 million collected by the NRSC .
The NRSC also is trailing where it was financially at this point in the previous cycle , when some in the party were critical of Dole , then head of the NRSC , for lagging behind the Democrats ’ money pace .
Through the first six months of 2005 , the NRSC had raised $ 20.9 million and showed $ 8 million in the bank at the end of June .
Even that last bright spot for Republican committees , the RNC , is seeing its huge traditional advantages shrink .
DNC RNC June 2007 4.2 6.6
All 2007 28.8 46.4
Cash on Hand 4.7 15.9
Debts 2.0 0
This , however , represents a serious narrowing of the gap by the Democrats compared to just two years ago , when the parties geared up for the competitive and consequential 2006 midterm elections .
At the end of June 2005 , the RNC had raised $ 62 million and the DNC had raised $ 31.3 million .
Making matters worse for congressional Republicans , the RNC , which was able to focus on House and Senate races in 2006 , will be refocused on its usual mission in 2008 -- the White House .
So while the RNC was able to make up some of the 2006 shortfall experienced by their Senate committee , and the smaller than usual advantage by their House committee ( " only " a $ 40 million advantage ) , they can't be expected to make up this year 's dramatic shortfalls while still focusing on winning the presidency .
Meanwhile , Democratic presidential candidates are showing that their own fundraising negates the necessity for leaning on the DNC .
Republicans built their majorities , in large part , on their traditionally massive cash advantages .
Those are now gone .
And given their deficits on the issues and with Mr. 25 % wrapped around their necks , their prospects for 2008 look even dimmer than usual .
Then again , before anyone rest easy , Democrats won big in 2006 despite a GOP advantage of $ 107 million .
Money is n't everything .
There is perhaps nothing else so distinctive of the condition and character of a people as the method in which they treat their dead .
- William Tegg , 1876
Throughout the history of human civilization , different cultures mourn and treat the dead differently .
Some , like Tibetan Buddhists , have no use for burials as they dispose the dead by feeding corpses to vultures or by burning them in funeral pyres .
Most cultures , however , show their respect by burying the dead , sometimes in complex and ornate tombs , crypts , and catacombs .
This article takes a look at ten of the most fascinating final resting places around the world , from the largest prehistoric burial mound in Europe to the the tombs of pharaohs to the most beautiful mausoleum in the world :
Newgrange
The burial mound of Newgrange in County Meath , Ireland is definitely one of the most impressive prehistoric monuments in the world .
Build between 3300 BC - 2900 BC , it is the also the world 's oldest surviving building ( it 's older than Stonehenge and the Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt ) .
Newgrange is impressive : the circular mound is 250 feet ( 76 m ) across and 40 feet ( 12 m ) high .
It covers an entire acre ( 4046 m² ) .
A long tunnel under the mound leads to a high - domed burial chamber , a corbelled vault with ceilings made of huge , interlocking stone slabs .
The entrance to Newgrange is marked with a huge curbstone that is elaborately carved with " megalithic art , " which includes spiral and concentric arc motifs chipped into the stone with flint tools .

Tana Toraja
The Toraja people in Sulawesi , Indonesia , have what is probably the most complex funeral ritual in the world .
When someone dies , the funeral is attended by a lot of people and can last for days !
But that 's not the strange part - this is : the funeral ceremony is often held weeks , months , or even years after the death ( to give the family of the deceased time to raise enough money for expenses ) .
Torajans can wait that long because they believe that death is not a sudden event but instead a gradual process towards the afterlife ( if you 're wondering about the smell - the dead body is embalmed within the first few days of death , then stored in a secret place until the funeral ceremony ) .
After much partying ( including the slaughter of one or several water buffaloes ) , the dead is buried in a stone cave carved out of a rocky cliff .
A wood - carved effigy called tau tau , carved with the likeness of the dead person is then placed in the balcony of the tomb to represent the dead and watch over their remains .

" In Tana Toraja , everything revolves around death .
The graves can be very sophisticated yet sometimes , long after the coffins are destroyed by time , people gently place bones along natural cave ' racks ' .
Often , the bones are offered cigarettes or various offerings .
This is supposed to prevent dead ancestors from bringing bad luck and otherwise making the lives of the living miserable . "

Westminster Abbey
The gothic church Westminster Abbey in London , United Kingdom was established by Benedictine monks in the tenth century ( and rebuilt in the 13th century by King Henry III ) - since then it has evolved into both the coronation church for English royalty and the final resting place of monarchs .
Though at first Westminster Abbey was the burial place of kings , aristocrats , and monks , it soon became the tomb - of - choice ( if there is such a thing ) for the who's who in England .
Poets and writers like Geoffrey Chaucer , Charles Dickens , Thomas Hardy , Rudyard Kipling , and Alfred Tennyson ; as well as scientists like Sir Isaac Newton , Charles Darwin , and Ernest Rutherford were all interred there .

Giza Necropolis
There are more than 100 pyramids in Egypt , with the largest and most famous being the complex of pyramids in Giza Necropolis , Cairo , Egypt .
This complex consists of the Great Pyramid of Giza ( tomb of the Egyptian pharaoh Khufu or Cheops ) , the Pyramid of Khafre , the Pyramid of Menkaure , the Great Sphinx statue , as well as several other smaller satellite pyramids .
Let 's take , for instance , the Great Pyramid of Giza , the only surviving member of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World .
When it was completed in 2560 BC , the pyramid was 481 feet ( 147 m ) tall with each base side being 758 feet ( 231 m ) wide .
The blocks weigh about 1.5 tons each , with the internal granite blocks used as the roof of the burial chamber being about 80 tons each .
The ancient Egyptians knew what they were doing : the base sides have a mean margin of error of only 2 1/3 inch ( 58 mm ) !
Needless to say , it is an amazing work of engineering .

Valley of the Kings
Even if you do n't know much about the Valley of the Kings , a burial ground of ancient Egyptian pharaohs and one of the most famous archaeological sites in the world , chances are you know about one of its occupants : King Tut and the Curse of the Pharaohs that accompany his grave .
In 1922 , Egyptologist Howard Carter discovered and opened the tomb of Tutankhamen - despite warnings that " Death shall come on swift wings to him who disturbs the peace of the King . "
Lord Carnarvon , the funder of the expedition , was the first to die : he was bitten by a mosquito and later accidentally lashed the bite while shaving .
His wound became infected and he died of blood poisoning .
Whether the " mysterious " deaths associated with the Curse of the Pharaoh actually had anything to do with opening of the tombs or just great copy to sell newspaper , scientists did recently discover that the tombs indeed contained potentially dangerous molds , bacteria , toxins , and even hazardous gases .

Catacombs of Paris
Officially called les carrières de Paris or " the quarries of Paris , " the Catacombs of Paris is a network of underground tunnels and rooms that used to be Roman - era limestone quarries .
In the late 1700s , Paris was suffering from diseases caused by improper burials and mass graves in church cemeteries .
Local authorities decided that they would remove thousands of bones and place them stacked in the abandoned underground quarries .
Today , the entrance to the catacombs is restricted and only a small portion of the 186 miles ( 300 km ) worth of underground tunnels is accessible to the public .
Secret entrances to the Catacombs , however , dotted Paris - urban explorers have found access via sewers , manholes and even the Paris Metro subway system .

Terracota Army
In 1974 , local farmers in Xi'an , China , discovered a vast underground complex of mausoleum while drilling for water .
They had serendipitously stumbled upon the burial ground of Qin Shi Huangdi , the First Emperor and the unifier of China .
According to legends , the First Emperor was buried alongside great treasures inside a tomb with pearl - laced ceilings ( in a pattern that represented the cosmos ) and channels dug in the ground with flowing mercury to represent the rivers of China .
But the most famous feature of the tomb is the Terracota Army , about 8,000 life - like and life - sized statues of soldiers buried alongside Qin Shi Huangdi to help the Emperor rule in the afterlife .

Capuchin Catacombs of Palermo
When the Capuchin monastery in Palermo , Italy , outgrew its original cemetery in the 16th century , monks excavated the catacomb below it and began a bizarre tradition that lasted until the 19th century .
The Capuchin monks mummified the bodies of the dead , dressed them up in everyday clothing and then put them on display on the monastery walls .
Apparently , it was quite a status symbol to be entombed in the Capuchin monastery - prominent citizens of the town would ask to be preserved in certain clothing or even have the clothes changed on a regular basis according to contemporary fashion !
When the last body was interred in the late 1800s , there were 8,000 mummies on the walls of the Capuchin monastery and in the catacombs .

Sedlec Ossuary
The Sedlec Ossuary resides in a small Roman Catholic chapel in Sedlec , Czech Republic .
If you did n't know any better , you would n't have guessed that inside the unassuming building is an ossuary containing about 40,000 human skeletons artistically arranged to form decorations , chandeliers , and furnishings !
In the 13th century , an abbot returned to Sedlec with a small amount of earth from Golgotha , the site of Jesus ' crucifixion , and sprinkled it all over the abbey 's cemetery .
This made the grounds of the church a desirable burial site and over centuries thousands of people were buried there .
In 1870 , František Rint , a woodcarver was hired to put the heaps of bones in order .
He decided to make a work of art out of the skeletal remains : a chandelier made from skull and bones , a coat of arms of the family that paid him to do the work , and even an " artist 's signature " done in bone , of course !
Little would you suspect what lies inside ...

Taj Mahal
No article on tombs is complete without the Taj Mahal , a magnificent mausoleum in Agra , India .
The Taj Mahal was built in 1631 by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan , who was devastated when his wife Mumtaz Mahal died during childbirth .
Grief stricken , he ordered that the most beautiful mausoleum be built .
Taj Mahal is an amazing architectural wonder : the marble tomb in the center of the complex is flanked on four corners by minarets .
The massive central dome , called the onion dome because of its shape , is striking in its symmetrical perfection .
Finials and calligraphy are everywhere .
Inside the Taj Mahal is even more ornate : Precious and semi-precious gemstones are inlaid into the the intricately carved marble panels that serve as walls .
The caskets of Mumtaz and Shah Jahan are decorated with gems and inscribed with calligraphy , reciting the 99 names of God .
The story of the Taj Mahal actually did n't end with the completion of its buildings : shortly after its completion , Shah Jahan fell ill and a power struggle amongst his four sons ensued .
The victor , Aurangzeb , locked the king in the Fort of Agra , where he remained until he died .
Legend has it that he spent the remainder of his life gazing at the Taj Mahal , the tomb of his beloved wife , from the window of his prison .

City of the Dead in Northern Ossetia , Russia
In the remote , rugged Gizel valley of Northern Ossetia , Caucasus , Russia , there is a set of stone buildings that from a distance look like a regular village - but with one important detail : it is not for the living .
A closer look inside the buildings with slanted slate roof reveal something gruesome : mummified bodies dressed in their best clothes and shoes with hair tidily combed .
Local legends have it that in the 18th century , a plague swept through Ossetia .
The clans built quarantine houses for sick family members , who were provided with food , but not freedom to move about , until death claimed their lives .
A slow and painful way to go , indeed .

Kucinich tells debate audience : I saw a UFO Mike Aivaz and Nick Juliano
Published : Wednesday October 31 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This Dennis Kucinich 's presidential campaign is hardly being taken seriously by the major media in this country , and that fact was on full display Tuesday night when NBC's Tim Russert took time from the Democratic candidates ' debate to ask Kucinich 's views on little green men .
Russert asked Kucinich about a recent claim by actress Shirley MacLaine , a longtime friend to the Ohio congressman , that he saw was very moved by an encounter with a UFO many years ago .
Kucinich acknowledged the encounter with a mysterious , hovering , triangular craft , but he left open whether he thought it was carrying space invaders .
" I did , " he said .
" It was an unidentified flying object , OK ?
It 's like , it 's unidentified ; I saw something . "
MacLaine wrote that Kucinich found the experience " extremely moving . "
" The smell of roses drew him out to my balcony where , when he looked up , he saw a gigantic triangular craft , silent , and observing him , " she wrote .
" It hovered , soundless , for 10 minutes or so , and sped away with a speed he could n't comprehend .
He said he felt a connection in his heart and heard directions in his mind . "
At the debate , Kucinich joked that he was planning to move his headquarters to Roswell , New Mexico , the site of a suspected UFO crash .
Kucinich compared himself to former President Jimmy Carter , who also claimed to have seen a UFO , and he joked that there were more people in the US who have had a close encounter with a strange flying object than who approve of President Bush 's performance .
The following video is from MSNBC's DEMOCRATIC DEBATE , broadcast on October 30 , 2007 New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson in a post debate interview with Chris Matthews , Richardson tells Matthews " I do n't believe there are UFOs , but the government has not handled this well over the years .
...
The government would help their case if they just declassified all their papers . "

In other work , Berger examined the 2004 yellow wristband phenomenon .
A research team at Stanford first sold the bands to students living in one dorm .
A week later , researchers began selling the wristbands in a neighboring dorm with a stronger academic focus and a social reputation as a " geek " dorm .
A week after the wristbands were adopted by the " geeks , " there was a 32 % drop in students wearing the bands at the first dorm .
The idea is " that people in the original dorm abandoned the wristband to avoid other students thinking they were similar to the geeks , " Berger says .
In the worst " friendly fire " incident involving British forces in the country , an American F - 15 long - range strike aircraft dropped a single 500lb bomb killing the soldiers from 1st Battalion the Royal Anglian Regiment .
The investigation will need to determine whether the accident was the result of a communications or technical failure , why an American rather than a British plane was involved , and why such a relatively big bomb was dropped close to British positions on the ground .
The soldiers were part of a 60 - man patrol deployed to disrupt Taliban movements north - west of Kajaki , the site of a hydroelectric dam under repair and potentially significant irrigation projects for Helmand province .
At about 6.30 pm local time on Thursday the patrol was attacked by Taliban fighters and came under heavy gunfire from several directions .
In a statement yesterday the Ministry of Defence said : " During the intense engagement that ensued , close air support was called in from two US F - 15 aircraft to repel the enemy .
A single bomb was dropped and it is believed the explosion killed all three soldiers who were declared dead at the scene . "
The next of kin had been informed , the MoD said .
The two injured soldiers , including one critically ill , were evacuated by helicopter to the medical facility at Camp Bastion .
Nine soldiers from the battalion have been killed in southern Afghanistan over the past four months .
The latest friendly fire deaths are thought to be the second incident involving British soldiers being killed by Americans in Afghanistan .
Eight British military personnel have been killed by US fire in Iraq since the start of the war in 2003 .
Yesterday 's incident brings the total number of British troops killed while on operations in Afghanistan since 2001 to 73 .
Fifty have been killed in action .
Lt Colonel Charlie Mayo , the British army spokesman in Helmand , said : " There are a handful of different reasons why this tragic incident has happened and we are not in a position at the moment and I do n't think we will be for some time to find out exactly what has happened . "
The Ministry of Defence was criticised by MPs earlier this year for delays in installing new technology in systems designed to prevent friendly fire .
However , in past friendly fire incidents human error has often been the cause .
The MoD said British troops in Afghanistan had frequently relied on US and British air support to get them out of trouble .
The government made clear it is anxious that the incident did not further exacerbate relations and is stressing there is no assumption that the US is to blame .
It is emphasising that there are parallel investigations : while the US will investigate the role of its pilots , the British will check whether the British soldiers may have given the wrong coordinates .
Des Browne , the defence secretary , said the investigation into the incident would be " thorough " , adding that he would not " indulge in any speculation " about the causes .
He described such incidents as " rare " .
He added : " We go to extraordinary lengths to ensure these things do n't happen but at the end of the day combat environments are very complex environments .
Human error is always a possibility . "
The shadow defence secretary , Liam Fox , said : " It is wrong to jump to any conclusions .
Many issues including combat identification systems will need to be considered in the investigation . "
In Washington , Lt Colonel Todd Vician , a Pentagon spokesman , said : " We express deep condolences to the families and loved ones of the British soldiers who died and we wish those who were injured a full recovery . "
He added : " Close air support in a combat environment is tremendously challenging and our forces train and prepare for operations to eliminate incidents to the greatest extent possible . "
The Pentagon is sensitive about friendly fire incidents , particularly those involving British troops .
It regards US airmen as unfairly stereotyped as trigger - happy .
It is still angry over the leaking earlier this year of a classified video it sent to Britain for the inquest into the death of Lance Corporal Matty Hull , killed by a US air attack in Iraq in 2003 .
Relations between the US and Britain have been strained in recent weeks , with the British criticising US bombing in Afghanistan for alienating the local population after of a rising toll of civilian death .
US officers have been critical of the British performance in southern Iraq .
The Nato - led International Security Assistance Force , Isaf , said it had procedures in place to minimise the risk of friendly fire incidents .
Spokeswoman Lt Col Claudia
Foss said : " Isaf is committed to finding out exactly how this tragedy occurred and how similar incidents can be avoided . "

50 YEARS AFTER THE WORLD'S FIRST MAJOR NUCLEAR ACCIDENT , RADIATION IS STILL LEAKING INTO THE SOUTHERN URALS — AND BEYOND
Browse column CHELYABINSK —
It was just after four o'clock in the afternoon on September 29 , 1957 , when the cooling system failed at the Mayak nuclear complex inside the closed military town of Chelyabinsk - 65 .
Two hundred and fifty cubic meters of volatile liquid uranium waste overheated , then combusted .
The fireball shot a kilometer into the sky , where the toxic clouds caught wind and drifted northeast , slicing at roughly 45 degrees between the two nearest cities , Chelyabinsk in the south and Yekaterinburg in the north .
It was a less lucky wind for the more than 200 villages and settlements under the fallout 's fated path .
According to state maps of what is officially known as the " East Ural Radioactive Trace Zone , " this path stretched 50 km wide and 300 km long .
The blast in Chelyabinsk - 65 , since renamed Ozersk , was one of the twentieth - century 's best - kept secrets .
Its full scope known only to a handful of Soviet officials for more than three decades , it was the first major accident of the atomic age .
Until Chernobyl melted down , it was also the largest .
A quarter of a million people were irradiated in the days following the September 1957 explosion .
Most of them were soon resettled outside the inner trace zone at the state 's expense .
But not all of them .
Fifteen years after the truth about Mayak spilled out , many of those left behind now believe that while the ' 57 blast was an accident , their subsequent suffering was part of large - scale human radiation experiment .
The question hangs over the East Urals Trace Zone like a mist :
Why were some villages evacuated , and others not ?
For those left behind , exposure continues through radioactive isotopes in the soil and water with decay rates measured in millennia , and through fresh leakage of radioactive material from Ozersk .
For their children and grandchildren , the legacy of 1957 was passed on in the womb .
A Geiger counter on a Techa flood plain reading 1.101 megs — or more than 50 times what is considered safe " This is an intergenerational catastrophe , " says Vladimir Chouprov , a nuclear specialist with Greenpeace Russia , which helped organize a demonstration commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Mayak blast last week in Chleyabinsk .
" We are seeing the second and third generations living amid radioactive contamination , both accidental and systemic . "
Compounding the legacy of radiation in some villages , say local activists and victims , is the inadequate response by Mayak and government officials , neither of whom returned phone calls for this article .
After decades of lies and indifference , they say , the lies and indifference continue in new forms .
For the residents of Tatarskaya Korabolka , a dying settlement of 600 , the lies started 50 years ago last Saturday .
The townsfolk were in the fields collecting a bumper harvest when they heard it : a solid , dull boom to the west .
Ground tremors followed , strong enough to crack windows and rattle plates loose from their shelves .
The villagers turned and watched in wonder as a black plume rose high above the cloudless horizon , a dozen kilometers away .
" Around the smoke it was the color of sunsets , " remembers Gulchara Ismagilova , a witness to the blast who was 11 at the time .
Veterans of Stalingrad ordered parents to round up their children and seek shelter .
Russia 's new enemies , they yelled , have brought war to the southern Urals .
Within hours of the distant blast , villagers handling irradiated hay began to fall sick .
Even before police arrived wearing futuristic white suits , locals knew something was terribly , Biblically wrong .
But they had no idea what .
They would only start to put the pieces together after Chernobyl , three decades later .
The Soviet authorities understood immediately the severity and nature of the disaster .
When 300 Korabolka residents out of 5,000 died in the immediate aftermath , the village was slated for complete evacuation by the end of the year .
But the planned evacuation never occurred — at least not completely .
Instead , a strange thing happened .
Its Tatar and Russian halves were handed two separate futures : the ethnic Russian side of the village ( population 2,300 ) was evacuated and razed , while the ethnic Tatar side of the village ( population 2,700 ) was not .
There is no trace left of Russian Karobolka , only a forest visible from the nearby road .

A visual pathway links brain structures active during magnetic compass orientation in migratory birds .
Every year millions of migratory birds fly towards their wintering quarters and come back in next year´s spring to breed .
Behavioral experiments have shown that the Earth´s magnetic field is the main orientation cue on their journeys .
Nevertheless , surprisingly little is known about the neuronal substrates underlying these navigational abilities .
In recent years , it has been suggested that sensing of the magnetic reference direction involves vision and that molecules reacting to the Earth´s magnetic field in the birds ' eye form the molecular basis for a vision - dependent compass mechanism .
Cryptochromes , which fulfill the molecular requirements for sensing the magnetic reference direction , have recently been found in retinal neurons of migratory birds ( Mouritsen et al. , PNAS , 2004 ) .
Furthermore , studies investigating what parts of a migratory bird´s brain are active when the birds use their magnetic compass showed that the cryptochrome - containing neurons in the eye and a forebrain region ( “ Cluster N ” ; Mouritsen et al. , PNAS , 2005 ; Liedvogel et al. , EJN , 2007 ) are highly active during processing of magnetic compass information in migratory birds .
Sensory systems process their particular stimuli along specific brain circuits .
Thus , the identification of what sensory system is active during magnetic compass orientation , provides a way to recognize the sensory quality utilized during that specific behavior .
In the current study the research group from Oldenburg , Germany and their collaborators traced the neurons from the eye and from Cluster N . The results “ link ” the recent findings by demonstrating a functional neuronal connection between the retinal neurons and Cluster N via the visual thalamus .
Thus , the only two parts of the central nervous system shown to be highly active during magnetic compass orientation are linked to each other by a well - known visual brain circuit , namely by parts of the so - called thalamofugal pathway .
For the first time , clear neuroanatomical data suggest which specific brain pathway processes magnetic compass information in migratory birds .
These findings strongly support the hypothesis that migratory birds use their visual system to perceive the reference compass direction of the geomagnetic field and that migratory birds are thus likely to " see " the geomagnetic field .

Ohio Republicans have blocked a proposal to test electronic voting machines prior to the 2008 presidential primary .
By a 4 - 3 vote , Republicans on Ohio's State Controlling Board blocked Democratic Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner 's proposed $ 1.8 million unbid contract for voting machine testing .
Brunner had already set aside the $ 1.8 million for the test .
Her specific request to the Controlling Board was a waiver for competitive bidding .
Her office had hoped to complete all testing by November 30 , 2007 .
A former judge , Brunner is successor to the infamous J. Kenneth Blackwell , who helped engineer the theft of Ohio 's electoral votes for George W. Bush in 2004 .
Brunner won election as a reform candidate , vowing to guarantee the public access to the polls --- and an accurate vote count --- in 2008 .
In California , Democratic Secretary of State Debra Bowen recently completed an extensive testing of that state 's electronic voting machines .
She decertified many of them and is on course to rework how America 's biggest state casts and counts its ballots .
Brunner has not been quite so aggressive .
When it was recently revealed that 56 of 88 Ohio counties illegally destroyed protected materials from the 2004 election , she showed little reaction .
She has also stated publicly doubts that the irregularities that defined the Ohio vote that year could have affected the outcome or that the illegal destruction of more than 2000 ballots could have been intentional .
But in attempting to carry out her promise to test Ohio 's electronic voting machines , Brunner has followed through on public demands that the ability of Ohio 's electronic machines to deliver a fair and reliable vote count be proven .
Tests and studies conducted by the federal Government Accountability Office , Princeton University , Johns Hopkins , the Brennan Center , the Carter - Baker Election Commission , John Conyer 's House Judiciary Committee and others have all shown clearly that electronic voting machines are unreliable and easily rigged .
The New York Times has now joined that consensus , calling for an outright federal ban .
" Electronic voting has been an abysmal failure , " the Times said .
" Computer experts have done study after study showing that electronic voting machines , which are often shoddily made , can easily be hacked .
With little effort , vote totals can be changed and elections stolen . "
Apparently , the Ohio GOP is not anxious to have a state study add to such conclusions .
At a Monday hearing , State Senator Steve Stivers ( R- Columbus ) attempted to table Brunner 's request before she was allowed to speak .
Only the procedural intervention of Controlling Board President Joe Secrest afforded Brunner the courtesy of presenting her controversial proposal .
Brunner 's plan calls for contracts with testing companies that are preferred by the voting machine vendors like SysTest Labs and computer security experts from various universities to inspect the machines under the management of the Battelle Memorial Institute .
But Senator John Carey ( R - Wellston ) angrily reacted to Brunner 's mention of the tests conducted in California , saying they were the work of " leftists and extremists . "
Both Stivers and Carey questioned the independence and objectiveness of the academics from Cleveland State , Penn State , and the University of Pennsylvania listed in Brunner 's plan .
Cleveland State University Law Professor Candace Hoke , who witnessed the California tests of e-voting machines for hackability , told the Controlling Board that " Within ten seconds to two minutes . . . they found thirty different ways " to hack the machines .
Both Brunner and Hoke stressed the lack of security measures now used at Ohio 's polling places .
The issues of so - called " sleepovers " used in some Ohio counties , like Hocking , were cited .
This practice involves often untrained poll workers to take hackable voting machines home with them the weekend before an Election Day .
Brunner repeatedly emphasized the need to establish a " chain of custody " concerning both the access and memory cards used in voting machines , the latter serving as an electronic ballot box .
In recent elections , memory cards have gone missing for hours on election nights in both Toledo and Dayton .
State Senator Ray Miller ( D - Columbus ) declared that election security is " the most important issue that 's come before the Controlling Board . "
He said , " It 's way beyond the building of buildings .
It goes to the core of our democracy . "
But the attack on Brunner 's testing contract was initiated by Ohio Speaker of the House Republican John Husted in the morning prior to the September 10 Controlling Board meeting .
He sent a letter to Brunner demanding she remove the requested contract proposal from the Controlling Board agenda .
" At the present time , too many outstanding questions remain regarding the scope of this request and the intent of the study , " he wrote .
Brunner responded by saying " our testing process allows for parallel independent testing of Ohio 's voting systems by both corporate testing entities and some of the nation 's best computer security research scientists , allowing them to collaborate as needed .
" I regret I can not accede to your request to delay , " she added , " as I need information to prepare for the early March 4 primary election so that Ohio 's voters can trust that we have done all possible to ensure the safety , reliability and trustworthiness of our voting systems in Ohio . "
Early voting will begin here in late January .
But the GOP clearly intends to delay the testing in Ohio and conduct yet another election on eminently hackable electronic voting machines .

And the story inside Burma as the monks try to lead a movement for change is one we cannot close our eyes to .
One of Ko Htike 's readers posted this horrific account today at his blog , Prosaic Collection :
We just got phone call with our sister living in Yangon about a few hours ago .
We saw on BBC world , saying that 200 monks were arrested .
The true picture is far worse !!!!!!!!!
For one instance , the monastery at an obscure neighborhood of Yangon , called Ngwe Kyar Yan ( on Wei - za - yan - tar Road , Yangon ) had been raided early this morning .
A troop of lone - tein ( riot police comprised of paid thugs ) protected by the military trucks , raided the monastery with 200 studying monks .
They systematically ordered all the monks to line up and banged and crushed each one 's head against the brick wall of the monastery .
One by one , the peaceful , non resisting monks , fell to the ground , screaming in pain .
Then , they tore off the red robes and threw them all in the military trucks ( like rice bags ) and took the bodies away .
The head monk of the monastery , was tied up in the middle of the monastery , tortured , bludgeoned , and later died the same day , today .
Tens of thousands of people gathered outside the monastery , warded off by troops with bayoneted rifles , unable to help their helpless monks being slaughtered inside the monastery .
Their every try to forge ahead was met with the bayonets .
When all is done , only 10 out of 200 remained alive , hiding in the monastery .
Blood stained everywhere on the walls and floors of the monastery .
Please tell your audience of the full extent of the fate of the monks please please !!!!!!!!!!!!
' Arrested ' is not enough expression .
They have been bludgeoned to death !!!!!!
Even with this brutal treatment , the people of Burma are trying to keep fighting for their rights and Ko reported two attempted demonstrations in Yangon ( Rangoon ) today as well as word that 500 additional monks are being held at a detention center .
The monks refuse to accept food from their military jailors .
Please sign the global petition at Avaaz.org and support the efforts listed at the Burma Campaign Facebook group such as today 's email campaign calling on companies to end their investments in Burma .
Tomorrow , Congress will consider a bipartisan resolution , HR200 supporting Human Rights in Burma - make sure your representative knows that you want their Yea vote : 1-800-828-0498 .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Colgate - Palmolive Co. on Thursday warned counterfeit “ Colgate ” toothpaste that may contain a toxic chemical had been found in discount stores in four U.S. states .
People pass the entrance of Colgate - Palmolive World headquaters in New York City , in this August 31 , 2003 file photo .
Colgate - Palmolive Co. < CL.N > said on Thursday counterfeit toothpaste that may contain a toxic chemical had been found in discount stores in four U.S. states .
REUTERS / Jeff Christensen
“ There are indications that this product does not contain fluoride and may contain diethylene glycol , ” the company said of the toothpaste found in New York , New Jersey , Pennsylvania and Maryland .
Colgate - Palmolive said it does not use , nor has ever used , diethylene glycol as an ingredient in its toothpaste anywhere in the world .
The chemical , also known as DEG and sometimes illegally used as an inexpensive sweetener and thickening agent , is commonly found in solvents and antifreeze .
The counterfeit toothpaste is labeled as being manufactured in South Africa but Colgate - Palmolive said it does not import toothpaste to the United States from South Africa .
The packaging also contains several misspellings .
Colgate did not immediately respond to an inquiry seeking details of which stores the counterfeit toothpaste was found in , or how it may have found its way into the United States .
The Colgate announcement comes almost two weeks after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration warned consumers to avoid any toothpaste made in China after inspectors found DEG in tubes sold at two stores .
The FDA also issued an import alert aimed at preventing all toothpaste from three companies in China that make brands found to contain DEG from entering the United States .
The FDA has said it is not aware of any U.S. reports of poisonings from DEG - tainted toothpaste , but says the chemical has a “ low but meaningful risk of toxicity and injury , ” especially to children and people with kidney or liver disease .
Colgate - Palmolive said it was working closely with the FDA to identify those responsible for the counterfeit product .
Colgate is the leading toothpaste company , with 36 percent of the U.S. market in 2006 , slightly ahead of Crest , a Procter & Gamble Co. brand , with 35.7 percent , according to Euromonitor data .
When the FDA issued its warning early this month , Crest said its toothpaste sold in the United States is all manufactured in North America .
It also said Crest toothpaste sold in China is not manufactured by the companies under investigation .
A spokeswoman for Crest said on Thursday that counterfeit toothpaste is currently not an issue for the company .
The FDA issued its warning about Chinese toothpaste after seizing a batch found to contain 3 percent DEG .
It said inspectors found DEG - containing toothpaste at a Dollar Plus store in Miami and at a store called Todo a Peso in Puerto Rico .
The FDA has identified products by Goldcredit International Enterprises Ltd. , Goldcredit International Trading Co. Ltd. , and Suzhou City Jinmao Daily Chemicals Co. Ltd as containing DEG under brands such as Cooldent , Clean Rite and ShiR Fresh .
DEG - contaminated toothpaste has also been seized in Costa Rica , the Dominican Republic , Panama and Nicaragua .
The sweet substance , sometimes used as a substitute for glycerin , was found in cough syrup in Panama that led to the deaths of at least 100 people last year .
Colgate , which also makes dish soap and pet food , earlier this year recalled two pet products manufactured by a Canadian company whose foods were found to contain contaminated wheat gluten imported from China and suspected in the deaths of cats and dogs .
Colgate shares were down 59 cents , or .9 percent , at $ 66.87 in afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange .
Purge of voter rolls could swing 2008 election Jason Rhyne
Published : Wednesday September 12 , 2007
Print This Email This Using statistics and methodology that some voting experts are calling " flawed , " the Justice Department 's Voting Section is telling 10 US states to purge voter rolls which allegedly show more registered voters than are eligible - - a house - cleaning effort AlterNet 's Steven Rosenfeld says could swing the 2008 election .
" Voting Section Chief John Tanner called for the purges in letters sent this spring under an arcane provision in the National Voter Registration Act , better known as the Motor Voter law , " says Rosenfeld , adding that the letters " notify states that 10 percent or more of their election jurisdictions have problematic voter rolls .
It tells states to report ' the subsequent removal from rolls of persons no longer eligible to vote . "
According to experts interviewed by Rosenfeld , however , the Justice Department is misrepresenting the information they are using to make their recommendations .
" That data does not say what they purport it says , " David Becker , senior voting rights counsel for People for the American Way , said .
" They are saying the data shows the 10 worst voter rolls .
They have a lot of explaining to do . "
Rosenfeld also quotes U.S. Election Assistance Commission consultant Kim Brace , who said " You are basically seeing them grasping at whatever straws are possible to make their point . "
Obtaining the same data used by the Voting Section , AlterNet 's analysis found that " some states facing Justice Department pressure to purge voters have long been targeted by GOP ' vote fraud ' activists , especially where concentrations of minority voters have historically elected Democrats -- such as St. Louis , Philadelphia and South Dakota 's Indian reservations . "
" Voter roll purges , if incorrectly done , can be a factor in determining election outcomes -- particularly in tight races , " Rosenfeld writes .
" Looking toward the 2008 election , it appears the purges could be a new and legal way to accomplish a controversial longstanding Republican Party electoral tactic -- thinning the ranks of likely Democratic voters in states where there may be close races . "
" The GOP agenda is to make it harder to vote , " Joe Rich , former Voting Section Chief told AlterNet .
" You purge voters .
You do n't register voters .
This is ripe for partisan decision making .
You pick the states where you go after Democrats . "
Earlier this year , ePlubirus Media examined what they called a " breathtaking politicization " of the Voting Section after Rich was replaced as chief in 2005 by John Tanner .
" Tanner has waged an aggressive effort to remake the section in his own image -- not an image that most people who promote the core mission of the Voting Rights Act , which the Section is primarily responsible for enforcing , would support , " ePlubirus reported .
The 10 states that received Voting Section letters , according to AlterNet , are Iowa , Massachusetts , Mississippi , Nebraska , North Carolina , Rhode Island , South Dakota , Texas , Utah and Vermont .

Gordon Brown was in Iraq yesterday on a " fact - finding mission " .
It need n't all have looked gloomy for the next prime minister , however - not if he did some fact - finding about Blackwater , a North Carolina company that is now one of the most profitable military contractors operating in Iraq , and proves just what a land of opportunity Iraq really is .
Blackwater 's president , Gary Jackson , acclaimed a " staggering " 600 % growth in 2004 : " This is a billion - dollar industry , " he said , " and Blackwater has only scratched the surface of it . "
So if Gordon , or any of us , wants to get on this Iraqi gravy train , we could do worse than see how Blackwater goes about it .
First you need your father to leave you a billion dollars or so , as happened to Erik Prince , Blackwater 's founder .
Then use the money to set up a company that specialises in shooting people .
Of course , you say the company 's vision is " to support security , peace , freedom and democracy everywhere " .
But your brochure is full of photos of men bursting into rooms with machine guns and shooting from helicopters - and it offers five sniping courses : basic military , advanced military , situation sniper , high angle ( shooting people from rooftops ) and , of course , helicopter .
Making money out of this sort of violence , no matter how you dress it up in idealistic language , can look a little morally dodgy , so it would be best if - like Erik - you were a born - again Christian and you donate pots of money to the Republicans .
Since 1989 , the Nation reports , Erik and his wife have given $ 275,550 to Republican campaigns , and $ 0 to the Democrats .
A White House internship - something Erik did in the early 90s - could also provide enough friends in the right places .
The odd no -bid contract , such as the one Blackwater got to guard Iraq 's Coalition Provisional Authority , would n't go astray .
You should be comfortable with your friends making money .
For example , you pay your security guards $ 600 a day , but bill the Kuwaiti Regency Hotel company for $ 815 .
Regency , according to the Raleigh News & Observer , bills defence services company ESS for another chunk of money .
ESS sends the bill to Kellogg , Brown & Root , who add a percentage for their services and present the inflated bill to the Pentagon .
Senator Henry Waxman says he 's been trying in vain to find out what that bill is for two years .
We can again learn from Blackwater in how to keep expenses down .
On March 12 2004 , Blackwater signed a contract with Regency and ESS specifying that each security mission should have a minimum of " two armoured vehicles to support ESS movements " .
Blackwater had the word " armoured " deleted from the contract and saved $ 1.5 m .
This had was an unforeseen payoff when four Blackwater operatives were sent into Falluja and both vehicles were overwhelmed by a mob .
The men were killed and their mutilated bodies hung on a bridge .
Now rather than damage Blackwater 's reputation , this incident was to prove the company 's making as the US military got behind it .
Brigadier General Mark Kimmitt vowed : " We will be back ...
We will hunt down the criminals ...
It will be precise , and it will be overwhelming . "
The result was that the US more or less destroyed the town .
The families of the four men decided to sue Blackwater to find out why they died - but the company can seek profit even in this situation : last Friday it was announced that Blackwater is suing the dead men's estates for $ 10 m , according to the families ' lawyers , " to silence the families and keep them out of court " .
So there it is - more ways to make money out of Iraq than you or I would have dreamt of .
And companies like Blackwater are showing us the way .

Yosemite 's 10 Best Easy Hikes : Maximizing Your Scenery Per Footstep
What 's the good of a breathtaking view if you 're already out of breath ?
It 's hard to enjoy yourself when you 're so worked that you 're setting off other people 's heart monitors .
There 's something to be said for journeys that yield up their treasures easily , so for the pleasure of scenery cognoscenti everywhere , here are the Yosemite hikes most apt to keep your quality - of - life meters running solidly in the red :
1. Glacier Point ( 1 mile / 1.6 km round trip ) :
The views here are almost indescribable .
There 's a 270 - degree panorama including Half Dome , Clouds Rest , the waterfalls of the Mist Trail , dozens of peaks in the eastern Sierra range , and much of Yosemite Valley .
It 's probably the best place in all of Yosemite for watching the sunset .
2. Lower Mariposa Grove ( 2.2 miles / 3.5 km round trip ) :
This hike is at the outer bounds of the easy category , since it involves some ascent , but it 's well worth it .
It includes the Grizzly Giant , which is not only the world 's oldest sequoia , at 2,700 years , but also one of the world 's largest living things ; the California Tunnel Tree , which you can walk through ; the Bachelor and Three Graces ( pictured here ) ; and a variety of other behemoths that would merit their own parks anywhere else in the world but do n't even rate their own names here .
3. Tuolumne Meadows ( 2 miles / 3.2 km round trip ) :
There 's no place like a meadow for chilling out , and this one is Yosemite 's best .
Just meander around the trails and soak up the sun ( it feels good when you 're at 8,500 feet / 2,550 meters elevation ) and enjoy the wildflowers and the river and the deer and the granite peaks surrounding the meadow .
4. Lower Yosemite Falls ( 0.5 miles / 0.8 km round trip ) :
Hike to the base of the tallest waterfall in North America and absorb some of the adrenaline - soaked spray that 's just survived a 2,400 - foot ( 720 - meter ) freefall .
Best in the spring and early summer , when there 's lots of water roaring over the falls .
5. Tenaya Lake ( 2.5 mile / 4 km loop ) :
If you 've ever wanted to step into a postcard , come to Tenaya Lake .
The lake is beautiful enough by itself , but it's also got beaches along the eastern and western shores and is surrounded by striking granite domes and peaks .
6. Sentinel Dome ( 2.2 miles / 3.5 km round trip ) :
Sentinel Dome is at the upper end of the easy category , due to the short but steep foray up the side of the dome to the summit .
Once there , though , you 'll find 360 degrees of view encompassing Yosemite Valley , the high Sierras , and ( on unusually clear days ) the coastal range .
7. Bridalveil Fall ( 1.2 miles / 1.9 km round trip ) :
A short walk to the base of this 620 - foot ( 189 - meter ) waterfall that 's one of the most famous in the world , photographed millions of times from Yosemite 's tunnel view .
8. Taft Point ( 2.2 miles / 3.5 km round trip ) :
Heart - starting views over the very sheer edge of the south rim of Yosemite Valley , with only the most basic of guardrails to hold you up .
After you 've driven to Yosemite Valley and gotten out of your car to look at El Capitan just because it's too tall to see the top of through your windshield , hike to Taft Point so you can look down on it instead .
9. Sentinel & Cook 's Meadow Loop ( 2.25 miles / 3.6 km round trip ) :
This nearly flat hike takes you through two meadows in the heart of Yosemite Valley , crosses the Merced River twice - including a trip over the iconic Swinging Bridge ( at left ) - and provides multiple views of Yosemite Falls and Half Dome .
Not only that , but the trail goes directly past the Lower Yosemite Falls trailhead AND a bar .
10 . Olmsted Point ( 0.5 miles / 0.8 km round trip ) :
Head - swiveling panoramic views to Half Dome and Clouds Rest in the west and Tenaya Lake in the east .
Ringed by picturesque granite domes dotted with glacial erratics .
And you can see most of it without leaving the parking lot .
Honorable Mention
Sure , these did n't make the top 10 , but that does n't mean they 're not worthy of your footprints - it 's just that this is Yosemite , where the standards are higher .
If you had any of these in your backyard , you know what people would call you ?
Homeless .
Because your property would be condemned so they could turn it into a national park .
Washburn Point ( 20 steps ) :
This hike readily fits in the " easy " category ; in fact , it 's a stretch to consider it a hike at all , since the approach consists entirely of descending a staircase .
Similar views to Glacier Point , but with a profile rather than frontal view of Half Dome , and with an added view of Illilouette Falls .
Wawona Meadow ( 3.5 mile / 5.6 km loop ) :
This mostly flat loop around the edge of one of Yosemite 's largest meadows is an archetypal daydreamy stroll , especially during wildflower season just after a rainstorm .
It 's also one of the best places in the park to go for a run , and one of the few trails in Yosemite where dogs and bicycles are allowed .
For all its attractions , there 's hardly anyone here .
Nelder Grove of Giant Sequoias ( several short trails ) :
This little - known grove of Giant Sequoias is actually about 20 miles outside Yosemite 's south entrance , but it 's worth a visit .
Less crowded than any of the groves in Yosemite itself .
Mono Lake South Tufa Trail ( 1 mile / 1.6 km loop ) :
Another just - outside - Yosemite hike , 22 miles ( 35 km ) from the Tioga Road ( eastern ) entrance .
The surreal tufa towers here would still be waiting for Cousteau if Los Angeles 's water rapacity in the 1940's had n't lowered the lake by 40 feet and exposed them .
If you 're a photographer , this is a definite top - 10 hike .
Do this trail at sunrise or sunset if you can .
Overrated
Just because a crowd has gathered does n't mean something wonderful is going on - witness traffic jams , the DMV , or a Carrot Top concert , just to name a few .
There are some hikes in Yosemite that you can happily avoid , no matter how many busloads of people you see stopping at the trailhead .
These , for instance :
Mirror Lake ( 2.4 miles / 3.8 km round trip ) :
Central - Park - crowded because it's an easy hike in Yosemite Valley , but the scenery does n't merit the attention it gets - Mirror Lake is not , in fact , even a lake , but a pool in Tenaya Creek .
In its defense , this hike is much better in the winter .
Lower Yosemite Falls ( in the autumn and late summer ) :
It 's snowpack , not schizophrenia , that lands this hike on both the best - of and worst - of lists .
Yosemite Falls usually disappears by autumn - during radically dry years like 2007 , it can expire by the end of July - and like KISS without their makeup , a waterfall loses its mystique when there 's no water flowing over it .
“ The value of a social network is defined not only by who ’s on it , but by who ’s excluded . ”
This quote is from futurist Paul Saffo in an Economist article that makes a contrarian case for Facebook , in part by arguing that as social networks grow , they will eventually encounter the inverse of Metcalfe ’s law , becoming LESS valuable with each new user rather than more valuable .
This analogy to address books points to an important limitation for social networks , such as Facebook , compared with older sorts of network , such as the postal or telephone systems .
These benefit from Metcalfe ’s Law , which says that the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of its users .
In other words , the more people have phones , the more useful they become .
This “ network effect ” leads to rapid adoption and puts up barriers for new entrants .
But unlike other networks , social networks lose value once they go beyond a certain size .
“ The value of a social network is defined not only by who ’s on it , but by who ’s excluded , ” says Paul Saffo , a Silicon Valley forecaster .
Despite their name , therefore , they do not benefit from the network effect .
Already , social networks such as “ aSmallWorld ” , an exclusive site for the rich and famous , are proliferating .
Such networks recognise that people want to hobnob with a chosen few , not to be spammed by random friend - requests .
This suggests that the future of social networking will not be one big social graph but instead myriad small communities on the internet to replicate the millions that exist offline .
No single company , therefore , can capture the social graph .
On the one hand , you could argue that once all of your friends — or all of your professional colleagues — are on Facebook , it achieves a kind of perfect value , and that it does n’t matter whether the network is overrun by hoards of irrelevant people .
You do n’t have to be “ friends ” with them .
But even if only your friends can see your full profile , anyone can see your “ listing ” on Facebook and request to be your friend .
So what , you might say , just ignore or decline people you do n’t want to be friends with .
Well , sure , just like you could hang up on all those telemarketers who used to call during dinner time , before the Do Not Call list , when we discovered that everyone having a telephone actually reaches a point of diminishing returns , i.e. an inverse of Metcalfe ’s law .
I still find a great deal of cognitive dissonance around the idea the one social network can serve the needs of EVERY group — should n’t the web as platform lead to MORE customization and more verticalization , simply because it ’s cheap and easy to tailor applications to individual users ’ needs ?
Let ’s not forget why Facebook is called “ Facebook ” — because it was designed to serve the needs of a defined group of users , i.e. college students .
Facebook has only been successful in opening up beyond that original defined user base because it had a much better design than MySpace ( i.e. did n’t suck ) and because so many people over 30 wish they were back in college again .
The web has until now been about the pendulum swing from a world of monopoly distribution , local applications , hierarchy , and static information at one extreme , to a world of completely open , dynamic networks at the other extreme .
There ’s no question that this is the Age of the Network — the open question ( pun intended ) is whether the greatest value is derived from fully open networks or whether the pendulum swings back towards the center , with the greatest value derived from DEFINED networks , i.e. both delimited and dynamic ( two qualities which are not in fact at odds ) .
Looking at the most successful web companies suggests that defined networks are the key .
What is Google PageRank but a way to put boundaries around the network , to define some nodes as more powerful , more influential than others ?
Facebook , as already cited , was driven by the .edu limitation .
YouTube did n’t become huge as a mass medium for online video , where everyone watched the same thing — it grew because it was a platform for easily sharing video content among defined groups , i.e. email it to friends , share it with friends on MySpace .
Perhaps what ’s most counterintuitive about the web is that the network is liberating only to a point — the value of the network needs to be harnessed .
A purely open , unbounded free - for - all is chaos .
Right now , Facebook feels like a free - for - all — there ’s huge value in so many people I know professionally and personally being on Facebook , but the value is diminished because when I logged in everything is all mashed together .
Doc Searls posted about the diminishing returns of Facebook , as he ’s been overrun by non-value - creating requests from the network .
Facebook is introducing a feature that will enable users to segment that chaos into more clearly defined , higher value segments , e.g. my personal friends , my professional colleagues .
Facebook may yet succeed in being the one network for all interactions among people on the web — but that ambition might also bump up against the inverse of Metcafe ’s law , and against what we may discover is the natural grain of the web .
You may recall Hardball host Chris Matthews ' creepy exchange with CNBC's Erin Burnett where he asked her to get closer to the camera so he could gawk at her and called her a knockout .

by P.A. Madison on June 30th , 2011
The United States Supreme court tells us their “ case law firmly establishes Congress ’ power to regulate purely local activities that are part of an economic ‘ class of activities ’ that have a substantial effect on interstate commerce . ”
In a September 2009 press release , former speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi asserted , “ the Constitution gives Congress broad power to regulate activities that have an effect on interstate commerce . ”
The question explored here is whether such “ case law ” or public assertions are supported in any way by the history , text and custom of regulating commerce .
If it can not be supported by any factual evidence then it is clearly erroneous and has no place in federal jurisprudence where facts and truth should be held paramount .
History of the organic law of this country conclusively shows beyond any doubt that the regulation of commerce was nothing more , and nothing less , then the act of imposing a tax on articles of import for the sole purpose of restricting or prohibiting their introduction in order to protect or promote local manufactures .
Moreover , this was the custom and practice of all nations in regulating commerce with other nations or parts of a nation and no nation ever claimed police powers over another nation or parts of themselves via authority to regulate commerce .
Because regulating commerce and generating revenue is accomplished through the same identical method of imposing a tax , the regulation of commerce “ among the several states ” was inserted for remedial purposes of preventing States from taxing the trade of other States as well as preventing Congress from doing the same under Section 9 .
It will become abundantly clear why James Madison referred to the regulation of commerce “ among the several states ” as a “ negative and preventive provision ” and not any power Congress may resort to for “ positive purposes ” ( see Madison letter to Joseph C. Cabell ) .
Finally , it will be pointed how the court has mistakenly confused marine law of nations with that of regulating commerce , which has introduced erroneous assumptions over the extent of the power .
The Power Described
Chief Justice Marshall tells us in the classic and still respected case of Gibbons v. Ogden ( 1824 ) that the power to regulate commerce “ describes the commercial intercourse between nations , and parts of nations , in all its branches , and is regulated by prescribing rules for carrying on that intercourse . ”
Marshall obviously is correct in describing the Commerce Clause as dealing with commercial intercourse “ between ” nations and parts of nations because the Constitution speaks only of regulating commerce “ with foreign nations ” and “ among the several States ” and not the regulation of commercial activities within nations or within States .
It is too obvious why the regulation of commerce must be “ between ” and not “ within ” because Congress has no sovereign jurisdiction over commercial activities either within a foreign nation or within a State .
This fact alone makes it silly to suggest the power to regulate commerce can have broad application .
Some might attempt to argue the method of regulating foreign commerce is not the same as regulating commerce among the States .
However , the text of the Commerce Clause reveals no alternating commands to how the regulation of commerce shall be regulated differently between States and nations ( or even with Indian tribes ) .
Marshall pointed out this clear fact in Gibbons by observing , “ it ( regulation of commerce ) must carry the same meaning throughout the sentence , and remain a unit , unless there be some plain intelligible cause which alters it . ”
Marshall further pointed out that “ [ c] ommerce among the States must , of necessity , be commerce with the States . ”
Suffice to say , there is no “ plain intelligible cause ” to alter how the power is exercised differently between States and nations .
Since commerce is regulated in the same manner among the States as with foreign nations , answering what rules are prescribed in regulating foreign commerce also answers the question of what are the proper rules for regulating commerce among the States .
Because the subject of regulation is the commercial intercourse “ between ” nations and States and not within them , does not make it terribly important of what might all come under the singular word “ commerce ” outside of this regulation because its meaning can only be properly defined in connection with what is actually exchanged between different powers .
This textual fact of the Commerce Clause limits the discussion of commerce to importation since that is the only commercial intercourse that goes on between different powers ( more on this in a moment ) .
A quick word on navigation :
When “ navigation ” is spoken of as an ingredient of regulating commerce it is a reference to points of entry where ships of trade are directed to enter for purpose of customs ( cargo inspection , duties and imposts levied , seizures made , etc. ) .
This is why Chief Justice Marshall said the words , “ nor shall vessels bound to or from one state be obliged to enter , clear , or pay duties in another ” was the navigation comprehended in regulating commerce .
The Regulating Power Sought Over Commerce with the States
No doubt the reason for little debate or controversies over Congress regulating commerce among the States during the constitutional convention was due to the well understood practice of the power and resolutions under the old Articles of Confederation asking for State approval to empower Congress with specific and detailed powers to regulate State and foreign commerce .
The first resolution in February of 1781 by John Witherspoon , read , in part :
That it is indispensably necessary that the United States in Congress assembled , should be vested with a right of superintending the commercial regulations of every state , that none may take place that shall be partial or contrary to the common interest ; and that they should be vested with the exclusive right of laying duties upon all imported articles , no restriction to be valid , and no such duty to be laid but with the consent of nine states : provided , that all duties and imposts laid by the United States in Congress assembled , shall always be a certain proportion of the value of the article or articles on which the same shall be laid …
Another resolution example is from a committee lead by James Monroe in 1785 asking the States to give Congress the authority “ of regulating the trade of the states , as well with foreign nations , as with each other , and of laying such impost and duties , upon imports and exports , as may be necessary for the purpose . ”
Monroe would later explain in 1822 that :
Commerce between independent powers or communities is universally regulated by duties and imposts .
It was so regulated by the States before the adoption of this Constitution , equally in respect to each other and to foreign powers .
The goods and vessels ( tonnage duties ) employed in the trade are the only subjects of regulation .
It can act on none other .
A power , then , to impose such duties and imposts in regard to foreign nations and to prevent any on the trade between the States was the only power granted .
Madison offered a resolution on November 30 , 1785 asking that , “ the United States in Congress assembled be authorized to prohibit vessels belonging to any foreign nation from entering any of the ports thereof , or to impose any duties on such vessels and their cargoes which may be judged necessary . ”
To prevent States from regulating commerce , Madison ’s resolution called for no State to be at “ liberty to impose duties on any goods , wares , or merchandise , imported , by land or by water , from any other state , but may altogether prohibit the importation from any state of any particular species or description of goods , wares , or merchandise , of which the importation is at the same time prohibited from all other places whatsoever . ”
This resolution leads to the Annapolis Convention of 1786 that in return lead to the convention in Philadelphia in May of 1787 .
Another resolution in August of 1786 asking the States to empower Congress with the power to “ have the sole and exclusive power of regulating the trade of the States as well with foreign nations as with each other and of laying such prohibitions and such Imposts and duties upon imports and exports as may be Necessary for the purpose … ”
These resolutions show a clear , consistent understanding of how commerce is , and was , regulated through taxation on importation and not municipal law over internal commercial activities .
Additionally , these examples illustrate the well - recognized dual purpose of taxation of either raising revenue or regulating commerce .
William
Pitt speaking before the House of Commons in 1765 pointed out the dual purpose of taxes , “ there is a plain distinction between taxes levied for the purpose of raising a revenue , and duties imposed for the regulation of trade . ”
Colonial delegate Benjamin Franklin asserted the same thing a year later .
James Madison in Federalist No. 56 said , “ [ t ] axation will consist , in a great measure , of duties which will be involved in the regulation of commerce . ”
Marshall in Gibbons also recognized the dual purpose of taxes : “ It is true that duties may often be , and in fact often are , imposed on tonnage with a view to the regulation of commerce , but they may be also imposed with a view to revenue . ”
Imposing a general revenue tax disguised as a regulation of commerce that clearly does not protect or promote local manufactures , could have adverse consequences as Britain once discovered during colonial times ( the colonies “ cheerfully consent[ed ] ” to Britain taxing for the regulation of their external commerce but not for general revenue ) .
Because of this dual nature of taxes , States were restrained from laying taxes for any purpose upon imports or exports outside of their own .
The first act of Congress following the convention to regulate commercial intercourse was an act titled , “ An act for laying a duty on goods , wares , and merchandizes , imported into the United States , ” signed by President Washington on July 4 , 1789 .
Imposing rules of what imported articles are restricted or prohibited via a tax was the only known method of regulating commercial intercourse between independent powers .
It is now easy to understand what Marshall meant of regulating commerce in Gibbons as “ cannot stop at the external boundary line of each State , but may be introduced into the interior . ”
He of course was referring to the prohibition against a State in taxing either another State or foreign nation imports / exports once it is introduced into the State and with the intent to be shipped through the State to another for purpose of bringing that trade to market .
Commerce Defined
Because the regulation of commerce is the regulation of intercourse “ between ” different powers , and because this intercourse is regulated through duties on imports , leaves us with the only question of what exactly is an “ import . ”
Chief Justice Marshall in Brown v. Maryland ( 1827 ) says the “ lexicons inform us they ( imports ) are ‘ things imported . ' ”
He continues , “ If we appeal to usage for the meaning of the word , we shall receive the same answer .
They are the articles themselves which are brought into the country . ”
Marshall goes on to state the articles of import are those “ only which are intended for sale or consumption in the country . ”
It should be apparent how such things as “ labor ” or “ services ” cannot come under the regulation of commerce because , for example , “ services ” are not property imported .
It is also rather absurd to argue regulating the transportation of “ passengers ” is a regulation of commerce in light of the unmistakable fact the United States no longer recognizes a property in men for purposes of trade .
This is what made regulating the foreign slave trade awkward under the Commerce Clause because as Madison put it , human beings were not “ property , ” and “ slaves are not like merchandise , consumed , etc . ”
This is why the court in New York v. Miln ( 1837 ) was forced to acknowledge persons “ are not the subject of commerce , and not being imported goods , cannot fall within a train of reasoning founded upon the construction of a power given to Congress to regulate commerce . ”
England and the States never asserted they were regulating commerce when they passed laws regulating manufactures , labor or fixing the price of certain commodities .
The word “ commerce ” as employed under the Commerce Clause also does not extend any powers over buying and selling .
Thomas Jefferson said , “ [ t ] o make a thing which may be bought and sold is not to prescribe regulations for buying and selling . . . if this were an exercise of the power of regulating commerce , it would be void , as extending as much to the internal commerce of every state , as to its external . ”
In response to Jefferson , Hamilton agreed buying and selling “ falls more aptly within the province of the local jurisdictions than within that of the general government . ”
Consider also that to regulate the value of money , to make laws for bankruptcies , or to “ fix the standard of weights and measures ” are all - important ingredients of commerce , yet the Constitution specifically enumerates these powers for Congress to exercise .
In Federalist No. 42 Madison said : “ The power of establishing uniform laws of bankruptcy , is so intimately connected with the regulation of commerce , and will prevent so many frauds where the parties or their property may lie , or be removed into different states , that the expediency of it seems not likely to be drawn into question . ”
So while bankruptcy may be “ intimately connected ” with commerce , this connection does not make it part of any regulation of commerce because bankruptcies are never the subject of commercial intercourse between different sovereigns .
It is no wonder that the framers are frequently found referring to the regulation of commerce as the “ regulation of trade ” because this commerce is the regulation of those articles of trade imported for the purpose of consumption .
Why Nations Regulate their Commercial Intercourse
The object behind taxation for regulating commercial intercourse is not , of course , revenue , but for the protection or encouragement of local manufactures by laying restrictive or prohibiting duties on those imported items that compete with what is domestically manufactured .
Moreover , like all taxes , this tax extends no power over the thing taxed other than to restrict or prohibit its introduction .
The Declaration of Colonial Rights of 1774 declared the “ regulation of our external commerce , for the purpose of securing the commercial advantages of the whole empire to the mother - country , and the commercial benefits of its respective members . ”
Again , referring to Section 1 of the first acts of Congress in regulating commerce in 1789 , we find the purpose of regulating commerce in the words , “ encouragement and protection of manufactures , that duties be laid on goods , wares , and merchandizes , imported , etc . ”
Jefferson wrote in 1821 that the “ government of the United States at a very early period , when establishing its tariff on foreign importations , were very much guided in their selection of objects by a desire to encourage manufactures within themselves . ”
Madison writing on tariffs in 1828 said the power of regulating commerce “ has been understood and used , by all commercial and manufacturing nations , as embracing the object of encouraging manufactures .
It is believed that not a single exception can be named . ”
A couple of examples of regulating commerce is in order : Congress may seek to encourage American shipbuilding or American navigation in the coasting trade through prescribing high tonnage duties on foreign made vessels while laying little to none on American made ships in order to encourage building or use of American ships .
Another example would be how Congress currently encourages the use of American made ethanol for gasoline blending by placing a $ 0.60 per gallon duty on all imported ethanol .
While this is a proper exercise of regulating commerce , mandating by positive law that refineries must produce gasoline blended with ethanol is not because such laws are a police regulation that only the sovereign where such activities occur under can mandate .
During the federal convention in 1787 , Madison noted that Col .
Mason observed the “ particular States might wish to encourage , by impost duties , certain manufactures , for which they enjoyed natural advantages , as Virginia [ in ] the manufacture of hemp , etc. ” Madison responded by saying the “ encouragement of manufactures in that mode requires duties , not only on imports directly from foreign countries , but from the other States in the Union , which would revive all the mischiefs experienced from the want of a general government over commerce . ”
Why Congress was empowered to Regulate Commerce among the States
Nothing clarifies a constitutional provision better than the purpose for which it was approved and adopted to serve .
With that said , a little history is in order .
The single most cause of discontent among the Colonies and States was over how particular States taxed the commerce of other States .
Example : Connecticut was taxing the produce of Massachusetts as it navigated down the Connecticut River causing Massachusetts to retaliate by taxing all exports from its harbors belonging to citizens of all New England colonies prior to 1650 .
Later New York attempted to break up the trade of Connecticut and New Jersey by imposing heavy duties on every vessel entering from those States .
Delaware and New Jersey attempted to attract the foreign trade of Pennsylvania and New York by offering lower import duties .
Massachusetts and Rhode Island placed prohibitive duties on imports via British ships while Connecticut admitted such imports free , seeking a monopoly of domestic trade in British products .
James Madison explains the “ very material object ” of the power to regulate commerce among the States in Federalist No. 42 :
A very material object of this power was the relief of the States which import and export through other States , from the improper contributions levied on them by the latter .
Were these at liberty to regulate the trade between State and State , it must be foreseen that ways would be found out , to load the articles of import and export , during the passage through their jurisdiction , with duties which would fall on the makers of the latter , and the consumers of the former .
We may be assured by past experience , that such a practice would be introduced by future contrivances ; and both by that and a common knowledge of human affairs , that it would nourish unceasing animosities , and not improbably terminate in serious interruptions of the public tranquility .
Madison describes the power as a “ constitutional remedy ” in this 1832 letter to Professor Davis of the University of Virginia :
The power to regulate commerce among the States was well known and so explained by the advocates of the Constitution when before the people for their consideration , to be as a necessary control on the conduct of some of the importing States toward their non-importing neighbors .
A recurrence to the angry legislation produced by it among the parties , some of whom had passed commercial laws ( duties and imposts on articles of import ) more rigid against others than against foreign nations , will well account for the constitutional remedy .
Alexander Hamilton liken States regulating each other ’s trade to the “ trammels ” of the German empire : “ The commerce of the German empire is in continual trammels from the multiplicity of the duties which the several princes and states exact upon the merchandises passing through their territories , by means of which the fine streams and navigable rivers with which Germany is so happily watered are rendered almost useless . ”
Framer Edmund Randolph commenting upon the powers of Congress over commerce among the States as President Washington ’s AG in 1791 , described the power as “ little more than to establish the forms of commercial intercourse between the States , and to keep the prohibitions which the constitution imposes on that intercourse undiminished in their operation ; that is , to prevent taxes on imports or exports . ”
It does not require rocket science to figure out why States would desire an end to such mischief by removing the power of the States to impose such taxes .
The accepted way of doing it was to delegate the power exclusively in one authority so no State could claim it still possessed the right , and if any State did attempt to tax other States commerce for its own interests there would be a remedial avenue in voiding such actions .
None of this of course , in any way , extends to concerns over buying or selling across State lines .
Example : A resident citizen of a State purchases a book from a mail order merchant who then ships the book from another State to the purchaser .
This activity is not part of any regulation of commerce because the book is not a property belonging to an export of another State with the intent to bring to market for sale but is merely private property having already been sold .
As we will discover below , the central government could not be trusted with any affirmative power to regulate State - to - State commerce .
Congress Lacks Affirmative Powers over Interstate Commerce
With the regulation of commerce being the power to impose a tax upon competing articles of importation for purposes of protecting or promoting local manufactures , makes clear how the Constitution limits its exercise between States .
Under Article I , Section 9 ( Limits on Congress ) under the clause that reads , “ No Tax or Duty shall be laid on Articles exported from any State . ”
This federal prohibition is broad and encompasses every known tax for every known purpose upon any articles exported from any State .
An “ export ” is merely the reverse of an import – that is to say , only those items of trade transported out for the purpose of sale or consumption in another jurisdiction .
Framer James
Wilson made it clear this prohibition extended to the regulation of commerce by pointing out this federal prohibition against taxing State exports would remove “ half the regulation of trade , ” meaning Congress would effectively be left with only an affirmative power over foreign imports while leaving the regulation of commerce among the States a nullity .
The debate over the clause during the federal convention went along these lines ( from Madison ’s notes ) :
Mr. Elseworth :
It is best as it stands - The power of regulating trade between the States will protect them agst each other - Should this not be the case , the attempts of one to tax the produce of another passing through its hands , will force a direct exportation and defeat themselves – There are solid reasons agst .
Congs taxing exports .
1 . it will discourage industry , as taxes on imports discourage luxury .
2 . The produce of different States is such as to prevent uniformity in such taxes .
there are indeed but a few articles that could be taxed at all ; as Tobo .
( Tobacco ) rice & indigo , and a tax on these alone would be partial & unjust .
3 . The taxing of exports would engender incurable jealousies .
Mr. Williamson : Tho ’ N- C. ( North Carolina ) has been taxed by Virga ( Virginia ) by a duty on 12,000 Hhs of her Tobo. exported thro ’
Virga yet he would never agree to this power .
Should it take place , it would destroy the last hope of an adoption of the plan .
Mr. Butler was strenuously opposed to a power over exports as unjust and alarming to the staple States .
Mr. Langdon suggested a prohibition on the States from taxing the produce of other States exported from their harbours .
Mr. Dickenson :
The power of taxing exports may be inconvenient at present ; but it must be of dangerous consequence to prohibit it with respect to all articles and forever .
He thought it would be better to except particular articles from the power .
Mr. Sherman :
It is best to prohibit the National legislature in all cases .
The States will never give up all power over trade .
An enumeration of particular articles would be difficult invidious and improper .
Mr. Gerry was strenuously opposed to the power over exports .
It might be made use of to compel the States to comply with the will of the Genl Government , and to grant it any new powers which might be demanded - We have given it more power already than we know how will be exercised - it will enable the Genl Govt to oppress the States , as much as Ireland is oppressed by Great Britain .
Mr. Mercer was strenous against giving Congress power to tax exports .
Such taxes were impolitic , as encouraging the raising of articles not meant for exportation .
The States had now a right where their situation permitted , to tax both the imports and exports of their uncommercial neighbours .
It was enough for them to sacrifice one half of it .
It had been said the Southern States had most need of naval protection .
The reverse was the case .
Were it not for promoting the carrying trade of the Northn States , the Southn States could let their trade go into foreign bottoms , where it would not need our protection .
Virginia by taxing her tobacco had given an advantage to that of Maryland .
Mr. Butler declared that he never would agree to the power of taxing exports .
As it turned out , framer Roger Sherman was correct ; States would never give up all power over commerce to the central government , nor did they .
It has been argued the clause really reads “ No Tax or Duty shall be laid on Articles exported [ to a foreign nation ] from any State . ”
This argument obviously has serious flaws primarily because such an interpretation is at war with the unambiguous text .
It is also at war with the fact Congress avoided taxing State exports from State - to - State to avoid any appearance of taxing this trade .
Example : When Congress passed the controversial Carriage Tax of 1794 for taxing the conveyance of passengers it made very clear that carriages used in “ husbandry , or for the transporting or carrying of goods , wares , merchandise , produce or commodities ” was exempted .
This was to avoid any appearance of Congress attempting to lay a tax on State - to - State exports .
Without the power to lay duties on State exports , there are no means for Congress to encourage or protect manufactures in one State from competition of another State .
Congress cannot argue they are merely regulating State imports because one States import is another States export when it comes to commerce among the States .
Regulating commerce only works when the intercourse is between foreign nations and where there are no State exports involved .
Justice Story said of section nine : “ The obvious object of these provisions is , to prevent any possibility of applying the power to lay taxes , or regulate commerce , injuriously to the interests of any one state , so as to favour or aid another . ”
Story further remarked the “ prohibition extends not only to exports , but to the exporter .
Congress can no more rightfully tax the one , than the other . ”
Framer Charles Pinckney told the House on February 14 , 1820 :
I will only mention here , as it is perfectly within my recollection , that the power was given to Congress to regulate the commerce by water between the States , and it being feared , by the Southern , that the Eastern would , whenever they could , do so to the disadvantage of the Southern States , you will find , in the 9th section of the 1st article , Congress are prevented from taxing exports , or giving preference to the ports of one State over another , or obliging vessels bound from one State to clear , enter , or pay duties in another ; which restrictions , more clearly than any thing else , prove what the power to regulate commerce among the several States means .
Since the States made no restriction upon themselves to regulate their own internal commerce , can act to promote or protect manufactures of the State by imposing restrictive or prohibitory duties on anything that competes with what is made and sold in the State .
Example : A State may impose high duties on foreign made t- shirts that are shipped into the State with the intent to be sold intrastate in order to protect State t- shirt manufacture from low cost foreign competition .
There is no right under the Commerce Clause that says merchandise must be freely admitted and sold within a State but only that outside trade may enter and exit a State unburdened by taxes .
Since it is abundantly clear to what the text and history of the clause commands , no further discussion is required .
Confusing Marine Power with the Regulation of Commerce
It needs to be noted how the powers over commerce has been erroneously extended through the false assumption of the maritime jurisdiction and the regulation of commerce being one of the same .
They are not .
When the States moved from a league of States to one of a Nation for limited purposes of foreign commerce , defense , bankruptcies , piracies on the seas , etc. , became by custom of nations a marine power .
Per law of nations , all maritime affairs within three miles of the shore are invested with the national power and this jurisdiction extends to anything related to the sea such as salvage , marine insurance , safety regulations , contracts , vessel registration , liens , coasting trade , pilotage , seamen , etc. , etc. , etc .
Nobody disputed or questioned the fact the new general government would be empowered over general maritime affairs of the sea because it was widely viewed as the responsibility of all nations to exercise .
Framer Edmund Randolph summed it up best when he wrote as Attorney General :
The law of nations , although not specifically adopted by the Constitution , is essentially a part of the law of the land .
Its obligation commences and runs with the existence of a nation , subject to modification on some points of indifference .
This explains how the constitution can extend jurisdiction to the judiciary over admiralty and maritime affairs without such a power having been specifically delegated to national government to exercise .
Maritime jurisdiction extends itself to rivers and canals that are directly connected with the sea , and which may allow navigating for purpose of carrying out trade .
Bodies of water where there is no direct connection to the sea or channels unusable for trade do not fall within this jurisdiction .
Furthermore , it is the custom of nations to treat vessels ’ as exclusive property under the jurisdiction of the nation whose flag they sail under .
Said Webster : “ A vessel on the high seas , beyond the distance of a marine league from the shore , is regarded as part of the territory of the nation to which she belongs , and subjected , exclusively to the jurisdiction of that nation . ”
This is the authority for Congress to require vessels to carry necessary medications for seamen , or tax seamen wages to provide for hospitalization in case of sickness .
None of this has anything to do with the Commerce Clause .
Marshall in Gibbons v. Ogden points out that the marine power of the nation and the regulation of foreign commerce were placed in the same hands :
“ The provisions of the law respecting native seamen and respecting ownership are as applicable to vessels carrying men as to vessels carrying manufactures , and no reason is perceived why the power over the subject should not be placed in the same hands . ”
In United States v. South - Eastern Underwriters ( 1944 ) , Justice Hugo Black made a rather lame attempt to show the regulation of commerce included the business of insurance by completely misconstruing what Alexander Hamilton wrote in his 1791 opinion on the constitutionality of the Bank of the United States .
In footnote , Black quotes Hamilton ’s words , “ admit of little if any question ” to falsely assert Hamilton was suggesting the “ federal power to regulate foreign commerce included ‘ the regulation of policies of insurance . ' ”
Justice Black omits the important fact that Hamilton was not directly describing the regulation of foreign commerce but speaking of the nations maritime power for which such insurance over shipping falls .
In his opinion , Hamilton said the regulation of commerce comes under four headings for which the business of insurance does not fall under because Hamilton describes the power as a taxing power with the incidental power to aid the collection ( customhouses ) :
To prohibit them ( nations ) or their commodities from our ports ( imposing prohibitory duties or embargo ) .
To impose duties on them where none existed before , or to increase existing duties on them .
To subject them to any species of custom house regulation .
To grant them any exemptions or privileges which policy may suggest ( low or no duties on particular articles or tonnage ) .
After highlighting these four proper headings of regulating foreign commerce , Hamilton argues these headings “ omits every thing that relates to the citizens , vessels , or commodities , of the United States . ”
Hamilton then goes into a laundry list of omissions that turns out to be those exact powers exercised by nations under their maritime jurisdiction , example : “ The regulation of policies of insurance ; of salvage upon goods found at sea ; and the disposition of such goods . ”
And , “ [o ] f the power of regulating the manner of contracting with seamen , the policies of ships on their voyages , &c. of which the act for the government and regulation of seamen in the merchant service is a specimen . ”
It is obvious from Hamilton ’s list of omitted powers he was speaking of those powers exercised over marine affairs since little , if any , had any direct application to dry land .
Additionally , these powers had no connection to laying taxes on articles of import which Hamilton himself had acknowledged was the sole method of regulating commerce .
Maritime jurisdiction would exist without any mention of regulating commerce because it is a custom of all mercantile nations for the national power to manage affairs of the sea .
On the other hand , Congress could not regulate commerce without being specifically empowered because otherwise it would have been a reserved power remaining with each State to exercise like they had after the revolution and because it is n’t a part of law of nations .
Conclusion
The power to proscribe what articles of imports shall be restricted or prohibited through the laying of duties on imports for purposes of protecting or promoting American manufactures and the rules for executing this power was the only power acknowledged , approved and adopted .
Rules for executing this power can include customhouse regulations , pilotage , forfeitures , laws against smuggling ( avoiding customs ) , navigation points , etc .
Because the power acts only on commercial intercourse “ between ” separate powers , limits the power to importation and anything that could burden the introduction of imports through taxes .
Only Congress is authorized to burden the introduction of foreign imports .
The sole purpose behind the regulation of commerce “ between ” powers being for the promotion or protection of manufactures against foreign competition dispels the judicial fable of internal economic activities or markets of States is related to the commercial intercourse “ between ” them .
This explains why Congress never showed any interest over internal commercial activities among the States or their markets as evidenced by the lack of any laws over the subject or acts of acquiring and maintaining vital data over commerce among the States .
On the other hand , the entire interest of the nation , as a nation , was with foreign commerce where rules were made and statistics kept .
As a consequence of the power to regulate commerce among the States being void of any affirmative powers for Congress to exercise over the States , and because the power is limited to laying a tax on imports , the power cannot be appealed to in order to make any act of Congress over markets or commerce of the States necessary and proper .
For the court to deny the purpose , custom and usage of the term “ to regulate commerce ” “ between ” States and nations in order to continue empowering Congress with greater authority over the States to do what is forbidden is repugnant to the Constitution .
Finally , I ’ll leave the last word to Justice Story :
“ If the constitution is to be only what the administration of the day may wish it to be , and is to assume any and all shapes which may suit the opinions and theories of public men , as they successively direct the public councils , it will be difficult , indeed , to ascertain what its real value is .
It cannot possess either certainty , or uniformity , or safety .
It will be one thing today , and another thing tomorrow , and again another thing on each succeeding day .
The past will furnish no guide , and the future no security .
“ It will be the reverse of a law , and entail upon the country the curse of that miserable servitude so much abhorred and denounced , where all is vague and uncertain in the fundamentals of government . ”
How Do I Know When My Exhaust System Needs Repairing ?
As the evidence that Comcast is doing something untoward with BitTorrent and other traffic on its network has mounted , the cable company has tried clumsily to fend off accusations of wrongdoing .
The latest developments come in the wake of several conference calls held by the ISP in which it attempted to make a case for its practice of sending forged TCP reset packets to interfere with some P2P traffic .
Timothy B. Lee , who is a regular contributor to the Tech Liberation Front blog as well Ars Technica , was invited to sit in on one of yesterday 's conference calls , along with folks from a handful of think tanks .
According to Tim , the Comcast engineer on the call said that the Lotus Notes problems were a known side effect of Comcast 's traffic shaping practices , one the company was trying to fix .
The engineer also " seemed to implicitly " concede that the accounts about the forged packet resets were accurate .
Delaying as a blocking tactic
The company still claims that it is is n't blocking BitTorrent and other P2P traffic , just " delaying it . "
In a statement given to Ars earlier today , a Comcast spokesperson denied that the company blocks traffic .
" Comcast does not block access to any Web sites or online applications , including peer - to - peer activity like BitTorrent , " the spokeperson told Ars .
" Our customers use the Internet for downloading and uploading files , watching movies and videos , streaming music , sharing digital photos , accessing numerous peer - to - peer sites , VOIP applications like Vonage , and thousands of other applications online .
We have a responsibility to provide all of our customers with a good Internet experience and we use the latest technologies to manage our network so that they can continue to enjoy these applications . "
Comcast VP of operations and technical support Mitch Bowling put it this way .
" We use the latest technologies to manage our network so that our customers continue to enjoy these applications .
We do this because we feel it's our responsibility to provide all of our customers with a good Internet experience . "
Another Comcast executive told the New York Times that the company " occasionally " delays P2P traffic , " postponing " it in some cases .
His rather clumsy analogy was that of getting a busy signal when making a phone call and eventually getting through after several attempts .
" It will get there eventually , " is the takeaway message .
That 's a distinction without any meaning .
If someone is preventing my calls from going through and giving me a busy signal , the effect is the same .
At the time I am trying to make the call , it 's being actively blocked ; calling it " delayed " is merely an exercise in semantics .
Comcast is , in effect , impersonating the busy signal and preventing the phone at the other end from ringing by issuing TCP reset packets to both ends of a connection .
What 's particularly troublesome is that Comcast 's FAQ leaves customers with the impression that all content will flow unfettered through its network .
One entry states that Comcast engages in " no discrimination based on the type of content , " saying that the ISP offers " unfettered access to all the content , services , and applications " on the Internet .
Another FAQ entry informs customers that Comcast does not " block access to any Web site or applications , including BitTorrent . "
What did I do wrong ?
Comcast 's attempts to clarify its traffic shaping practices are having the opposite effect of what the company intends .
As is the case with its nebulous bandwidth caps , customers can find themselves running afoul of what appears to be an arbitrary limitation imposed by the ISP .
As a result , Comcast 's customers do n't really know that what they 're paying for , aside from a fast connection that may or may not give them access to the web sites and applications they want .
The company 's public comments on the traffic shaping issue are intended to leave the impression that , like the bandwidth cap issue , this only affects a handful of bandwidth hogs .
But judging by the comments we 've seen from our readers and on other sites , there are either a lot more bandwidth hogs than Comcast leads us to believe , or the company 's traffic shaping practices extend further than is being disclosed .
Without some transparency from the ISP , we 're left to guess .
Comcast has a handful of options to choose from .
The company can own up to what it 's doing and tell customers how to avoid running afoul of its BitTorrent regulations .
Comcast could also continue on its current course , keeping its opaque traffic management practices in place .
The cable giant 's best option may be dropping the practice of sending false TCP reset packets altogether .
There are a couple of reasons that the third option may be the best choice for Comcast .
First , it may be against the law .
An Indiana University PhD student and Cnet contributor believes that the illicit reset packets may violate state laws in Alabama , Connecticut , and New York against impersonating another person " with intent to obtain a benefit or to injure or defraud another " ( language from the New York law ) .
In sending out the spoofed packets , Comcast is impersonating the parties at either end of the connection .
When the market can't sort things out
Legal concerns aside , Comcast is providing net neutrality advocates with plenty of ammunition .
Comcast is not running a neutral network right now , and its traffic shaping choices are degrading the broadband service of many a Comcast customer .
In a perfect free market , customers would be free to pack up in leave Comcast for greener and more open broadband pastures , but the competitive landscape in the US does n't always provide that kind of choice .
More than a few Comcast customers are faced with the choice of Comcast or dial - up , leaving them with the Hobson 's choice of hoping their data packets can evade Comcast 's traffic shaping police or not having broadband service at all .
On Monday a federal appeals court ruled that Caterpillar Inc , the Illinois - based company that has supplied several bulldozers used by the Israeli Defence Force ( IDF ) in house demolitions in the occupied territories , could not be sued as to do so would bring the judiciary into conflict with the executive branch of the US government .
A panel of three judges argued that the legal action could not have gone to trial " without implicitly questioning , and even condemning , United States foreign policy towards Israel " .
Corrie was killed on March 16 2003 by a 60 - tonne Caterpillar D9 bulldozer in Rafah , Gaza , as she was attempting to prevent the home of a Palestinian pharmacist being razed .
She was wearing a fluorescent orange vest and according to witnesses in full view of the bulldozer operator .
Her parents , along with four Palestinian families left bereaved in actions involving similar bulldozers , began legal proceedings in 2005 .
Lawyers acting for the families alleged that Caterpillar had sold the machines to the Israeli government on a commercial basis .
The firm knew , or should have known , that the equipment was going to be used to demolish homes in violation of international law in incidents that at times led to the deaths of innocent people , they said .
Caterpillar , with supporting evidence from the US government , argued that the machines had been paid for by the Pentagon as part of the government 's military aid to Israel .
Cindy Corrie , Rachel 's mother , told the Guardian that she was extremely disappointed by the court 's decision .
" Clearly there were war crimes committed here and we will continue to challenge Caterpillar and the US government . "
Mariah LaHood , a lawyer with the Centre for Constitutional Rights who acted on the case , questioned the role the US government played in giving evidence favourable to Caterpillar .
" Is n't there a responsibility to permit justice to be sought on behalf of a US citizen killed in a foreign country ? "
Caterpillar said in a statement that it was pleased with the ruling .
" We are hopeful it will bring to an end what has been a lengthy but fair judicial process . "
Corrie 's story received widespread attention at the time of her death .
Her emails home describing her experiences as a peace activist in the run-up to her death were turned into a stage play , My Name is Rachel Corrie , coedited by Alan Rickman and the Guardian journalist Katharine Viner .
Among the other families included in the legal suit were that of Mahmoud Omar al - Shu 'bi from Nablus in the West Bank .
In April 2002 a D9 bulldozer destroyed his home in the middle of the night in an action by the IDF , allegedly without warning .
His father Umar , sisters Fatima and Abir , brother Samir and sister - in - law Nabila who was pregnant , as well as their three children aged four , seven and nine , were all killed .
The sale of Caterpillar equipment to Israel caused controversy within the Church of England after the synod voted last year to disinvest from firms profiting from Israel 's occupation of Palestinian territory .
However , it later decided to keep its shares in the company .
Poll : 41 % of Americans unable to name any GOP candidates Muriel Kane
Published : Wednesday October 24 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This The Pew Research Center has released a new poll showing that 41 % of Americans responding are unable to come up with the names of any Republican presidential candidates without prompting .
In contrast , only 19 % are unable to name even one Democratic candidate .
According to the Pew report , " The Republicans ' disengagement , if not disillusionment , with the campaign is borne out by the fact that many more Republicans are able to recall unprompted the names of Democratic frontrunners Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama than can name Rudy Giuliani and other leading GOP candidates . "
Hillary Clinton 's name was offered unprompted by 78 % of all respondents and Barack Obama 's by 62 % .
However , no more than 45 % came up with the name of GOP frontrunner Rudy Giuliani -- and even among Republicans the figure was only 57 % .
This level of awareness of Democratic candidates is far beyond what it was at the equivalent point in the 2004 campaign , while the awareness of Republican candidates is generally similar to that in past elections , resulting in what Pew describes as " a sizable partisan gap in campaign interest . "
Pew 's figures further show that throughout the course of 2007 , about half of respondents have indicated they are following news about the candidates either very or fairly closely -- roughly the same as for other major news stories .
In the past , that level of interest has developed only with the start of the presidential primaries .
Despite this , 55 % of respondents indicated they were finding the presidential campaign " dull " and 66 % said elections were " too long , " while only 41 % consider the press is doing a good or excellent job of covering the campaign .
When asked what particular areas they would like to see better covered by the press , the greatest number , 77 % , asked for more about the candidates ' positions on issues .

£ 500 m Mumbai palace for family of six and 600 staff High - rise era attacked as dawn of ' new vulgarity '
In the most conspicuous sign yet of India 's unprecedented prosperity , the country 's richest man , Mukesh Ambani , is building a new home in the financial hub of Mumbai : a tower block palace with helipad , health club and six floors of car parking .
The building , named Antilla after a mythical island , will have a total floor area greater than Versailles and be home for Mr Ambani , his mother , wife , three children and 600 full - time staff .
Draped in hanging gardens , the building will have a floor for a home theatre , a glass - fronted apartment for guests , and a two - storey health club .
As the ceilings are more than twice as high as a normal building 's , the 173 m ( 570 ft ) 27 - storey tower will be equivalent to a building 60 - storeys high .
With property prices rocketing , the building is already worth more than £ 500 m .
It is expected to be ready for the Ambanis to move in next year .
The family currently live in a 14 - storey building , Sea Wind .
Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Group is India 's largest private company , with interests in oil , retail and biotechnology .
The 50 - year - old became the country 's first rupee trillionaire this week , taking his net worth to £ 14bn .
The Indian economy is soaring : yesterday it posted annual growth of 9.4 % .
Friends of the Ambanis told the Guardian that the billionaire 's new home was " comparable to those owned by friends such as Lakshmi Mittal " .
The UK - based steel tycoon bought the most expensive house in London last year , paying £ 60 m for a place in Kensington Palace Gardens .
Urban planners say Mr Mukesh 's home is part of a global rush for tall buildings that has seen skyscrapers spring up in Dubai , Shanghai and Seoul .
In India , planning rules and a historic antipathy to unrestrained materialism has meant that this race to touch the sky has largely bypassed the cities , which are more notable for their shantytowns and dilapidated housing .
But experts say the next wave of skyscraper proposals could come in India .
" Our wealthiest citizens used to hide their money , " said Hafeez Contractor , a Mumbai - based architect .
" They would not drive their Mercedes , they lived in small apartments .
Even Mr Ambani's father lived in a small block of flats .
They were afraid of the taxman .
But that attitude has gone ; Mukesh has made his money , and good for him if he wants to flaunt it . "
Mr Contractor said it is only a matter of time before Mumbai was littered with high - rises : " We have to find homes for people , and in a small area that means building skyscrapers . "
While some idolise the riches and glamour of India 's " Jazz Age " , others are uncomfortable with the " new vulgarity " .
Only last week India 's prime minister , Manmohan Singh , called on business leaders to " eschew conspicuous consumption " and " be role models of moderation " .
Praful Bidwai , a newspaper columnist , said the divide between rich and poor was obscene .
" Mr Ambani is building an edifice to his own ego , " he said .
" It will not go down well with the public .
There is growing anger about such absurd spending . "

We have all heard Lord Acton ’s admonition , " Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely . "
Most of us believed this referred only to absolute rulers , but its scope is much more widespread .
Today the U.S. is the only superpower ; as such it has almost absolute power .
It can go anywhere , wipe out any state , conquer any army , and ruin any economy with economic sanctions .
As such it sees itself as the existential authority , the chosen state , the " city on a hill " that can bring democracy , freedom , and virtue to the world , if necessary through the barrel of a gun .
While the neocons have emphasized the use of power to bring enlightenment to the world , especially the Middle East , the U.S. has a long history of bearing the " White Man ’s Burden , " of conquering foreign territories , either to bring Christianity to Roman Catholic Filipinos , to annex pagan Hawaii , to install friendly governments in Central America or to rid Cuba of the colonial rule of Spain by installing our benevolent governance .
Manifest destiny , a staple of our social studies courses in grade school , led us to remove the uncivilized and pesky " redskins " to fulfill our goal of a coast - to - coast empire .
Between the First World War and the Second , the United States , despite its isolationist foreign policy , never hesitated to send our military abroad .
From 1912 to 1933 American marines controlled Nicaragua ; Haiti was occupied from 1915 to 1934 ; from the time of the Spanish - American war until Castro assumed control , the U.S. played a major role in Cuba .
Under a U.S. budget bill of 1901 , the Platt Amendment reserved the right to intervene in Cuban political , economic and military affairs ; it also secured the permanent right to Guantánamo Bay as an American military base .
When our leaders today talk about the necessity of maintaining a strong force in Mesopotamia to " pacify " the area , they are following a long tradition .
With the exception of Latin America where , under the Monroe Doctrine , America has imposed its will for at least a century , the U.S. used to be looked up to around much of the world .
Currently , as we have extended our reach to their neighborhoods , we are hated in most states .
The U.S. military has bases in about 130 countries and on all continents except Antarctica , where we have three " research " stations .
Why were we attacked on September 11 , 2001 ?
Having stationed our troops in Saudi Arabia , not far from Mecca , enraged the Muslim world .
Or as the CIA would say , it was " blowback . "
President George W. Bush claimed that al - Qaeda attacked the U.S. because its followers hated our freedoms and our democracy .
If so , why have the terrorists never attacked Switzerland , Sweden , Canada , or Norway ?
Except for the incident in 2001 when the French foiled an attack on the U.S. Embassy , that country has been free of terrorism since 1995 .
Those countries follow democratic practices and provide freedom for their people , yet they remain untouched by Islamic extremists .
Certainly they have as dissolute and erotic societies as the U.S. Terrorists have ignored them because they are not making a military presence felt in the Muslim world .
Except for the attack on the American Embassy , the French have escaped any Islamic violence by staying out of the Middle East and , especially , out of the Iraq conflict .
At least in part because of their long traditions of neutrality , Switzerland and Sweden have refrained from sending troops to the Middle East .
Neither Canada nor Norway supported the U.S. in this invasion  although their recent participation in the NATO effort in Afghanistan may make them subject to an Islamic attack in the future .
Why did terrorists attack London and Madrid ?
Britain suffered several terrorist strikes from native Muslims offended by its participation in Iraq .
Spain was subject to the bombing of its trains by Islamic fanatics because it too had soldiers helping the Americans in Iraq .
Those spared terrorism had no troops on Muslim soil , nor were they following policies hostile towards Arabs .
The first instinct of people when attacked is to retaliate .
The natural reaction after September 11 was to go after the perpetrators .
Turning the other cheek by withdrawing our forces from abroad is very difficult , if not politically impossible .
Many people believe that , since we have the power , we should use it to go after those who brought down the World Trade Center .
None of the serious candidates for president argues for bringing all our troops home .
In fact , no one is suggesting removing our troops from the Middle East .
Repositioning is the furthest that the any one of the candidates will go .
Although it may be right and proper to argue that we should remove our troops from foreign soils and adopt a " Fortress America " stance , given the temptation of nearly absolute power this policy would require self - restraint greater than the body politic permits .
If , as seems likely , the U.S. continues to maintain a military presence in that part of the world , it will provide ample targets for Islamic groups to attack and will also provide an irresistible incentive to bring chaos and terror to our shores .
Democracy is swell but it does not permit policies that appear to be weak .
" We must not cut and run " say the politicians and many voters .
Our strength traps us into an " in your face " policy .
Assuming that a Democrat wins the 2008 presidential election , will he or she fly in the face of charges of cowardice and weakness to pull our troops out of Iraq and , ultimately , from Afghanistan ?
I fear not .
How long must we spill our blood and treasure in this quagmire ?
It has already gone on far too long and cost too many lives .
The Bill of No Rights
As seen in " Rights , Responsibilities , and Communitarianism , " the existence of a right implies a duty in others .
The opposite of a duty is liberty , which implies no right in others .
The identification of things for which there are no rights is thus an additional means of securing Liberty .
The following is a list of no rights ( or " non rights " ) that has been circulating on the Internet .
It is sometimes said to have been written by State Representative Mitchell Kaye from Cobb County , Georgia .
Now I am informed that it was really written and copyrighted by an active Libertarian from Mississippi , Lewis Napper .
I have altered the common version slightly , inserting punctuation and changing the wording in a couple of places , but it is substantially identical to the circulating list , including the exhortation at the end .
We the sensible people of the United States , in an attempt to help everyone get along , restore some semblance of justice , avoid any more riots , keep our nation safe , promote positive behavior and secure the blessings of debt free liberty to ourselves and our great great - great grandchildren , hereby try one more time to ordain and establish some common sense guidelines for the terminally whiny , guilt ridden , delusional , and other liberal bedwetters .
We hold these truths to be self - evident :
That a whole lot of people were confused by the Bill of Rights and are so dim that they require a Bill of Non Rights .
ARTICLE I --
You do not have the right to a new car , big screen TV or any form of wealth .
More power to you if you can legally acquire them , but no one is guaranteeing anything .
ARTICLE II --
You do not have the right to never be offended .
This country is based on freedom , and that means the freedom for everyone , not just you !
You may leave the room , turn the channel , express a different opinion , etc. , but the world is full of idiots and probably always will be .
ARTICLE III --
You do not have the right to be free from harm .
If you stick a screwdriver in your eye , learn to be more careful .
Do not expect the tool manufacturer to make you and all your relatives independently wealthy .
ARTICLE IV --
You do not have the right to free food and housing .
Americans are the most charitable people to be found , and will gladly help anyone in need but we are quickly growing weary of subsidizing generations of professional couch potatoes who achieve nothing more than the creation of another generation of professional couch potatoes .
ARTICLE V --
You do not have the right to free health care .
That would be nice but , from the looks of public housing , we 're just not interested in government run health care .
ARTICLE VI --
You do not have the right to physically harm other people .
If you kidnap , rape , intentionally maim or kill someone , do n't be surprised if the rest of us want to see you fry in the electric chair .
ARTICLE VII --
You do not have the right to the possessions of others .
If you rob , cheat or coerce away the goods or services of other citizens , do n't be surprised if the rest of us get together and lock you away in a place where you still wo n't have the right to a big screen TV or a life of leisure .
ARTICLE VIII --
You do n't have the right to demand that our children risk their lives in foreign wars to soothe your aching conscience .
We hate oppressive governments and wo n't lift a finger to stop you from going to fight , if you 'd like .
However , we do not enjoy parenting the entire world and do not want to spend so much of our time battling each and every little tyrant with a military uniform and a funny hat .
Editor 's Comment : Libertarians tend to think that if we leave everyone else alone , they will leave us alone .
Unfortunately , the world often does not work that way .
If we see a crime being committed in daily life , we have a moral obligation , if we are able , to do something about it .
This is a non-contractual duty of commission .
The same principle works in the life of the Nation , with qualifications of prudence that sometimes it is better not to participate even in a righteous war .
The original phrasing of this non-right , about an " aching conscience , " seems to be directed a people who might think other nations had a duty to stop the Nazis from conquering and murdering people .
A dictator with a " funny hat " is dismissive of what tyrants can do , and allowing them to get away with it for too long means that the strength derived from their success endangers us more directly .
This goes back to the maxim of Machiavelli , that " allowing a disorder to continue , " is not prudent or sensible statecraft .
ARTICLE IX --
You do n't have the right to a job .
All of us sure want all of you to have one , and will gladly help you in hard times , but we expect you to take advantage of the opportunities of education and vocational training laid before you to make yourself useful .
ARTICLE X --
You do not have the right to happiness .
Being an American means that you have the right to pursue happiness -- which by the way , is a lot easier if you are unencumbered by an over abundance of idiotic laws created by those of you who were confused by the Bill of Rights .
If you agree that a understanding of no rights is necessary to " Secure the Blessings of Liberty , " I strongly urge you to refer this to as many people as you can , or link it from your own webpages .
No , you do n't HAVE to ....
Nothing tragic will befall you should you NOT refer it .
I just think it 's about time common sense is allowed to re-emerge in our society and flourish again .
Thank you !!!

Jason Lewis made his final journey along the Thames
Jason Lewis , from Dorset , has travelled over five continents , two oceans and a sea to be the first to circle the globe on human power alone .
After dodging crocodiles and breaking both his legs , he travelled up the River Thames in his pedal - powered boat .
On Saturday , an overwhelmed Mr Lewis carried his boat over Greenwich 's Meridian Line , where the quest began .
I came over the line and I was choked
Jason Lewis
He said he thought it was " never going to happen " , but was " overwhelmed to have returned in one piece " .
" It feels fantastic .
I came over the line and I was choked .
I blubbed like a baby , " Mr Lewis said .
" Everything I 've been doing for the last 13 years has been in some way connected with this trip and tomorrow that will be no more . "
The former cleaner , from Askerswell , received a royal welcome from the Duke of Gloucester when he finally crossed the Meridian Line from east to west at London 's Royal Observatory with his trusted Devon - built 26ft ( 8 m )
Moksha .
Among the hundreds of onlookers was his father Col Sebert Lewis , who helped his son with the navigation , " sleeping with a paper and pen in case of emergencies " .
He said : " It has been like one long military exercise lasting 13 years .
" I felt like I was on the expedition . "
The Duke of Gloucester - who is the patron of " Expedition 360 " - launched and named the craft in 1994 .
Mr Lewis went on to say the " low points " had included breaking both legs in the USA and being arrested by Egyptian authorities , who thought he was a spy .
He added : " There have been many high moments .
To be honest , it 's always good to reach the other side of an ocean .
" But if it was just about the physical challenge I would have got bored .
" The ' why ' question changed over the years .
" I started circumnavigating the world ... but it became more about using the expedition as an educational tool to enhance children 's learning experience in the classroom . "
Rest planned
Mr Lewis , who completed the journey in 16 legs and stayed at various points around the world in - between , also made the trip in kayaks , mountain bikes and in - line skates .
He was 26 when he began his 46,000 - mile ( 74,000 km ) journey on 12 July 1994 , with his colleague , Steve Smith , who decided to leave the expedition in Hawaii in 1999 .
Mr Lewis arrived in Britain at 2100 BST on Sunday , 30 September after spending a day crossing the English Channel from Calais , France , on the 16th and final leg of the trip .
He said he planned to rest on Sunday , before starting a career organising " mini expeditions " for young people and giving talks about climate change .
The Moshka will now be put into retirement as he takes his well earned rest .
If only .
Emoticons , the smiling , winking and frowning faces that inhabit the computer keyboard , have not only hung around long past their youth faddishness of the 1990s , but they have grown up .
Twenty - five years after they were invented as a form of computer - geek shorthand , emoticons — an open - source form of pop art that has evolved into a quasi- accepted form of punctuation — are now ubiquitous .
No longer are they simply the province of the generation that has no memory of record albums , $ 25 jeans or a world without Nicole Richie .
These Starburst - sweet hieroglyphs , arguably as dignified as dotting one ’s I ’s with kitten faces , have conquered new landscape in the lives of adults , as more of our daily communication shifts from the spoken word to text .
Applied appropriately , users say , emoticons can no longer be dismissed as juvenile , because they offer a degree of insurance for a variety of adult social interactions , and help avoid serious miscommunications .
“ In a perfect world , we would have time to compose e-mails that made it clear through our language that we are being cheerful and friendly , but we ’re doing these things hundreds of times a day under pressure , ” said Will Schwalbe , an author of “ Send : The Essential Guide to Email for Office and Home ” ( Knopf , 2007 ) , written with David Shipley , the deputy editorial page editor at The New York Times .
Mr. Schwalbe said that he has seen a proliferation of emoticon use by adults in delicate and significant communications .
“ People who started using them ironically are now using them regularly , ” he said .
“ It ’s really in the last couple of years that the emoticon has come of age . ”
In fact , a recent Yahoo study indicates that the days in which emoticons were considered as unacceptably casual as flip - flops at work are over .
Paranoia at the Highest Level
by Eric Margolis by Eric Margolis
DIGG THIS
Last week , CIA finally released a series of top - secret files known in the agency as the " Crown Jewels " that covered its illegal activities from 1960 — 1970’s .
The much - anticipated dossier offered few surprises and confirmed much of what was already well known .
Still , the files officially confirmed CIA plans in the 1960 ’s to assassinate foreign leaders like Fidel Castro , Congo ’s Patrice Lumumba , the Dominican dictator Rafael Trujillo , and Vietnam ’s President Ngo Dinh Diem .
It also revealed extensive agency spying on Americans , illegal wiretaps and often embarrassingly amateurish cloak and dagger operations that contrasted unfavorably with rival KGB ’s more professional performance .
Unfortunately , many other secret operations that violated US law — an attempt to kill Egypt ’s president , Gamal Abdel Nasser , overthrowing governments in Syria and Central America , or waging war in Indonesia — remained classified .
Former CIA directors , Adm. Stansfield Turner and Dr. James Schlesinger , both told me in the 1980 ’s that they had wanted to reveal far more information about CIA than had then come out , but were not able to do so .
Revelations of CIA ’s " family jewels " certainly bring back lots of Cold War nostalgia .
Americans , however , are asking how these past CIA illegalities compare to today ’s violations of the Constitution and federal laws by US national security agencies .
The answer : today ’s violations by CIA , FBI , NSA ( National Security Agency ) and various Pentagon intelligence operations — that include massive wiretapping , data mining , and communications intercepts , kidnapping , and torture — are far more serious and widespread .
However , their justification , the alleged threat to national security by " Islamic terrorists , " is tiny compared to the huge threat posed by the Soviet Union ’s massive nuclear arsenal during the Cold War .
CIA ’s dramatic historic revelations bring us to the shadowy figure of the real power in the White House , US Vice President Dick Cheney .
It was Cheney who engineered the Iraq war , is urging attacks on Iran and Syria , and has championed CIA ’s domestic surveillance programs .
He sees America surrounded and infiltrated by enemies .
In these respects , Cheney bears a remarkable resemblance to the fabled Cold Warrior , and US intelligence grand master , James Jesus Angleton .
Angleton rose through US wartime OSS intelligence to become director of CIA ’s powerful counterintelligence division .
He was extremely close during the 1950 ’s to the senior British MI6 intelligence officer , Kim Philby , who headed up British intelligence in Washington and was the nexus of Anglo - American intelligence operations .
The charming , brainy Philby fed Angleton a steady stream of disinformation and lies .
Angleton fell totally under Philby ’s spell ; some intelligence sources hinted at an even more intimate relationship , though no proof has ever emerged .
Whatever the case , Philby used Angleton and made a complete fool of him .
In 1963 , Philby defected to Moscow after being finally unmasked as a high - level KGB agent by a Russian defector .
By then , the damage was done .
Philby ’s treachery inflicted huge damage on US and British intelligence , nearly bringing the demoralized MI6 to its knees .
Philby ’s betrayal , so brilliantly captured in semi-fictional form by the writer John le Carré in Tinker , Tailor , Soldier , Spy and Smiley ’s People , caused something to snap in Angleton ’s tormented brain — just as the 9/11 attacks appear to have transformed Dick Cheney from a capable but colorless , mostly apolitical senior bureaucrat into an ardent militarist , sword - bearer of America ’s far right , and soul - mate of Israel ’s rightwing Likud Party .
By the late 1960 ’s , the brilliant , eccentric , Angleton , whose job was to find enemy agents within US intelligence , had became deeply disturbed and paranoid .
Angleton trusted no one .
He came to believe genuine Soviet defectors were KGB plants , and KGB plants legitimate defectors .
He also become an active " asset " or at least very close ally of Israel ’s Mossad , and a champion of Israel ’s cause in Washington .
On orders of President Lyndon Johnson , Angleton unleashed notorious operation " CHAOS " that conducted highly illegal CIA surveillance of American anti-war and civil rights groups .
He accused FBI of being infested by Soviet moles and blocked CIA - FBI cooperation .
By the 70’s , Angleton was seeing enemy spies everywhere .
He suspected Henry Kissinger , and accused Canadian prime ministers Lester Pearson and Pierre Trudeau of being Soviet agents .
He claimed Britain ’s PM Harold Wilson , Sweden ’s PM Olof Palme , and Germany ’s chancellor Willy Brandt were also KGB agents .
Angleton ’s galloping paranoia caused him to believe CIA was filled with Soviet moles .
Similarly , Cheney concluded today ’s CIA is unreliable , filled with " defeatists " and " Arabists , " and could not be trusted with national security .
Cheney and old ally Donald Rumsfeld created two " special " intelligence offices in the Pentagon linked to Israeli intelligence designed to bypass CIA and feed the White House and Congress bogus reports justifying invading Iraq and waging the so - called " war on terrorism . "
Angleton created his own internal intelligence unit within the agency that spied on its co-workers and fed his growing dementia .
Agency morale collapsed .
This period of fierce mutual suspicions , snooping on employees , double or triple agents , and ruined careers became aptly known as " a wilderness of mirrors . "
Angleton , a hero of America ’s hard right , kept warning the White House the Soviets were about to attack .
In 1974 , the mentally unstable Angleton was forced to retire , having nearly wrecked CIA and severely damaged relations with key US allies .
Now , many in official Washington are worrying about how to retire the increasingly paranoid figure of Vice President Cheney , who , like Angleton , appears to have lost touch with reality in a wilderness of mirrors .
The Best of Eric S. Margolis
Republicans are n't exactly racing to defend President Bush 's assertion of executive privilege against Congress 's investigation of his firing of nine U.S. attorneys .
This leaves former political director Sara Taylor and Harriet Miers , former White House counsel , facing possible contempt sanctions .
If this sword of Damocles drops , an important constitutional showdown between the branches might well reach the Supreme Court .
Rather than run from this fight , supporters of the constitutional system ought to stand firm with the president ....
Overprotective Parents May Be Responsible For Fatality Increase Posted by Pile ( 9862 views ) [ E - Mail link ] [ Bad Parents ]
Parents who forbid their children to cross roads alone may be preventing them from learning vital lessons in how to avoid being run over , according to an analysis of official figures in England .
The proportion of children who are never allowed to cross a road unsupervised has risen each year for the past five years .
But the number of child pedestrians being killed is also rising .
Department for Transport research found that , last year , almost half ( 49 per cent ) of parents with children aged 7 - 10 said that they never allowed them to cross the road on their own , compared with 41 per cent in 2002 .
Over the same period , the number of child pedestrians killed in that age range rose from 10 to 18 .
The overall rate of road deaths for all children under 16 rose by 20 per cent between 2005 and 2006 , from 141 to 169 .
The Parliamentary Advisory Council for Transport Safety said that parents needed to understand the risks of being overprotective .
Rob Gifford , the council ’s director , said : “ Parents should consider whether forbidding their children from crossing the road unaccompanied is exposing them subsequently to additional risk .
They may not acquire the skills they need .
“ Children need to learn to cross the road on their own and the answer may be to encourage them to do so initially while being watched . ”
He said that parents who tried to avoid exposing their children to road danger by driving them to school were contributing to a vicious circle .
Drivers became less accustomed to seeing children on the streets and were therefore less prepared for the possibility of one suddenly stepping into the road .

Darwinism and its effects on society .
Posted by Master Bates on 2007-09 - 11 13:26:07 for the love of all that is good in the world , what happens when you take a lion that has been born and brought up in a zoo and throw it into the wild ?
it dies because its waiting around where the truck that dropped it off was looking for a zoo keeper to drop off a plate of beef .
its too stupid to catch its own food .
this my firends is darwinism .
strong survive , dumbasses that eat too many marbles in kindergarden die off and dont get to reproduce .
the problem is that while kids do learn and make decisions their parents are too stupid to let them learn about lifes real lessions IE .
COMMON SENCE PEOPLE !
with all this new crap about healthy children and " good parenting " i wonder what happen to the tried and true methods .
i was brought up where we didnt have safety toys , everything did not have rounded corners , there was lead paint and bicycling with out helmets and i drove in a car in a regular seat unbuckled in the back without losing life or limb .
protecting your children is one thing but to be completely isolating them from any resonable self taught knowledge is lunacy .
you dont let them cross the road by themselves they are never gonna learn to look both ways .
i crossed the road one day in my younger days and almost got ran down by a suburban .... horn blasting and the driver screaming profanities at me made sure the message hit home that i almost died that day .
let your children be children instead of caged animals that you let out only when closely supervised .
if they get hurt they learn , theres an old saying that for every scar on a body is a lession learned and i believe it still holds true .
stupid parents = stupid kids .
Posted by ned on 2007-09 - 12 13:34:45
I totaly agree ,
In fact I beleive spanking should be used , if the kids cause trouble , j walk , steal , then its simple , you spank em .
I dont mean just the kids , you spank the parents to , right there on the street , in the mall , whereever , and you spank them barebutted too , and hard , really really hard so they learn their lessons well .
I also believe spanking should be re-instated in prisons and schools , inmates , kids misbehave , , , you spank them silly till their red in the face !!!
yeah , damn right .

Given this past weekends exciting President ’s Cup tournament in Montreal I thought it would n’t it be great to see that kind of team golf format every week .
The players are pumped and help support their team members .
There is a totally different and refreshing strategy when playing team golf .
And the crowds are much more supportive of the home team of golfers rather then just the one or two guys leading a normal tournament .
So here ’s what I would do if I had enough money to just throw around .
I would create the International League of Team Golf or ILTG .
Given that tournaments would only be played Thursday to Sunday there is no reason why this could n’t be an international league .
Teams would consist of 12 players from no specific country .
Each team would have a uniform and would have a “ home ” course .
Approximately half the season would be home tournaments and half the season away tournaments .
There could be an East and West Conference with 12 teams in each conference , possibly 2 divisions of 6 teams in each conference and the top 8 teams in each conference would make the playoffs .
The finals would be between the East and West conference winners for the ILTG Champions Cup .
The benefits of this league would be :
Team Golf is a more exciting format
It would give golfers who are n’t in the PGA or EPGA a chance to make a living at golf
Individual golfers do n’t have to be as good as Tiger Woods for this league to be successful .
The teams just have to be competitive .
It would truly be an international league showing both North American style courses and traditional links courses .
Fans would have a team to follow and cheer for rather then just one individual
Of course there would be some sort of collective bargaining agreement between the owners and players .
There would be trades and free agents .
I think it would be a very exciting league to watch and attract many more viewers that normally would n’t watch a golf tournament .
Let me know what you think ?
Editor 's note : CNN agreed not to use the full names of the family members in this article due to concern for their safety .
Youssif , now in an apartment in Los Angeles , will need months of treatment .

LOS ANGELES , California ( CNN ) --
Youssif , the 5 - year - old Iraqi boy who was savagely burned by masked men , arrived in the United States late Tuesday with his family -- the first step toward his lengthy rehabilitation .
For a family whose lives were tortured by the random and brutal violence of Iraq , the sheer magnitude of stepping onto American soil was surreal .
His parents were rendered speechless .
Quite simply they grinned from ear to ear .
They did n't need to speak .
The joy on their faces was palpable .
They had traveled more than 7,500 miles to get help for their son , from war - torn central Baghdad to coastal Los Angeles .
It marked the first time the family had ever left their homeland , let alone flown on a plane .
" Oh my God , it 's so green .
Am I in heaven ? "
Youssif 's mother , Zainab , said after arriving in Chicago before the family flew on to Los Angeles where Youssif will be treated .
" I feel like I 'm in a dream , " said his father , whom CNN has agreed not to name .
" Someone needs to pinch me . "

The family left Amman , Jordan , early Tuesday en route to the United States .
The night before they departed , Youssif did n't sleep a wink .
He woke the family up extra early , shouting , " Let 's go !
Let 's go ! "
Youssif , his parents and his infant sister , Ayaa , finished their 24 - hour journey in Los Angeles around 11 p.m. PT Tuesday .
They were greeted by members of the Children 's Burn Foundation , the nonprofit organization that paid for the family 's travel and is covering all of Youssif 's medical bills .
Youssif playfully fought with his father over the luggage cart in Los Angeles International Airport .
" I want to push it .
I want to push it , " he said gleefully .

The family was then whisked away to the two - bedroom , two - bath apartment where they will be staying during Youssif 's treatment .
It 's a stark contrast to their humble one - room home in a rundown central Baghdad neighborhood rife with violence .
There was a television , toys everywhere , and a balcony .
A crib sat in the kids ' bedroom and the kitchen even had a high - chair so that Youssif 's sister would be able to eat with them at the table .
For the first time in a long time , the family laughed out of pure joy .

When Youssif walked into the new home , he glanced at the plush wall - to - wall carpet and ordered everyone to take their shoes off .
Do n't get it dirty , he said .
His mother opened a door in the master bedroom and marveled at the walk - in closet .
" Is this a bedroom ?
It ca n't be a closet , " she said .
Standing on the apartment 's balcony , Youssif 's father turned to Barbara Friedman , executive director of the Children 's Burn Foundation .
" You see America on television , but you never imagine or dream that you will ever be here . "
He paused , tears in his eyes .
" It 's more than paradise . "
This is the same father who walked the streets of Baghdad seeking help for his boy .
He went to the Health Ministry and even wrote letters to the Iraqi parliament and the prime minister 's office for help .
No one would listen .
Desperate , he turned to CNN .
" Look at what these monsters did to my boy , " he said .
Watch how Youssif was transformed from a smiling boy to a disfigured victim
CNN and CNN.com first reported his story on August 22 after the family risked their lives to tell his story :
On January 15 , masked men grabbed Youssif outside his home , doused him with gas and set him on fire .
The story prompted an outpouring of support to get help for Youssif .
More than 12,000 CNN.com users have contributed to a fund set up by the Children 's Burn Foundation .
In recent weeks , the foundation worked feverishly with the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad to secure the necessary paperwork for the family 's travel to the United States -- something that typically takes months , if not years , to do .
Youssif and his family are expected to be in the United States for six months to a year while he undergoes multiple surgeries and extensive rehabilitation .
They are to meet with Dr. Peter Grossman , the plastic surgeon who will perform the operations , Wednesday afternoon .
Grossman works for the nearby Grossman Burn Center and is donating his services to Youssif 's cause .
On this day , the family was simply ecstatic to have finally made it here .
They arrived on September 11 -- the date the United States will always remember as a day of unspeakable horror .
But for this family , 9/11 will always mean something much different :
Hope and a better future for their son -- and a newfound love for America .
" This is a moment that will stay with us forever , " Youssif 's dad said .
Friedman smiled broadly and said , " For us too . "
