When Glenn Beck told listeners of his radio show on March 2 that they should “ run as fast as you can ” from any church that preached “ social or economic justice ” because those were code words for Communism and Nazism , he probably thought he was tweaking a few crunchy religious liberals who did n’t listen to the show anyway .
Instead he managed to outrage Christians in most mainline Protestant denominations , African - American congregations , Hispanic churches , and Catholics–who first heard the term “ social justice ” in papal encyclicals and have a little something in their tradition called “ Catholic social teaching . ”
( Not to mention the teaching of a certain fellow from Nazareth who was always blathering on about justice … )
He also managed to bring the National Council of Churches–once a powerful umbrella organization for Christian churches–out from hibernation , in the form of a withering response from leader Peg Chemberlin .
Progressive evangelical leader Jim Wallis , taking a page from his conservative counterparts , is calling for Christians to boycott Beck ’s shows .
And Beck has given the folks who come up with slogans every week for church signs plenty of material to work with .
After initially doubling - down on his statements , Beck is now trying to walk them back somewhat , making a distinction between religious injunctions for individuals to help the poor and the broader notion that society has an obligation to care for the “ least of these . ”
But as religious scholar and blogger Mark Silk points out , that ’s not what Beck ’s own tradition –the Latter - Day Saints –believes :
“ Not to belabor the point , but the Judeo - Christian tradition from which Beck ’s Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints springs expects the poor to be provided for as a matter of public law .
And indeed , in the days when the LDS Church ran its corner of North America as a theocracy , that ’s just what it did . ”
And Philip Barlow , a professor of Mormon history at Utah State University , told the New York Times that , “ One way to read the Book of Mormon is that it ’s a vast tract on social justice , ” adding , “ A lot of Latter - Day Saints would think that Beck was asking them to leave their own church . ”
The term “ Social Gospel ” has been considered a dirty phrase by conservatives for a while now .
But if that ’s what Beck meant , he has quickly learned the consequences of sloppy language .
And in any event , he has certainly discovered the dangers of publicly practicing theology without a license .

" Noch viel stärker als die sichtbare Verschuldung von Bund , Ländern und Kommunen schlagen die Schulden , die in unserem Sozialstaat versteckt sind , zu Buche “ , sagte Bernd Raffelhüschen der Tageszeitung „ Die Welt “ ( Montagausgabe ) .
Seinen Angaben zufolge liegt die gesamte Schuldenlast der öffentlichen Haushalte bei 6,2 Billionen Euro statt der offiziellen 1,9 Billionen Euro .
Sozialleistungen in Gefahr
Schuldenrekord mit Haushalt verdoppelt
Rückendeckung von Köhler
Raffelhüschen rechnet zur Gesamtverschuldung oder „ Nachhaltigkeitslücke “ auch jene finanziellen Rücklagen hinzu , die der Staat eigentlich bilden müsste , um die künftigen Ausgaben finanzieren zu können .
„ Vor allem versprechen wir mehr Sozialleistungen , als wir uns in Zukunft werden leisten können “ , sagte der Ökonom .
Seit 2008 ist die Gesamtschuldenlast laut Raffelhüschen von 167 Prozent des Bruttoinlandsprodukts ( BIP ) auf 249 Prozent im laufenden Jahr in die Höhe geschnellt .
Zur Begleichung dieser tatsächlichen Schuldenlast müsste jeder Bundesbürger – vom Neugeborenen bis zum Rentner – bis zum Lebensende zusätzlich zu seinen Steuern und Sozialabgaben jeden Monat 279 Euro an den Staat abführen , hat der Leiter des Forschungszentrums Generationenverträge berechnet .
Davon entfielen 193 Euro auf die verdeckte Verschuldung und 86 Euro auf die sichtbare Staatsschuld .
Lediglich mit neun Euro schlägt dabei laut Raffelhüschen die Wirtschaftskrise zu Buche .
Nach seinen Worten ist die hohe Verschuldung „ nicht der Krise geschuldet , sondern Ausdruck der Tatsache , dass wir seit Jahrzehnten über unsere Verhältnisse leben “ .
Der Bundestag hatte am Freitag den Bundeshaushalt mit einer Rekordverschuldung beschlossen .
Das am Freitag verabschiedete Gesetz ermächtigt die Regierung zur Aufnahme neuer Kredite im Volumen von 80,2 Milliarden Euro .
Damit verdoppelt die schwarz - gelbe Koalition in ihrem ersten Etat den bisherigen Schuldenrekord aus dem Jahr 1996 .
Mit dem Geld werden die wegbrechenden Steuereinnahmen aufgefangen .
Außerdem steigen die Ausgaben für den Arbeitsmarkt und die Krankenversicherung .
Trotz klammer Kassen sieht sich Finanzminister Wolfgang Schäuble ( CDU ) mit immer neuen Finanzwünschen seiner Kabinettskollegen konfrontiert .
Schäuble reagierte darauf mit einem Rüffel : „ Die Etatwünsche der Kolleginnen und Kollegen tragen – zurückhaltend formuliert – dem Ernst der Lage noch nicht in vollem Umfang Rechnung “ , sagte Schäuble der „ Bild am Sonntag “ .
Er kündigte daher an , er werde „ in dieser Woche im Kabinett in aller Klarheit daran erinnern , dass die Einhaltung von Stabilitätspakt und Grundgesetz eine Aufgabe der ganzen Regierung zum Besten unseres Volkes ist “ .
Für Schäuble hat die Rückführung der Staatsverschuldung bei der Aufstellung des Haushalts für das kommende Jahr oberste Priorität .
„ Wenn es richtig ist , dass 2010 das letzte Krisenjahr ist , dann müssen wir 2011 entsprechend den Vorgaben des Euro - Stabilitätspakts und der Schuldenbremse im Grundgesetz die Staatsverschuldung zurückfahren “ , erklärte er. Das bedeute , dass der Bund das strukturelle Defizit bis 2016 um jährlich zehn Milliarden Euro zurückführen müsse .
Auf den Bundeshaushalt kämen damit einschneidende Änderungen zu.Auch Bundespräsident Horst Köhler verlangte am Wochenende im FOCUS einen Abbau der Staatsschulden .
Ein Ende des schuldengetriebenen Konsums sei zwar schwierig , aber unumgänglich .
Microsoft Research Software Radio Platform for Academic Use
This page contains information on how you can build a powerful software radio research platform based on Microsoft Research Software Radio technology and the Academic Kit .
First , please understand that this is not a Microsoft product .
It comes with no warranties and we disclaim all liabilities .
If this ever causes any one any harm , you will indemnify Microsoft .
( In another word , you do it at your own risk !
Do n’t touch it if you do n’t know what you are doing . )
Further , no intellectual property is granted ; all IPs belong to Microsoft or their respective owners .
It can only be used for non-commercial academic research and education purpose .
If you are okay with this , please read the Microsoft Research Software Radio Academic Kit License Agreement carefully .
We require signature from someone who has the authority on behalf of your institution .
( We wo n’t accept forms signed by a student , post - doc , or in some case , junior faculty . )
Once you return the form , we will connect you to a local make - to - order vendor company , who can supply you with the hardware , either component - by - component or as an integrated system ( “ turn - key ” solution ) .
Please note that we ( Microsoft ) do not make or sell Sora hardware .
The vendor company makes hardware according to Sora spec , and charges you a fee to cover the components and assembling ( plus S&H ) .
You may need to acquire the following items :
1. A Multi-core PC
A Shuttle XPC with RCB and RF plugged in .
We recommend you use a high - end PC ( workstation - class or server - class ) with a performance desktop or server CPU ( at least quad - core ) .
We suggest the latest Intel Core i7 or Xeon ( “ Nehalem ” or later ) .
Some quad - core Core i5 may work , but we have n’t tested it extensively .
Here is the list of CPU ( and motherboard chipset ) models that we know will work : Intel core i7 - 9xx ( X58 ) , i7-2600 ( H61/H67 ) , i7-3770 ( H61/H67/Z77 ) , and Xeon E5 - 16xx / 26xx ( C602 ) .
Older Intel “ Nehalem ” or “ Core 2 ” quad - core CPU should also work .
We have n’t tested any AMD processor .
The PC should have at least one free full - size PCIe x8 or x16 slot .
( Note that some low - budget PCs have only PCIe x1 slots or video - card - only slots .
Those wo n’t work . )
The amount of memory and disk space is less important and will depend on what you plan to do .
We recommend at least 2G RAM for single - radio and 8G RAM for MIMO .
2. RCB ( Radio Control Board )
Original RCB ( internal PCIe card )
RCB is the most important component in Sora hardware .
We now have two types of RCB .
The original RCB is a full - length full - height PCIe card designed to be plugged in a PCIe slot inside the PC .
Due to the space limitation , it is almost always used in a single - radio setting ( like in the Shuttle XPC picture above ) .
The ballpark estimate for the original RCB is RMB ¥10,000 ( US $ 1.7K ) .
The actual amount will be set by the vendor and will be affected by component market price and also currency exchange rate .
Sora MIMO Kit ( PCIe external enclosure )
The MIMO RCB comes as a PCIe external enclosure box .
The 1U , half - depth , and rack - mountable enclosure houses the MIMO RCB , 4 - way RAB , and up to 4 RF daughter - boards .
It connects to the PC with one or two external PCIe extension cables .
3. Driver and SDK
We can download the software from codeplex .
It runs on 64 - bit Windows 7 or 8 .
Starting from SDK 2.0 , Sora now supports MIMO .
The SDK also includes the Brick source code of a working implementation of 802.11n .
SDK v1.8 upgrade includes a rewritten 802.11a/b/g baseband using Brick .
The baseband source code is now highly modular , very easily to understand and modify .
SDK v1.7 upgrade supports 64 - bit Windows 7 and 64 - bit Windows 8 .
( All previous versions required Windows XP . )
Wi -Fi visual decoding with DbgPlot
SDK v1.6 upgrades the UMX API and supports a new Reflection mechanism to integrate user - mode SDR modem into Windows network stack .
It also includes a new modular programming library , called Brick , for high - performance DSP programs , and two new powerful tools : DbgPlot for real - time monitoring and debugging and UMXSDRab as an interactive 802.11a / b modem application based on UMX Reflection .
SDK v1.5 is a major facelift from previous v1.0 and v1.1 .
It fixes almost all bugs known to us ( like the bluescreens ) and substantially changes the implementation to provide a more flexible , robust , and friendly developing environment .
In particular , we have a new ethread scheduler , a full - fledged user - mode extension , and a set of new tools for testing hardware and tuning RF parameters ( gains , I / O imbalance , central frequency ) , etc .
The PDF version of the Sora Manual is here .
You must have RCB hardware installed before you can load and run the driver and SDK .
4. Radio Front-ends
If you want to conduct wireless experiments over - the - air , you will need to connect the Academic Kit with a Radio Front - end ( RF daughter - board ) .
( Of course you must follow your local laws and regulations about radio frequency use and obtain license if necessary . )
Sora Kit ( single- radio RCB - RAB -RF combo )
The RF daughter - board connects to the RCB through a well - defined Fast Radio Link interface .
In principle , you can obtain any third - party RF daughter - boards and play mix - and - match .
But unless you want to experiment with the hardware , we recommend you get one of the supported RCB - RAB - RF combos when you buy the RCB .
Many RF daughter - boards require a RAB ( RF Adapter Board ) to work with RCB , and we have worked with our RCB vendor to provide several types of RAB for some common RF daughter - boards .
For MIMO , you should almost always obtain the whole Sora MIMO Kit ( integrated RCB , RAB , and 2 - 4 RF daughter - boards in one enclosure box ) .
It is extremely challenging to get MIMO hardware right .
The following is a list of third - party Radio Front - ends that are known to work with the Academic Kit .
We will update the list when more become available and have been tested .
Again , we ( Microsoft ) do not make or sell any Radio Front - end , nor do we endorse any particular brands or makers .
Note 1 . Single channel setting only .
Not compatible with Sora MIMO Kit .
If you have or know of a Radio Front - end that is proven to work with our Academic Kit , please let us know .
5 . Tools , samples , applications
Interstate 70 near Glenwood Springs remains closed after a rockslide smashed through a bridge and dumped boulders the size of tractor trailers on the highway early Monday just west of the Hanging Lake Tunnel .
Detours of up to 200 miles could last for days , if not weeks , before the 17 - mile stretch of interstate re-opens , the Colorado Department of Transportation said this afternoon .
No injuries or damage to vehicles were reported .
CDOT geologists made the two - hour hike each way to inspect the slide area this afternoon , finding that it remained unstable .
Officials will meet Tuesday to decide a course of mitigation and estimate when the interstate might reopen .
Gov. Bill Ritter this afternoon declared a disaster emergency in order to ask for money from the Federal Highway Administration to help pay for repairs .
A similar slide in the same area in 2004 cost $ 700,000 to repair .
“ This is very similar in size , but we think it has caused even more damage than that one did , ” said CDOT spokeswoman Stacy Stegman .
In 2004 , I - 70 reopened the next day , but there was not unstable rock that had to be addressed above the slide , however , according to CDOT .
Ritter ’s order called on all state departments and agencies to take whatever actions necessary to speed the work .
“ The immediate repair and reconstruction of the damaged highway is vital to the security , well - being , and health of the citizens of the state of Colorado , ” Ritter stated in his emergency declaration .
The long detours for truckers will mean extra costs and delays , an industry official said .
“ You could n’t have picked a worse location , because there is no work - around .
That is one of the real choke points in the system , ” said Greg Fulton , president of the Colorado Motor Carriers Association .
“ It is not five or 10 miles .
This is a fairly significant impact on our end . ”
CDOT will implement emergency contracting procedures and meet with contractors over the next couple of days as crews develop repair plans .
As many as 20 boulders , ranging from 3 feet to 10 feet in diameter , hit the interstate .
CDOT estimates the largest rock weighs 66 tons and some are as big as semi trucks .
The largest stone weighed 66 tons .
About 120 feet of steel guard rail and 100 feet of median were damaged .
One hole in the bridge is estimated at about 10 - by - 20 feet .
All lanes are closed from Glenwood Springs east to the town of Dotsero between mile markers 116 and 125 .
Up to 25,000 vehicles a day travel that section .
Alternate routes are in effect :
From westbound I - 70 exit at U.S. Highway 40 / Empire to Colorado Highway 13 and back to I - 70 ; exit in Silverthorne and take Colorado Highway 9 to U.S. Highway 40 and Colorado Highway 13 ; exit at Wolcott / Colorado Highway 131 to U.S. Highway 40 and Colorado Highway 13 .
Arpaio shrugs off his arrest of an innocent American girl
If you 're Hispanic in Maricopa County , Sheriff Joe 's goons have probable cause to arrest you on suspicion of being undocumented .
Hey , they can always release you later .
That 's the word from the elephant 's mouth after an MCSO raid on four area McDonald 's yesterday that netted an American citizen , Viridiana Ramirez , who was cuffed and held for four hours as she pleaded with MCSO thugs that she was born in this country and could prove it .
What was Arpaio 's response to the news that his Kris Kobach - trained deputies has violated the civil rights of a single mother and terrorized her no end ?
" That 's just normal police work , " he shrugged in a news conference following the raid .
" Sometimes you do have probable cause , you do take people in for questioning , and they 're released . "
So it 's arrest 'em if they 're brown first , and sort 'em out later .
False arrest and imprisonment be damned .
Perhaps the U.S. Department of Justice and the FBI should follow Arpaio 's way of doing things .
There 's probable cause enough out there that Arpaio 's deprived others of their civil rights and done so under the color of law .
So arrest him , and sort out the details later .
And when he whines about it , play a video of Arpaio 's statement above .
Just do so when I 'm around so I can watch the look on his flaccid face .
Never has this county been so in need of federal intervention as it is now .
Where are the feds ?
The DOJ's Civil Rights Division has been probing the MCSO for over a year .
What is Attorney General Eric Holder waiting for , a gold - trimmed invitation to act ?
U.S. Attorney Dennis Burke has a grand jury ongoing , investigating Arpaio 's alleged criminal misdeeds .
The same question goes for those involved in that inquiry .
How many more innocent people have to be arrested ?
How many more cases of racial profiling do there have to be ?
How many women will have their jaws busted and their arms broken , as has been the case for immigrant women held in Arpaio 's jails ?
It 's not just women , of course .
Last year Julio Mora , an American citizen , and his legal resident father were cuffed and held for three hours during the MCSO 's violent immigration raid on Handyman Maintenance Inc. , a county vendor .
Mora and his dad are now suing Sheriff Joe and the county .
Ms. Ramirez should do the same , and extract her financial pound of flesh for Arpaio 's misdeeds .
Arpaio acts as if he and his beige - shirts are above the law .
They should not be .
It 's time for the feds to finally lay it down .
We 're all tired of waiting .
Tired of the excuses and dithering .
Weary of watching yet another mother weep because of the way she was treated by Arpaio 's roughneck Hispanic - hunters .
â€ œI ainâ€™t running for preacher , â€ Republican presidential candidate Phil Gramm snarled to religious right activists in 1995 when they urged him to run a campaign stressing moral themes .
Several months later , despite Grammâ€™s fund raising prowess , the Texas conservative finished a desultory fifth place in the Iowa caucuses and quickly dropped out of the race .
Since then , few candidates have made Grammâ€™s mistake .
Serious contenders for the office recognize that the role and scope of the modern presidency cannot be so narrowly confined .
Todayâ€™s candidates are running enthusiastically for national preacherâ € " and much else besides .
In the revival tent atmosphere of Barack Obamaâ€™s campaign , the preferred hosanna of hope is â€ œYes we can !â€ 
We can , the Democratic front - runner promises , not only create â€œa new kind of politicsâ€  but â€œtransform this country , â€ â€œchange the world , â€ and even â€œcreate a Kingdom right here on earth.â€ 
With the presidency , all things are possible .
Even though Republican nominee John McCain tends to eschew rainbows and uplift in favor of the grim satisfaction that comes from serving a â€œcause greater than self - interest , â€  he too sees the presidency as a font of miracles and the wellspring of national redemption .
A president who wants to achieve greatness , McCain suggests , should emulate Teddy Roosevelt , who â€œliberally interpreted the constitutional authority of the officeâ€  and â€œnourished the soul of a great nation .
â€ President George W. Bush , when passing the GOP torch to his former rival in March , declared that the Arizona senator â€ œwill bring determination to defeat an enemy and a heart big enough to love those who hurt .
â€
Hillary Clinton , meanwhile , suggests she is â€œready on Day 1 to be commander in chief of our economy .â€ 
The chief executive of the United States is no longer a mere constitutional officer charged with faithful execution of the laws .
He is a soul nourisher , a hope giver , a living American talisman against hurricanes , terrorism , economic downturns , and spiritual malaise .
Heâ € " or sheâ € " is the one who answers the phone at 3 a .m. to keep our children safe from harm .
The modern president is Americaâ€™s shrink , a social worker , our very own national talk show host .
Heâ€™s also the Supreme Warlord of the Earth .
This messianic campaign rhetoric merely reflects what the office has evolved into after decades of public clamoring .
The vision of the president as national guardian and spiritual redeemer is so ubiquitous it goes virtually unnoticed .
Americans , left , right , and other , think of the â€œcommander in chiefâ€ as a superhero , responsible for swooping to the rescue when danger strikes .
And with great responsibility comes great power .
Itâ€™s difficult for 21st - century Americans to imagine things any other way .
The United States appears stuck with an imperial presidency , an office that concentrates enormous power in the hands of whichever professional politician manages to claw his way to the top .
Americans appear deeply ambivalent about the results , alternately cursing the king and pining for Camelot .
But executive power will continue to grow , and threats to civil liberties increase , until citizens reconsider the incentives we have given to a post that started out so humble .
Minimum Leader
It wasnâ€™t supposed to be this way .
The modern vision of the presidency couldnâ€™t be further from the Framersâ€™ view of the chief executiveâ€™s role .
In an age long before distrust of power was condemned as cynicism , the Founding Fathers designed a presidency of modest authority and limited responsibilities .
The Constitutionâ€™s architects never conceived of the president as the man in charge of national destiny .
They worked amid the living memory of monarchy , and for them the very notion of â€œnational leadershipâ€ raised the possibility of authoritarian rule by a demagogue ready to create an atmosphere of crisis in order to enhance his power .
The constitutional office they designed gave the president an important role , but heâ€™d have â€ œno particle of spiritual jurisdiction , â€ the 69th essay of The Federalist Papers tells us .
In Federalist No. 48 , James Madison assured Americans that under the proposed Constitution the â€œexecutive magistracy is carefully limited , both in the extent and the duration of its powers .
â€ 
Indeed , the very pseudonym the Federalistâ€™s authors chose , â€ œPublius , â€ says something about how hostile Founding - generation Americans were to the idea of one - man rule .
Publius Valerius Poplicola , a hero of the Roman revolution in the 5th century B.C. , was famous in part for passing a law providing that anyone suspected of seeking kingship could be summarily executed .
Never were constitutional limitations more essential than when it came to using military power .
Early Americans were no strangers to national security threats ; in 1787 the U.S. was a small frontier republic on the edge of a continent occupied by periodically hostile great powers and Indian marauders .
Yet the Constitution limited emergency powers and sharply rejected the idea that the president was above the law .
â€ œIn no part of the Constitution , â€ Madison wrote in 1793 , â€œis more wisdom to be found , than in the clause which confides the question of war or peace to the legislature , and not to the executive department .â€ 
In any other arrangement , â€ œthe trust and the temptation would be too great for any one man.â€ 
That sentiment crossed party lines .
As Chief Justice John Marshall wrote in 1801 , â€ œthe whole powers of war being by the Constitution of the United States vested in Congress , the acts of that body can alone be resorted to as our guides.â€ 
Today Americans expect their president to pound Teddy Rooseveltâ€™s â€œbully pulpit , â€ whipping the electorate into a frenzy to harness power against perceived threats .
But the Framers viewed that sort of behavior as fundamentally illegitimate .
In fact , the president wasnâ€™t even supposed to be a popular leader .
As presidential scholar Jeffrey K. Tulis has pointed out , in the Federalist the term leader is nearly always used pejoratively ; the essays by Madison , Alexander Hamilton , and John Jay in defense of the Constitution begin and end with warnings about the perils of populist leadership .
The first Federalist warns of â€œmen who have overturned the liberties of republicsâ€ by â€œpaying obsequious court to the people , commencing demagogues and ending tyrants , â€ and the last Federalist raises the specter of a â€œmilitary despotismâ€ orchestrated by â€œa victorious demagogue.â€ 
Instead of stoking public demands for action , the chief magistrate was expected to resist â€ œthe transient impulses of the peopleâ€  and use his veto to keep Congress within its constitutional bounds .
That role didnâ€™t require much speechifying .
Early presidents rarely spoke directly to the public ; from George Washington through Andrew Jackson , they averaged little more than three speeches per year , with those mostly confined to ceremonial addresses .
In his first year in office , by comparison , President Clinton delivered 600 .
In the early State of the Union addresses to Congress , presidents knew better than to adopt an imperious tone .
After his third SOTU , Washington wrote that â€œmotives of delicacyâ€ had deterred him from â€œintroducing any topic which relates to legislative matters , lest it should be suspected that [ I ] wished to influence the questionâ€ before Congress .
Yet the deference shown by Washington and his successor John Adams didnâ€™t go quite far enough for our third president , Thomas Jefferson , who thought their practice of speaking before the legislature in person smacked of the British kingâ€™s â€ œSpeech From the Throne.â€  Jefferson instead inaugurated a new tradition of delivering the annual message in writing .
For 112 years , that Jeffersonian tradition held sway , until the power - hungry Woodrow Wilson delivered his first State of the Union in person .
The 19th century did see presidents occasionally taking independent action of enormous consequences : Jefferson purchased Louisiana without congressional approval , Madison seized West Florida in 1810 , Andrew Jackson governed as an irritable populist , and Abraham Lincoln expanded presidential power dramatically throughout the course of the cataclysmic Civil War .
Yet taken as a whole , the 19th - century presidency was a pale shadow of the plebiscitary office we know today .
In a 2002 study tracking word usage through two centuries of SOTUs and inaugural addresses , political scientist Elvin T. Lim noted that in the first decades under the Constitution presidents rarely mentioned poverty , and the word help did not even appear until 1859 .
Nor did early presidents subscribe to the modern notion that itâ€™s all â€œabout the childrenâ€ ; they rarely even mentioned the little buggers .
But Lim found that â€ œPresidents Carter , Reagan , Bush , and Clinton made 260 of the 508 references to children in the entire speech database , invoking the governmentâ€™s responsibility to and concern for children in practically every public policy area.â€ 
George Washington did mention kids in his seventh annual message , lamenting â€ œthe frequent destruction of innocent women and childrenâ€ by Indian raiders .
But that was a far cry from Bill Clinton in 1997 , who declared in the State of the Union that â€œwe must also protect our children by standing firm in our determination to ban the advertising and marketing of cigarettes that endanger their lives.â€ 
Wail to the Chief
A little - remembered vignette from the 1992 presidential race underscores how far weâ€™ve traveled from the Framersâ€™ unassuming â€œchief magistrateâ€â € " and how infantile our politics have become along the way .
The scene was the campaignâ€™s second televised debate , held in Richmond , Virginia ; the format , a horrid Oprah - style arrangement in which a hand - picked audience of allegedly normal Americans got to lob questions at the candidates , who were perched on stools , trying to look warm and approachable .
Up from the crowd popped a ponytailed social worker named Denton Walthall , who demanded to know what George H.W. Bush , Bill Clinton , and H. Ross Perot were going to do for us .
â€ œThe focus of my work as a domestic mediator is meeting the needs of the children that I work withâ€ ¦and not the wants of their parents , â€  Walthall said .
â€ œAnd I ask the three of you , how can we , as symbolically the children of the future president , expect the three of you to meet our needs , the needs in housing and in crime and you name it.â€ 
One wonders how some of the more irascible presidents of old would have reacted at the sight of a grown man burbling about childish necessities to the prospective national father .
Yet under the hot lights of the 1992 campaign , Ross Perot said heâ€™d cross his heart and take Walthallâ€™s pledge to meet Americaâ€™s infantile needs , whatever those were .
Bill Clinton , being Bill Clinton , pandered .
And Bush 41 spluttered through his answer thusly :
â€ œI mean Iâ € " I think , in general , letâ€™s talk about theseâ € " letâ€™s talk about these issues ; letâ€™s talk about the programs , but in the presidency a lot goes into it .
Caring isâ€ ¦thatâ€™s not particularly specific ; strength goes into it , thatâ€™s not specific ; standing up against aggression , thatâ€™s not specific in terms of a program .
So I , in principle , Iâ€™ll take your point and think we ought to discuss child careâ € " or whatever else it is .â€ 
That wasnâ€™t just an example of the Bush familyâ€™s famous locution problems ; itâ€™s hard not to stammer when faced with the limitless and bewildering demands the public places on the presidency .
How did we go from a reticent constitutional officer to the modern commander in chief , a figure who continually shifts back and forth between gushing empathy and military bluster , often within the same speech ?
As Tony Soprano might have put it , whatever happened to Calvin Coolidge , the strong , silent type ?
There is no single explanation for the presidencyâ€™s growth .
New communication technologies such as radio and television played a role , as did growing material progress , which made Americans less willing to suffer inconveniences and more receptive to the belief that public problems could be solved with collective action .
Yet in each key period of the presidencyâ€™s growth , we see a familiar pattern : expansionist ideology meeting practical opportunity in the form of successive national crises .
The 100 - Year Emergency
Much of whatâ€™s wrong with American government today can be traced to the Progressive Era , that period of reformist backlash against the Industrial Revolution that dominated the decades surrounding the turn of the 20th century .
As the Progressives saw it , if the Constitution stood in the way of necessary reforms , then too bad for the Constitution .
â€ œWe are the first Americans , â€ a young scholar named Woodrow Wilson wrote in 1885 , â€ œto hear our own countrymen ask whether the Constitution is still adapted to serve the purposes for which it was intended ; the first to entertain any serious doubts about the superiority of our institutions as compared with the systems of Europe.â€ 
The Progressives were â€ œthe nearest to presidential absolutists of any theorists and practitioners of the presidency , â€ wrote Raymond Tatalovich and Thomas S. Engeman in their 2003 book The Presidency and Political Science : Two Hundred Years of Intellectual Debate .
For the new centuryâ€™s reformers , power wielded for national greatness was benign , checks on such power perverse .
The Progressives had no use for the restrained oratorical traditions of the 19th century ; it was the presidentâ€™s job to move the masses , unifying them behind calls for bold executive action .
Their model and embodiment was Teddy Roosevelt , whom the Progressive journalist and New Republic founder Herbert Croly described as a â€œsledgehammer in the cause of national righteousness .â€ 
When T.R. took the stage at the 1912 Progressive Party convention , he foreshadowed Obamaâ€™s quasi-religious fervor and McCainâ€™s bellicosity , barking , â€ œTo you who strive in a spirit of brotherhood for the betterment of our Nation , to you who gird yourselves for this great new fight in the never - ending warfare for the good of humankind , I say in closing .
â€ ¦We stand at Armageddon , and we battle for the Lord!â€ 
The most astute among the Progressives recognized that , given the American publicâ€™s congenital resistance to centralized rule , a sustained atmosphere of crisis would be necessary to sell the expansion of White House power .
Two world wars and one Great Depression did the trick nicely .
T.R.â€™s activist , celebrity presidency heralded the coming of a new sort of chief executive , one who would evermore be the center of national attention , the motive force behind American government .
With his expanded power , Roosevelt busted trusts , carried a big stick throughout the Americas with a newly imperial U.S. Navy , and issued nearly as many executive orders as all of his predecessors combined .
Woodrow Wilson then proved what Progressives had long hypothesized : that soaring rhetoric combined with the panicked atmosphere of war could concentrate massive social power in the hands of one person .
Over the course of his presidency he helped create the Federal Reserve , nationalized railroads , and used the Espionage and Sedition Acts ( along with more than 150,000 vigilantes ) to carry out the most brutal campaign against dissent in U.S. history .
But it took FDR to eliminate the last remaining vestiges of the modest presidency .
Roosevelt used Wilsonâ€™s Trading With the Enemy Act to shut down all U.S. banks in 1933 , grabbed the power to approve or prescribe wages and prices for all trades and industries , and authorized the FBI to spy on suspected subversives .
He changed the Supreme Court from a bulwark against presidential overreach to an enabler .
By the end of his 12 - year reign , FDR had firmly established the president as national protector and nurturer , one whose performance would be judged in terms of what political scientist Theodore Lowi has identified as the modern test of executive legitimacy : â€œservice delivery .â€ 
In his 11th State of the Union address , FDR conjured up a second Bill of Rights , one whose guarantees would include â€œa useful and renumerative jobâ€  and the â€œright of every farmer toâ€ ¦a decent living .
â€
Depression - era economic controls and war - driven centralization had turned the American system of government , in Lowiâ€™s words , into â€œan inverted pyramid , with everything coming to rest on a presidential pinpoint.â€ 
War was the health of the presidency during the long twilight struggle against the Soviet Union as well .
â€œThe worse matters get , â€ Harry Trumanâ€™s adviser Clark Clifford told him in 1948 , â€ œthe more is there a sense of crisis .
In times of crisis , the American citizen tends to back up his president .â€ 
During the Cold War , presidents used the all - purpose rationale of national security to justify spying on their political enemies .
Richard Nixon might have been the most notorious abuser , with a series of dirty tricks and flagrant offenses that led to his downfall , but his predecessors also wielded the presidential bludgeon with gusto .
When American steel companies raised prices in 1962 , John F. Kennedy declared privately that â€ œthey fucked us , and now weâ€™ve got to fuck them , â€ then ( along with his attorney general , brother Bobby ) ordered up wiretaps , Internal Revenue Service audits and early - morning raids on steel executivesâ€™ homes .
During the 1964 presidential race , Lyndon Johnson used the CIA to obtain advance copies of Barry Goldwaterâ€™s campaign speeches , and the FBI to bug Goldwaterâ€™s plane .
In the pre-Watergate age of the heroic presidency , public trust in government was at its height , and mainstream scholars lauded the presidency as an earthly manifestation of the living God .
As political scientist Herman Finer put it in 1960 , the office was â€ œthe incarnation of the American people in a sacrament resembling that in which the wafer and the wine are seen to be the body and blood of Christ.â€ 
The president , Finer said , was â€ œthe offspring of a titan and Minerva husbanded by Mars.â€ 
I Hate You ; Donâ€™t Leave Me
After Vietnam and Watergate , Americaâ€™s intoxication with the imperial presidency ended with a crushing hangover .
A newly aggressive press and assertive Congress produced serial revelations of the executive abuses that blind trust had enabled .
In the bicentennial year of 1976 , Idaho Sen. Frank Churchâ€™s Committee to Study Governmental Operations With Respect to Intelligence Activities summed up the damage :
â€ œFor decades Congress and the courts as well as the press and the public have accepted the notion that the control of intelligence activities was the exclusive prerogative of the Chief Executive and his surrogates .
The exercise of this power was not questioned or even inquired into by outsiders .
Indeed , at times the power was seen as flowing not from the law , but as inherent , in the Presidency .
Whatever the theory , the fact was that intelligence activities were essentially exempted from the normal system of checks and balances .
Such executive power , not founded in law or checked by Congress or the courts , contained the seeds of abuse and its growth was to be expected .â€ 
During the Eisenhower 1950s and the JFK / LBJ 1960s , the newly ascendant conservative movement coalescing around Barry Goldwater and William F. Buckleyâ€™s National Review was the most potent source of criticism of the imperial presidency .
â€ œOthers hail the display of presidential strengthâ€ ¦simply because they approve of the result reached by the use of power , â€  Goldwater wrote in his 1964 campaign manifesto .
â€ œThis is nothing less than the totalitarian philosophy that the end justifies the means.â€ 
But enticed by the long - awaited prospect of an â€œemerging Republican majorityâ€  and turned off by the journalistic and congressional attacks on Nixon , conservatives learned to stop worrying and love the executive branch .
During the post - Watergate reform era , two senior Gerald Ford White House aides named Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld fought tooth and nail against what they felt were dangerous shackles on the executive branch , supported by a conservative commentariat that refocused its ire on the Democratic Congress and the left - leaning press .
â€ œI didnâ€™t like Nixon until Watergate , â€ National Review stalwart M. Stanton Evans once quipped .
Although Americans finally recovered their native skepticism toward power after Vietnam , Watergate , and the revelations of the Church committee , we never reduced our demands on the executive branch .
The lesson we seemed to have learned from the legacy of abuses was to trust less , ask more .
In 1998 the Pew Research Center noted that â€œpublic desire for government services and activism has remained nearly steady over the past 30 years .â€ 
Two years later , a report on a survey by NPR , the Kaiser Family Foundation , and Harvardâ€™s John F. Kennedy School of Government put it pithily : â€ œAmericans distrust government , but want it to do more .â€ 
The spirit of Denton Walthall lived on in the years leading up to the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 .
Superman Returns
The Bush administrationâ€™s extraconstitutional innovations in response to those attacks are by now all too familiar .
John Yoo , David Addington , and other members of the presidentâ€™s legal team constructed an alternative version of the national charter , a â€œneoconstitutionâ€  in which the president has unlimited power to launch war , wiretap without judicial scrutiny , and even seize American citizens on American soil and hold them for the duration of the War on Terrorâ € " in other words , indefinitelyâ € " without ever having to answer to a judge .
Conventional accounts of the post -9/11 imperial presidency emphasize the role of dedicated ideologues within the administration , men and women who had long believed that post - Watergate America had swung the pendulum too far back , jeopardizing national security .
Thereâ€™s good reason for that emphasis , but the â€œcabal of neoconsâ€ narrative risks obscuring the role that public demands have played in driving the centralization of power .
In his 2007 book The Terror Presidency , Jack Goldsmith , the former head of the presidentâ€™s Office of Legal Counsel , describes the prevailing atmosphere within the executive branch after 9/11 , one where the presidentâ€™s men were acutely aware that all eyes were on the commander in chief .
What is he doing to keep us safe ?
What more is he prepared to do ?
Goldsmith , a dissenter from the Bush administrationâ€™s absolutist theories of executive power , often clashed with Dick Cheneyâ€™s deputy David Addington , the hardest - driving supporter of those theories .
But Goldsmith understood why Addington was so unrelenting : â€ œHe believed presidential power was coextensive with presidential responsibility .
Since the president would be blamed for the next homeland attack , he must have the power under the Constitution to do what he deemed necessary to stop it , regardless of what Congress said.â€ 
That dynamic can lead to enhanced presidential power even in areas far removed from the War on Terror , as was demonstrated in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina .
In business or in government , responsibility without authority is every executiveâ€™s worst nightmare .
That was the political reality facing the Bush administration in late summer 2005 , when New Orleans was under water and desperate for assistance .
As Colby Cosh of Canadaâ€™s National Post put it at the time , â€ œthe 49 percent of Americans who have been complaining for five years about George W. Bush being a dictator are now vexed to the point of utter incoherence because for the last fortnight he has failed to do a sufficiently convincing impression of a dictator.â€ 
To be sure , the administration deserved plenty of blame for bungling the disaster relief tasks it had the power to carry out .
But it soon became clear that the public held the Bush team responsible for performing feats above and beyond its legal authority .
One almost had to feel sorry for Michael â€ œHeckuva Jobâ€ Brown ( ie ) , the disgraced former Federal Emergency Management Agency head , when he was obliged on Capitol Hill a month after the hurricane to inform an irate Rep. Chris Shays ( R - Conn . ) that in our federalist system , the FEMA chief has no power to order mandatory evacuations , or to become â€ œthis superhero that is going to step in there and suddenly take everybody out of New Orleans .
â€ â€ œThat is just talk , â€ 
Shays responded .
â€ œWere you in contact with the military ?â€ 
For a president beleaguered by public demands , seizing new powers can be an adaptive response .
Small wonder , then , that the Bush administration promptly sought enhanced authority for domestic use of the military .
Although few in the media noted the historical moment , the president received that authority .
On October 17 , 2006 , the same day he signed the Military Commissions
Act denying centuries - old habeas corpus rights to â€œenemy combatants , â€ the president also signed a defense authorization bill that contained gaping new exceptions to the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 , the federal law that restricts the presidentâ€™s power to use the standing army to enforce order at home .
The new exceptions to the act gave the president power to use U.S. armed forces to â€œrestore public order and enforce the lawsâ€ when confronted with â€œnatural disasters , â€ â€œpublic health emergencies , â€ and â€œotherâ€ ¦incidentsâ€â€ " a catchall phrase that radically expands the presidentâ€™s ability to use troops against his own citizens .
Under it , the president can , if he chooses , fight a federal War on Hurricanes , declaring himself supreme military commander in any state where he thinks conditions warrant it .
Thatâ€™s the kind of executive power grab that happens when the public demands that the president protect Americans from the hazards of cyclical bad weather .
2009 and Beyond
To understand is not to excuse :
No president should have the powers President Bush has sought and seized during the last seven years .
But after 9/11 and Katrina , what rationally self - interested chief executive would hesitate to centralize power in anticipation of crisis ?
That pressure would be hard to resist , even for a president devoted to the Constitution and respectful of the limited role the office was supposed to play in our system of government .
In the current presidential race , none of the major - party candidates comes close to fitting that description .
Aside from the issue of torture , thereâ€™s very little daylight between John McCain and George W. Bush on matters of executive power .
For her part , Hillary Clinton claims she played a key role in her husbandâ€™s undeclared war against Serbia in 1999 .
â€ œI urged him to bomb , â€  she told Talk magazine that year .
In 2003 she told ABCâ€™s George Stephanopoulos : â€ œIâ€™m a strong believer in executive authority .
I wish that , when my husband was president , people in Congress had been more willing to recognize presidential authority .â€ 
Barack Obama has done more than any candidate in memory to boost expectations for the office , which were extraordinarily high to begin with .
Obamaâ€™s stated positions on civil liberties may be preferable to McCainâ€™s , but would it matter ?
If and when a car bomb goes off somewhere in America , would a President Obama be able to resist resorting to warrantless wiretapping , undeclared wars , and the Bush theory of unrestrained executive power ?
As a Democrat without military experience , publicly perceived as weak on national security , heâ€™d have much more to prove .
As Jack Goldsmith put it in his 2007 book , â€ œFor generations the Terror Presidency will be characterized by an unremitting fear of attack , an obsession with preventing the attack , and a proclivity to act aggressively and preemptively to do so .
â€
¦
If anything , the next Democratic Presidentâ € " having digested a few threat matrices , and acutely aware that he or she alone will be wholly responsible when thousands of Americans are killed in the next attackâ€ " will be even more anxious than the current President to thwart the threat.â€ 
Law professors Jack Balkin of Yale and Sanford Levinson of the University of Texas at Austin are both Democrats and civil libertarians , so they take no pleasure in their prediction that â€ œthe next Democratic President will likely retain significant aspects of what the Bush administration has done .
â€
Indeed , they write in a 2006 Fordham Law Review article , future Democratic presidents â€œmay find that they enjoy the discretion and lack of accountability created by Bushâ€™s unilateral gambits.â€ 
Throughout the 20th century more and more Americans looked to the central government to deal with highly visible public problems , from labor disputes to crime waves to natural disasters .
And as responsibility flowed to the center , power accrued with it .
If that trend continues , responses to matters of great public concern will be increasingly federal , increasingly executive , and increasingly military .
In the years to come , many Americans will find that the results of executive action are not to their liking .
And if history is any guide , theyâ€™ll respond by vilifying the officeholder and looking for another man on horseback to set things right again .
In The Road to Serfdom , economist and political philosopher F.A. Hayek chastised the â€œsocialists of all partiesâ€ for their belief that â€œit is not the system we need fear , but the danger it might be run by bad men.â€ 
Todayâ€™s â€œpresidentialists of all partiesâ€â€ " a phrase that describes the overwhelming majority of American votersâ€ " suffer from a similar delusion .
Our system , with its unhealthy , unconstitutional concentration of power , feeds on the atavistic tendency to see the chief magistrate as our national father or mother , responsible for our economic well - being , our physical safety , and even our sense of belonging .
Relimiting the presidency depends on freeing ourselves from a mind - set one century in the making .
One hopes that it wonâ€™t take another Watergate and Vietnam for us to break loose from the spellbinding cult of the presidency .
Gene Healy , a senior editor at the Cato Institute , is the author of The Cult of the Presidency : Americaâ€™s Dangerous Devotion to Executive Power ( Cato ) , from which this essay was adapted .

Friends , please prayerfully consider the evidence you will see on Noah 's Ark .
It may not be important or necessary for you to learn of this discovery , but there are millions of people who need confirmation of biblical artifacts in order to strengthen their faith in God and the Bible .
Satan is strongly attacking this and other discoveries in order to deceive men of God 's truth .
All the false stories about finding Noah 's ark were created by Satan to " muddy the water , " and cause disbelief in the genuine .
The Real Noah 's Ark !
Top Points to Consider
It is in the shape of a boat , with a pointed bow and rounded stern .
Exact length as noted in biblical description , 515 feet or 300 Egyptian cubits .
( Egyptian not Hebrew cubit would have been known to Moses who studied in Egypt then wrote Genesis . )
It rests on a mountain in Eastern Turkey , matching the biblical account , " The ark rested . . . upon the mountains of Ararat " Genesis 8:4 .
( Ararat being the name of the ancient country Urartu which covered this region . )
Contains petrified wood , as proven by lab analysis .
Contains high - tech metal alloy fittings , as proven by separate lab analyses paid for by Ron Wyatt , then performed later by Kevin Fisher of this web site .
Aluminum metal and titanium metal was found in the fittings which are MAN - MADE metals !
Vertical rib timbers on its sides , comprising the skeletal superstructure of a boat .
Regular patterns of horizontal and vertical deck support beams are also seen on the deck of the ark .
Occupied ancient village at the ark site at 6,500 ft. elevation matching Flavius Josephus ' statement " Its remains are shown there by the inhabitants to this day . "
Dr. Bill Shea , archaeologist found an ancient pottery sherd within 20 yards of the ark which has a carving on it that depicts a bird , a fish , and a man with a hammer wearing a headdress that has the name " Noah " on it .
In ancient times these items were created by the locals in the village to sell to visitors of the ark .
The ark was a tourist attraction in ancient times and today .
Recognized by Turkish Government as Noah 's Ark National Park and a National Treasure .
Official notice of its discovery appeared in the largest Turkish newspaper in 1987 .
Visitors ' center built by the government to accommodate tourists further confirms the importance of the site .
Huge anchor stones were found near the ark and in the village Arzap , 15 miles away , which hung off the rear of the ark to steady its ride .
The ark rests upon Cesnakidag ( or Cudi Dagi ) Mountain , which is translated as " Doomsday " Mountain .
Dr. Salih Bayraktutan of Ataturk University stated , " It is a man made structure , and for sure it 's Noah 's Ark " Common Sense .
This same article also states " The site is immediately below the mountain of Al Judi , named in the Qur'an as the resting place of the Ark . "
Houd Sura 11:44
Radar scans show a regular pattern of timbers inside the ark formation , revealing keels , keelsons , gunnels , bulkheads , animal chambers , ramp system , door in right front , two large barrels in the front 14 ' x 24 ' , and an open center area for air flow to all three levels .
New , 2016 , high resolution , resistivity scans were done on the ark and reveal the same man-made elements that Ron Wyatt found in his 1985 scans .

CAUTION
About Dig Announcements
Multiple recent dig announcements have been made concerning Noah 's ark ,
but none have taken place .
Dig fees and donations have been requested .
Verify a dig permit from the government before paying money to be on a dig or to donate .
This Turkish website lists digs going back to 2014 , and as we have already searched , and none exist .
http://www.kulturvarliklari.gov.tr/TR,44150/kazi-ve-yuzey-arastirmalari-faaliyetleri.html
Yer = location and Il = city .
Province is Agri and city is Dogubayazit
Don't take the word of someone excitedly saying " we are going to have a dig this Summer . "
A government permit has to be issued first , and we know that the government
is reluctant to issue a permit for this site per the government archaeologist we work with .
Sad that we have to sound this alarm .
We lost $ 3,800.00 in a false dig announcement , and
a friend said that this friend donated $ 25,000.00 and none of it was returned , and this is just
the tip of the iceberg of money lost .

The Biblical Location
There is only one verse in the Bible which gives us a hint of where we the ark came to rest , " the ark rested ... upon the mountains of Ararat . "
Genesis 8:4 .
Where is Ararat ?
The name Ararat is a large area or ancient country covering eastern Turkey , western Iran and western Russia , as shown in yellow below .
" The name Ararat , as it appears in the Bible , is the Hebrew equivalent of ... Urartu , ancient country of southwest Asia ... mentioned in Assyrian sources from the early 13th century BC " Encyclopaedia Britanica 15th ed .
Some have mistakenly assumed the Bible meant the ark came to rest on Mount Ararat ( Agri Dagh ) , but that is not the case .
Mount Ararat is 17,000 feet tall , and is a post - Flood volcanic mountain that gained its height after the Flood , therefore there is no reason to assume it is a more likely candidate for the resting place of the ark , instead it is a less likely candidate .
The ark came to rest in the mountains of the ancient country of Urartu , not on Mt. Ararat .
The Ancient Historical Record Flavius Josephus , c. 90 AD , the famous Jewish historian stated , " Its remains are shown there by the inhabitants to this day . "
He quotes Berosus the Chaldean , c. 290 BC , who indicated tourists would take home pieces of the ark for making good - luck charms , " It is said there is still some part of this ship in Armenia , at the mountain of the Cordyaeans ; and that some people carry off pieces of the bitumen , which they take away , and use chiefly as amulets for the averting of mischiefs . "
These comments tend to indicate its location would not be in an inaccessible area .
At some point , the ark was covered by a mud and lava flow which caused future generations to lose its location .
Life Magazine 1960
The 1960 expedition to the ark found a formation whose top sides were even with ground level as seen in the photos above .
The site researched by Ron Wyatt is 18.2 miles south of Mount Ararat at the elevation of 6,524 ft. , in the " mountains of Ararat . "
A Turkish captain , Llhan Durupinar , was reviewing NATO Geodetic Survey photographs of the area in 1959 , and noticed a boat shaped formation .
Others in the U.S. then analyzed the photograph including Dr. Arthur J. Brandenberger , world famous expert in photogrammetry , who said " I have no doubt at all that this object is a ship .
In my entire career I have never seen an object like this on a stereo photo .
Even the approximate length of the object fits " The Ark File , p118 .
An expedition sponsored by a party from the U.S. included among others , Rene Noorbergen , later author of The Ark File ; and George Vandeman , evangelist , and Dr. Brandenberger .
They made a visual inspection of the site and conducted no scientific studies , only some digging and dynamiting of the ark and and mistakenly concluded this site was just an " odd geological formation . "
The expedition was expecting to find on the surface of the ark " petrified beams "
The Ark File , p126 , by digging in a few places .
An article then appeared in the September 5th , 1960 , Life magazine , shown above , revealing a very impressive aerial photo of an extremely large boat - shaped object , plus two photos taken by the expedition .
Seventeen years later in 1977 , Mr. Wyatt made his first of 24 trips to the ark , and he was impressed that this really was the remains of Noah 's Ark !
In the research he performed over the next 15 years , Mr. Wyatt successfully performed metal detection tests and subsurface radar scans of the site , and he proved this site really IS the mud-and - lava covered remains of Noah 's Ark !
Above : Ron Wyatt in 1977 wanted to visit the area to find the ark , but none of the 1960 group could tell him where it was located , just some where near Mt. Ararat .
Ron had three days in the area , so he and his two sons prayed that the Lord would help them .
They hired a taxi and started driving around , then the taxi stalled .
They were surprised , and quickly piled up stones to mark the spot .
The car then started and they drove off .
This happened three times .
The next day Ron went back to the piles of stones and walked out from them .
He found the ark , the anchor stones that you will see , and the remains of Noah 's house .
God had performed miracles to partner with Ron in revealing this amazing discovery .
Government Confirmation : Visitors ' Center Opened
The Turkish government has double - verified Mr. Wyatt 's tests , and they have given him credit for the discovery .
The announcement appeared in Turkey 's largest newspaper on June 21 , 1987 .
The area was first designated a National Park , and then it was upgraded to the status of a National Treasure .
The government has built a visitors ' center overlooking the site and issued official tourist brochures so people of all races can come and see the ark !

Center , overlooks the ark site which is to the left .

The Announcement of the Discovery Translation of newspaper article announcing the discovery of Noah's Ark : " THE NOAH'S ARK OPENED TO TOURISM .
The surrounding area of a ship - like soil pile nearby the village of Uzengili within the township of Dogubeyazit as a national park .
Dogubeyazit -
The American Academics confirmed the soil pile nearby the village of Uzengili in the township of Dogubeyazit is Noah 's Ark .
The surrounding area is declared to be a national park and it is opened to tourism .
15 Km away from Dogubeyazit at the village of Uzengili , Ronal Eldon Wyatt and his colleagues , an American research group , made researches after their Turkish colleagues completed their investigations .
Upon analyzing the soil structure and finding specific iron pieces and particles , the American researchers concluded that Noah 's Ark is located at Uzengili village .
With a ceremony attended by the Governor of Agri Province , Subgovernor of Dogubeyazit township , the Mayor Usha , Mr. Osman Baydar and the local and foreign scientists and researchers and a group of citizens , the Noah 's Ark is opened to touristic visits .
The Governor Serket Ekinci said , " In recent years , Turkey has become one of the countries to be visited in worldwide tourism .
It is assured that the Noah 's Ark , mentioned in Quran and the Bible , is located here .
I am honored to pen this area having the Noah's Ark which attracts attentions of millions in the world .
I owe our thanks to those national and foreign scientists and researchers contributed to the researches so as to locate Noah 's Ark .
At the social facilities to be built , we will accommodate local and foreign tourists and have our country make hard currency . " translation courtesy Val Smith www.throneofgod.com
Government sign directs your way to the ark Kevin Fisher standing in the " Valley of Eight " along the main highway , this government sign points your way to " Noah 's Big Boat " and away from the infamous Mt. Ararat .

Graphics Mark Johnson ArkFind.com
The length of the ruins of the ark is 515 ft. , which is exactly 300 Egyptian cubits ( 20.6 inches ) !
Moses was schooled in Egypt and was not familiar with the Hebrew cubit which was not even in existence when Moses wrote Genesis .
So the Egyptian cubit was used by Moses when describing the measurements of the ark .
The brown material above represents the outline and shape of the ark today .
The Bible said there were three levels , and based upon the present depth of the ark , it may have originally appeared as shown above .

Ark Excavated by God
Pre-earthquake photo
The photo above shows the ark deeply embedded in the surrounding terrain .
In 1978 , when Mr. Wyatt was returning to Nashville , he prayed that God would send an earthquake to " excavate " the site .
When arriving in Nashville the headlines read , " Earthquake in Eastern Turkey . "
The earth dropped from around the sides of the ark , defining the formation more clearly and making it more accessible for research .
Above :
We can see how the earth has dropped around the sides of the ark .
photo Kevin Fisher Metal Used in the Ark !
The ark contains a large amount of metal fittings which were used to secure the large timbers together .
These two photos below are from our October 2000 , trip to the site .
Notice how there was once two large rivet fasteners , but now only one is left .
A large metal plate was positioned behind the rivets .
I received a positive metal reading when passing the metal detector over the rivets .
We should not be surprised to find metal alloys used in the ark , because Genesis 4:22 states , " Tubal - Cain , an instructor of every craftsman in bronze and iron . " photos Kevin Fisher
( Left ) Ron Wyatt found a beautiful specimen of one of the metal rivets used on the ark .
It was tested and found to contain high - tech metal alloys , such as titanium , magnesium , and aluminum , etc. Critics have said Ron did not find this fine specimen on the ark but just manufactured it .
Well , as you will see below , we found the same objects and had them tested .
They too proved to have the same metals , in the same percentages !
( Below )
Two rough rivets in lower portion of photo .
photo Kevin Fisher Our Own Metal Samples Tested Lab Report Shows
Our Rivet Contains Man-Made Metals !
Below is what is shown above .
It appears to be part of a large washer that would have been slipped over a shaft and then secured on the shaft by flaring out the end of the shaft .
We have drawn circles on the photo to demonstrate the circular effect in the specimen .
The surrounding material on the side of the ark around this object had a greenish color .
Assuming a circular shape , this sample would be the same size as the rivet found by Mr. Wyatt .
( The photo at right is of the rivet as we found it on the ark ) Galbraith Laboratories of Knoxville Tennessee has tested the specimen for three metals I requested .
I asked them to test for aluminum metal , iron metal , and titanium metal .
It costs $ 60 to test for each metal requested .
The results show 8.35 % iron metal , 8.35 % aluminum metal , and 1.59 % titanium metal .
ALUMINUM AND TITANIUM METALS ARE NOT FOUND IN NATURE !!!
THIS OBJECT IS MAN - MADE , USING ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY !!
These results are similar to those produced in the analysis of the rivet found by Mr. Wyatt .
Since the specimen is fossilized , it is assumed a large portion of it is now silica replacement , reducing the percentage of metal that was originally in it when it was made .
These rivets are found in several locations on the outside of the Ark , and are probably buried inside the Ark by the hundreds or thousands .
In comparison to others , this specimen is in poor condition .
Second specimen is also man-made
with aluminum metal !
The second item I had tested by the lab reveals that is is also man-made .
It was found on the side of the ark .
It produced positive metal readings with my metal detector when I was at the site .
Later in Istanbul , I tested it with a magnet which produced an attraction to it .
It appears to have been flared out ( left photo ) by pounding the center when it was hot .
The left hand photo is facing us the way it appeared on the starboard side of the Ark .
Notice the side view ( right view ) which shows the tapering effect .
Test results from Galbraith Labs , completed in June 2001 , reveal it has man-made aluminum metal in it !
It contains 8.08 percent aluminum metal , 8.24 percent iron metal , 1.34 percent titanium metal , and 3.82 percent magnesium metal .
Click on link below to read lab report .
This may be the end of a metal rod .
Turkish officials reported removing four foot long metal rods from the site .
Metal Bracket
In May , 1985 , Dr. John Baumgardner of Los Alomas Labs , was inspecting the ark with a metal detector when he became startled and said , " Undecomposed Iron ! "
A rectangular beam was protruding from the side of the ark , with iron flakes .
He found a beautiful right angled wrought iron bracket which had been stretched and hammered , showing preferential gradiance .
John tested it at Los Alomas Labs and it was found to be 91.84 % iron FE203 .
Ballast ?
Below is a suspected piece of metal ballast that may have been thrown into the bottom of the ark when the craftsmen were through forming metal brackets and had metal waste left over .
Notice the concave features on almost every side , where other pieces of ballast were pressed against it when it was still hot .
I found this next to the ark .
( Two photos of same item . ) Metal Wedge ?
This appears to be some manganese ballast which was poured into the hull in a liquid state ,
then hardened and took the curvature of the hull ( right photo ) .
It has a coating on the convex side , while the flat side appears to be metal .
Found a few feet away from the ark .
Ballast Found by Wyatt
This is an example of the metal ballast that has been found in the hull of the ark .
It is made up of manganese primarily , which is a by - product of forming magnesium that was used in the metal rivets .
Found by Ron Wyatt .
Square Object with " X " Impression
The western side of the ark had this square object that had the appearance of metal on its top and three sides ..
It also contained an impression in it , much like it had been struck while it was hot .
It was at a higher level where I could not measure it .
It may have been 8 inches in diameter .

The port or eastern side of the ark , near the front , was scraped off by Ron in an effort to view the timbers without loose , crumbling material in the way .
This process revealed the lighter color rib timbers in a systematic , vertical pattern .
You can see a darker , curved pattern across the top , which represents the remnants of a large keelson .

The Petrified Wood

Specimen found by Ron Wyatt .
Above : A close - up photo of an 18 inch deck plank unearthed before Turkish officials by Ron Wyatt and features three distinct layers of wood with glue protruding from the end .
It was tested and proved to be petrified wood .
It is 18 inches in length and has a few visible nails .
It is made of three layers of wood with dark pitch on top .
At the bottom right you can see dark spots which may be consistent with Pecky Cypress wood , so this may be the gopher wood described in the biblical account .
This deck timber was analyzed at Galbraith Labs in Knoxville , Tennessee , and was found to have a total carbon content of 0.7100 % .
From this figure you would deduct the inorganic carbon of 0.0081 % , leaving 0.7019 % organic carbon , which is a much higher level of organic carbon than inorganic , so this indicates this was once living matter .

The ark originally came to rest higher on the mountain after the Flood .
At some point in the first two thousand years of resting in the mountains of Ararat , a volcano erupted above the ark and moved the ark further down the mountain and then impaled it on a rock outcropping where it rests today .
The ark rests on Cesnakidag Mountain , which is interpreted as " Doomsday " Mountain .
The Flood would be considered a real " doomsday " since it destroyed the world .
The mountain is made of sedimentary cretaceous water laid rock , which means it was formed by the Flood waters and is not a post Flood formation .

An excavation permit to dig into the ark has never been issued by the Turkish government , preventing thorough documentation of the site .
Partial documentation of this site has periodically appeared on The 700 Club , 20 / 20 , The Discovery Channel , The Learning Channel , CNN , Encounters , and various local Christian TV stations , but Ron Wyatt never had his own documentary shown on national television .
An excavation would uncover petrified timbers inside , so we are hopeful a dig can someday take place .

The apartments in Beitar Illit are " an exception " the Israelis say Israel has authorised the building of 112 new apartments in a Jewish settlement in the West Bank .
The move comes as the US announced that Israel and the Palestinians had agreed to hold indirect talks .
Meanwhile , US Vice - President Joe Biden has arrived in the region , becoming the highest - ranking US official to visit since Barack Obama took office .
Israel had promised a 10 - month pause in settlement building in the West Bank , not including East Jerusalem .
Israeli officials said construction was approved before the moratorium was declared .
However the announcement will place strain on the already fragile agreement to talk , Palestinian negotiators say .
In Washington , a US state department spokesman said that while the Israeli move did not violate the moratorium , " this is a the kind of thing that both sides need to be cautious of as we move ahead with these parallel talks . "
US envoy George Mitchell is currently in the Middle East to mediate in what is referred to as " proximity talks " .
" I 'm pleased that the Israeli and Palestinian leadership have accepted indirect talks , " Mr Mitchell said in a statement on Monday .
" We 've begun to discuss the structure and scope of these talks and I will return to the region next week to continue our discussions .
" As we 've said many times , we hope that these will lead to direct negotiations as soon as possible , " he added .
But other Palestinian groups based in Syria , including the Islamist Hamas movement which runs the Gaza Strip , rejected the talks .
They said the talks were bowing to pressure from Israel and the US .
A breakthrough in the talks will surprise all sides , the BBC's Middle East editor Jeremy Bowen says .
' Grudging '
The planned apartments are in the settlement of Beitar Illit , which has a mostly Orthodox Jewish population .
ANALYSIS Tim Franks , BBC News , Jerusalem
The line from Israel 's defence ministry is they needed to plug a potentially dangerous gap between steeply raked apartment buildings .
They have decided that the best way to do this is to fill in the space with 112 new apartments .
Palestinian officials see this only as further evidence of the flimsiness of Israel 's current , self - declared settlement " freeze " .
As it is , there is plenty of construction carrying on inside these settlements , on buildings which were started just before the curb on new approvals came into effect at the end of last year .
In the meantime , the Americans are hoping this week that Vice - President Joe Biden 's visit to the region will coincide with an announcement that indirect talks will start between the Israeli and Palestinian leaderships .
But shuttle diplomacy , brokered by the US , can only go so far .
As the latest news shows , both sides have such a low opinion of each other 's intentions that the prospect of direct negotiations - let alone agreement - remains remote .
Israeli ministers said the buildings would be allowed to go ahead because of what they termed called " safety issues " .
A statement from the defence ministry said the building was needed to plug a potentially dangerous 40 - yard gap between two existing buildings .
" Beitar Illit is an exceptional permit that came about following safety problems in the infrastructure , " the statement said .
The building permits were issued under the previous government of Ehud Olmert and before the settlement pause was announced .
The Palestinian leadership in the West Bank had demanded a complete stop to settlement building as a precondition to re-engaging in talks which broke down more than a year ago .
They agreed " grudgingly " , reports said , and came after many months of shuttle diplomacy from Mr Mitchell .
The talks should be limited to four months , Palestinian officials said .
Under heavy US pressure , the Israeli government agreed in November to a temporary and partial pause in building .
It said that work which had already started on 3,000 homes should be allowed to continue , and further exceptions to the pause were possible .
Israel has refused to stop building in East Jerusalem , which the Palestinians say they want as the location of a future capital of a Palestinian state .
In February , the Israeli government revealed that work had been continuing in many settlements despite the promise of a pause .
' Exception ' Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said the move put the talks at risk .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" If the Israeli government wants to sabotage Mitchell 's efforts by taking such steps , let 's talk to Mitchell about maybe not doing this if the price is so high , " he was quoted by the Associated Press as saying .
Israeli Environment Minister Gilad Erdan said the settlement was " an exception " to the building pause .
" At the end of last year the government decided to freeze construction , but this decision provided for exceptions in cases of safety problems for infrastructure projects started before the freeze , " he told Army Radio .
Peace Now , an Israeli group , said the announcement raised questions about Israel 's commitment to the peace process .
" The Israeli government is welcoming the US Vice - President by demonstrating , to our regret , that it has no genuine intention to advance the peace process , " the group 's settlement expert Hagit Ofran told AP .
All settlements in the the West Bank , including East Jerusalem , are considered illegal under international law , although Israel disputes this .

I agree with Felix Salmon that the former Lehman staffers who defend Repo 105 are psychopaths – certifiably insane .
They state ( as if this justifies it ) that …
The only people who would worry about using an old trick to reduce leverage from 13.9 to 12.1 , are “ yappers who do n’t know anything . ”
For those that do n’t know Repo 105 was a sale and repurchase agreement by which Lehman parked about 50 billion in assets ( presumably assets they did not want to discuss ) overnight via a repo transaction so they would not appear on the balance sheet .
By now anyone who does not realize that sort of accounting legerdemain is unacceptable is ( a ) entirely out of touch with reality and ( b ) self aggrandizing on a magnificent scale .
Both are signs of mental illness .
But unfortunately the Lehman executives do have one point .
Repo 105 type balance sheet faking was “ an old trick ” and well known to anyone who cared to read balance sheets ( very ) carefully .*
Let me take you back to 2006 and Bank of America .
Pages 94 and 95 of the 2006 Annual Report show ( amongst other things ) the average total assets by quarter from the fourth quarter of 2005 to the fourth quarter of 2006 inclusive .
Here are the numbers :
( US dollars - millions ) Q4 2006 Q3 2006 Q2 2006 Q1 2006 Q4 2005 Average total assets 1,495,150 1,497,987 1,456,004 1,416,373 1,305,057
Now lets extend this table by including period end assets .
You can find the data here ( see page 4 for both fourth quarters and third quarter , and page 4 here for the first and second quarters ) .
( US dollars - millions ) Q4 2006 Q3 2006 Q2 2006 Q1 2006 Q4 2005 Average total assets 1,495,150 1,497,987 1,456,004 1,416,373 1,305,057
End period total assets 1,459,737 1,449,211 1,445,193 1,375,080 1,291,803 end period less average assets - 35,413 - 48,776 - 10,811 -41,293 - 13,254
You will notice that the end period assets were always lower than the average assets .
Moreover it was not obvious unless you really looked because the quarterly earnings releases did not include average assets ( but you could work it out because they stated return on average assets ) .
It was not just 2006 either – this had been happening for a while .
Bank of America was parking its assets off balance sheet at the end of every quarter for some time and had been obscuring the fact .
Counterparties
If Bank of America wanted to shove the assets off balance sheet someone ( credit worthy ) needed to be found to house the assets overnight .
There are not that many parties credit worthy for $ 50 billion or more of overnight repos .
Well – being an obsessive reader of bank accounts I found the counterparty .
It was MUFJ .
If you wish to you can show – the same way that MUFJ had end period assets higher than average assets and that the differences and timing roughly match .
Someone had to assist BofA in its financial legerdemain and we know the counterparty .
Once – through an interpreter – I asked senior MUFJ executives about this .
Any nuance in the answer was lost in translation .
So back to Repo 105
Repo 105 is fraud .
Its a lie to investors and rating and regulatory agencies .
It was also fraud when BofA did it .
But both Lehman and Ken Lewis compartmentalized it as OK .
And it was not the fraud that undid them – it was the overweening arrogance that thought this was alright .
The same overweening arrogance that made Ken Lewis think it was alright to pay a big premium to close for Merrill Lynch ( and later force mass dilution of BofA common shareholders ) .
But the chief executive ( or other executive ) who thought this was alright was probably certifiable .
Just as certifiable as the Lehman execs who Felix rightly chastises .
Do we want to prosecute ?
There is a big debate in the blogosphere as to whether anything in the Valukas Report rises to the level of prosecution .
I suspect in a vacuum it does .
But this was a collective insanity every bit as mad as the poisoning craze written about Charles Mackay .
Mass insanity does lower moral culpability and it takes an extraordinary person to stand up to it .
Besides – if we are going to slap Erin Callan ’s wrists in handcuffs then we are going to have to do the same to Ken Lewis and probably have to extradite the top-end of the Japanese establishment who were the counterparties .
I do not want to go there – and I do not think it would be constructive .
Disclosure : Long a lot of Bank of America – surprising given this post I guess .
* It is my burden to read balance sheets like this and to remember details four years later .

Der Leipziger Sexualwissenschaftler Kurt Starke hält die schädliche Wirkung von Pornographie auf Jugendliche für nicht belegt .
In einer von dem Erotikanbieter Huch Medien eingeholten Expertise , die heise online vorliegt , schreibt Starke , dass " eine schädliche Wirkung von Pornografie per se auf Jugendliche nicht belegt werden " könne .
Den von Jugendmedienschützern ins Feld geführten möglichen " negativen Einfluss von Pornographie " nennt Starke eine " beliebte Fiktion ohne wissenschaftliche Substanz " .
Ein Verbot von einfacher Pornographie für Jugendliche , wie es der Jugendmedienschutzstaatsvertrag ( JMStV , PDF - Datei ) vorsieht , lehnt der Forscher daher ab .
Der Wissenschaftler hat dazu gut ein Dutzend Studien zum Thema gesichtet und eigene Untersuchungen hinzugezogen .
Sein Fazit ist eine Ohrfeige für den deutschen Jugendmedienschutz : Verbote helfen Jugendlichen nicht nur nicht , sie schaden ihnen sogar , meint Starke .
Nicht der Konsum einfacher Pornographie , sondern erst das Verbot und die damit einhergehende soziale Ächtung könne Jugendliche in ihrer Entwicklung beeinträchtigen .
Ein Verbot könne den Konsum nicht verhindern , sondern sorge letztlich nur für Schuldgefühle bei Jugendlichen .
Das Strafgesetzbuch kriminalisiere schon Nacktbilder , die Jugendliche von sich selbst ins Netz stellen .
Erotikanbieter
Huch sieht sich durch das Gutachten in seiner Forderung nach einer Abschaffung des Verbots einfacher Pornographie im Strafrecht und im JMStV bestätigt .
Er habe das Gutachten bereits an die Ministerpräsidenten der Länder und die Länderparlamente gesandt , sagte Geschäftsführer Tobias Huch .
Auch wenn Jugendliche und Erwachsene vor ungewollter Konfrontation mit Pornographie zu schützen seien , für gesetzliche Pauschalverbote fehle jede Rechtfertigung .
In der kommenden Woche beraten die Ministerpräsidenten der Länder die Neufassung des JMStV und könnten sich dabei für eine weitere Verschärfung des Pornographieverbotes aussprechen .
Künftig sollen auch Darstellungen verboten sein , " die in sonstiger Weise pornographisch sind " .
Das geht Huch eindeutig zu weit .
Im Falle eines Falles will er gegen die beteiligten Behörden wegen einer Amtspflichtsverletzung vorgehen .
Ob die Studie den Gesetzgeber verpflichtet , die Schädlichkeit von Pornographie künftig anders zu bewerten , wie Huch behauptet , ist unter Juristen allerdings umstritten .
Aktuell macht der Gesetzgeber von seinem Vorrecht Gebrauch , bei wissenschaftlich unsicherer Datenlage selbst zu entscheiden , wie das Gefährdungspotential einzuschätzen ist .
Die Kommission für Jugendmedienschutz ( KJM ) kämpft unterdessen an einer anderen Front .
In einer Mitteilung wehrte sich die KJM gestern gegen die aus ihrer Sicht völlig ungerechtfertigten Vorwurf , dass mit dem neuen JMStV eine Zensur stattfinde .
Von verschiedenen " falschen Sachverhaltsdarstellungen " ist in der Mitteilung die Rede .
Unter anderem gebe es weder im bisherigen , noch im aktuellen Novellierungs - Entwurf " eine neue Sperrverpflichtung für Zugangsvermittler " .
Sperrungsverfügungen seien vielmehr bereits seit Jahren nach geltender Rechtslage möglich . ( ad )
To the right , it 's about getting things done .
Right - wing nutjobs are n't overly interested in individual glory and fame ; they just see what they percieve as a great injustice , and will do whatever it takes to right it .
Now , this is where Jay Tea , the ultra - conservative poster , goes over the line :
The examples I cited in that earlier comment demonstrate this : William Ayers and Bernardine Dohrn vs. Timothy McVeigh .
Ayers and Dohrn formed the Weather Underground with a bunch of friends and lovers and whatnot , published their manifestos and screeds , and set up their bombs around the country to express their outrage .
McVeigh , on the other hand , recruited one buddy and set off one big bomb .
In the end , McVeigh and Terry Nichols achieved far more than all the Weather Underground ever did with their bombs ; McVeigh took out a whole federal building and almost 200 people , while the biggest score the Weather Underground ever pulled off was an " own goal " where they blew themselves up .
It 's also illustrative in how the " mainstream " left and right treat their nutjobs .
McVeigh is universally seen as a monster , and nearly everyone is glad he was caught and executed .
On the other hand , Ayers and Dohrn were allowed to put their past behind them ( without even a public repenting ) , and were allowed to assume positions of authority and responsibility and trust .
First off , there is no comparison .
McVeigh was an anti-social prick who could have cared less that his " success story " killed 168 people , including all the children in a daycare .
Say what you will about The Weather Underground , I do n't think there 's anyone of any consequence applauding their bombings these days .
Anyway , that 's beside the point .
These people are so proud of their aggressive accomplishments these days , they 're willing to look up to McVeigh as an example of doing it right .
Any argument is fair game as long as the right looks right .
It 's not even an issue of condemning these people after the fact .
Using McVeigh as a good example of a successful executor in any kind of slam piece of the left is about a nuts as it gets .
And disgraceful .
So , whose nuts are more of a problem ?
Tough call .
No , Jay .
It 's not a tough call .
An asshole is an asshole .
There is no defense of Timothy McVeigh 's actions and you should not be proud of them .
Lately there 's been lots of blog and Twitter chatter about recognizing an open source product .
While an interesting intellectual exercise , the debate could also have a real - world impact on IT purchasing decisions .
Open source " purity "
I used to spend time debating the open source " purity " of a given open source vendor .
I moved on when Shaun Connolly , with JBoss at the time , wrote a post titled " Open Source Community and Barack Obama . "
In 2010 , it 's incredibly difficult to define an " open source vendor , " because virtually every IT vendor uses open source in its products , contributes to open source , or provides services around open source .
[ Keep up with the latest news and insights on open source with InfoWorld 's Technology : Open Source newsletter . ]
The recent debate about open source " purity " extends beyond the vendor and instead focuses on products .
The debate is being spurred by the increasingly popular open - core licensing approach and the delivery of software products through cloud offerings .
The 451 Group 's Matt Aslett writes :
It ought to be simple : Either the software meets the open source definition or it does not .
But it is not always easy to tell what license is being used , and in the case of software being delivered as a service , does it matter anyway ?
The ability to deliver software as a hosted service enables some companies that are claimed to be 100 percent open source to offer customers software for which the source code is not available .
In the perfect world , customers would pay vendors for the value they receive from usage of free and open source products .
Because that has n't really panned out , open - core licensing and cloud delivery of open source software are gaining attention as leading approaches to capture revenue around open source products .
Keep an eye on freedom of action
Customers using or considering a product that falls into the open - core licensing category , take note :
The enterprise commercial product you purchase probably wo n't offer the same freedoms as the open source community edition that the developers likely used and became advocates for .

Los Angeles , California ( CNN ) -- Erykah Badu shed her clothes as she walked along a Dallas , Texas , sidewalk until she was nude and then fell near where President Kennedy was assassinated .
The result was a controversial video , released Saturday , for her song " Window Seat , " which Badu said was " shot guerrilla style " with no crew and in one take March 17 .
Children could be seen nearby as Badu stripped in Dealey Plaza , a popular tourist spot since Kennedy 's 1963 assassination .
The singer 's management did not immediately respond to request for comment , but Badu responded to the controversy via Twitter .
She tweeted that " there were children there .
i prayed they wouldnt b traumatized . "
Badu will not face indecent exposure charges for shedding her clothes on the Dallas , Texas , sidewalk , a Dallas Police spokeswoman said .
Although children were nearby , no one filed a complaint against Badu after the March 17 incident , Dallas Police Senior Cpl. Janice Crowther said .
" But if we had had a call and would have caught Ms. Badu in the act of walking down the street taking her clothes off , she would have been charge with a Class B misdemeanor , " she said .
The R&B singer said she was making a statement against " groupthink , " which she tweeted was an " unwritten rule " that " i will not express my true opinion if it opposes those i love and fear . "
Some fans sent tweets praising Badu 's artistic vision .
One fan tweeted to Badu on Sunday : " thank you , because your being brave , i no longer feel afraid to say what i really feel . "
The video opens with a November 22 , 1963 , radio broadcast describing Kennedy 's motorcade turning onto Elm Street seconds before fatal shots were fired .
In the video , Badu is behind the wheel of a 1965 Lincoln Continental , parked along Kennedy 's route .
A single camera focuses on her as she walks toward Elm Street and the book depository where Kennedy 's assassin fired his rifle .
Badu tweeted that " i was petrified while shooting this video ... but liberation began to set in .
i conquered many fears in that few moments . "
She said she was " too busy lookin for cops " to be embarrassed by her nudity .
" i been naked all along in my words actions and deeds .
thats the real vulnerable place , " she tweeted .
The video does not include shouts from people off camera , she said .
" they were yelling , ' THIS IS A PUBLIC PLACE : YOU OUGHTA BE ASHAMED : PUT YOUR CLOTHES ON : DAMN GIRL ! etc , " Badu tweeted .
More than a dozen people stood along the plaza's " grassy knoll " when Badu took off the last piece of clothing .
" the people caught in the shot were trying hard to ignore me , " she tweeted .
As she reached the spot where Kennedy was first struck by a bullet , the crackle of a gunshot is heard and Badu 's head snaps back and she falls to the ground as if dead .
Badu said when the camera stopped " we ran . "
The singer was born in Dallas , where she is raising her three children -- ages 1 , 5 and 12
She tweeted to fans about her 5 - year - old daughter 's response when told of her plans for the video : " she looked at me with a blank face and replied ok mama can i have another pudding ? "
The video was released days before the singer 's next album , " New Amerykah Part Two : Return of the Ankh , " hits record stores .
The single " Window Seat " is at No. 28 on Billboard 's R&B / hip - hop chart .
REYKJAVIK , Iceland —
After the dust began to settle last year — after the banks failed , the currency collapsed , the stock market crashed and the government fell — the dazed inhabitants of Iceland woke up to another unpleasant problem :
They owed , it seemed , some $ 5.3 billion to more than 300,000 angry people in the Netherlands and Britain .
These were the customers of Icesave , a now notorious online retail branch of the Icelandic bank Landsbanki , which went bankrupt in October 2008 along with 85 percent of Iceland ’s banking system .
The British and Dutch governments reimbursed their citizens , but then demanded that Iceland repay the money , the equivalent of $ 65,000 per household here , plus interest .
To put it in perspective , it is as if American taxpayers were being forced to pay $ 5 trillion ( plus interest ) to reimburse customers of the Japanese branch of a failed private American bank , said Magnus Arni Skulason , the head of InDefence , a group agitating for a better deal .
The question of how to pay has convulsed this tiny country of about 319,000 people , severely damaging its international reputation and paralyzing its economic recovery .
It has so incensed its residents that on Saturday they are expected to reject overwhelmingly the latest Icesave repayment plan , in the first national referendum ever held here on any subject .

Bodily interface Handy too
Finding the keypad on your cellphone or music player a bit cramped ?
Maybe your forearm could be more accommodating .
It could become part of a skin - based interface that effectively turns your body into a touchscreen .
Called Skinput , the system is a marriage of two technologies : the ability to detect the ultralow - frequency sound produced by tapping the skin with a finger , and the microchip - sized “ pico ” projectors now found in some cellphones .
The system beams a keyboard or menu onto the user ’s forearm and hand from a projector housed in an armband .
An acoustic detector , also in the armband , then calculates which part of the display you want to activate .

But how does the system know which icon , button or finger you tapped ?
Chris Harrison at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , working with Dan Morris and Desney Tan at Microsoft ’s research lab in Redmond , Washington , exploit the way our skin , musculature and skeleton combine to make distinctive sounds when we tap on different parts of the arm , palm , fingers and thumb ( see video ) .
Bone machine
They have identified various locations on the forearm and hand that produce characteristic acoustic patterns when tapped .
The acoustic detector in the armband contains five piezoelectric cantilevers , each weighted to respond to certain bands of sound frequencies .
Different combinations of the sensors are activated to differing degrees depending on where the arm is tapped .
Twenty volunteers tested the system and most found it easy to navigate through icons on the forearm and tap fingers to actuate commands .
“ Skinput works very well for a series of gestures , even when the body is in motion , ” the researchers say , with subjects able to deftly scroll through menus whether they moved up and down or flicked across their arm .
The system could use wireless technology like Bluetooth to transmit commands to many types of device – including phones , iPods and even PCs .
The researchers will present their work in April at the ACM Computer - Human Interaction meeting in Atlanta , Georgia .
Body control
Pranav Mistry of the Media Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology warns that users will have to position the armband very precisely so the projection always appears in the right place .
Nevertheless , Skinput looks a promising idea , says Michael Liebschner , director of the Bio-Innovations Lab at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston , Texas , who has worked on bone acoustic conduction technology for gadget - to - gadget transmission .
“ This sounds a very feasible approach to using the body itself as an input device , ” he says .
“ When you are immersed in a virtual game using a head - mounted 3D display , you cannot just take it off to fiddle around with control buttons .
This will make things much easier . ”
This legislation accomplishes several key goals :
Full repeal of " Do n't Ask , Don't Tell . "
It will allow the Department of Defense to continue its study to determine the best way to implement the repeal , but ensures that the study remains dedicated to implementing repeal , not considering whether to repeal .
Ends discharges for gay and lesbian servicemembers immediately .
While the study period for implementation goes forward , no members of the Armed Forces will be discharged solely for their sexual orientation .
In other words , this bill ensures that we stop harming our military 's effectiveness , but still takes a reasonable approach to ensure that the repeal is done in a responsible way .
It 's an excellent piece of legislation , but some opponents still claim it will spell disaster for our military .
The American people do n't agree .
In fact , the latest Quinnipiac Poll , released February 10 , shows 57 % of Americans supportive of repeal and only 36 % opposed .
The wishes of the American people are clear , but some members of the Senate still believe our soldiers can't handle serving with openly gay and lesbian servicemembers .
I could n't disagree more .
That 's why I 'm asking you to join me in supporting this crucial legislation by becoming a citizen cosponsor to prove , once and for all , that Americans will no longer tolerate this unfair policy that hampers our fighting men and women .
Our Armed Forces are the best in the world , and it's high time we stopped handicapping them with " Do n't Ask , Don't Tell . "
Please join me and voice your support for repealing this harmful policy , right now .
Become a citizen cosponsor today !
Then , please join me in the comments for further discussion of the bill .
Thank you for your support !
As a relative newcomer to the craft of sewing , I just recently started to realize the value of fabric scraps .
That 's why I was intrigued when I heard of Looptworks , a new apparel company — started by three guys who worked together on product design and management at Adidas — that claims to make all their products out of excess materials .
This MacBook laptop sleeve , for example , is made from scrap neoprene found in wetsuit factories in China and Thailand .
I love the simple design ; it also has two exterior pockets that fit a power adapter and a couple of thumb drives perfectly .
Because their materials are n't mass - produced , most of their designs are available for a limited time only .
Looptworks rolls out new items every month on their web site and in selected specialty apparel stores in most major cities .

( CNN ) -- Technicians who tested a Toyota Prius after its owner claimed its gas pedal stuck were unable to recreate the same condition , according to a draft congressional memo obtained Sunday by CNN .
In addition , owner Jim Sikes ' claim that the car kept going even though he slammed on the brake while his gas pedal was stuck to the floor does " not appear to be feasibly possible , " said the draft , obtained from sources familiar with the investigation .
The memo , written for members of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform , summarizes the observations of a representative present at the testing of the Prius , as well as another car " allegedly involved in sudden unintended acceleration events . "
Contacted by CNN , Sikes declined to comment but said he stands by his story .
He said his attorney will be making a statement on his behalf Monday .
Sikes said last week he was traveling east on Interstate 8 outside of San Diego , California , when his accelerator stuck as he sped up to pass a car .
" As I was going , I was trying the brakes ... and it just kept speeding up , " he said .
Sikes said he called 911 for help as he was traveling in excess of 90 mph on a winding , hilly portion of the highway .
He said dispatchers tried to talk him through ways to stop the car , but nothing helped .
Eventually , a California Highway Patrol officer caught up to Sikes and used the patrol car 's public address system to instruct Sikes to apply the brakes and the emergency brake at the same time .
That tactic worked , and he was able to stop the car .
The memo said that before Sikes ' vehicle could be tested , technicians had to replace rotors , brakes and pads , because the pads and rotors were worn down .
David Justo of Toyota Motor Sales headquarters , described in the memo as Toyota 's residential hybrid expert , said that if car 's gas pedal was stuck to the floor , and the driver applied the brake , the engine would shut down .
" If the engine does not shut down , then the gears would be spinning [ past ] their maximum revolutions per minute and completely seize the engine , " the memo said , quoting Justo .
" So , in his case ... it does not appear to be feasibly possible , both electronically and mechanically that his gas pedal was stuck to the floor and he was slamming on the brake at the same time . "
Technicians from Toyota and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration took Sikes ' Prius on a test drive and attempted to duplicate the same experience , the memo said , but were unsuccessful .
A congressional staffer and another Toyota technician tested another Prius .
" Every time the technician placed the gas pedal to the floor and the brake pedal to the floor , the engine shut off and the car immediately started to slow down , " the memo said .
" NHTSA and Toyota field representatives reported the same results with the 2008 Prius owned by Mr. Sikes . "
" These findings certainly raise new questions surrounding the veracity of the sequence of events that has been reported by Mr. Sikes , " said Kurt Bardella , spokesman for Rep. Darrell Issa , R- California , and ranking member on the committee .
Toyota recently issued widespread recalls because of problems related to the accelerator pedal in several of its auto models .
One theory behind the sticky accelerators is the vehicles ' floor mats .
But Sikes said last week , " My mat was perfect .
There was nothing wrong with my mat . "
He said that before the incident , he had taken his 2008 Prius into a Toyota dealership and gave workers his recall notice but was told his car was n't on the recall list .
The academic at the centre of the " climategate " controversy over leaked university emails admitted yesterday that some of his correspondence had been " pretty awful " .
Professor Phil Jones , the head of the of the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia ( UEA ) , made the remark to a powerful cross-party committee of MPs , when challenged about saying he would not release data to a climate sceptic , " because all he wants to do is find something wrong with it . "
Defending himself in public for the first time , Professor Jones faced a fierce grilling from the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee about the emails hacked from UEA computers , which critics say are evidence of how climate scientists continually obstruct requests for information .
The " climategate " affair has resulted in major controversy about climate change science and policy , because Professor Jones 's unit is one of three centres in the world which put together the global temperature record going back to the 19th century and even earlier .
Climate sceptics say that its conclusion that the world is now warmer than at any time for 1,000 years – because of current global warming – is flawed , and have been seeking the raw data on which the record has been constructed , in order to challenge it .
The committee 's inquiry is one of two being held into the affair , the other having been organised by UEA itself , under the chairmanship of the Scottish academic Sir Muir Russell .
Yesterday 's evidence session had a full panoply of witnesses ranging from the noted climate sceptic and former Chancellor of the Exchequer Lord Lawson of Blaby , and Richard Thomas CBE , the former Information Commissioner who is an expert on Freedom of Information law , to three of Britain 's most senior climate scientists – Professor John Beddington , the Government 's Chief Scientific Adviser , Professor Julia Slingo , the Chief Scientist at the Met Office , and Professor Bob Watson , Chief Scientist at the Department of Environment , Food and Rural Affairs and a former head of the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change .
Lord Lawson and Benny Peiser , the chairman and director respectively of the Global Warming Policy Foundation , a climate think - tank representing the sceptic camp , told the committee that the leaked emails demonstrated there was a concerted attempt to prevent the release of scientific data and also to manipulate the peer - review process .
Climategate , said Dr Peiser , had " tarnished the image of science around the world " .
Lord Lawson added : " The fact of the matter is that they were reluctant to provide data for a very long period " .
But it was Professor Jones who held centre stage yesterday and MPs listened intently as he agreed that in the past , climate data , including lists of named weather stations , and the computer code used to analyse the data they provided , had not been made publicly available , in spite of repeated requests .
He told the MPs that it was " not standard practice " .
Labour MP Graham Stringer said to him : " If that 's not standard practice , how can science progress ? "
Professor Jones replied : " Maybe it should be but it is n't . "
Accompanied in his evidence by Professor Edward Acton , the UEA vice - chancellor , Professor Jones looked strained during the 40 - minute session in which he was questioned at length by the committee .
Raising the email in which he wrote " why should I make data available to you when you 're trying to find something wrong with it ? " – which Professor Jones agreed was " pretty awful " – Mr Stringer asked Professor Jones : " But scientists make a name by proving and disproving things , do n't they ?
The statement seems to be anti-scientific .
It is an absolutely clear denial of the man 's attempt to get at what you were doing .
He wanted your information and you refused to give it to him ?
Why ? "
Professor Jones replied : " Because we had invested a lot of work and resources in it , and this was before FOI [ Freedom of information legislation ] started . "
He listed other reasons for withholding data including the fact that some of the weather stations around the world which had supplied it were not willing for it to be released , but he said that the same information was available in the US .
The MPs heard that in July last year the Climate Research Unit was " deluged " with 61 Freedom of Information requests from climate sceptics , after there had only been two or three in the previous year .
Professor Action told the committee that the unit had only three full - time members .
" It is a very small unit , " he said .
" We are not a national archive , but a research unit .
The manpower involved [ in responding to FOI requests ] is very considerable . "
He said said he had not seen any evidence of flaws in the overall science of climate change – but said he was planning this week to announce the chair of yet another independent inquiry , which will look into all the science produced at CRU .
Professor Jones was also questioned on the most controversial email of all those leaked , in which he talks about " a trick " to " hide the decline " .
This refers to altering a graph showing that temperature recorded by tree - ring growth after 1960 no longer followed the instrumental record closely , as it once had done .
Professor Jones said the " divergence problem " was well known and had been written about in a scientific paper before the email was sent .
Leaked emails :
Who is involved – and how they performed before MPs yesterday
* Professor Phil Jones
As director of the University of East Anglia 's controversial Climatic Research Unit , Prof Jones has been caught in the eye of an increasingly ugly storm in recent months .
At the end of last year , emails which appeared to show that the unit 's scientists had manipulated climate data were hacked from the university 's server and leaked online – a scandal which came to be known as " Climategate " .
Professor Jones has temporarily surrendered his post while two independent inquiries are conducted into the claims but has said he " absolutely " stands by the science the unit has produced , dismissing suggestions that the data was doctored to support a theory of man-made climate change as " complete rubbish " .
How did he do ?
Hesitant and strained , obviously under a lot of personal pressure and it showed .
* Nigel Lawson
The Rt Hon Lord Lawson of Blaby is a former chancellor who is now the chairman of the Global Warming Policy Foundation , a " think - tank " of climate sceptics .
Lord Lawson is best known for the " Lawson Boom " ( the period of rapid economic growth that he presided over in the 1980s ) , and his titantic efforts in losing weight after he left office .
He has been a strong critic of the Kyoto Protocol 's attempts to limit CO2 emissions and has called for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to be disbanded .
He accepts that global warming may be happening , but believes that many scientists are being alarmist about its effects .
How did he do ?
Bluff and expansive , as you would expect from a consummate politician , but not so good on detail .
* Dr Benny Peiser
Dr Peiser , a director of the Global Warming Policy Foundation , is a social anthropologist at Liverpool John Moores University and an outspoken " agnostic " on global warming .
He has not undertaken any scientific research into climate change , but this has not stopped him from being a fierce critic of climate scientists .
His own areas of research include topics such as " societal evolution and neo- catastrophism " and he endorses Lawson 's view that predictions about climate change have been alarmist .
Peiser is a fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society and boasts that a minor planet called 7170 Peiser is named after him .
How did he do ?
Evasive and untrustworthy , did not answer some questions straight and hid behind " I 'm not a scientist " line .
* Professor Julia Slingo
As the Met Office 's chief scientist , Prof Slingo is responsible for making sure that the organisation adheres to high scientific standards .
She admitted recently that the public were " very confused " about climate change , and that scientists had not done enough to help people understand the subject .
She has held the position since July 2008 and presided over an unsettled time for the organisation , which began with its prediction that the country was " odds - on " for a barbecue summer in 2009 , followed by its suggestion last October that Britain was heading for an unusually mild winter .
Climate change sceptics seized upon the errors under her leadership , using them to accuse the Met Office of allowing its obsession with global warming to influence its forecasts for the following week 's weather conditions .
How did she do ?
Solid and well in charge of her brief , the sort of sound scientist every politician dreams of having on their side .
* Richard Thomas
Thomas is a former information commissioner who , while in the post , raised concerns about increased video surveillance through the widespread use of CCTV cameras in public places and the introduction of ID cards .
He was trained as a lawyer and has worked in citizens ' advice and in posts for the National Consumer Council and the Office of Fair Trading .
He was involved in the Campaign for Freedom of Information , which led to the law that many climate sceptics have used to badger scientists into providing raw data on their research .
How did he do ?
A little boring and pedestrian but the kind of lawyer who would never get himself into trouble .
* Sir Muir Russell
Sir Muir is the University of Glasgow vice - chancellor in charge of the " independent " investigation into the allegations regarding the leaked emails from the University of East Anglia , which is paying for the inquiry .
Sir Muir has impeccable establishment credentials as a career civil servant and chair of the Judicial Appointments Board for Scotland .
However , he suffered some embarrassment when , within hours fo his announcing the membership of the inquiry team , one member , Dr Phil Campbell , editor of Nature , had to resign over previous comments on the email leak .
How did he do ?
Effusive and convincing , with a touch of Scottish humour , almost breaking into song .
Obviously wants to be liked .
* Professor John Beddington
Prof Beddington is the Government 's Chief Scientific Adviser .
He is also Professor of Applied Population Biology at Imperial College London and an expert on the economics and biology of sustainable management of renewable resources .
When the scandal broke , Beddington said that scientists had to be more transparent and honest about their research .
He said that it was not healthy to dismiss " proper " scepticism .
" Science grows and improves in the light of criticism , " he said .
How did he do ?
A measured and assured performance , a man who evidently wants the science to speak for itself .
In February 2010 , total U.S. industrial production rose + 1.7 % year over year according to the Federal Reserve .
While there was continued expansion , production growth fell from Q4 2009's +6.6 % rate and Q3 2009 's + 6.4 % growth .
Still , overall industrial production kept growing in February .
But ... diving into a breakdown of different products by market shows that some U.S. industries have already experienced sharp reversals of fortune .
As shown below , U.S. industrial production contracted sharply in February ( orange bars ) for Home Electronics , Appliances & Furniture , Paper Products , and Industrial Business Equipment .
This came after strong growth in Q4 ( blue bars ) .
Thus for some the recovery already feels like it 's over .

The Muslim prison population in England and Wales has sharply increased in recent years .
The BBC's Ushma Mistry hears from former inmates and prison officers who claim gangs of Muslim prisoners are an increasingly powerful force .
" Muslims run it .
Muslims run the prisons and there 's nothing the screws can do about it .
For a Muslim you 'd say it 's good but for a non-Muslim , it 's very , very bad , " a former inmate called Jay says .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
It is a claim which is backed by former prison officers and other inmates .
Jay , 24 , is a Muslim and has been in and out of prison for most of his life .
He openly admits to helping to convert non-Muslim inmates to Islam and has meted out violence against anyone who dares to " disrespect " his religion .
He first went to prison when he was 15 and said there were hardly any Muslims inmates back then .
" At the beginning not many knew about Islam .
There were n't many converts .
The mosque was empty , but nowadays jails are run mostly by the Muslims , " he said .
" There are certain brothers that convert purely on the basis that they read Islam and they want to believe in something that does good for them .
Then other people because they want to be looked after .
" I 've been in jail five times and on my last occasion , I 've seen jails being run by Muslim inmates .
" Muslim prayers on a Friday are very , very busy .
In some prisons there 's no space .
In one jail I was in , they do the prayers in two sessions because there 's no space . "
Intimidating Muslims represent 12 % ( 9,795 ) of the prison population in England and Wales , according to the latest available figures from 2008 .
This has risen by 50 % over five years .
MUSLIM PRISONER POPULATION 2008 : 9,795 ( 12 % of total prison population in England and Wales ) 2007 : 8,864 ( 11 % ) 2006 : 8,243 ( 11 % ) 2005 : 7,246 ( 10 % ) 2004 : 6,571 ( 9 % ) 2003 : 6,136 ( 8 % ) Source : Ministry of Justice
In some high security prisons , the figures are well above average .
In 2008 , Muslim prisoners accounted for a third ( 34 % ) of prisoners in HMP Whitemoor , in March , Cambridgeshire , and about a quarter ( 24 % ) of inmates in HMP Long Lartin , in Evesham , Worcestershire .
Speaking anonymously , a former prison officer , who worked at HMP Long Lartin , told the Donal MacIntyre programme about cases where non-Muslim prisoners were seriously assaulted and intimidated for refusing to abide by unofficial rules imposed by Muslim gangs , about eating pork or listening to Western music .
" Muslim gangs was something I was very concerned about - the situation changed where underworld gangsters who used to keep discipline and order were no longer in charge in the prison , " she said .
" The younger guys , who were being forced to convert , were doing it more for protection from a Muslim gang rather than follow the faith - most of them were n't interested in the faith .
It is ridiculous to suggest that any gang ' controls ' a prison
Prison Service spokesperson
" I knew one lad quite well who was approached by the radical Muslims , and he changed .
He just seemed very frightened all the time .
" He used to be forced to pray at certain times and I know for a fact they would be woken in the middle of the night to pray .
" He even grew a long beard even though he did n't want to .
I asked him why he grew the beard and he said ' It 's survival miss , survival ' " .
Physical retribution Colin Moses , national chairman of prison workers ' trade union , the POA , said not all Muslims in prison were in gangs , but acknowledged there was a growing problem .
Colin Moses argues prison staff need more resources to tackle the problem " People are being radicalised , forcibly radicalised by these gangs .
We see it as a real danger , now and for the future of prisons , " he said .
And , he pointed out that those who were in gangs or converted to Islam often did it to carry out criminal activities .
" As the Muslim population grows , the gangs are becoming more and more prevalent by the week and they fight to take control of the drug trade and the dealing of mobile phones in prison .
" This will make our prisons even more violent , " he added .
Violence is something familiar to former inmate Jay , who admits to physical retribution on fellow inmates who he deemed to have disrespected Islam .
" It hurts as a Muslim to have someone disrespect my religion .
If we deal with him one time , with violence , and show him what time it is , he will never disrespect our religion again , " he said .
He also believes prison officers have much to learn about Islam .
" Islam is a very sensitive matter .
And the screws do n't understand that .
I respect what the screws do but they 've got to understand our ways , where we 're coming from , " he added .
' Wealth of experience ' POA chairman Colin Moses recognises there are some shortcomings in prison staff 's understanding of Muslim inmates .
" We must be given the resources to face these gangs , and one of those must be a greater knowledge of the Muslim religion , " he said .
" And we must see , I believe , a greater input of Muslim prison officers - we have very few and in some prisons none whatsoever .

In a statement , a Prison Service spokesman said the allegations made about Muslim gangs were unsubstantiated .
" It is ridiculous to suggest that any gang ' controls ' a prison , " he said .
He went on to say : " The Prison Service has a wealth of experience in dealing with gang activity and managing prisoners who form gangs .
" It is important not to conflate security issues with the prisoners ' religious identities .
' Muslim gangs ' will be treated like other gangs in relation to security concerns .
" Violence is not acceptable in prison and any incidents will be investigated thoroughly and dealt with accordingly , with support from the police where appropriate .
" We have a programme of work in place to respond to the risks of all forms of radicalisation and extremism in prisons ( not only al - Qaeda influenced extremism ) .
" This work will continue to develop to support prisons in tackling this behaviour . "

Ingredients to avoid
It is scary to find out what is commonly found in food , toiletries , and common household items !
When it comes to most people , it seems that they do n't want to know or even think about what they are really eating or using or , most likely , they would stop buying it !
Besides animal body parts , blood , pus , etc ... there are a lot of chemicals , antibiotics , artificial ingredients etc ... that few people truly know what it actually is .
Below is a long list of items found in foods and other products that can contain animal parts .
Several of them have a vegan alternative but unless absolutely sure , most of these items and ingredients should be avoided .
A good philosophy to have when it comes to eating in general , whether vegan or not .... the more natural it is the better !

What is most striking about the “ Tea Party ” is the complete discordance between what Tea Party supporters say about the Tea Party and its goals and what we “ know ” about these from the Tea Party ’s outpourings .
The sheer wealth of conflicting data is enough to make your head spin .
We progressives see lunatics – and we ’re not alone .
Tea Partiers present themselves as average , everyday Americans who have been pushed too far .
From their perspective , they are us .
They are America .
But they are no America I know or am familiar with .
Their America seems to be a phobic , paranoid little place rife with conspiracies intent on overthrowing “ real ” America .
Nowhere is this rhetoric , and the narrative of impending tyranny at the hands of a “ black , non-American white - hating Indonesian Muslim , ” more evident than in the phenomenon known as the Tea Party .
Asking , “ What is the Tea Party ? ” might seem like a silly question at this point , but it is an important one ; we cannot have a meaningful discussion if we cannot agree on our terms .
Advertisements
Yet there are problems .
We might wish to establish the movement ’s bona fides up front , but that is not easily done .
David Barstow writes in the New York Times of the Tea Party as a “ sprawling rebellion ” : “ The Tea Party movement defies easy definition , largely because there is no single Tea Party . ”
We progressives criticize and then are told that there are actually two tea parties : the “ Tea Party Nation ” and the “ Tea Party Movement .
” The TPN is ( so the story goes ) a group that is trying to insinuate themselves ( or itself ) as the “ leaders ” of the movement ( they would disagree ) .
I am told these people are staunch Republican partisans and are attempting to co-opt the movement , the “ true ” Tea Party ( Real Americans ?
Real Tea Partiers ? ) .
The explanation I get is that it is the TPN which is pushing more of a social agenda ; the movement itself is based on fiscal issues .
If you visit the Tea Party Nation website , you will find that “ Tea Party Nation ( or TPN ) is a user - driven group of like - minded people who desire our God given Individual Freedoms which were written out by the Founding Fathers .
We believe in Limited Government , Free Speech , the 2nd Amendment , our Military , Secure Borders and our Country ! ”
If you visit the site of the “ Tea Party Patriots , ” the “ Official Home of the Tea Party Movement ” you find a similar mission statement :
“ Tea Party Patriots as an organization believes in the Fiscal Responsibility , Constitutionally Limited Government , and Free Markets . ”
They also claim to be a “ grassroots organization . ”
There seems to be no difference between the two groups .
They both claim channeling our Founding Fathers .
How can this be ?
Will the “ real ” Tea Party please stand up !
It is significant that the TPN is supposed to be the group in thrall to the GOP .
But the TPM – those fiscally minded folks – is supported by Freedomworks – not a libertarian group as you might have reason to suspect from the rhetoric – but a conservative nonprofit led by former Republican House Majority Leader Dick Armey .
Freedomworks claims “ FreedomWorks fights for lower taxes , less government and more economic freedom for all Americans . ”
This does not advance our cause much – How can we know what we ’re talking about when we talk about “ Tea Partiers , ” “ Teabaggers ” or “ the Tea Party ” ?
In David Barstow ’s study of the Tea Party movement (s ) in the New York Times , he makes the following observation : “ The ebbs and flows of the Tea Party ferment are hardly uniform .
It is an amorphous , factionalized uprising with no clear leadership and no centralized structure . ”
“ At the grass - roots level , it consists of hundreds of autonomous Tea Party groups , widely varying in size and priorities , each influenced by the peculiarities of local history . ”
It ’s no wonder then when criticism is leveled that individual Tea Partiers cry foul and say “ that ’s not it at all ! ”
It may not be – for them locally , or individually .
But can you be a Tea Partier without a party ?
In a way , many of these protests remind me of Christians who say , when confronted with the horrors Christianity has perpetrated on the world for 2,000 years , “ They were n’t real Christians , ” and now the cry is , “ They ‘re not real Tea Partiers ! ”
Well , I answer , “ They say they are . ”
And I ask again , how do we tell them apart ?
How do we tell them apart ?
The Media , which has a center - right bias , does not always appear to know ( or perhaps admit ) that there is more than one current flowing , and that these are sometimes at cross-purposes .
It is in the interest of conservatives ( and the media is conservative ) to make the Tea Party appear to be one big happy – and conservative – family .
Conclusion
Lunatics R Us ?
That seems to be the finding of a conservative reporter writing for Newsweek who attended the Tea Party gathering in Nashville .
Jonathan Kay writes that “ Many of the tea - party organizers I spoke with at this conference described the event as a critical step in their ascendancy to the status of mainstream political movement .
Yet with rare exceptions , such as blogger Breitbart , who was reportedly overheard protesting Farah ’s birther propaganda , none of them seems to realize how off - putting the toxic fantasies being spewed from the podium were . ”
He further denounces the failings of the mainstream media , who do n’t bother to catalog “ these bizarre , conspiracist outbursts ” of “ radicalized conservatives [ who ] will behave like unhinged paranoiacs when they collect in the same room . ”
Speaking at least of the TPN then , Mr. Kay writes that “ That does n’t say much for the state of the right in America .
The tea partiers ’ tri-cornered hat is supposed to be a symbol of patriotism and constitutional first principles .
But when you take a closer look , all you find is a helmet made of tin foil . ”
Where do the Tea Partiers themselves stand on the issues ?
That depends upon who you ask .
As noted at the outset of this piece , there is a disconnect between what they say they ’re saying and what we ’re hearing .
The problem for the rest of us – and more significantly perhaps , for the Tea Partiers themselves – is that with them all looking and sounding so much alike , we ca n’t tell who has the tinfoil hats and who does n’t .
I have always loved and protected them just as they loved and protected me .
Running
Wolf explained that they would miss me very much ,
but that one day we would all be together again .
They had done everything that they could do to make me well and happy ,
but I just kept getting sicker .
It was with their blessings that I was set free
so that I could go towards the light .
There would always be a special place in their hearts for me .
He said that
every time that Mommy lights the candles
the glow will reaffirm their love for me .
It will also renew their promise to join me one day
when they come to that turn in the road
and climb the golden stairs to heaven .
We all smiled at the thought
that then we would be reunited
for forever and one day more .

The launch of ESA 's CryoSat - 2 satellite from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan , scheduled for 25 February , has been delayed due to a concern related to the second stage steering engine of the Dnepr launcher .
Although the fuel supply of the second stage engine should be sufficient to get CryoSat into orbit , the fuel reserve is not as large as they would like it to be , according to the Ukrainian company Yuzhnoye , who developed and is responsible for the launcher .
The situation is being reviewed , and measures will be taken to resolve this concern .
Kosmotras , the launch provider , will inform ESA of a new launch date shortly .
CryoSat - 2 will fly in a highly inclined polar orbit , reaching latitudes of 88° north and south , to maximise its coverage of the poles .
From an altitude of just over 700 km , CryoSat will precisely monitor changes in the thickness of sea ice and variations in the thickness of the ice sheets on land .
Sanda had been on the market for about £ 2.5 m A Swiss businessman is thought to have paid about £ 2.5 m for a small group of islands off the west coast of Scotland .
The deal includes the island of Sanda , which has its own pub but only one resident , as well as the neighbouring Sheep Island and Glunimore Insland .
The three islands lie off the tip of the Mull of Kintyre , 13 miles south of Campbeltown .
The sale was confirmed by Dick Gannon , who had owned the three islands for the past 20 years with his wife Meg .
The buyer was named locally as Michi Meier , who is originally from Switzerland but now lives in Sweden .
Mr Gannon , 59 , said : " The island is sold , close to the asking price , to a customer sent over by Hamburg - based selling agents Vladi Private islands , but I can't say any more about the sale than that .
" The new owner is taking over at the end of April .
It 's a bit of a mystery what he is going to do but I am hoping it will go on as it is now , as a business , as a tourist destination . "
I think it is a bargain .
Sanda is a beautiful island , you can farm there and you have also got six self catering cottages and an award winning pub
Dick Gannon
Previous owner Sanda had been on sale since August 2008 .
It was originally priced at £ 3.2 m but dropped to offers around £ 2.5 m .
Mr Gannon said : " I think it is a bargain .
Sanda is a beautiful island , you can farm there and you have also got six self catering cottages and an award winning pub . "
Mrs Gannon has always lived at the family home in Campbeltown while her husband was the island 's only listed resident .
Although they have three sons and a daughter , none of their family was interested in taking over Sanda .
Mr Gannon said : " 20 years we have had Sanda and it's been the experience of a lifetime really but it's a bit like hiding away and I now want to visit a few places and do a few things .
There is a life outside Sanda . "
Mr Meier could not be contacted , but has been speaking to a number of business people in Kintyre about services for the island in recent weeks .
Terry Smith , who owns farm land at Southend , near the Mull of Kintyre - the nearest mainland point to the 314 acre isle of Sanda - said Mr Meier had visited him last week .
Tourism destination
He said it was his understanding the new owner intended to run Sanda for his family 's private use .
Kintyre Councillor Donald Kelly said : " I would sincerely hope that Sanda will stay as a tourism venue and that the community will be able to work constructively with the new owner to the benefit of Kintyre . "
Sanda was home to only a few derelict buildings when the Gannons bought the three - isle chain for £ 250,000 in 1990 .
Mr Gannon spent years building the island into a unique tourism destination , renovating the buildings into the award winning Byron Darnton tavern and six self catering cottages .
The Gannons , who marketed Sanda as " a piece of paradise " , are selling up because of their decision to separate .
The island 's 350 breeding ewes are included in the sale , along with chickens which produce free range eggs and enjoy such a good reputation that customers , including Princess Anne , have sailed in specially to buy them .
The other two islands in the chain are uninhabited apart from a flock of 60 Soay sheep on Sheep Island .

Thanks , but No Thanks German Banks Turn Their Backs on Greek Bonds
Greece needs to refinance 20 billion euros ' worth of debt by May , but has found it difficult to raise money on the bond markets .
On Thursday , the country delayed an issue out of fear of a ratings downgrade .
And on Friday , German banks said they are n't interested in taking on more Greek debt .
For Immediate Release
WASHINGTON – The Libertarian Party adamantly opposes the health care bill passed on Christmas Eve by the US Senate that is currently being considered in the US House of Representatives .
The Libertarian Party calls on the US House to vote down this disastrous plan , and instead to pass laws reducing federal involvement in health care .
Libertarian Party Chairman William Redpath commented , “ We oppose this horrible federal government expansion into health care , just as we have consistently opposed all the increased government intrusion into health care proposed by Republicans and Democrats over the years .
For example , we vocally opposed the huge Medicare expansion pushed through Congress by Republicans in 2003 . ”
Redpath continued , “ It is a virtual certainty that the cost estimates of this legislation are drastically understated .
When Medicare Part A started in 1965 , the projected cost for 1990 was $ 9 billion .
It turned out to be $ 67 billion .
Should this bill become law , when the debt of the United States government is downgraded by ratings agencies shortly thereafter , it will not be a coincidence .
That will increase interest rates , and the entire economy will suffer . ”
The Libertarian Party Platform says the following about health care : “ We favor restoring and reviving a free market health care system .
We recognize the freedom of individuals to determine the level of health insurance they want , the level of health care they want , the care providers they want , the medicines and treatments they will use and all other aspects of their medical care , including end - of - life decisions . ”
The words “ health care ” and “ medicine ” are not found anywhere in the Constitution .
Accordingly , the Libertarian Party asserts that Congress has no authority to regulate or appropriate money for health care .
( The Libertarian Party has consistently argued for decades that the “ general welfare ” and “ interstate commerce ” clauses are not generic authorizations for spending and regulation . )
Redpath concluded , “ This is a top - down , Washington - mandated control of health insurance and health care in this nation .
It is the antithesis of consumer - driven health care , which is what will ultimately be necessary to control health care costs and to provide the best health care for the greatest number of people . ”

The LP is America ’s third - largest political party , founded in 1971 .
The Libertarian Party stands for free markets and civil liberties .

Croc versus bat
Updated
Freshwater crocodiles snap at bats swooping towards the water at Fitzroy Crossing , north - western WA , October 24 , 2004 .
Photographer Drew Taylor ( orca1 ) writes on ABC Contribute : " I could n't believe my luck when I managed to get this shot .
I was like a little boy jumping around in my boat after seeing the digital image on the screen .
Take note of all the crocs sitting in the water waiting for their moment of chance . "

( Natural News ) The U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) recently issued new restrictions for four popular long - acting asthma drugs .
Novartis AG 's Foradil , GlaxoSmithKline 's Serevent and Advair , and AstraZeneca 's Symbicort , all contain an ingredient that relaxes airway muscles in the lungs which can cause asthma- related death .
If not accompanied by other asthma drugs to offset this life - threatening side effect , the consequences could be fatal .
These drugs have long contained a label that reads , " increases risk of asthma - related death " , but apparently this warning is not enough for this extreme class of medications .
Known as long - acting beta-agonists ( LABAs ) , these asthma drugs are used by roughly six million asthma sufferers to combat asthma symptoms .
Ironically , LABAs are so dangerous that , if not combined with other asthma drugs , can actually cause an asthma attack .
It defies logic to try to figure out how asthma drugs that can kill people by causing severe asthma attacks are considered to be useful and effective medicine .
Instead of pulling these dangerous drugs from the market entirely as it should , the FDA is ordering that stronger labels be affixed to warn doctors and physicians about the extreme risks associated with taking the drugs .
It is unclear from the agency 's press release exactly how it intends to strengthen the drugs ' current death warning .
The FDA has indicated that it will require the drugs ' manufacturers to conduct education campaigns for medical professionals about how to safely use the LABA asthma drugs .
The agency is also mandating that each manufacturer conduct additional studies to verify the safety of their drugs .
Since 2002 , the FDA had continually rejected all of the overwhelming evidence presented to it that LABAs are inherently dangerous .
Only in 2008 did the FDA first admit that the drugs were dangerous , particularly for children and some adults .
Prior to that , the agency seemed to be in agreement with a series of industry spin pieces concocted by the drug industry to defend the alleged safety of the drugs ; this alone exhibits the FDA 's lunacy in asking the industry to conductof its own safety studies .
While warning that the drugs should only be used " as necessary " seems like a step in the right direction , the FDA should be taking a leap to pull these drugs off the market .
Many experts agree that these drugs are wholly dangerous , and that the industry has been aware of these dangers for nearly a decade .
Once again , the FDA is giving lip service to the public it is supposed to be defending while protecting drug industry interests instead .

I.B.M.
I.B.M. and a Saudi Arabian research institute are collaborating to develop a desalination plant powered by a new type of solar technology .
The goal is to build a desalination project in the Saudi city of Al Khafji capable of producing 7.9 million gallons of water a day that would supply 100,000 people .
Desalination is an energy - intensive process , which has limited the deployment of such plants outside desert regions like the Middle East .
But I.B.M. and the Saudi research institute , the King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology , plan to dramatically reduce the electricity costs by building a 10 - megawatt solar farm that deploys ultra-high concentrator photovoltaic arrays .
The technology will concentrate the sun 1,500 times on a solar cell to boost efficiency .
That ’s about three times the solar concentration of most concentrating photovoltaic panels currently in operation .
Sharon Nunes , vice president of I.B.M. ’s Big Green Innovations division , said in an interview Tuesday that the key to increasing the solar panels ’ efficiency was a device called a liquid metal thermal interface .
A legacy of Big Blue ’s mainframe computer work , the liquid metal thermal interface acts as a heat sink to cool the extreme temperatures generated by concentrating photovoltaic systems .
“ The solar component is something we ’ve been implementing and that we have done testing on for the past two years , ” Ms. Nunes said .
“ We ’re quite confident with the results . ”
I.B.M. has not yet revealed the efficiency of such a solar system at converting sunlight into electricity .
But Jenny Hunter , a company spokeswoman , said it was expected to be a significant increase over current concentrating photovoltaic technology .
I.B.M. has had discussions with solar developers about using the technology , Ms. Nunes said .
The researchers are still exploring options to run the plant when the sun is not shining , looking at technologies to store solar electricity as well conventional power sources .
To further cut energy costs , the company and Saudi researchers said they had developed a nanomembrane that desalinates water and removes toxins while using less electricity .
Ms. Nunes said the company expected that a pilot version of the desalination plant will be built later this year .
If all goes well , I.B.M. will enter talks with plant builders about rolling out the technology to other parts of the world .
That 's not the sun .
But for a brief period , in a small Arctic town in Canada , in the dead of winter , it was the next - best thing .

This 100,000 lumen artificial sun lit up the town of Inuvik , giving them long days during a winter that 's mostly shrouded in darkness .
It was sponsored by Tropicana , which I 'm sure had some bizarre marketing angle about orange juice and breakfast and sunrises .
BUT : the important thing is that technology — as simple as affixing lights to a large helium balloon — gave light to 3,500 people who were otherwise mired in darkness .

Wat een ‘ goed ’ bed is , is individueel te bepalen afhankelijk van het gewicht , de lichaamslengte , de taillebreedte , de heupbreedte , enz ...
Het is dan ook niet moeilijk te begrijpen dat het noodzakelijk is om gedurende onze slaap onze rug te ontlasten .
Pascal Mannekens is universitair kinesitherapeut gespecialiseerd in motorische revalidatie .
Ook vochtabsorptie is van belang aangezien we per nacht zo ’n 200 ml vocht afgeven .
Hiervoor is wol zeer geschikt als deklaag : het neemt vocht op zonder kil aan te voelen en door zijn absorberend vermogen en goede isolatie - eigenschap­pen voorkomt wolvezel plotse afkoeling bij de temperatuurverlaging .
Wat ook nog meespeelt bij de keuze van het slaapsysteem is de warmte - isolatie en de vochtabsorptie .
De matras moet de warmte isoleren tot 30 - 35 °C .
De mens koelt ‘s nachts af en bij een slechte isolatie koelen we te fel af met mogelijk verkrampte spieren tot gevolg .
Aangezien er meestal een gewichtverschil is tussen beide partners , is het aan te raden om aparte matrassen aan te schaffen want een gewichtsverlies van 20kg geeft reeds aanzienlijke verschillen in de keuze van de matras .
Concreet betekent dit dat men niet te hard , noch te zacht mag liggen , maar moet de matras in zijlig de vorm van de schouders en heupen goed opvangen en in ruglig meegeven ter hoogte van de schouders en de heupen en eveneens steun bieden ter hoogte van de nek , de taille en de benen .
In een goed ondersteunend bed zal de natuurlijke positie van de wervelkolom gehandhaafd blijven .
Wanneer men zijlings slaapt , blijft de wervelkolom het beste in een horizontale lijn .
In ruglig moet de wervelkolom zijn normale S - vorm behouden .
2. Slaaphoudingen .
Vooraleer een goede positie aan te kunnen nemen , moet je op ideale wijze in bed belanden .
In bed doe je het best door erin te kruipen , je te laten doorzakken en dan op buik of zij te gaan liggen .
De beste houding is de zijlig : omdat er dan geen belastende druk is op bloedva­ten en ingewanden .
Negatief tegenover de ruglig is de minder stabiele houding , met een kleiner steunvlak .
Voor rugpatiënten blijkt de foetushouding ideaal te zijn : zijlig met de benen opgetrokken .
De ruglig heeft als voordeel dat hier het grootst mogelijk oppervlak wordt gebruikt om het gewicht te verdelen , waardoor de druk op de tussenwervelschij­ven geminimaliseerd wordt .
Ook is deze houding heel stabiel waardoor onze spieren maximaal ontlast worden .
In ruglig kan het aangenaam zijn om kussens te gebruiken onder de knieën of in de rugholte .
Om echter de juiste houding te vinden per patiënt is raadpleging van de arts aan te raden .
Doe alle inspanningen niet teniet door op de verkeerde wijze uit bed te komen maar ga op je zij liggen , gebruik je hand als steun bij het opheffen van je romp .
3. Seksualiteit en lage rugpijn .
Lage rugpijn kan bij zowel man als vrouw aanleiding geven tot seksuele proble­men .
Aan de basis van verminderd seksueel genot ligt lichamelijke vermoeidheid , de rugpijn zelf en niet te vergeten de angst voor meer rugpijn .
Dit leidt naar een vicieuze cirkel waarbij seksueel contact gezien wordt als een verergering van pijn waardoor de frequentie en de duur van geslachtsgemeenschap daalt .
Spierrelaxatie en oefeningen die de beweeglijkheid van het bekken en de rug bevorderen , zullen ook het succes mee bepalen .
Licht ook uw partner in want seksuele disfuncties gaan vaak gepaard met emoties zoals pijn , angst , schuld en schaamte .
Aanbevelingen :
1. Vraag advies aan je arts
2. Spreek met je partner af om niet door te gaan bij optreden van pijn
3 . Hecht belang aan het voorspel
4 . Open communicatie in het gezin is de sleutel tot succes
5 . Blijf positief denken en verwijt mekaar niets
My many readers ( read : my family ) have often asked why I established a secret organisation intent on taking over the world ( and whether I ’m doing any real work at Uni , and whether I ’m going to get a proper job and move out any time soon , and so on… ) .
While few things could possibly be traced back to a single source , there is no denying a certain pivotal character in my life , and with recent news of his unfortunate passing away , I feel a tribute is necessary if only to show just how truth can really be stranger than fiction sometimes .
The identity in question is none other than my year 11 English teacher , Mr T , as he shall be called .
We just so happened to get him in what he believed to be his final year of teaching before retirement , but whether this really had as much influence on his behaviour as he would have us believe is probably up for debate .
The bottom line was he loved teaching English ( amongst other things ) to young and malleable minds .
He had no time for “ scrotes ” and would not hesitate to send anyone that attempted to be disruptive , outside to play football for the rest of the lesson .
That said , he repeatedly explained how if your marks were not up to scratch then he was entirely open to bribes .
Not just any old bribe however .
His only currency was that of European type of “ Mozart ” chocolates , a box of which he would routinely show us and describe as being “ better than an orgasm ” .
He also apparently had a fondness for schnapps , as highlighted by his desire to bring some in for us to sample as we studied Peter Goldsworthy ’s Maestro .
Some substances he was not quite so open to consuming however , if his militant attempts to cram veganism down our throats were anything to go by .
This ranged from articles about how a lady cured her terminal cancer by simply removing dairy from her diet ( in slight contradiction to his love affair with chocolate ) , to showing us videos of abattoirs in action .
The scene of the intact , yet unseeing cow head slowly rolling across the pile of moving mince was especially poignant .
Of course , he then contrasted all of this with a story about a surgeon - turned - drug dealer who gets stranded on an island with nothing to eat except his own limbs , using his stash as anaesthetic .
An interesting dilemma to be sure , but it ’s a tad hard to ponder when you ’re busy trying to avoid throwing up .
Mr T was also unique as a proudly Buddhist teacher in a Christian school , to the extent of having his own Zen garden at home and being so devoutly against killing animals that a couple of students in our class caught him releasing rats he ’d caught at home in the staff car park .
Consequently , having him teach a religious education class probably was n’t really in the school ’s best interests as he proceeded to fanatically elaborate on the virtues of anarchy for the whole lesson .
Indeed , one fine Friday when the weather was lovely and we were all feeling quite relaxed and cheerful , ready for the last lesson of the week , he walked in , took one look at us and then spent the rest of the lesson describing the great many ways in which humanity is doomed .
As the siren finally sounded at the end of the lesson , he explained to our stunned silent stares that we ’d been in such a cheerful mood when he came in that he ’d decided he had to put a stop to it .
We even had the scenario put towards us of whether upon learning that Armageddon was only minutes away , would we cast aside social norms and get it on with each other ?
I do n’t think you could blame someone for performance anxiety in that situation .
It ’s probably no surprise that many of us wondered whether he ’d had a CAT scan any time recently .
This concern was especially highlighted by the case of one of the girls in the class being told that her recent submission was so good he ’d like a copy to keep .
She gladly left a copy on his desk later , only to have it handed back with a really low mark and a note telling her that she could do much better .
Regardless , we all survived the year , with only one of us being converted to vegetarianism as far as I recall .
We were definitely all much more cultured as a result of being exposed to significant diversions from mainstream content with Cat on a Hot Tin Roof ( There ’s a great Simpsons scene that makes sense as a result ) , If… , Slaughterhouse - Five , Brave New World ( original ) and so on .
I think it ’s safe to assume that several of the titles he showed to us had their roots in significant consumption of illicit substances , but despite that I would certainly say he inspired a strong incentive to examine the logic behind typically unquestioned human motives .
Failing that , he gave us some interesting memories .
I think he can safely rest in peace , knowing that none of us will ever be at peace again .

In the face of constant news about how the Internet connects people and empowers them , Sam Harris provided an interesting and contrarian perspective here at the brainy TED Conference in Long Beach , California .
The eternal skeptic and author of " The End of Faith " responded in this way when I asked him what the most destructive technology on the planet is :
" Increasingly the Internet itself , given our reliance on it , is a source of destructive technology .
I think we really have to worry about cyber terrorism and cyber crime increasingly .
But there 's obviously nuclear proliferation and bio-weapons and chemical weapons . "
But the Web is n't completely bad , he said :
" I think it 's had two diametrically opposed effects .
One effect has been really good .
It 's created transformation and empowered people and allowed us to debunk bad ideas in a very ... decisive way .
It 's almost created a cognitive immune system for the planet . "
He continued : " It 's also empowered pranks and pseudoscience and bad information because every person on the Internet can sort of find the people like them and everyone can find an audience so there are certain forms of ignorance that would more or less be unthinkable without the Internet .
Global jihad has been massively empowered by the Internet .
Even things like the 911 truth conspiracy .
That , to my mind , is an Internet phenomenon .
No one would publish those books .
This is something that is born of Web sites and Internet commentary . "
It 's yet to be seen whether technology 's overall effect on humanity has been good or bad , he said .
" The final chapter is not written on that .
It 's made it much better and yet it 's given us the power to make it worse .
It 's conceivable that if we fail to build a truly viable global civilization we could use technology to immiserate ourselves more deeply than we would have had we not invented the technology . "

TWO questions faced an American congressional panel on Thursday March 5th as it considered the mass killings of Armenians during and after the first world war by forces of the Ottoman Empire .
First , was it genocide ?
The historical debate is as hot , and unsettled , as ever .
Armenians continue to insist that it was the first genocide of the twentieth century , while Turks call the killings merely part of the chaos of the break - up of empire .
But the second question on the minds of congressmen in the Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of Representatives was more urgent .
What is more important , fidelity to history or concern for the present ?
The vote took place as warming relations between Turkey and Armenia have cooled again and those between Turkey and America are under increasing strain over Iran , Israel and other affairs in the region .
Turkish diplomats and politicians gave warning before the vote that the consequences would be felt across the range of issues of shared concern to the two countries .
In the end the panel narrowly decided against pragmatism and chose to set straight the historical records .
A resolution recognising the killings as genocide was sent to the House by a vote of 23 to 22 .
When the same House committee passed a “ genocide ” resolution in 2007 the White House urged that the vote be scrapped .
But this year , it had come with a twist ; Barack Obama had promised during his election campaign to recognise the event as genocide .
But before the vote his advisers said that while he acknowledges a genocide personally , he urged unsuccessfully that official interpretation be left to the parties involved .
Congress is far more sensitive to lobbying than the president and to small but highly motivated groups of voters .
Lobbyists working for both Armenians and Turks had been active before the vote and Armenians are concentrated in several Californian districts .
But no fashioner of foreign policy — among whom the president is by far the most important — can ignore the strategic importance of Turkey .
It is a vital American ally and has the second - biggest army in NATO .
The country is home to an important American air base and is a crucial supply route for America 's forces in Iraq .
Relations were difficult even before the beginning of the war in Iraq in 2003 .
The mildly Islamist government denied the Americans the ability to open a second front in Iraq through Turkey .
Turkey 's relationship with Israel has deteriorated too .
Israel 's two recent wars , in Lebanon and Gaza , have outraged Turkish public opinion .
Mr Obama 's more even - handed approach to the Israel - Palestine conflict has improved America 's reputation in Turkey , but not by much .
Turkey itself is caught between forces that make the Armenia issue potentially dangerous .
The country 's secular , Western - oriented politicians , among others , have been discouraged by the strict terms offered by the European Union for eventual Turkish membership .
In part as a result there has been a gradual realignment in Turkish foreign policy towards its more immediate neighbours .
Turkey 's government seeks peaceful relations with countries at its borders , which has meant some cosying up to Iran , despite the fact that most of Turkey 's NATO allies are pushing for more sanctions against the Islamic republic over its alleged efforts to obtain nuclear weapons .
The vote comes at a sensitive time , too , for Turkey 's relations with Armenia .
The pair have been at odds since Turkey closed the border in 1993 , during Armenia 's war with Turkey 's ethnic cousins in Azerbaijan .
Last year , protocols were agreed that foresaw an establishment of diplomatic relations and an opening of the border .
But Armenia 's highest court then declared that the protocols were in line with Armenia 's constitutionally mandated policy that foreign affairs conform to the Armenian view of the genocide .
Turkey responded with fury and the protocols were endangered .
The American vote will anger Turkey further and perhaps make it even more inclined to turn away from Europe , America and Armenia in favour of its Islamic neighbours .
One hope is that Turkish anger will subside if , as happened in 2007 , the House leadership stops the resolution from reaching a full vote .
It may do so again .
Turkey recalled its ambassador after Thursday 's vote just as in 2007 .
The Turkish government , in a spat with the country 's nationalist army , may play the foreign - insult card to bolster its domestic strength .
But ultimately the Turks are unlikely to weaken their relationship with America lightly .

Yesterday , I inadvertently squandered $ 4000 plus worth of medical resources during a lunch break .
That I could do this , gain no benefit , and not even see the bills , is what 's right and wrong with American medical care .
I 'll tell the story in moment but first consider that none of the politically active reform proposals being debated deal with the absence of market pricing for medical care , that system - wide problem that there is a disconnect between the supplier and the consumer , and this problem is absolutely pervasive .
You rarely know the prices of what you are getting , and even when you do , the prices are an abstraction : something to know but not act on , since they do n't really affect your premiums as with other forms of insurance .
The result is hardly surprising .
End -user costs soar higher and higher and resource use lacks that essential component of economizing by priority .
The American system just assumes that there is no such thing as too much technology , too many drugs , too much service , too much care .
The consumer , in the end , is n't really a consumer but a passive conduit of an unchecked contractual relationship between producer and third - party payers who are heavily subsidized by taxpayers .
So now my slightly goofy story of how I spent probably $ 4000 yesterday without knowing it .
I had a chest cold of some sort that was getting on my nerves , so I finally decided to see the doctor at a walk - in clinic .
I complained of tightness in my chest that would n't go away .
Within minutes , an EKG machine was hooked up to my heart and x-rays were being taken of my chest .
Fifteen minutes later , the doctor came back to tell me that he found a big black spot on my lungs .
He inquired about my past smoking .
Of course at this point , I 'm ashen and woozy and worrying about who will update my Facebook page after I 'm dead .
The doctor orders a cat scan : " stat ! "
Suddenly , I felt like I was in a television show .
I make my way to a medical specialist company , a place that looks like an industrial castle .
I 'm greeted by receptionists , hooked up to an IV by nurse practitioners , and slapped down on the scanning machine , which whirls and buzzes wildly all over my chest .
The staff gathers around the pictures I could not see but I can see all these people 's faces through a glass .
They are staring and pointing with looks of intense seriousness .
Meanwhile , the scans are sent to a radiologist in Tennessee , who is also examining them .
In my mind , I 've already divided up my property among heirs and I 'm hoping that I have time to train someone to do stuff that I do .
My final wishes for world peace and prosperity will be written in my last message to the world , read to all those gathered at my funeral .
Thirty minutes later , they gather to tell me the news .
Nothing .
No one can see anything at all .
My lungs are pink , my heart is working away , and I 'm healthy as can be .
The nurse suggests that the walk - in clinic needs to fix their x-ray machine , which is evidently throwing blacks spots around the images .
Maybe it is a filter .
Maybe someone bumped the machine .
Regardless , my life was back and I appreciated all things anew .
Oh but wait .
I pointed out to them that I never received anything for my chest cold .
The lady said : " oh that .
Take some Mucinex . "
And that 's what $ 4000 bought yesterday between the hours of 1 and 5 pm .
Maybe it was more .
Maybe it was less .
I do n't really know .
On the one hand , the whole process was amazing .
The speed !
The efficiency !
The miraculous technology !
On the other hand , it was all wholly unnecessary .
Now , you might say , hey , do n't complain : at least you know .
That 's true enough .
But if there were really a concern about costs , I 'm not entirely sure this would have happened .
And can there be any doubt that the scan was ordered over liability concerns mainly ?
Lots of people benefit in this system .
You could say that I benefited .
But at what cost ?
And is the cost proportional to the benefit ?
This is what the system does n't seem to address .
And the reform proposals , so far as I can tell , are designed to make what I went through a universal feature of American medicine .
It 's wishful thinking , and while the attempt might last a while , eventually it will go the same way all such attempts go : skyrocketing costs and universal stagnation .

Nobody reduced my three felony charges to a misdemeanor .
But then again , I did n't learn and follow the lessons to be learned in this blog post .
Instead , I just exposed the crimes the FORs ( Friends of Republicans ) were doing , and so of course I had to be hammered for it .

Laws asked St. Louis County police to investigate on March 21 , the day after the incident .
" We did n't want anybody accusing us of a coverup , " Laws told the Post - Dispatch on Tuesday .
Overland Police Capt .
Michael Laws , the acting police chief of Overland , said a few other Overland officers have been suspended with pay from the department while the investigation continues to see what role , if any , they had .
Laws refused on Tuesday to say how many other officers are involved or to identify them .
I applaud the acting Chief on bringing in St Louis County to handle the investigation .
Sounds as if charges are still being decided upon for the " few other " Overland cops currently suspended .
Sounds as if they know who erased the tapes and was perverting justice and we can only hope they receive the fullest punishment the law allows .
If we cant trust the Police to be honest even against one of their own , were all screwed .

Steve @ # 1 , I looked back at some of the old Brad Blog articles and I found one in which it said that your charge would be reduced to a misdemeanor for good behavior after a year , I think it was ?
I 'm guessing that did n't happen .
I will always be grateful that you broke the law in order to expose actual criminal activity that had far - reaching effects on our entire election system .
What a contrast to these lawbreakers who had to make up criminal activity that never existed and sell it to the public to bring down an organization that helped so many people .

@ Laura , No. 11 .
Thanks for your very kind words .
I plead guilty to and was convicted of one felony , and I was sentenced to three years of probation .
Per the plea agreement , after staying out of trouble for one year my felony conviction was , in fact , reduced to a misdemeanor .
I completed the last two years of probation without incident and my conviction was expunged .
The expungement is per Cal. law for a first offender who completes all requirements of probation , as I did .
But I did get charged with three felonies , and convicted of one felony .
These little pissants ( O'Keefe , et. al. ) will , it seems , only be charged with misdemeanors .
And the aforementioned pissants have deep - pocket donors from the right - wing to cover their legal bills .
My wife and I had to double mortgage our house to pay my legal bills .
Our defense fund did receive generous donations from progressive individuals from all over the country , and we are very grateful for that .
But that double mortgage was still necessary , and that continues to weigh us down financially to a very significant degree .
Also , there were no right - wingers standing by to offer me gainful employment .
I got fired when the news broke that I 'd been charged with three felonies ( in March of 2006 ) , and four years later this ex-felon is still unemployed ( but going to school full time to train for another career , and should be working again in the near future ) .
I have no complaints ; I did what I did , and my wife and I had to pay the price .
I do wish , however , that other parties who were involved in criminal wrongdoing in my case had been held to account .
And I also believe that O'Keefe , et. al. are getting preferential treatment and being handled with the proverbial " kid gloves . "
I had no such luck .
But then again , IOKIFYAR .

@ Steve # 13 , Thanks for the clarification , that you had been charged with 3 felonies and convicted of one ; then later the conviction was reduced .
Yeah , quite a difference from our well - connected miscreants who had their charges reduced .
We 'll just have to figure out some other way to MTPFHOP ( make them pay for hurting other people ) .

There does seem to be something wrong with our jurisprudence system .
Just yesterday one of the criminals guilty of the meltdown plea bargained down from a sentence that would have incarcerated him for 25 years to a meagre 6 months for hoodwinking millions from their nest eggs .

In March 2010 , we launched a bold advertising campaign which saw beautifully illustrated posters of some of the pet names women call their vaginas plastered around London Underground and pulled along by adbikes displaying the URL loveyourvagina.com .
Visitors to loveyourvagina.com could submit their own pet names in the online poll , as well as find out more about Mooncup® .
The aim was to transform the conversation and break the taboo around talking about vaginas ( and how we look after them ) , periods and sanitary protection .
The campaign received a huge amount of publicity , with The Guardian calling it the model for green advertising .
It was the first time we had done a campaign on such a big scale .
The book was designed by Lisa Murphy and is called Tactile Minds .
It is designed to be ' enjoyed ' by the blind and visually impaired - and is on sale for £ 150 .

The premiere of the first episode of the new series of Doctor Who was screened in Cardiff .
The new Timelord , Matt Smith , chatted to BBC 's entertainment reporter Lizo Mzimba - and let slip a couple of secrets ...
He smiled and looked around the restaurant , which has a museumlike collection of basketball memorabilia : “ We like that portrayal . ”
With hair as white as his laugh is quick , the 73 - year - old Plump is as engaging and unpretentious as the restaurant that bears his name .
The best seller at Plump ’s is a pork tenderloin sandwich that Angelo Pizzo , who wrote and co-produced “ Hoosiers , ” said was the size of a Frisbee .
The bar favorite is $ 2 Miller High Life drafts .
Plump boasted that two years ago , the bar sold more Maker ’s Mark bourbon than any other bar in the state .
On Monday , as the after - work crowd trickled in , the song “ Patience ” by Guns N’ Roses whistled through the restaurant .
It is a down - home place where Butler Coach Brad Stevens said he was a frequent visitor .
Stevens knows all about the allure of “ Hoosiers . ”
His office was once situated where he could see people wander in to gaze at Hinkle Fieldhouse .
They would come tell Stevens , then a low - level assistant , their favorite story of Hinkle , and he would tell them his favorite right back .
Stevens said that people would occasionally still come in the gym during Butler practice and yell , “ Hickory ! ” the name of the team in “ Hoosiers . ”
Stevens said of Plump : “ He ’s an icon in Indiana and a legend in Indiana and he makes a heck of a tenderloin sandwich .
He really does , it ’s great .
My wife and I go quite a bit in the summer . ”

Before Hollywood made crew cuts and set shots of local basketball here national lore , Plump had always been somewhat of an icon .
But he did not just live out his high school days .
He decided not to play in the N.B.A. after graduating from Butler .
Instead , he played for Phillips 66 because it paid better .
From there , he returned home to Indiana , where he opened an insurance business that evolved into a financial planning business .
He also opened up Plump ’s , which is now run by his son .
Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel sought peace with its neighbours
Israel 's prime minister has distanced himself from comments by a member of his cabinet who suggested Israel was heading for a new war with Lebanon .
Israel was " not seeking any conflict " with Lebanon , Benjamin Netanyahu said .
Earlier , Yossi Peled , minister without portfolio and a reserve army general , had said that a repeat of the 2006 war with Lebanon was only a matter of time .
More than 1,000 Lebanese , mostly civilians , and about 160 Israelis , mostly soldiers , died in the conflict .
" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu clarifies that Israel is not seeking any conflict with Lebanon , " the Israeli leader said in a statement on Saturday .
" Israel seeks peace with its neighbours . "
The statement came shortly after comments by Mr Peled were broadcast in which the minister said Israel was " heading towards a new confrontation " .
" In my estimation , understanding and knowledge it is almost clear to me that it is a matter of time before there is a military clash in the north , " he said .
In 2006 the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah launched a raid into Israel in which it captured two Israeli soldiers .
Hezbollah also sent thousands of rockets into northern Israel .
Israel launched huge air and sea attacks on targets all over Lebanon , and then a land invasion .
More than 1,000 Lebanese , many civilians , died in the war as well as 116 Israeli soldiers and 43 civilians .
In Lebanon , bridges , roads and thousands of homes were destroyed in the Israeli bombardment .
Last summer Eddie Izzard decided to run around England , Ireland , Scotland and Wales though not necessarily , as Eric Morecambe said , in the right order .
The touching and thought provoking programme , Eddie Izzard : Marathon Man , was buried alive quite late at night on BBC3 but , if you missed it , there are two more episodes .
To say he did it for Sports Relief is true up to a point .
The real reason is harder to fathom .
He had to run 1,000 miles – 43 consecutive marathons – followed by a motorised rickshaw ( with the camera crew ) and an ice - cream van ( with Flake 99s ) .
To see him stumbling along in blinding rain , no cheers , no crowds , no pavements , carrying the sodden flag of the appropriate country , made you want to shout : " Excelsior ! "
He was 47 and far more accustomed to six - inch heels than trainers .
The director of the Olympic Medical Institute , Professor Greg Whyte , rallying from the initial shock , said : " Being a competitive athlete is fundamentally miserable .
What he needs is people around him . "
You could , of course , say the same of a comedian .
In Thurber 's story The Day the Dam Broke , one man starts to run and the whole town joins in .
So , along the way , Eddie started to attract what I can only describe as sympathisers .
In Devizes a man began involuntarily to run beside him , saying : " Let me shake your hand , because I think there 's summat wrong wi ' you . "
Seventy - two - year - old Bruce Tulloch , who once ran across America , joined him for a while , wondering why runners run .
A couple of wild Welsh ponies , manes flying , galloped up to watch .
On the Brecon Beacons , when the motorised rickshaw ran out of puff , his whole camera crew ( fluffy caterpillar and all ) got out and ran after him .
In Skewen , South Wales , he knocked on a door and said : " My name 's Eddie Izzard .
I used to live here . "
His mother , however , died there .
" I was six , so I think it 's all about that loss of love and my desperation for it .
I turned to an audience as a substitute . "
As a teenager he cycled to Skewen from London .
" I keep going back .
Probably to recapture the time before my Mum died .
It makes you very independent .
Very cold and shut off , really .
This drive , because of something that disappeared . . . maybe I 'm just a big kid still determined to do these adventures I invent in my head . "
Running 30 miles a day on blistered and infected feet ( " I could lose my toenails , " he said .
" You could lose your nipples , too , " replied Jo , his therapist , heartlessly ) gives you plenty of time to think about this and that .
If only to stop you thinking about your nails and your nipples .
About being a transvestite , for instance .
" I 'm a transvestite , but I will thump people if they give me a hard time .
I do n't understand why .
But I was given these cards .
And I 'm honest about it .
It 's genetic .
Not my choice .
Just be truthful and get on with it . "
All punctuated with gasping breaths .
" And does the road wind upwards all the way ?
Yes , to the very end . "
Towards the end of the 10th marathon , he collapsed .
When they told him there were three switchback miles to go , he said : " I do that then . "
His therapist begged him to walk , but he did it running and , to celebrate , freewheeled downhill into Builth Wells ( pop. approx 2,000 ) and a rousing civic reception .
" I like making a little bit of a rumpus , a little bit of a circus coming to town , because I grew up in Bexhill , and not much happens in Bexhill . "
Even less , I suspect , in Builth Wells , but when it does they make the most of it .
Twitter had gone ahead like a carrier pigeon and the street was packed with cheering people , boys pulling faces at the camera , and the obligatory dog .
Eddie 's unadvertised gig seemed to be collecting an audience as it went along , as a boat collects barnacles .
The sunset sky glowed rosy .
Perhaps it would n't rain tomorrow .
He had run 277 miles in 11 days .
There were only 800 or so more miles to go .
He said : " I will finish .
By hook or by crook , I Will Finish . "
And you knew that , short of a thunderbolt , he would .
If you are going to run you must – so to speak – be driven .
I spent last week in Denmark , 40 miles outside of Copenhagen .
While nearly every Dane speaks near - perfect English , I of course stand out as an American .
I took a taxi from a resort hotel venue to the local train station .
The fare was 70 kroner ( about 15 dollars ) .
I gave the driver a 200 - kroner note .
He gave me back 30 kroner change .
So here ’s the question :
If it were you in that situation , what would you instantly assume about what is going on ?
Trusting vs. Being Trustworthy
Much of what we usually talk about on Trust Matters is trustworthiness , as opposed to trusting .
They are not the same thing ; in fact they are quite distinct .
The ability to trust strangers ( as will be described in this week ’s Trust Quotes interview with Eric Uslaner — tune in Wednesday ) is instilled in us when we were young , and does not change easily .
Trustworthiness , on the other hand , feels less risky and is more teachable .
The taxi driver incident is about trusting , not trustworthiness : and it offers a quick litmus test of your propensity to trust .
Which do you instinctively assume :
You assume that obviously the taxi - driver made a mental slip , thinking you had given him a 100 - kroner note , rather than a 200 - kroner note .
It is early in the morning , perhaps he has n’t had his coffee .
You politely point out you had given him 200 .
You momentarily think , “ What is going on here ?
Why did he do that ? ” and then just as quickly assume he probably just had a momentarily lapse .
Since the 200 - kroner note is still in his hand , you are comfortable pointing at it and smiling , so that he will notice his error .
You are mildly annoyed : you think , “ He ca n’t be pulling this move , can he ? ”
You quickly realize , however , there is no risk here ; you simply point out the 200 - kroner note still in his hand , somewhat clumsily sitting on his lap .
“ I gave you 200 , ” you firmly point out , realizing also he had plausible deniability — if pressed , he ’d almost certainly insist it was an honest mistake .
Adrenaline rises in you instantly : you think , “ What do you take me for , some naïve foreigner you can hustle ?
No way , Jose , are you getting away with this crap — not with me , you do n’t . ”
You point directly at his hand , still guiltily holding on the to the 200 - note , and say grimly with clenched teeth , “ You ’re short , buddy ; give me the other 100 , and you can forget about a tip . ”
There is no right or wrong answer here , there are simply degrees of propensity to trust .
Whether your answer is ‘ smart ’ is also situational ; you may answer differently in rural Denmark at 9 AM than you would in downtown Hamburg or Detroit at 2 AM ( and if not , you ’re naïve ) .
Given that , if your answer is :
You are very trusting , more so than the average person in the world .
Depending on the situation , you may be too trusting , in fact , for your own good .
You make a distinct choice to note your suspicions , but to act as if you do not have them ; people read you as responding from trust , though you have n’t given up your objectivity about risk .
You ’re a bit suspicious .
While most would not take offense at your response , neither are you likely to take advantage of some opportunities presented in life .
Your basic response to life is one of caution .
You believe you do n’t have much control over your life , and that others know it and are out to get you before you get them .
You expect little of others , and are rarely disappointed .
The interesting thing about trusting - ness is that it is catching .
The way you behave toward others influences the way they respond back to you .
Whether you expect the worst of people , or the best of people , you ’ll pretty much be right .
Act accordingly .

India needs more parks and corridors for long - term survival of its animals
Technology
ani -Staff
By Super Admin
Washington , March 11 ( ANI ) :
In a new study , an international team of scientists has determined that the long - term survival of many large species in the midst of rapid economic growth in India will require improving existing protected areas and establishing new protected areas and corridors .
The study , carried out by researchers at the Wildlife Conservation Society , Duke University , and other groups , found that country 's protected area system and human cultural tolerance for some species are key to conserving the subcontinent 's tigers , elephants , and other large mammals .
The researchers created models to estimate extinction probability for 25 large mammal species , determining current species distributions along with more than 30,000 historical records from natural history , taxidermy and museum records dating back 200 years .
The models were used to gauge how factors such as protected areas , forest cover , elevation , and human demographics , and cultural attitudes impact extinction predictions .
The results of the analysis found that all 25 species would experience some level of local extinction due to a variety of factors such as habitat loss and human population growth and development .
The study results confirmed that species do benefit from protected areas , especially large carnivores such as tigers and other forest - dwelling animals such as Sambar deer .
The species with the highest probable rates of extinction were large - bodied animals such as the wild buffalo ( 66 percent ) , habitat specialists such as the goat - like Nilgiri tahr ( 71 percent ) and the swamp deer ( 90 percent ) , and rare species had higher probabilities of extinction such as the Asiatic lions of Gir Forest ( 96 percent ) .
Factors such as human densities did increase the probability of extinction for many species with the exception of adaptable animals such as wild pigs , jackals , and blackbuck .
The researchers pointed out that many species , including ones that exist outside of protected areas and species that now occupy a tiny remnant of former ranges will require new protected areas to ensure their persistence .
" Our results highlight the need for an expansion of conservation planning to complement land use decisions and development , " said Krithi K. Karanth of Duke and Columbia University .
" This study provides us with a roadmap for next steps for conservation in India , " said Colin Poole , executive director of the Wildlife Conservation Society 's Asia Program .
" As India develops into a world economic power , it is critical that conservation planning is part of that expansion , " he added .
" Our work highlights the perilous state of wildlife in India and conservation priorities must help conserve the nation 's natural heritage , " said Karanth .

The Greek debt crisis deepened today , despite reassurances from European Union officials that the country was not on the brink of default .
Financial markets ignored European Central Bank President Jean - Claude Trichet 's comments that " a default is not an issue for Greece , " and continued their bond sell - off for a third day .
The yield on Greek bonds – which the country needs to pay to fund its schools , hospitals and other public spending – rose to 7.35 % , almost twice as much as Britain's .
This puts more pressure on Greece , making its financing practically unsustainable .
Investors want more details about a potential bailout package , something that the EU has so far failed to provide , dragging the crisis into its fourth month .
" It 's like game theory , " said Michael Krautzberger , head of European fixed - income at Blackrock , whose team manages $ 50 bn ( £ 33 bn ) in bond funds .
" At the beginning of the crisis , the EU did n't want to give help too quickly because they wanted to pressure Greece to cut their budget , but now we have reached a point where it 's clear they need the help .
For a few weeks , we thought maybe they do n't need the help , now we have passed that point , the yields are now too high to stay too long . "
The premium that investors demand to buy Greek bonds soared to 440 basis points over German bunds , the highest since the euro was created a decade ago .
The cost of insuring $ 10 m of Greek debt leapt to a record $ 470,000 , from $ 410,000 on Wednesday , before settling back at about $ 435,000 , according to Markit data .
That is more than four times the price paid for Britain 's debt protection .
The turmoil sent the euro and European equity markets lower , as a collapse of the Greek economy could have a domino effect on other southern European countries , such as Portugal .
The euro weakened to $ 1.328 , although it recovered slightly after Trichet 's comments , trading near $ 1.334 .
All major European stock indexes lost about 1 % .
" Greece continues to look like a slow - motion train crash , " Steve Barrow , analyst at Standard Bank , said .
" The crash has not occurred yet but it is coming .
Efforts to avoid a crash seem doomed to failure , whether it is emergency loans or some other initiative .
As the crisis plays out , so bond spreads are likely to widen much further and the euro fall much more . "
The so - called bond vigilantes , or activist bond investors , want more clarity about what interest Greece should pay on any potential bailout loan , something which still divides EU officials .
Led by German Chancellor Angela Merkel , some leaders say Greece should have to borrow at market rates .
" Countries like Germany know they have to help , but they would like to postpone it as much as possible as they have local elections in May and it's not necessarily popular , " Krautzberger said .
" Everyone would have been better off if they had been quicker , and Germany has a role here – things like local elections should not play such a role here . "
Greece admitted this week that its budget deficit would need to be revised up , to more than 12 % , the highest in the EU .
Greek banks have also asked for further funding as savings have fallen , driven by a capital flight .
Investors are especially worried as Greek banks have been the biggest buyers of Greek bonds recently .
" With or without support from the EU , the bottom line remains that after years of fiscal mismanagement the market has little confidence that Greece can swallow the necessary austerity measures and slash its budget deficit , " said Jane Foley , director of research at Forex.com .
She said : " The debt financing crisis for the Greek government is closer to boiling over . "
Greece needs to raise another € 35bn ( £ 31 bn ) this year to refinance its debt , of which € 10.5 bn must be raised by the end of May .
The country says it has already met its April financing needs , but plans to meet US investors from 19 April in a US tour , aiming to raise $ 5 bn .
In the meantime , investors are urging the EU " to see it 's necessary to help , and that we wo n't gain anything by postponing it another three to four weeks , " Krautzberger said .
" We have to accept the EU is a very complex institution and everything takes a long time .
But the longer it takes , the bigger the package .
The EU has to start walking the walk . "
Somalia : Danger signs are up
Maneuvering among contending forces is reflecting growing instability in a region of chronic chaos .
Islamic Al Shabaab rebels controlling most of southern Somalia have vowed holy war against Kenya in response to reports that 2,500 Kenyan troops had massed along the border poised to invade on behalf of Somalia ’s fragile transition government .
Eritrea was newly accused of providing the rebels with arms , despite a UN ban imposed last December .
PressTV reported that troops of Eritrea ’s enemy Ethiopia entered Somalia on Feb. 6 in a minor - league replay of Ethiopia ’s U.S. - backed occupation of Somalia in 2006 , which ended a year ago .
Two days later in the capital Mogadishu , exchanges of mortar and artillery fire left nine people killed and 14 injured .
Reuters notes that 21,000 people have been killed in Somalia over three years of near daily clashes .
Al Shabaab “ confirmed for the first time ” its alignment with Al Queda , according to the BBC on Feb .

Russia : Approval for Soviet system remains
Designers of a study asking Russians to assign value to the terms “ Soviet ” and “ anti-Soviet ” sought the opinions of 1,600 adults living in 42 widely distributed regions .
The survey , carried out over two days in mid-January , had a margin of error of less than 3.4 percent .
To the question “ What do you feel on hearing the word ‘ Soviet ’ , ” 31 percent noted “ nostalgia ; ” 18 percent , “ pride ; ” 17 percent , “ approval ; ” 13 percent , “ indifference ; ” 13 percent , “ appreciation ” ; 10 percent , “ admiration ; ” 10 percent , “ hope ; ” and 6 percent , “ deception . ”
Five more choices were offered , each expressing a negative feeling and each selected by 3 percent of respondents or less .
Only two choices were allowed per participant .
Older people were much more likely than younger to express positive feelings toward the word “ Soviet . ”
Similarly restricted to two choices , respondents reacted to the term “ anti-Soviet ” as follows : “ condemnation , ” 23 percent ; “ indifference , ” 22 percent ; “ deception , ” 13 percent ; “ anger , ” 11 percent ; “ shame , ” 8 percent ; “ fear ” , 6 percent ; “ skepticism , ” 5 percent ; and “ hope , ” 2 percent .
Five more expressions of positive feelings were offered as choices with none being selected by more than one percent .
The study , described as a sociological inquiry , appeared in Spanish on www.rebelion.org.

On July 23 , 2009 the UK Met Office issued their infamous winter forecast , ahead of the coldest winter in 50 years .
It read :
“ … Early indications are that winter temperatures are likely to be near or above average over much of Europe including the UK .
For the UK , Winter 2009 / 10 is likely to be milder *( and wetter ) than last year “ .
This was recorded by Piers Corbyn at Weather Action and several other sites on July 23 .
Source :
http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/science/creating/monthsahead/seasonal/2009/winter.html ( released 23 July )
I remember reading the article on the Met Office web site at the time .
But something funny happened on December 30 , 2009 .
The Met Office over wrote that link with a new article titled “ Forecast for the rest of Winter 2009 / 10 ” which has no mention of the original prediction .
It now reads :
… for the rest of winter , over northern Europe including the UK , the chance of colder conditions is now 45 % ; there is a 30 % chance of average and a 25 % chance of milder conditions .
Their original warm winter forecast seems to have been scrubbed from the web site , and there are no longer any press releases dated July 23 .
http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/corporate/pressoffice/2009/index.html
Other sites which noted the July 23 Met Office article and link include :
http://climaterealists.com/index.php?id=3758
http://climateresearchnews.com/2009/07/weather-action-met-office-winter-forecast-2009-10-reckless-misleading-nonsense/
According to The Independent , the winter forecast seems to have been updated on September 29 , but the Met Office no longer has any press releases with that date either .
The Met Office came under tremendous fire as a result of their disastrously bad winter prediction
The Big Question : Should the BBC drop the Met Office as its official weather forecaster ?
By Michael McCarthy , Environment Editor
And this lead them to drop their seasonal forecasts , which have been notoriously poor in recent years .
What could have motivated them to destroy their original winter forecast ?
======================
[ From AW– Note : unlike government services in the USA , the UK Met Office gets bonuses , see their benefits package :
http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/corporate/recruitment/benefits.html
So , this might be an incentive to remove poor work products .
The Times did a story about it last August after the BBQ summer fiasco :
It ’s raining bonuses at the Met Office
And the Met Office Chief , despite botched forecasts , got a 25 % pay increase in January 2010 , according to this Telegraph story :
Met Office chief receives 25 pc pay rise
The head of the Met Office , the national weather service which has been heavily criticised for getting its forecasts wrong , is now paid more than the Prime Minister , after receiving a 25 per cent pay rise .
]
======================
— — — — — ——
For the record , here are a few of of their other classic mis-predictions :
2007 – forecast to be the warmest year yet Wrong – la Nina hit and temperatures plummeted .
Met Office forecast for Summer 2007
Hot summer – Wrong – it was the wettest summer on record with cold daytime temperatures .
A typical British summer 2008 Wrong – it was the second wettest summer on record with cold daytime temperatures .
Trend of mild winters continues 2008 Wrong – it was the coldest winter in 15 years .
Summer forecast 2009 “ Barbecue Summer ” 2009 Wrong – another miserable washout of a summer .
Warming could push Greenland ice sheet beyond ‘ tipping points ’

Decknamen entschlüsselt : Der Code der RAF
1976 verfügten Terrorfahnder über drei Taschen mit RAF - Papieren .
Doch sie konnten den Code nicht knacken .
Jetzt werden erstmals alle Decknamen entschlüsselt .
BERLIN taz | Ein Codesystem der RAF aus den siebziger Jahren ist entschlüsselt worden .
So habe der damalige Terrorist Christian Klar in den Attentatsplänen " Ede " geheißen , für Verena Becker habe " Paula " und für Stefan Wisniewski " Hans " gestanden , berichtete der Autor Michael Sontheimer in der sonntaz .
Am 30 .
November 1976 fassten Ermittler zwei RAF - Kader und beschlagnahmten drei Taschen mit Strategiepapieren und Arbeitsplänen .
" Heute ist klar , dass diese Papiere der Bundesanwaltschaft und dem Bundeskriminalamt eine große Chance eröffneten " , schreibt Sontheimer .
" Wäre es den Terrorfahndern gelungen , die Dokumente zu entschlüsseln , hätten sie die ' Offensive 77 ' der RAF verhindern können . "
Der Journalist sprach mit mehreren ehemaligen RAF - Mitgliedern und dechiffrierte aufgrund ihrer Angaben Decknamen und Codewörter .
Mit " Ps " seien die verbündeten Palästinenser abgekürzt worden .
Der Stuttgarter RAF - Anwalt und Sympathisant Klaus Croissant sei schlicht " Hörnchen " genannt worden .
Dies hätten die Ermittler Mitte der siebziger Jahre nicht begriffen .
" Die waren mit ihren Bürokratenhirnen einfach zu blöd " , zitierte Sontheimer einen Ex-RAF - Mann , " sich in unsere Assoziationen hineinzudenken . "
Da die Ermittler nur einen sehr kleinen Teil der Papiere entschlüsseln konnten , gelang es ihnen mit der Verhaftung von Siegfrid Haag und Roland Mayer lediglich , die Anschläge der RAF zu verzögern .
Ursprünglich hatten die Illegalen das Attentat an Siegfried Buback für Ende 1976 geplant ; das " Kommando Ulrike Meinhof " ermordete den Generalbundesanwalt und seine beiden Begleiter dann am 7 .
April 1977 .
Die Ermittler konnten nur drei der zwölf Decknamen entschlüsseln .
In einem Beitrag für die sonntaz werden alle zwölf Namen zugeordnet .
Am 13 .
April veröffentlicht Sontheimer , " Spiegel " - Autor und ehemaliger taz - Chefredakteur , das Buch " Natürlich kann geschossen werden " zur Geschichte der RAF .
The Yamanote Line is going to have automatic gates installed on all its platforms over the next few years in an attempt to prevent passengers falling on the rails and delaying services .
The installation of the gates will be done in parts starting with Ebisu and Meguro Station .
The work at Ebisu and Meguro will begin this month and finish by the end of June 2010 and August 2010 respectively .
JR have released a schedule and details ( pdf document in Japanese ) .
The door section that opens will be a glass panel rather than just steel .
This will allow passengers and staff to see whether any objects have been caught in the doors when they shut , a regular occurrence when trains are busy .
It will be a shame to see the structures go up and block the view of trains coming into the station , but hopefully this will help to prevent accidents and other incidents where passengers end up falling on the tracks .
The Chuo Line , which suffers a high proportion of suicides , may also want to consider implementing such a system .
What do you think about these automatic gates being installed ?

The university says it will continue to invest in targeted areas Jobs at the University of Sussex could be at risk as attempts are made to respond to the economic downturn and cuts in funding , bosses have admitted .
University managers have not ruled out job cuts as they try to make significant savings .
The University 's budget for 2009 / 10 seeks to reduce costs by £ 3 m on a turnover of £ 160 m , with additional savings of up to £ 5 m in 2010 / 11 .
Its vice - chancellor said jobs could be at risk but no cuts were planned yet .
Professor Michael Farthing , the vice - chancellor , said : " Regrettably , the need to make savings means that some jobs could be at risk , although I must emphasise that we have no proposals of any kind as yet .
" I recognise that this is an unsettling time for all staff and the campus community at Sussex . "
New courses
The university has said it will continue to invest in targeted areas like the infrastructure developments on its campus for teaching , learning and research as well as in new student housing .
In 2009 / 10 the university will offer new degree programmes in business , management , economics and international security .
Prof Farthing said : " The development of the campus is necessary to sustain growth and improvement over the long term and is critically important if the university is to be successful .
" And of course we remain absolutely committed to enhancing the experience that our students have at Sussex . "
Discussions on the financial situation are being held over the summer with managers across the university .
Briefing sessions are also being held with representatives of the campus trades unions and with student representatives .

You ca n’t save daylight by moving around the hands on your clock , of course .
So daylight saving time remains as absurdly named as it ever was .
The general pointlessness of DST was the subject of a Rachel Maddow interview Friday ( video below ) with the author of a whole book (! ) on the subject .
What ’s germane here is that DST saves about as much energy as light , according to most studies .
In fact , a 2008 study found DST “ may actually waste energy “ :
Up until two years ago , only 15 of Indiana ’s 92 counties set their clocks an hour ahead in the spring and an hour back in the fall .
The rest stayed on standard time all year , in part because farmers resisted the prospect of having to work an extra hour in the morning dark .
But many residents came to hate falling in and out of sync with businesses and residents in neighboring states and prevailed upon the Indiana Legislature to put the entire state on daylight - saving time beginning in the spring of 2006 .
Indiana ’s change of heart gave University of California - Santa Barbara economics professor Matthew Kotchen and Ph.D. student Laura Grant a unique way to see how the time shift affects energy use .
Using more than seven million monthly meter readings from Duke Energy Corp. , covering nearly all the households in southern Indiana for three years , they were able to compare energy consumption before and after counties began observing daylight - saving time .
Readings from counties that had already adopted daylight - saving time provided a control group that helped them to adjust for changes in weather from one year to the next .
Help Grist raise $ 20,000 by 9/30 .
Just click the image above ☝️
Their finding : Having the entire state switch to daylight - saving time each year , rather than stay on standard time , costs Indiana households an additional $ 8.6 million in electricity bills .
They conclude that the reduced cost of lighting in afternoons during daylight - saving time is more than offset by the higher air - conditioning costs on hot afternoons and increased heating costs on cool mornings .
“ I ’ve never had a paper with such a clear and unambiguous finding as this , ” says Mr. Kotchen , who presented the paper at a National Bureau of Economic Research conference this month .
A 2007 study by economists Hendrik Wolff and Ryan Kellogg of the temporary extension of daylight - saving in two Australian territories for the 2000 Summer Olympics also suggested the clock change increases energy use .
The Kotchen and Grant NBER paper is here .
It concludes :
We also estimate social costs of increased pollution emissions that range from $ 1.7 to $ 5.5 million per year .
Finally , we argue that the effect is likely to be even stronger in other regions of the United States …
There are nevertheless several reasons we might infer that DST increases electricity demand across a much broader area .
First , existing simulations suggest that DST increases electricity consumption on average over 224 different locations throughout the United States ( Rock 1997 ) .
Our results also corroborate the results of such simulation exercises .
Second , even when prior research finds little or no electricity savings from DST in the United States , the effect is smaller in more southern regions ( DOE 2006 ) .
Finally , the fact that we identify the underlying tradeoff between artificial illumi- nation and primarily air - conditioning suggests that the DST effect that we estimate is likely to be even stronger in the more populated , southern regions of the Unites States .
Further south , the days are shorter during the summer , meaning that decreases in electrical use from lighting are likely to be smaller , and air conditioning is more common and intensively used , meaning that increases in electricity for cooling are likely to be bigger .
In “ 13 Things You Probably Did n’t Know About Daylight - Saving Time , ” U.S News notes :
Daylight - saving time was first used during World War I , as part of an effort in the United States and other warring countries to conserve fuel .
In theory , using daylight more efficiently saves fuel and energy because it reduces the nation ’s need for artificial light .
An Australian study concluded “ These results suggest that current plans and proposals to extend DST will fail to conserve energy . ”
Probably the best recent case for DST is from a 2008 Department of Energy report for Congress , which found DST saved a whopping .02 percent of the country ’s total use in 2007 .
But Wikipedia lists a bunch of other studies on DST , most of which ( but not all ) come to a similar conclusion as the Australia study .
DST ’s general inanity is clear in this Rachel Maddow interview of Spring Forward : The Annual Madness of Daylight - Saving Time :
[ vodpod id=ExternalVideo.1012247&w=425&h=350&fv=launch%3D35846288%26width%3D400%26height%3D320 ]
U.S. News concludes , “ When clocks spring forward , people lose sleep , have more heart attacks , and might not even save energy . ”

While the astute reader may have noticed that the company that owns William Faulkner ’s literary rights sued Sony for copyright infringement based on a misquoted snippet of a sentence that appeared in Midnight In Paris , it was news to me when I stumbled across the article in the ABA Journal this morning .
Given that I try and keep abreast of happenings in the world of copyright , and this should really have been BIG NEWS ( in all caps , even ) , I was shocked that the coverage was so ho -hum , with nary a vitriolic diatribe to be found anywhere .
Given that Wilson is time - travelling back to 1920s Paris at the time he makes the statement , it ’s more a reflection of his actual condition ( i.e. , the past is not past because he ’s currently living in the past ) than a comment on Faulkner ’s line of dialogue

SAN FRANCISCO — “ Hey Alice , look at the pics I took of us last weekend at the picnic .
Bob ”
That Facebook message , sent last fall between co-workers at a large U.S. financial firm , rang true enough .
Alice had , in fact , attended a picnic with Bob , who mentioned the outing on his Facebook profile page .
So Alice clicked on the accompanying Web link , expecting to see Bob ’s photos .
But the message had come from thieves who had hijacked Bob ’s Facebook account .
And the link carried an infection .
With a click of her mouse , Alice let the attackers usurp control of her Facebook account and company laptop .
Later , they used Alice ’s company logon to slip deep inside the financial firm ’s network , where they roamed for weeks .
They had managed to grab control of two servers , and were probing deeper , when they were detected .

They are taking tricks honed in the spamming world and adapting them to what ’s driving the growth of social networks : speed and openness of individuals communicating on the Internet .
“ Social networks provide a rich repository of information cybercriminals can use to refine their phishing attacks , ” says Chris Day , Terremark ’s chief security architect .
This shift is gathering steam , tech security analysts say .
One sign :
The volume of spam and phishing scams — like the “ LOL is this you ? ” viral messages sweeping through Twitter — more than doubled in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared with the same period in 2008 , according to IBM ’s X - Force security research team .
Such “ phishing ” lures — designed to trick you into clicking on an infectious Web link — are flooding e-mail inboxes , as well as social - network messages and postings , at unprecedented levels .
An infected PC , referred to as a “ bot , ” gets slotted into a network of thousands of other bots .
These “ botnets ” then are directed to execute all forms of cybercrime , from petty scams to cyberespionage .
On Tuesday , authorities in Spain announced the breakup of a massive botnet , called Mariposa , comprising more than 12 million infected PCs in 190 countries .
Three Spanish citizens with no prior criminal records were arrested .
Panda Security , of Bilbao , Spain , helped track down the alleged ringleader , who authorities say has been spreading infected links for about a year , mainly via Microsoft ’s free MSN instant messenger service .
“ It became too big and too noticeable , ” says Pedro Bustamante , senior researcher at Panda Security .
“ They would have been smarter to stay under the radar . ”
What happened to Bob and Alice , the picnickers at the financial firm , illustrates how social networks help facilitate targeted attacks .
As a rule , tech - security firms investigate breaches under non-disclosure agreements .
Honoring such a policy , Terremark used pseudonyms for the affected employees in supplying USA TODAY with details of what happened at the financial institution .
Investigators increasingly find large botnets running inside corporate networks , where they can be particularly difficult to root out or disable .
“ Social networks represent a vehicle to distribute malicious programs in ways that are not easily blocked , ” says Tom Cross , IBM X - Force Manager .
Koobface gold mine
The attacks run the gamut .
In just four weeks earlier this year , one band of low - level cyberthieves , known in security circles as the Kneber gang , pilfered 68,000 account logons from 2,411 companies , including user names and passwords for 3,644 Facebook accounts .
Active since late 2008 , the Kneber gang has probably cracked into “ a much higher number ” of companies , says Tim Belcher , CTO of security firm NetWitness , which rooted out one of the gang ’s storage computers .
“ Every network we see today has a significant problem with some form of organized threat , ” Belcher says .
The Kneber gang “ happened to focus on collecting as many network - access credentials as possible . ”
Stolen credentials flow into eBay - like hacking forums where a batch of 1,000 Facebook user name and password pairs , guaranteed valid , sells for $ 75 to $ 200 , depending on the number of friends tied to the accounts , says Sean - Paul Correll , researcher at Panda Security .
From each account , cyberscammers can scoop up e-mail addresses , contact lists , birth dates , hometowns , mothers ’ maiden names , photos and recent gossip — all useful for targeting specific victims and turning his or her PC into an obedient bot , Correll says .
On the high end , the Koobface worm , initially set loose 19 months ago , continues to increase in sophistication as it spreads through Facebook , Twitter , MySpace and other social networks .
At its peak last August , more than 1 million Koobface - infected PCs inside North American companies were taking instructions from criminal controllers to carry out typical botnet criminal activities , says Gunter Ollmann , vice president of research at security firm Damballa .
In another measure of Koobface ’s ubiquity , Kaspersky Labs estimates that there are 500,000 Koobface - controlled PCs active on the Internet on an average day , 40 % of which are in the U.S. , 15 % in Germany and the rest scattered through 31 other nations .
“ The personal information employees post day - by - day on Facebook is turning out to be a real gold mine , ” says Stefan Tanase , a Kaspersky Lab senior researcher .
Facebook , the dominant social network , with 400 million members and therefore the biggest target , says recent partnerships with Microsoft and security firm McAfee to filter malicious programs help keep compromised accounts to a small percentage .
“ We are constantly working to improve complex systems that quickly detect and block suspicious activity , delete malicious links , and help people restore access to their accounts , ” says spokesman Simon Axten .
Still , social networks have grown popular because they foster open communication among friends and acquaintances , which plays into the bad guys ’ hands , says Eva Chen , CEO of anti-virus firm Trend Micro .
“ These new communication platforms are where people go , so that ’s where the hackers are going , ” Chen says .
Meanwhile , discussions about restricting workplace use of social networks and training employees to be more circumspect are just beginning to percolate at venues like the big tech security trade show here this week sponsored by RSA , the security division of EMC .
“ Most larger businesses simply ask employees to watch their time spent on social - networking sites , ” says Ollmann .
A noisy attack
Each infected PC in a corporate network represents a potential path to valuable intellectual property , such as customer lists , patents or strategic documents .
That ’s what the attackers who breached Google and 30 other tech , media , defense and financial companies in January were after .
Those attacks — referred to in security circles as Operation Aurora — very likely were initiated by faked friendly messages sent to specific senior employees at the targeted companies , says George Kurtz , McAfee ’s chief technology officer .
The attack on the picnicking co-workers at the financial firm illustrates how targeted attacks work .
Last fall , attackers somehow got access to Bob ’s Facebook account , logged into it , grabbed his contact list of 50 to 60 friends and began manually reviewing messages and postings on his profile page .
Noting discussions about a recent picnic , the attackers next sent individual messages , purporting to carry a link to picnic photos , to about a dozen of Bob ’s closest Facebook friends , including Alice .
The link in each message led to a malicious executable file , a small computer program .
Upon clicking on the bad file , Alice unknowingly downloaded a rudimentary keystroke logger , a program designed to save everything she typed at her keyboard and , once an hour , send a text file of her keystrokes to a free Gmail account controlled by the attacker .
The keystroke logger was of a type that is widely available for free on the Internet .
The attackers reviewed the hourly keystroke reports from Alice ’s laptop and took note when she logged into a virtual private network account to access her company ’s network .
With her username and password , the attackers logged on to the financial firm ’s network and roamed around it for two weeks .
First they ran a program , called a port scan , to map out key network connection points .
Next they systematically scanned all of the company ’s computer servers looking for any that were not current on Windows security patches .
Companies often leave servers unpatched , relying on perimeter firewalls to keep intruders at bay .
The attackers eventually found a vulnerable server , and breached it , gaining a foothold to go deeper .
A short time later , the attackers were discovered and cut off .
One of Bob ’s Facebook friends mentioned to Bob that the picnic photos he had sent had failed to render .
That raised suspicions .
A technician took a closer look at daily logs of data traffic on the company ’s network and spotted the vulnerability scans .
Terremark ’s
Day says two or three collaborators , each with different skill sets , most likely worked together to pull off the attack .
“ They were noisy about how they went about this , ” says Day .
“ Had they been quieter they would ’ve gotten much further . ”

Tony Blair is preparing to launch a " faith offensive " across the United States over the next year , after building up relationships with a network of influential religious leaders and faith organisations .
With Afghanistan and Iraq casting a shadow over his popularity at home in Britain , Blair 's focus has increasingly shifted across the Atlantic , to where the nexus of faith and power is immutable and he is feted like a rock star .
According to the annual accounts of the Tony Blair Faith Foundation , a UK - based charity that promotes cohesion between the major faiths , the foundation is to develop a US arm that will pursue a host of faith - based projects .
The accounts show that his foundation has an impressive – and , in at least one case , controversial – set of faith contacts .
Sitting on some £ 4.5 m in funds as of April last year , mostly gathered through donations , it is now well placed to make its voice heard .
The foundation 's advisory council of religious leaders includes Rick Warren , powerful founder of the California - based Saddleback church .
It attracts congregations of nearly 20,000 and is reportedly one of the largest in the US .
Warren , who has addressed the UN and the World Economic Forum in Davos , has been named one of the " 15 world leaders who matter most " and one of the " 100 most influential people in the world " .
His influence was confirmed in December 2008 when Barack Obama chose him to give the invocation at his presidential inauguration .
But the decision angered many liberals , who see Warren as an opponent of gay rights and abortion on demand ; a prominent alliance with Warren is likely to attract similar attacks on the former British prime minister .
Also on the council is David Coffey , president of the Baptist World Alliance ( BWA ) , a Virginia - based network of churches that spans the globe and is particularly active in the US .
Another initiative has been to team up with the Belinda Stronach Foundation in Toronto .
Unknown in the UK , Stronach , daughter of a Canadian billionaire , is hugely influential in Canada where as a philanthropist , businesswoman and former politician she has served in both the Conservative and Liberal parties .
Attractive and barely into her 40s , media commentators have dubbed her " bubba 's blonde " , a reference to her friendship with Bill Clinton .
According to the accounts , Blair intends to open an office in Toronto to develop the relationship .
His desire for North America to be the focus of his faith - based operations was confirmed by the decision to hold his foundation 's inaugural event in May 2008 in New York , for the " charity 's key partners and religious stakeholders " .
The accounts also shine a light on the close connections the foundation now enjoys with major political institutions in the US .
" With the Washington - based Centre for Interfaith Action , the foundation supported a meeting of major international organisations active in faith - based approaches to combating malaria ( plus the White House , World Bank , UN , World Health Organisation ) to co-ordinate international efforts , " the accounts state .
That Blair , a charismatic politician driven by faith , should be at home across the Atlantic is no surprise to political analysts .
" He comes across as confident and persuasive , " said Professor Shawn Bowler , of the University of California at Riverside .
" He does not talk like a modern robo - candidate in the way so many US political figures do . "
Unlike in the UK , Blair 's religious fervour is seen as a strength .
" Blair is very open about his faith and that plays a lot better in the US than in Britain , " Bowler said .
But the overtly religious dimension has drawn criticism .
" The Tony Blair Faith Foundation is a fundamentally flawed concept , " said Terry Sanderson , president of the National Secular Society .
" If religion is constantly at the fore , then the old suspicions and hatreds will continue to fester . "
Other North American faith - based initiatives endorsed by the foundation include the New York - based Global Nomads Group , which brings together young people through video conferences " to discuss the global issues that affect their lives " , and the Faiths Act Fellowship , which selects " 30 young leaders aged 18 - 25 , drawn from the different faiths from the US , UK and Canada , to embark on a 10 - month journey of interfaith service " .
Blair 's status is such that he is now called on to sprinkle stardust at religious gatherings , such as a speech he delivered at the National Prayer Breakfast in Washington .
Even his autobiography , The Journey , for which he was paid a £ 4.6 m advance , appears to be aimed at the US market .
" Tony Blair is an extremely popular figure in North America , " said Sonny Mehta , his publisher .
" His memoir is refreshing , both for its candour and vivid portrayal of political life . "
So embedded is he that Blair regularly crops up in Washington society diaries .
Last September , the former Republican vice - president , Dick Cheney , was dining in the same restaurant .
Blair got top billing in the gossip columns .
Allison , 26 , and her boyfriend were having sex — an activity they had engaged in many times over the six months they had been dating — when her contraceptive vaginal ring fell right out of her vagina .
Her boyfriend paused .
He developed a sudden concern over the efficacy of the couple ’s method of birth control .
“ He was like , ‘ Oh , no .
How is it going to catch my semen ? ’ ” Allison recalls .
For about a year now , Allison has used the NuvaRing to prevent pregnancy .
Three weeks out of the month , the clear , flexible plastic ring sits in Allison ’s vagina and releases hormones into her bloodstream that prevent her from ovulating .
It does not “ catch ” anybody ’s semen .
“ He played it off as a joke , ” says Allison of her boyfriend ’s bizarre interpretation of her birth control .
“ But in the tone of his voice , that honest worry was there .
Part of him was thinking , ‘ What does this ring actually do ? ’ ”
Allison is a veteran witness to contraception awareness syndrome .
“ I was dating a guy in college who knew that I was on the birth control pill .
Of course , he was concerned about me getting pregnant , ” says Allison .
“ So he said , ‘ You know , you should take four or five of these a day — just take as many as you need to , ’ ” she says .
Jenna had been living with her boyfriend for several months when he floated his own contraceptive theory .
Jenna was taking her birth control pills continuously , meaning that she was skipping the pack ’s built - in placebo pills in order to stop her period .
At some point , her boyfriend discovered how she had managed to avoid the monthly ritual .
“ I was thinking you were just magical , like a unicorn , ” he told her .
“ I mean , you hope one exists somewhere , but you never think you ’ll get to live with one … a cool chick with no period drama that has sex all month long . ”
He added , “ The guys thought I was making it up . ” ( Boyfriends could not be reached for comment for this story ) .
According to a new study by the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy , many young American men exhibit attitudes toward contraception that could best be described as “ magical . ”
The study [ PDF ] surveyed American singles ages 18 – 29 about their perceptions about and use of contraception .
Twenty - eight percent of young men think that wearing two condoms at a time is more effective than just one .
Twenty - five percent think that women can prevent pregnancy by douching after sex .
Eighteen percent believe that they can reduce the chance of pregnancy by doing it standing up .
For the most part , men lagged behind women on the pregnancy prevention front .
And when the study dipped into the realm of “ female ” forms of birth control , the gender divide intensified .
In the study , 29 percent of men and 32 percent of women reported that they know “ little or nothing about condoms . ”
When asked to rate their knowledge of birth control pills , 78 percent of men reported to be clueless , compared to 45 percent of women .
With a majority of young men generally unknowledgeable about hormonal birth control — and nearly half of young women equally stumped — men sometimes do n’t figure out the basics until they think they may have impregnated someone , or their penis feels something weird .
“ I dated a girl with a NuvaRing , while I did n’t know she had one , ” says a 22 - year - old Arlington resident who did n’t discover how the couple was preventing baby - making until his penis was already well inside her vagina .
“ I found out the physical way , when I felt the alien object .
I immediately recoiled in fear , asking what was wrong .
It was frightening .
Then she told me her birth control was a ring in her vagina , which I had never heard of . ”
He demanded the evidence .
“ She retrieved it — which is a sight to see — and showed it to me , put it back , and we continued , ” he says .
“ I feel like girls should tell people . ”
When Allison ’s boyfriend expressed concern with the efficacy of her vaginal ring , she told him all about it .
But even between two adults , the subject inspired some awkwardness .
“ The conversation was n’t exactly free - flowing , ” Allison says .
“ I ’ve been dating since high school , and it feels like the men that I date now have a very similar idea of birth control as the men I dated who were high school students , ” says Allison .
“ They get a preliminary idea in sex ed , and then there ’s not really any education after that .
Nothing ever changes . ”
In addition to staging teach - ins , women are also responsible for shouldering the physical , emotional , and financial responsibilities for pregnancy prevention .
Pap smears , STI tests , and gynecological sessions about their contraceptive options — that ’s just the tip of it for the sexually active woman .
In order to keep their birth control subscription fresh , they have to repeat that process every year .
Their male sex partners are under no such requirements .
As Salon noted last year , women have 11 methods of contraception from which to choose ; men have two — condom and vasectomy .
And even if men did have additional reliable birth control options , many women would n’t trust them to use them correctly .
In a comment on the Salon article , one woman wrote , “ I love my husband more than anything in the world but I would not place that responsibility on him because if the BC failed and he was responsible for it I would kill him then he would be dead and I would be having a child while in prison . ”
Perhaps it is no mystery why some men confine their responsibility to forms of birth control which relate directly to their own genitalia .
Gustav Seestedt , 23 , says that birth control pills are the form of contraception he has “ the most indirect experience with . ”
He has no idea how they work .
“ I thought it , uh , controlled , uh … I actually do n’t know , now that I think about it , ” he says .
“ Oh , man , I thought it had something to do with hormonal control , but that does n’t seem right at all .
That sounds pretty awful .
I thought it , uh , somehow killed fertility with like chemicals and stuff , ” he says .
The ring , however , strikes Seestedt as a superior option .
“ I thought that was pretty fine , because , from what I understood , it was kind of a low - cost way of doing it , and it was n’t really … I like it because chemical pills and stuff are kind of weird , [ but the ring ] was kind of placed inside , and …you know what I mean ?
It just kind of did its thing , you know ? ”
To some , the male indifference to birth control can be attributed to a juvenile disregard for all things related to the place in which the vaginal ring “ does its thing . ”
We live in a country where heterosexual heartthrob Robert Pattinson feels comfortable announcing to Details magazine , “ I really hate vaginas .
I ’m allergic to vagina . ”
Where tech nerds everywhere let out a collective titter over new Apple device the “ iPad , ” because it sounds kind of like a thing women use when they ’re on their periods .
Where Judd Apatow has built a film career out of turning extended vagina jokes into blockbusters .
“ I definitely think that the inability to understand birth control goes back to the woman ’s period , ” says Allison .
Months after the vaginal ring incident , Allison ’s boyfriend remained confused about the specifics of her menstrual cycle .
“ The other day , I was on my period , and I took out my tampon before I went into the shower , ” she says .
“ My boyfriend was like , ‘ Wait : But you just took your tampon out .
Can you go into the shower like that ? ’ ”
Allison responded to her boyfriend ’s question with more questions .
“ Does he think that the second I take out my tampon , it ’s just blood , blood everywhere ? ” she wondered .
“ That if I do n’t plug it up with this cotton thing every moment , all hell will break loose ? ”
Her boyfriend did not elaborate .
“ He was just kind of like , ‘ Never mind , ’ ” says Allison .
“ I think he understood the absurdity of his comment .
But he was making an honest attempt to learn about something he does n’t really know about . ”

WebKit2 - High Level Document
WebKit2 is a new API layer for WebKit designed from the ground up to support a split process model , where the web content ( JavaScript , HTML , layout , etc ) lives in a separate process from the application UI .
This model is very similar to what Google Chrome offers , with the major difference being that we have built the process split model directly into the framework , allowing other clients of WebKit to use it .
Why is it named WebKit2 ?
The somewhat pedestrian reason is that it's an incompatible API change from the original WebKit , so it will probably be installed as something like / System / Library / WebKit2.
framework on Mac .
C API
WebKit2 provides a stable C - based non-blocking API that is mostly platform agnostic .
In order to achieve the goal of a non-blocking API , several techniques are used to make the API usable while still providing a comprehensive set of features to the embedder .
These techniques include :
Notification style client callbacks ( e.g. didFinishLoadForFrame )
These inform the embedder that something has happened , but do not give them the chance to do anything about it .
Policy style clients callbacks ( e.g. decidePolicyForNavigationAction )
These allow the embedder to decide on an action at their leisure , notifying the page through a listener object .
Policy settings ( e.g. WKContextSetCacheModel , WKContextSetPopupPolicy )
These allow the embedder to opt into a predefined policy without any callbacks into the UIProcess .
These can either be an enumerated set of specific policies , or something more fine - grained , such as a list of strings with wildcards .
Injected code ( e.g. WebBundle )
Code can be loaded into the WebProcess for cases where all the other options fail .
This can useful when access to the DOM is required .
[ Planned , but not currently implemented ]
The major API classes are :
WKContextRef
Encapsulates all pages related to specific use of WebKit .
All pages in this context share the same visited link set , local storage set , and preferences .
WKPageNamespaceRef
Encapsulates all pages that can script each other .
WKPageRef
Basic unit of browsing .
Stays the same as the main frame changes .
WKView [ Ref ]
Native view that hooks into the platform 's toolkit .
On Windows , this wraps a HWND .
On the Mac , it inherits from NSView .
Note that the requirement to be fully non-blocking requires an incompatible API break - many features of most existing WebKit APIs cannot be fulfilled in a non-blocking manner .
Since we needed the API break anyway , we also took advantage of the opportunity to clean up and simplify the API .
Port - Specific APIs
The Mac port provides a fully non-blocking Objective - C API as a wrapper on top of the C API .
The GTK + port provides also a stable and non-blocking API : ​http://webkitgtk.org/reference/webkit2gtk/stable/index.html
We believe a similar approach may be viable for other ports .
We are also not removing or obsoleting any of the existing port- specific APIs .
WebCore will remain as - is , and all current APIs will continue to work and be fully supported .
Thus , WebKit development and existing ports of WebKit will not be disrupted .
Process Architecture
WebKit2 changes the WebKit stack to build a process management mechanism inside the WebKit API layer .
Here is what the architecture of a traditional WebKit port looks like :
Everything is in one process , and there is an API boundary between the application and the WebKit API .
This is a simple model , and typically it 's pretty easy for applications to reuse the WebKit API .
Here is what we are going for with WebKit2 :
Notice that there is now a process boundary , and it sits * below * the API boundary .
Part of WebKit operates in the UI process , where the application logic also lives .
The rest of WebKit , along with WebCore and the JS engine , lives in the web process .
The web process is isolated from the UI process .
This can deliver benefits in responsiveness , robustness , security ( through the potential to sandbox the web process ) and better use of multicore CPUs .
There is a straightforward API that takes care of all the process management details for you .
How is This Different from Chromium WebKit ?
Chromium takes a different approach to multiprocess :
Notice that in this case , the the process boundary is * above * the API boundary .
Chromium WebKit does not directly provide a multiprocess framework , rather , it is optimized for use as a component of a multiprocess application , which does all the proxying and process management itself .
The Chrome team at Google did a great job at trailblazing multiprocess browsing with Chrome .
But it 's difficult to reuse their work , because the critical logic for process management , proxying between processes and sandboxing is all part of the Chrome application , rather than part of the API layer .
So if another WebKit - based application or another port wanted to do multiprocess based on Chromium WebKit , it would be necessary to reinvent or cut & paste a great deal of code .
That was an understandable choice for Google - Chrome was developed as a secret project for many years , and is deeply invested in this approach .
Also , there are not any other significant API clients .
There is Google Chrome , and then there is the closely related Chrome Frame .
WebKit2 has a different goal - we want process management to be part of what is provided by WebKit itself , so that it is easy for any application to use .
We would like chat clients , mail clients , twitter clients , and all the creative applications that people build with WebKit to be able to take advantage of this technology .
We believe this is fundamentally part of what a web content engine should provide .
Internals
There are two key subsystems that support the process division :
CoreIPC - an abstraction for general message passing , including event handling .
The current implementations use mach messages on Mac OS X , and named pipes on Windows .
DrawingArea - an abstraction for a cross-process drawing area .
Multiple drawing strategies are possible , the simplest is just a shared memory bitmap .
There are two other important abstractions , which may be pushed down to WebCore or WTF over time :
Run Loops
Work Queues
Current Status
WebKit2 is production ready and stable .
Different browsers are already using it like GNOME 's Epiphany .
How to try it Out
build - webkit on Mac OS X or Windows now builds WebKit2 by default .
WebKit2 will not work with the shipping version of Safari .
Because WebKit2 is an incompatible API break , it requires a custom testbed to run it .
A basic web browser application suitable for testing WebKit2 is available in Tools / MiniBrowser .
How to run layout tests
You can run layout tests in WebKit2 by passing " - 2 " ( or " - - webkit - test - runner " ) to run-webkit - tests , like :
run-webkit - tests -- debug -2
Many tests are skipped for WebKit2 ( via the LayoutTests / platform / mac - wk2 / Skipped file ) , but that number is decreasing as DumpRenderTree API is implemented for WebKitTestRunner .

The funny thing about WalterBlock ’s quote defending sexual harassment in the workplace is that the nature of the argument and its unfortunate compatibility with right - libertarian principles can serve as a very easy way to make those espousing said principles get in a very tight ethical conundrum .
When this quote is presented to someone ( something especially effective when someone is a Block disciple ) they either have to find a way to distance themselves from this argument ( much like Walter Block himself has done ) and thus risk cognitive dissonance , or they must bite the bullet and admit that Block was right .
It ’s amazing , not only how often you ’ll find them defending sexual harassment in the workplace in the name of liberty but also how often and easily they will trip on their own argumentation and put their foot firmly in their mouth .
Oh , they wo n’t call it “ harassment ” of course , they ’ll dance around the words until it can sound like some kind of normal human relationship , but functionally they will be defending the exact same situation and the right of the employer to make sexual advances to his secretaries under the guise of voluntarism .
Witness this latest example in reddit , where a commenter took the opportunity to defend Block ’s argument and give us gems like this :
In a society of private property , there is no inherent reason whatsoever why a woman will be compelled to accept a job that contains sexual advances that she does not want .
If a job does not specifically contract against it , then the employer can engage in that behavior .
If it does , then he can’t .
( emphasis mine )
How about a woman that does not have enough money to feed herself and her family ?
A very rare scenario I know …
And this :
If I have $ 50,000 say , then I do not owe anyone that money .
It ’s mine .
If I want to pay a woman to help me with my paperwork , then I can offer them that money .
If they are so destitute that they are willing to accept my sexual advances , then I can follow the non-aggression principle and not once harass her .
She is not obligated to stay with me .
If she wants to quit and find money somewhere else ( the number of potential jobs are numerous ) , then she can .
If she stays , then that ’s her choice that you must respect .
If she stays because she accepts it , then how can you say that I am acting improperly ?
I am not doing anything she does n’t want me to do .
I will not harass her because that violates the NAP .
If she accepts , then she must want it .
That ’s how relationships work .
This is the common fetishism of voluntarism that AnCaps do all the goddamn time .
Here in all its ugly glory for all to see .
A rich boss hiring a destitute girl and advancing sexually on her ?
No problem .
She must want it or she would have left .
You can easily see how much they need to assert that in a AnCap society there would be no unemployment which flies against all logic as this would make such a society immediately implode in a capitalist crisis .
But as long as we can assume that no unemployment will exist , we can sweep all such contentions under the blanket .
But the best quote is this :
If you condemn this because she is only sleeping with me because she wants my money , then does not reflect poorly on me or her ?
It ’s not me .
I ’m not the one sleeping with somebody else because I want their money .
It ’s her moral failure .
Nobody is destitute enough in a private property society that they must resort to prostitution .
Prostitution is a choice , just like every other occupation .
You ca n’t change that .
I wo n’t even try to point out how disgusting this paragraph is on it face .
How much it flies in the face of reality and women ’s plight .
I will only point out how one small Walter Block quote led this AnCap to say something like this .
Seriously , this thing is like an instant way to make right - libertarians say something so absurd or reprehensible that they will automatically lose all credibility and leverage in the eyes of those not already convinced of their ideology .
Use it with abandon and make them face up the ugly consequences of their ideology .

An Australian - American team of investigators has made novel discoveries about the human ability to predict what other people are about to say .
Their findings could have significant applications for educators , speech therapists , entrepreneurs , and many others interested in communication and comprehension .
The study is to be published in the March 2010 issue of the scholarly journal Language .
It is authored by Joan Bresnan and Marilyn Ford .
Everyone is familiar with the practice of completing someone else 's sentence -- essentially predicting what the other person is about to say .
To a remarkable degree , people are quite accurate in their ability to make these predictions , not only in terms of the basic content of the message , but also in terms of the word choices and phrasing of the sentences .
This ability to effectively predict the syntax of others in context comes from our knowledge of " linguistic probability . "
The human capacity for determining this probability is based on our day - to - day experience of the language .
The greater the amount of experience that individuals have of a language , the greater their ability to predict .
This is true of different dialects within a language .
For example , Australian speakers of English and American speakers of English detect slightly different patterns of phrasing and usage among their respective fellow speakers , thus enabling them to more effectively predict the syntax that will be used in a variety of contexts .
This intrinsic ability to predict based on probability has implications for language comprehension .
Educators engaged in foreign language instruction might effectively focus their initial efforts on the most probable sentence constructions .
Entrepreneurs engaged in marketing their products or services might use the most probable phrases in preparing their advertising messages .
These research findings on linguistic probability may also be helpful in making computerized language more natural .
Another practical application would be in the refinement of tools used in profiling and diagnosing those with language disorders .
As noted by the authors in an interview , " Linguistic patterns are important in predicting comprehension .
If we can make better use of these patterns to enhance comprehension , then we can improve people 's ability to understand one another . "
By advocating for a renewable energy bill on the eve of the demise of the man -made global warming theory and for its legislative offspring , economy killing cap - and - trade legislation , progressive Senator Lindsey Graham ( R - SC ) is simultaneously seeking to bail out GE and to rescue Obama ’s energy policy .
Graham is working with GE lobbyists to draft the ‘‘ Clean Energy Act of 2009 ’’ – legislation to establish a federal mandate requiring that an increasing amount of electricity must be derived from so - called “ clean energy ” sources over the coming decades .
Specifically , the draft bill demands that 20 percent of electricity come from “ clean energy ” sources by 2020 and 50 percent by 2050 .
Coincidentally or otherwise , Graham ’s definition of clean energy matches GE ’s business strategy in clean coal technology and renewable and nuclear energy .
The nexus between GE ’s influence and its business interests was exposed by the New York Times , which reported , “ Several sources said General Electric Co. helped Graham in crafting the legislative language .
GE has the world 's largest gas turbine manufacturing plant , in Greenville , S.C. , and the company also is leading development of new nuclear reactors and a ’ clean coal ‘ technology known as integrated gasification combined cycle , which has the capacity to capture and permanently sequester carbon emissions . ”
GE ’s wind and solar power products could also be used to meet Graham ’s renewable energy mandates .
By helping GE , Graham is undercutting our free market system , propagating the notion that fossil fuels are contributing to the demise of our planet and guaranteeing higher energy prices for all Americans .
The fact is , we do n’t need renewable energy mandates , but GE and Obama do .
Under the leadership of CEO Jeff Immelt , GE has made a huge bet on making money on global warming fears by developing energy - generating products that compliment Obama ’s left - wing attack on fossil fuels .
Nuclear energy , wind and solar power and clean coal are energy sources that eliminate or reduce the amount of carbon dioxide emissions released into the atmosphere .
Disturbingly , Immelt does not want to compete in the open marketplace .
Rather , he wants to game the political system by working with Congress to mandate demand for GE ’s products , either by increasing the price of fossil fuels through a cap - and - trade system or via a Graham - type bill that requires power generation from renewable energy sources .
Because the global warming tidal wave has been reduced to a mere splash , Immelt ’s grand plan is in jeopardy .
Climategate and the scandal surrounding the scientific basis of the latest UN ’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report on global warming is eroding both public and political support of costly emissions restrictions .
Congressional backlash against new global warming laws and / or regulation is also reducing support for proposed actions by the EPA .
Democratic Congressmen Ike Skelton and Collin Peterson have introduced a bill to strip the EPA 's authority to regulate greenhouse gases , and Senator Lisa Murkowski ( R - AK ) has Democratic co-sponsors for a legislative override of EPA ’s effort to regulate carbon emissions under the Clean Air Act .
Immelt is also seeing defections from the showcase cap - and - trade lobbying coalition – the United States Climate Action Partnership ( USCAP ) .
Just this week , three founding members , BP , Caterpillar and ConocoPhillips , decided to leave the group .
Additionally , Marsh and Xerox have mysteriously disappeared from the roster of member companies on the USCAP website .
Desperate and perhaps panicked over the prospects of imminent failure , Immelt and a band of CEOs and environmental group allies have unleashed a last - minute lobbying push .
They recently met with Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and Climate Change Czar Carol Browner on global warming legislation .
While the outcome of the Administration ’s lobbying fest remains unknown , it seems Immelt must have hit pay dirt with Graham .
Perhaps Graham is willing to accept undesirable aspects of the renewable energy bill in order to get broad political support for nuclear power , which our country needs .
Regardless of his intentions , this deal comes at too great a cost .
Yielding to the demands of a corporate interest , sacrificing free - market principles and legitimizing unsustainable “ clean ” energy technologies is unacceptable .
This is especially true at this critical time , when the entire basis for reducing carbon emissions is in jeopardy .
Graham should not snatch defeat from the jaws of victory by buttressing Immelt ’s failed business strategy or Obama ’s war on fossil fuels .
Let them deal with the consequences of their actions .

I 'm looking to start using a key / value store for some side projects ( mostly as a learning experience ) , but so many have popped up in the recent past that I 've got no idea where to begin .
Just listing from memory , I can think of :
CouchDB MongoDB Riak Redis Tokyo Cabinet Berkeley DB Cassandra MemcacheDB
And I 'm sure that there are more out there that have slipped through my search efforts .
With all the information out there , it 's hard to find solid comparisons between all of the competitors .
My criteria and questions are :

Which one is the fastest ?
Which one is the most stable ?
Which one is the easiest to set up and install ?
Which ones have bindings for Python and / or Ruby ?
Edit :
So far it looks like Redis is the best solution , but that 's only because I 've gotten one solid response ( from ardsrk ) .
I 'm looking for more answers like his , because they point me in the direction of useful , quantitative information .
Which Key - Value store do you use , and why ?

STAR CITY , Russia ( Reuters ) - Russia announced a halt to space tourism on Wednesday , saying it would struggle to ferry professional crews to the International Space Station after the U.S. mothballs its shuttle fleet this year .

NASA plans four more shuttle flights to the $ 100 - billion , 16 - nation space outpost before retiring its three shuttles by the end of the year .
Russia , sending crews to the ISS aboard its single - use three - man Soyuz ships , will double the number of manned launches to four this year because permanent crews of professional astronauts aboard the expanded station are set to rise to six .
“ This year will see the last shuttle mission , and from this moment Russia will not only become the sole nation sending crews , but ... also the only country ensuring the crew ’s safety , ” Sergei Krikalyov , the head of the Russian Cosmonauts ’ Training Center , told reporters in Star City outside Moscow .
“ As for ( space ) tourists ... there are now going to be six crew members , and it will be impossible to ferry a tourist each time there is a new crew shift in orbit , and for some time there will be a break in these journeys , ” Krikalyov said .
Canadian circus billionaire Guy Laliberte was the latest rich traveler -- officially the world ’s seventh space tourist -- who visited the ISS briefly aboard a Soyuz last October after paying $ 35 million for his ride .
Russia plans to launch the first of this year ’s planned four Soyuz ships on April 2 .
The U.S. - Russian trio will join a U.S. - Russian - Japanese team which has been manning the outpost since December .
Krikalyov did not say how long the break in space tourism would be .
He made clear it would largely depend on how long it takes NASA to build a new space ship to replace the Shuttle .
He said the United States targets 2014 as the deadline for building the new space ship , but there could be delays .
“ The talk will definitely be about years , but it ’s hard to say now , whether it ’s going to be one year , two years or five years , ” Krikalyov said .
“ The creation and trial of new spacecraft involves great technical risk and huge uncertainty . ”
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - The U.S. liberal grass - roots group ACORN is on the brink of bankruptcy and its leaders will hold a teleconference this weekend to discuss the group ’s future , The New York Times reported on its website on Friday .
Citing two leaders of the group , the Times reported ACORN is suffering from “ mismanagement along with a severe loss of government and membership funds . ”
The organization has been reeling since a secretly recorded YouTube.com video was disseminated last September showing ACORN workers giving advice on how to flout the law to two conservative activists who posed as a pimp and a prostitute .
Employees involved in the incidents in New York were fired from the organization but have been cleared of criminal prosecution .
Since September , at least half of ACORN ’s 30 chapters have disbanded , the Times said .
The group ’s large New York and California chapters have set up fresh organizations .
Congress voted by wide margins to prohibit the federal government from funding ACORN and the Census Bureau ended its partnership with the group .
Republicans have long accused the group of fraud in registering voters and improperly mixing political and nonpolitical activities .
ACORN , which stands for Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now , has denied the allegations .
ACORN plays a significant political role in low - income neighborhoods and in 2008 signed up 1.3 million people to vote in areas where Democrats poll well .
The group also promotes affordable housing and fights home foreclosures as well as giving tax advice .

The specific case of “ user myopia ” in the aforelinked piece from Jeff Atwood was related to Markdown formatting for submissions to Super User.
Markdown ’s popularity — still growing — is incredibly gratifying .
But I never intended for it to be used by people who do n’t actually know the Markdown formatting rules .
I created Markdown for my own use , and , well , I know the formatting rules pretty well .
For use in situations like user - submitted comments , GitHub Flavored Markdown is a superior variant .
It changes just three rules from regular Markdown , all of which make for a better set of formatting rules for people who do n’t even know the rules .

Updates on djangoappengine
This post is a short update on new features we 've added to our App Engine backend djangoappengine .
So let 's plunge in at the deep end . :)
New Features
First we added support for ListFields .
You can use them in combination with any Django field type .
Let 's say you want to add a ListField for strings to one of your models :
class Post ( models .
Model ) : words = ListField( models.CharField(max_length=500 ) ) title = models .
CharField( max_length=200 ) content = models .
TextField ( blank=True )
It 's as easy as that .
Validation for ListFields is done on each entry in the list using the field type specified .
The example above uses CharField 's validation .
ListFields now allows us to write many applications we could n't write before .
One example is a geolocation app .
It should be possible to port geomodel or mutiny using native Django only now .
We 've put ListField into djangotoolbox .
fields ( see djangotoolbox repository ) .
The next feature added is QuerySet.values ( ) support though it 's only efficient on primary keys .
Let 's see an example using the Post model from above :
android_posts = Post.objects.filter(words='android').values (' pk ' )
This will get only the primary keys of all posts including the word " android " without fetching the entities from the database itself .
It 's possible to use QuerySet.values ( ) on other fields than the primary key too but this will result in fetching the whole entity from the database and removing all fields not specified as arguments in .values .
One possible application of QuerySet.values ( ) on primary keys is a technique called " relation index " from Building Scalable , Complex Apps on App Engine .
This technique is used in nonrel - search which we will talk about in another post .
Another nice feature is BlobField ( contributed by Matt Bierner ) .
You can use it to upload files into the database :
class Post ( models .
Model ) : # ... file = BlobField ( blank=True ) class CreatePostForm( forms.ModelForm ) : class Meta : model = Post
The BlobField 's value is stored as a byte string and the default widget for a BlobField is an InputField displaying the size of the BlobField underneath itself .
In addition there are some smaller features added to our backend .
When iterating over a QuerySet we now fetch results lazily in small batches .
Also , we support Django 's __range queries ( inclusive on both boundaries ) .
Ahh , we added a new management command " remote shell " which allows you to execute code on the production database :
# manage .py remote shell >>> from post.models import Post >>> Post ( title= ' Android 2.1 ' , content= ' Android 2.1 comes with Live Wallpapers ...') .save ( )
This example will add a new Post entity into the production datastore .
Missing Features
Despite the features added we do not support all of App Engine 's functionality .
You can't use entity groups and transactions at the moment .
For transactions you can use the commit locked decorator from our sharded - counter example or App Engine 's db.run_in_transaction ( ) .
We do n't include it into django - nonrel because it probably wo n't get into Django .
What about FileField using App Engine 's Blobstore ?
Well , do n't worry this is already on the way . :)
Basically we reached a point where we nearly support all model / query layer functionality from App Engine 's ORM , that means we can implement almost anything we can with App Engine 's ORM itself .
In addition we plan to provide extra functionality in the form of an independent layer on top of the current database backend to support JOINs and other features transparently .
So let 's see what the future holds in store . :)
Sometimes , people hate what they do n’t understand .
Sometimes , politicians go so far as to demonstrate this hatred on the public record .
State Representative Nickolas Levasseur ( D - NH ) , pictured to the right above , posted to Facebook :
Anime is a prime example of why two nukes just was n’t enough .
Leaving aside whether or not the Representative personally enjoys anime , this is an elected official joking about deploying atomic weapons on a civilian population simply because he dislikes their TV shows .
Red Hampshire broke the story immediately on the 24th , which is unsurprising given that such an irresponsible statement ought to be no less than political suicide .
Major news media followed suit .
This is not the first time Levasseur has been caught on record saying outrageous things .
In 2008 he claimed to enjoy hunting Republicans , calling it “ a shooting sport . ”
Also in 2008 , he sent an official email to belittle a voter who asked him to clarify his stance on handguns .
I believe that you would be well served by being tutored in several subjects .
Perhaps a lesson on the purpose of civilized discourse or the purpose of representative democracy would be beneficial , or perhaps simply a course on manners .
You see , it is a simple fact that people do not always agree .
To the contrary , they more frequently do not .
Even when around friends , as I was in the committee hearing , we might find ourselves in disagreement .
This is not a problem or even a bad thing .
However , when we cross the line from opinion to insult , from debate to harassment , then we lose what is best in ourselves and our system .
If you wish to have an honest and open debate about the value of handguns versus their harm to society , I welcome it .
However , if you wish to dishonor and degrade yourself by using insulting language and threatening tones , then I will not be part of it .
While I do not agree with you on this particular issue , I have a responsibility to maintain the honor and dignity of the seat I hold , and I will not disgrace it by getting into a mud pitching battle .
I have to say that I find your comments to me to be at best dishonorable and at worst threatening .
While I do not intend any further action , I am compelled to forward this and all other messages of this nature to the House Sergeant - at - Arms .
It seems that the cause of honor would be far better served by scrutinizing the language used by Nickolas Levasseur himself .
To borrow a phrase , his outbursts might be called “ at best dishonorable and at worst threatening . ”
Thus far , the New Hampshire House of Representatives has made no move to formally censure him .
These antics are a far cry from the type of behavior Levasseur promised when he first campaigned for election .
Old school politicians talk in terms of the way things should be .
I want to focus on the way things are .
Have a word for your elected official ?

Recently , the German television station ProSieben ran a news story covering W. C. Heraeus in Hanau , Germany , the world ’s largest privately owned refinery .
In the story , Wilfried Hörner , the head of the gold foundry , shows a 500 gram bar ( 16.0755 troy ounces ) received from an unidentified bank .
The bar had the right physical dimensions to be an authentic gold bar , but one of the Heraeus employees suspected something funny .
After the bar was cut in half , you can see that the inside is tungsten , with only a coating of gold on the outside .
You can watch this news story on You Tube , where it was posted February 28 , at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKczs-7BFRI.
Last fall , Rob Kirby of Kirby Analytics in Toronto reported that China ’s central bank had discovered some 400 - ounce gold - plated tungsten bars among those it had recently received from bonded warehouses .
It was later learned that at least four counterfeit bars were found and that all had come from sources in the United States .
As suspicions grow about counterfeit bars among those held in bonded warehouses for delivery against either COMEX or London Bullion Market Association contracts or shares of exchange traded funds , investors could panic .
So , you can understand that there has been almost a total blackout on news coverage on this story .
Tungsten is the only lower value metal that has a specific density close enough to gold to fabricate passable counterfeit pieces of the same size and weight as genuine coins and ingots .
Over the years , there have been a few isolated reports of smaller coins and bars found to have been drilled to remove some of the gold which was replaced with tungsten .
However , it is far more profitable to fabricate larger original bars of tungsten that are then gold - plated .
Thus far , the commodity exchanges have disclaimed of any responsibility for the purity of the gold bars they are delivering against contracts .
As stories of gold - plated tungsten bars in bonded warehouses continue to appear , I expect the commodity exchanges are going to be forced to modify their business practices to provide a guaranty of purity for any bars they deliver .
The process of non-destructive testing of bars to check for counterfeits involves very expensive equipment and is time consuming .
It is beyond the means of almost all investors and coin dealers .
For maximize safety , I recommend purchasing only smaller size coins and ingots , say two ounces of gold content or less , and only deal with a company that has a lengthy track record and in - house staff expertise ( unlike the bank that took in this counterfeit 500 gram bar ) .
If you have purchased coins and ingots from unknown sources , you may want have them checked out by an experienced independent third party .
In contrast , the last things I would want to invest in are large gold bars stored in bonded warehouses in unallocated storage .
If it turns out that the warehouse holding your bars has too many counterfeit bars in their inventory , it could go bankrupt .
That would leave holders of unallocated inventory as unsecured creditors of the bankrupt company , and not as owners of gold .
Because the existence of counterfeit gold - plated tungsten bars could have such a huge impact on the financial markets , there is a huge potential for deception and misinformation to be passed around .
Be very careful about automatically believing any story you may hear .
For your own protection , it would be better to take physical possession of the smaller sizes of gold coins and bars now , and know that what you own genuine solid gold .

Obama signs anti-abortion executive order
By Kate Randall
25 March 2010
Barack Obama signed an executive order on Wednesday that upholds severe restrictions on the legal right to abortion .
The event sealed a deal reached by the president and House Democratic leaders with a group of anti-abortion Democrats who had threatened to vote against the Obama health care plan .
The signing ceremony , closed to the news media , was the culmination of a series of concessions to these anti-abortion forces throughout the year - long congressional debate on the health care overhaul .
In attendance to witness the event was Rep. Bart Stupak of Michigan , the leader of the anti-abortion group , along with 12 of his similarly minded colleagues .
The signing of the order and its reactionary content demonstrate not only the shameless pandering of the White House to this right - wing anti-abortion bloc , but also the regressive character of the health care plan as a whole .
The legislation — hailed as a landmark social reform — will have the effect of denying large numbers of working class and poor women access to abortion .
Rep .
Stupak is the co-author of an amendment included in the version of health care legislation passed by the US House last November .
The amendment prohibits the use of federal funds “ to pay for any abortion or to cover any part of the costs of any health plan that includes coverage of abortion , ” except in cases of rape , incest or danger to the life of the mother .
The Stupak - Pitts amendment was interpreted to mean that abortions not included in the exceptions would not be covered in the “ public option ” proposed in the House bill or in any of the private plans included in the insurance “ exchange . ”
Critics charged that women whose insurance policies currently cover the procedure could lose that coverage .
After Senate Democrats lost a seat to the Republicans in January ’s special election in Massachusetts , they no longer had the votes to avoid a Republican filibuster blocking the health care bill .
Obama and Democratic
House leaders then moved to approve the legislation by a process called reconciliation , which required the House to approve the Senate bill by a majority vote , followed by a simple majority vote in the Senate .
The Senate version of the health care bill , passed last Christmas Eve , contained similarly restrictive language barring the use of federal funds for abortions — not , however , as stringent as Stupak and his cohorts would have liked .
In the wrangling leading up to Sunday night ’s vote , they threatened to vote against the legislation , at one point demanding a separate vote on additional anti-abortion restrictions .
They finally agreed to vote for the bill if Obama agreed to sign an anti-abortion executive order they drafted in collaboration with White House officials .
The presidential order stipulates that the health care legislation signed into law by Obama on Tuesday and all of its provisions and mechanisms enforce existing laws barring the use of federal funds for abortions .
The presidential order states : “ [ I ]t is necessary to establish an adequate enforcement mechanism to ensure that federal funds are not used for abortion services ( except in cases of rape or incest , or when the life of the woman would be endangered ) consistent with a longstanding federal statutory restriction that is commonly known as the Hyde Amendment . ”
The Hyde Amendment , passed by the House in 1976 and named for its chief sponsor , Rep. Henry Hyde , Republican of Illinois , bars federal funds allocated to the Department of Health and Human Services to be used for abortions .
It was passed in the wake of the 1973 Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade legalizing the right to abortion .
The amendment is not a permanent law , but a “ rider ” that has been reauthorized for the past 33 years and attached to annual appropriations bills .
Its primary effect has been to block poor women from obtaining abortion services under the Medicaid program .
Obama ’s executive order states that the health care legislation “ maintains the current Hyde Amendment restrictions governing abortion policy and extends those restrictions to the newly - created health insurance exchanges . ”
The order also states that the legislation “ prohibit[s ] discrimination against health care facilities and health care providers because of an unwillingness to provide , pay for , provide coverage of , or refer for abortions . ”
According to the presidential order , numerous government agencies — including the Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) , the Office of Management and Budget ( OMB ) , and the Office of Personnel Management ( OPM ) — “ have a role in ensuring that these restrictions are enforced . ”
The order confirms stipulations in the Senate legislation that ban tax credits and federal subsidies for people required , under the new law , to purchase private insurance from being used to pay for abortion services ( except in cases of rape , incest or threat to the life of the mother ) .
The order also provides for the auditing of provisions in the bill that call for segregating funds that cover abortions in private insurance plans to be sold on exchanges .
This means that all those who buy a policy that covers abortions — not only those receiving tax credits — will have to separate their monthly premium payment into two parts : one small part ( $ 1 minimum ) to cover the plan ’s projected costs for covering abortions , and a second , much larger part for the remainder of the premium .
This mechanism will have the likely effect of discouraging insurers from offering plans that cover abortions .
The executive order calls for the secretary of HHS and the director of OMB to audit and enforce this complex set -up .
In practice , virtually all insurance plans available to working class and poor people will , as a result of the health care bill and Obama ’s executive order , exclude coverage for abortions .
The presidential order also confirms that funds allocated to Obama ’s new Community Health Center Fund established under HHS will not be used for abortions .
Anti-abortion Democrats had objected that the Senate bill did not specifically state that the Hyde Amendment restrictions would apply to these funds .
President Obama and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , Democrat of California — both professed defenders of abortion rights — worked assiduously to reach an agreement with Stupak and his supporters to get the majority vote in the House to pass the health care legislation .
This assault on a vital democratic right puts the lie to the longstanding argument of liberal and middle class “ left ” organizations that it is necessary to vote for the Democrats because a Republican president will appoint anti-abortion judges and Supreme Court justices who will weaken or eliminate abortion rights .
The biggest blow to women ’s access to abortions is being carried out by a Democratic White House and a Congress with large Democratic majorities in both chambers .
It is , moreover , contrived to impact low - income and working class women and exclude affluent women , who will have no problem obtaining access to the procedure .
Many supposedly “ left ” promoters of Obama ’s health care bill have cynically dismissed the attack on abortion rights .
In column published March 18 in the Nation , Katha Pollitt wrote , “ If health care reform becomes law , you can thank pro-choicers .
In the end , forced to decide between sacrificing abortion coverage and voting down coverage of everything else for 30 million people , abortion - rights supporters took the hit . ”
The likes of Pollitt did not take a “ hit ” by abandoning the defense of abortion rights in support of a health care bill that slashes hundreds of billions of dollars from Medicare and encourages the rationing of care along class lines .
They helped Obama impose the “ hit ” on the democratic rights of millions of working class women .
News Corporation Europe and Asia chief calls for tough line on piracy , adding : ' They 're not crazy kids .
No. Punish them '
This article is more than 10 years old
This article is more than 10 years old
James Murdoch today called on governments to get tough on illegal downloading , which he said was no different from " going into a store and stealing Pringles or a handbag " .
Murdoch , the chairman and chief executive of News Corporation 's European and Asian operations , was joined in calling for tougher piracy measures at the Abu Dhabi Media Summit today by other media executives including Ari Emanuel , co-chief executive of William Morris Endeavor , the biggest Hollywood talent agency .
But Murdoch , who stressed that future growth would come from original content production , took the toughest line on piracy .
" We need enforcement mechanisms and we need governments to play ball …
There is no difference with going into a store and stealing Pringles or a handbag and taking this stuff .
It 's a basic condition for investment and economic growth and there should be the same level of property rights whether it's a house or a movie , " he said .
" The idea that there 's a new consumer class and you have to be consumer - friendly when they 're stealing stuff .
No .
There should be the same level of sanctity as there is around property .
Content is no different .
They 're not crazy kids .
No. Punish them . "
The outburst from the man widely tipped to take over when his father , Rupert Murdoch , steps down as News Corporation chairman and chief executive , attracted a round of applause from media executives at the Abu Dhabi summit .
Only Maurice Levy , chief executive of French advertising group Publicis , sounded an alternative note when he said : " My grandchild does n't believe he 's stealing . "
Murdoch also reiterated previous threats by his father Rupert that News Corp may take legal action against content aggregators such as Google to protect its copyright .
" We 're being very careful legally to protect our rights , " he said .
" If there 's money getting stuck it 's getting stuck in an inefficient distribution layer … where Google and Yahoo are suddenly indexing copyright material and then selling bits of it and making money from it .
You may have to withdraw access to those things .
You may not . "
Murdoch also asked for lighter touch regulation for a business that is the largest shareholder in UK pay - TV broadcaster BSkyB and owns the News International stable of national newspapers including the Sun and the Times .
In an earlier point about investment opportunities , Murdoch said : " When we look at different marketplaces ... it 's really a question for us about how free a hand we 're going to have to operate . "
He was echoing comments made by his father , Rupert , at yesterday 's keynote speech in Abu Dhabi about the need for less regulation , particularly in the Gulf states .
Emanuel , the brother of US presidential adviser Rahm , said the industry was talking to the US government in a bid to introduce a " three strikes and you 're out " law to govern illegal downloading .
" We are in the midst of talking to the president and some attorney generals and [ we are ] trying to implement a three strikes and you 're out rule , " he added .
He suggested that there would be a " fight with ISPs " ( internet service providers ) over the subject .
France last year introduced a similar rule which allowed legal action once internet users had downloaded illegally three times .
Earlier today at the Abu Dhabi conference , Google 's chief executive Eric Schmidt made an impassioned presentation on the search company 's " mobile first " strategy .
But he was perhaps less forthcoming about the flood of questions about Google 's dominance and control over its use of our data .
" Would you prefer another government to hold the information that we have ? " he said , adding that the company had enough checks and balances to stop information being misused , and it would also not want to lose people 's trust .
Schmidt also suggested that location - based social networking services such as Foursquare and Gowalla could become the next Twitter .

Sex.com domain goes up for grabs
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- Sex.com , one of the most valuable Internet domain names , will go up for auction next week after the previous owner defaulted on its debts .
Escom LLC paid a reported $ 14 million for the Web site in 2006 .
But the company failed to repay debt owed to DOM Partners LLC , the New Jersey - based lender that helped finance the deal .
As a result , sex.com will be sold " as is " in the equivalent of a foreclosure sale , according to a letter from DOM Partners ' lawyers that was made public Tuesday .
The auction is set for March 18 in New York , and bidders are required to appear with a certified check for $ 1 million to participate .
Richard Maltz , an auctioneer at Maltz Auctions who is overseeing the sale , said there has been a " good amount of interest " in sex.com .
But he did not say how much the Web site could sell for .
" It is a very unique property , " he said .
" It will be an incredible opportunity for someone . "
Indeed , sex.com generated $ 15,000 a day in revenue at one point , according to Charles Carreon , an attorney who wrote about the Web site 's legal travails in his book " The Sex.com Chronicles . "
By way of comparison , the domain name www.pizza.com reportedly sold for more than $ 2.5 million at an auction in 2008 .
The sex.com saga
The auction is only the latest chapter in the turbulent history of sex.com , which includes allegations of theft and countless court cases .
Gary Kremen , the founder of Match.com , registered the domain name in 1994 , according to a timeline of the events on the Web site of journalist Kieren McCarthy , who wrote a book about sex.com .
According to McCarthy 's account , Kremen spent several years in court battling with " porn baron " Stephen Cohen , who was accused of stealing sex.com from him in 1995 by sending forged letters and e-mails .
In 2000 , a court handed control of the domain name back to Kremen and ordered Cohen to pay $ 65 million to Kremen .
Cohen subsequently appealed and the case was rejected by the Supreme Court in 2003 .
Two years later , Cohen was arrested in Tijuana for failing to appear in court .
He was released in 2007 , according to published reports .
Kremen was the principal in the 2006 sale of the domain to Escom , although a news release at the time said he would remain as an adviser .
TOKYO -- A female knuckleball pitcher from Japan will be playing for a minor league team in the United States .
Eri Yoshida , an 18 - year - old pitcher who played pro ball in Japan last year , signed with the Chico Outlaws of the Golden Baseball League .
The team said she will report to spring training next month .
" I am grateful for this opportunity to pitch for the Chico Outlaws , " Yoshida said .
" This is a dream come true for me and I hope I can contribute to the team and help them win and also to continue to improve as a pro baseball player . "
Yoshida will be the first female to pitch for a pro team in the United States since Ila Borders retired more than 10 years ago , the team said .
" We are really looking forward to having Eri as a member of the Chico Outlaws this season , " team president Mike Marshall said .
The 5 - foot , 114 - pound Yoshida became Japan 's first female pro baseball player last year when she pitched for the Kobe Cruise 9 in the Kansai Independent League .
She was 0 - 2 in 11 appearances with a 4.03 ERA , giving up seven runs in 10 2 - 3 innings .
The team is making accommodations to provide separate locker room facilities and hotel rooms while traveling .
Yoshida learned how to throw a knuckleball by watching video of Tim Wakefield and recently got a few tips from the Boston Red Sox pitcher at the team 's spring training facility in Fort Myers , Fla .
The 10 - team Golden Baseball League is an independent minor league with teams in Arizona , California and Canada .
The Outlaws open on the road on May 21 in Tijuana and return for their home opener on May 26th .

Neocons vs. Rand Paul
Created : March 17 , 2010 18:31 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
Rand Paul takes a little less relish in arguing with neoconservative foreign policy hawks than his father , Rep. Ron Paul ( R - Texas ) , does .
( The elder Paul ’s debate confrontation with Rudy Giuliani was a pivotal moment in his insurgent presidential campaign . )
But supporters of both Pauls generally despise the GOP foreign policy establishment .
They ’re going to love this part of Jonathan Martin ’s great story on Republican jitters about Rand ’s Senate bid .
Recognizing the threat , a well - connected former aide to Vice President Dick Cheney convened a conference call last week between Grayson and a group of leading national security conservatives to sound the alarm about Paul .
“ On foreign policy , [ global war on terror ] , Gitmo , Afghanistan , Rand Paul is NOT one of us , ” Cesar Conda wrote in an e-mail to figures such as Liz Cheney , William Kristol , Robert Kagan , Dan Senor and Marc Thiessen .
With an attached memo on Paul ’s noninterventionist positions , Conda concluded : “ It is our hope that you can help us get the word out about Rand Paul ’s troubling and dangerous views on foreign policy . ”
In an interview , Conda noted that Paul once advocated for closing down the detention center at Guantanamo Bay and sending some suspected terrorists to the front lines in Afghanistan .
“ This guy could become our Republican senator from Kentucky ? ” he exclaimed .
“ It ’s very alarming . ”
Paul probably wo n’t use this for fundraising , but his base does n’t need him to .
Research at the Sam and Rose Stein Institute for Research on Aging at the University of California , San Diego School of Medicine suggests a novel route to improving the symptoms of subsyndromal depression ( SSD ) in seniors through the regular use of " exergames " -- entertaining video games that combine game play with exercise .
In a pilot study , the researchers found that use of exergames significantly improved mood and mental health - related quality of life in older adults with SSD .
The study , led by Dilip V. Jeste , MD , Distinguished Professor of psychiatry and neurosciences at UCSD School of Medicine , Estelle and Edgar Levi Chair in Aging , and director of the UC San Diego Sam and Rose Stein Institute for Research on Aging , appears in the March issue of the American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry .
SSD is much more common than major depression in seniors , and is associated with substantial suffering , functional disability , and increased use of costly medical services .
Physical activity can improve depression ; however , fewer than five percent of older adults meet physical activity recommendations .
" Depression predicts nonadherence to physical activity , and that is a key barrier to most exercise programs , " Jeste said .
" Older adults with depression may be at particular risk for diminished enjoyment of physical activity , and therefore , more likely to stop exercise programs prematurely . "
In the study , 19 participants with SSD ranging in age from 63 to 94 played an exergame on the Nintendo Wii video game system during 35 - minute sessions , three times a week .
After some initial instruction , they chose one of the five Nintendo Wii Sports games to play on their own -- tennis , bowling , baseball , golf or boxing .
Using the Wii remote -- a wireless device with motion - sensing capabilities -- the seniors used their arm and body movements to simulate actions engaged in playing the actual sport , such as swinging the Wii remote like a tennis racket .
The participants reported high satisfaction and rated the exergames on various attributes including enjoyment , mental effort , and physical limitations .
" The study suggests encouraging results from the use of the exergames , " Jeste said .
" More than one - third of the participants had a 50 - percent or greater reduction of depressive symptoms .
Many had a significant improvement in their mental health - related quality of life and increased cognitive stimulation . "
Jeste said feedback revealed some participants started the study feeling nervous about how they would perform in the exergames and the technical aspects of game play .
However , by the end of the study , most participants reported that learning and playing the videogames was satisfying and enjoyable .
" The participants thought the exergames were fun , they felt challenged to do better and saw progress in their game play , " Jeste said .
" Having a high level of enjoyment and satisfaction , and a choice among activities , exergames may lead to sustained exercise in older adults . "
He cautioned , however , that the findings were based on a small study , and needed to be replicated in larger samples using control groups .
He also stressed that exergames carry potential risks of injury , and should be practiced with appropriate care .

The Afghan president , Hamid Karzai , has unilaterally taken control of the country 's top electoral watchdog , provoking outrage from western diplomats , the Guardian has learnt .
The Electoral Complaints Commission ( ECC ) , which forced Karzai into a runoff election after it disqualified nearly 1 m fraudulent votes in last year 's presidential election , previously included three foreign experts named by the UN .
However , according to a new presidential decree published today , Karzai will have the exclusive power to appoint all five panel members .
His decision to " Afghanise " the ECC came while parliament was in recess .
It provoked a shocked reaction from western diplomats , who fear parliamentary elections – due to take place in six months – will be fatally undermined by a repeat of last year 's electoral fraud .
Such an outcome would not only destroy the credibility of parliament , it would also be a further distraction to international efforts to push back the Taliban and build popular confidence in the Afghan government .
One foreign election expert described the decree as a " stunning " development .
A western diplomat said Karzai had given " two fingers " to the western donors who had pumped millions of dollars into establishing democratic elections in the country .
He said the Afghan president was using his power to make laws while parliament was not sitting in order to get rid of the three UN - appointed foreigners who had dominated the five - member ECC .
The commission 's Canadian chairman and his two non-Afghan colleagues were instrumental in demanding an investigation into widespread fraud during the election last summer .
Karzai was stripped of 954,526 votes and forced to accept a second round of voting after the ECC 's intervention left him short of the majority he needed to win outright .
Karzai has never accepted either the ECC 's verdict or that there was widespread fraud , instead blaming foreigners for " defaming " the process .
Abdullah Abdullah , the runner - up in the presidential election , said the presence of foreign commissioners last year was the only thing that prevented the country falling into " absolute turmoil " .
He told the Guardian : " It is a step backwards and it has to be challenged by parliament and the international community .
" If we are left with this situation as it is today , it could seriously jeopardise the efforts being made on the military front .
"
The election decree also does nothing to address foreign concerns about the Independent Election Commission , the Afghan organisation charged with running the vote .
Western diplomats threatened to withdraw funding if the commission was not overhauled and the chairman – heavily criticised for being biased towards Karzai – replaced .
Karzai has made no secret of his desire to " Afghanise " the membership of the ECC , but most diplomats thought he would be unable to do so because the constitution says election law cannot be changed within a year of a national vote .
However , the palace argues the constitution only prevents parliament from changing electoral law while presidential decrees are not so constrained .
By the same logic , Karzai 's aides argue that parliament would be unable to use its power to challenge the decree within 30 days of returning to work .
Diplomatic sources say Kai Eide , the head of the UN in Afghanistan , had struck a private deal with Karzai under which he will use his new powers to appoint at least two foreigners to the election watchdog .
But that will mean Karzai's Afghan appointees would hold the balance of power in the commission and be unlikely to challenge his wishes .
In another development likely to infuriate the president 's western backers , he has defied US pressure to pass a separate decree to help fight corruption .
The failure to pass the decree before parliament returned to work on Saturday means a key pledge to enact new anti-graft laws legislation by the end of February , made by Karzai at the international conference on Afghanistan in London last month , will almost certainly not be met .
The US hoped the decree would include measures to strengthen and give independence to the High Office of Oversight , an anti-graft body set up last year that has been criticised for being overshadowed by the president , and also establish an international monitoring body .
It is now extremely unlikely that parliament will pass the legislation in time , and legal delays could hold it up indefinitely .
There has been a tremendous response to my introduction to the Demographia Survey .
Many have asked me to expand upon the arguments and provide documentation ( such as Michael Dudley in this space ) , which was not possible in a preface .
This I am pleased to do .
Greenhouse gas emissions .
Advocates of high - density policies ( often termed " Smart Growth " but also under other descriptions and euphemisms such as " urban consolidation " , " compact development " , " growth management " and " urban renewal " ) maintain these policies save energy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
A comprehensive study of per capita emissions in Australia based on household consumption of all products and services appears in the Australian Conservation Foundation 's Consumption Atlas .
Unexpectedly , this analysis shows that greenhouse gas emissions of those living in high - density areas are greater than for those living in low - density areas .
An analysis of the data ( 1 ) shows that the average carbon dioxide equivalent emission of the high - density core areas of Australian cities is 27.9 tonnes per person whereas that for the low - density outer areas is 17.5 tonnes per person .
As mentioned in the Demographia Survey introduction , food and goods purchased account for most of the emissions and this amounts to more for wealthier inner-city dwellers .
Surprisingly , transport emissions amount to very little ( only 10.5 % ) , household electricity and heating fuel being about twice as much at 20.0 % .
( 2 ) It should also be noted that the emissions from household dwelling construction and renovations at 11.8 % are greater than emissions for transport .
It is clear that transport , so heavily emphasized by Smart Growth advocates , is responsible for only a small fraction of household emissions .
Interestingly , using regression analysis to attempt to isolate variables influencing household emissions , the paper on which the data is based ( 3 ) finds that density , as an isolated variable , has practically no effect on total energy requirements .
The paper also finds that density has little effect on the per person energy requirement for mobility and automotive fuel consumption .
Another study which solely measures direct household energy consumption ( 4 ) ( thus excluding the effect of purchases ) found that annual greenhouse emissions from this source in high - rise equated to 5.4 tonnes CO2 per person per year whereas that for detached housing was only 2.9 tonnes .
So even when excluding purchases associated with wealth , high - rise still comes out worst .
Yet another study , also not incorporating factors directly associated with wealth ( 5 ) finds that the total of transport , building operational and building embodied annual greenhouse gas emissions per person for city apartments is 10 tonnes whereas that for outer suburban dwellers is 7.3 tonnes – once again more for apartments .
The explanation for these findings probably partly arises from lower occupancy rates in high - rise compared to single - residential ( as revealed in the above - mentioned studies ) and the use of elevators , clothes dryers , air - conditioners and common lighted areas such as parking garages and foyers .
Most studies do not include this latter important element , simply because they are based upon consumer bills which do not include common consumption .
In addition there is the greater energy per resident required to construct high - rise .
Looking towards the future , if we are to reduce our urban energy and water footprint by individually collecting localised solar energy and rainwater it appears reasonable that this will only be practical for dwellings that have a large roof area per inhabitant .
That means low density .
In summary , in the Australian situation there is no environmental emission evidence that justifies forcing people to live in apartments - if anything the reverse seems to be the case .
Transport .
Not only does transport comprise only a minor portion of household emissions , the energy difference between the use of public and private transport modes is surprising small .
The Sydney City Rail website states " greenhouse gas emissions per passenger kilometre for rail transport is up to five times less than that of car transport " ( my emphasis ) .
However one cannot assume optimal conditions to always prevail such as full carriages .
Such theoretical figures are just that – theoretical .
Theoretical figures for automobiles would also be much more favourable if one assumes for example full occupancy of seats .
In fact the actual greenhouse gas emissions per passenger kilometre for the Sydney rail network , transporting around 500,000 passengers each day , is 105 grams .
( 6 ) The figure for automobiles in Australia , assuming an average seat occupancy of 1.3 , averages 155 grams and is much less for modern fuel - efficient vehicles that emit a mere 70 grams .
It needs to also be considered that direct point to point travel distances by personal transport are frequently less than that for equivalent public transport journeys so further reducing the energy difference .
Our research shows that high - density developments hardly reduce per person travel intensity at all .
Dudley dismisses a Melbourne study ( 7 ) I mentioned that shows that people who moved into newly converted dense areas did not use public transport to any greater extent , and there was little or no change in their percentage of car use .
He claims this is due to Melbourne being " a sprawling city " .
However the overall density of Melbourne is not relevant here as , in addition to being well served by public transport , the converted areas are located very close to the central business district .
It sometimes seems that the last refuge of Smart Growth advocates is to declare whatever they do n't like as sprawl .
Indeed , it could be argued that there are no cities in the developed world that do not sprawl .
Developers recognise that units without parking are not saleable .
In Melbourne medium density housing projects located near commercial or transit centres invariably include one or two parking places per dwelling .
( 8 ) The initial developers of a 5.7 ha site near Sydney Central Station abandoned their proposed development of the huge multi-unit project mainly because authorities insisted that a maximum limit of 60 per cent of the units could be allocated parking .
( 9 ) This abandonment was in spite of the fact that the site could not be in a better location for public transport , being adjacent to the central railway station and major bus routes that radiate out from the locality .
The reality is that , for many journeys undertaken ( including travelling to locations outside the city centre , attending childrens ' sport and recreational activities , transporting pets and visiting friends ) , public transport is unsuitable or even forbidden as with bulky goods or pets , as well as being too inconvenient and time - consuming to be of practical benefit .
A 2008 Canadian studyon the relationship between density and transit use does not alter the above assessment .
It plainly shows how little density contributes to a change in automobile use .
Without any evidence to the contrary , it seems reasonable to assume that the Canadian fraction of total household emissions that relate to transport is similar to that shown on the Australian Conservation Foundation 's website , being 10.5 % .
Applying this value to the data in Chart 2 of this Canadian study one finds that for those living within 5 km of the city centre there would be a difference attributable to density of only 1 % in total annual emissions per person .
For people living 20 km or more from the city centre the difference would be much less at 0.2 % .
Yet it seems that for Smart Growth advocates this miniscule difference justifies cramming people together like sardines .
These believers ignore other much more significant factors affecting emissions that completely over - ride this minute transport - related effect .
It is interesting to note that journey to work travel times do not seen to decrease as density increases .
Looking at New York and some examples of large cities of different density there is no indication that these times are less in dense cities :
The increased congestion caused by high - density policies results in inefficient stop - start traffic which increases greenhouse gas emissions as a direct consequence of burning more fuel per km and increases the concentration of dangerous micro-particles from vehicle exhausts .
The resulting greater traffic per area and less volume available for dispersion exacerbates this .
The World Health Organization maintains that several times as many people die from these particles every year as do from traffic accidents . ( 10 )
The evidence is that the imposition of high density policies does not lead to reduced traffic congestion , lower air pollution levels and improved travel times .
The reverse appears to be the case .
Health .
The increasing concentration of dangerous micro-particles from vehicle exhausts is mentioned above .
In addition , mental health problems are of major concern .
A study of over 4 million Swedes ( 11 ) has shown that the rates for psychosis were 70 % greater for the denser areas .
There was also a 16 % greater risk of developing depression .
The paper discusses various reasons for this finding but the conclusion is compelling : " A high level of urbanisation is associated with increased risk of psychosis and depression in both men and women " .
Another study of a population of 350,000 people in Holland ( 12 ) also finds adverse mental ( and other ) health consequences .
After allowing for demographic and socio-economic characteristics , for those living in areas with only 10 % green space the prevalence of depression and anxiety was 32 % and 26 % respectively .
For those with 90 % green space the prevalence was respectively 24 % and 18 % , a significant difference for an increasingly serious problem .
Research also indicates that bringing up young children in apartments can have adverse consequences .
( 13 ) Keeping children quiet emphasizes activities that are sedentary .
There is a lack of safe active play space outside the home - parks and other public open space offer poor security .
There are other indirect indicators that relate to this question :
The Australian Unity Well - being Index ( 14 ) reported that the happiest electorates have a lower population density .
A recent study in New Zealand ( 15 ) asking people whether residents in particular areas would most like to live in that type of area , revealed that the answer was yes for 90 % of rural residents , 76 % for small town residents , 75 % for city suburbs and only 64 % for central city dwellers .
Apparently as density increased , so did dissatisfaction with that type of living .
The inference from a study on apartment life ( 16 ) is that half of the apartment living households in Sydney and Melbourne would prefer to live in single - residential dwellings .
This corresponds to only about 10 % of all those in occupied dwellings in the two cities wishing to live in apartments .
A recent housing preference survey ( press release ) sent out with rate notices by Ku-ring - gai Council in Sydney reveals a similar result .
Within reasonable limits people should be allowed to live in the type of housing they prefer .
They should not be forced into living in a manner prescribed by planners who profess to know what is best for them .
It should be emphasised that we recognise that there are some people that prefer high - density living .
What we are arguing against , is the forced imposition of high - density policies , such as is occurring in Australia and other countries , to the overall detriment of their citizens and the environment .
It appears from deprecating comments about the " free market " and " libertarian " views that Smart Growth advocates are unconcerned about what people actually want .
Social networks should also be considered .
Putnam in his famous book " Bowling Alone " sums up that " suburbanisation , commuting and sprawl " have contributed to the decline in social engagement and social capital ( 17 ) : However charts in this book show the opposite .
The chart below aggregates Putnam 's portrayal .
This indicates that involvement ( 18 ) in these social activities of people in the centres in the more spacious small towns is nearly twice that in dense large cities .
It is also apparent that such community involvement is greater in low - density suburbs than in denser central city areas , especially for the larger centres .
The data therefore show , contrary to what was claimed , that as density increases , people 's involvement in community activity declines .
Facts available indicate that adverse health and social consequences of high - density living are significant .
Housing Cost
This aspect has been adequately covered in the Demographia Survey .
It seems reasonable to conclude that the major cause of excessive housing costs in Australia lies in over - prescriptive land use regulation .
In Sydney , where housing costs are the second highest in the 272 markets surveyed , the New South Wales government has restricted the release of greenfield housing sites ( 19 while at the same time demanding municipalities increase densities under threat of removing the councils ' planning powers .
Since 1977 the New South Wales population increased by 38 % while the proportion of greenfields land release sites decreased from an annual average of 20 % of dwelling production to 5 % . ( 20 )
As a consequence of the resultant land shortage the land component in the price of a house in Sydney has increased from 32 % in 1977 to 60 % in 2002 ( 21 ) and to an estimated 70 % today .
High - density policies increase the cost of housing , with special disadvantage to the younger generation by locking them out of the housing market .
In addition , they disadvantage the economy by throttling the competitiveness of new business trying to set up in the region .
Conclusion
The evidence available so far indicates that Smart Growth policies forced into unwilling communities do not reduce greenhouse gas emissions , do not facilitate travel , do not improve health , do not increase housing choice and do not reduce overall costs .
It seems that planners are intent on sweeping us backwards into despotic , overcrowded Dickensian gloom .
Dr. Tony Recsei has a background in chemistry and is an environmental consultant .
Since retiring he has taken an interest in community affairs and is president of the Save Our Suburbs community group which opposes over - development forced onto communities by the New South Wales State Government .

The connection between gut bacteria and obesity has gained some weight , with new findings demonstrating links in mice among immune - system malfunction , bacterial imbalance and increased appetite .
Mice with altered immune systems developed metabolic disorders and were prone to overeating .
When microbes from their stomachs were transplanted into other mice , they also become obese .
" This supports the notion that some of the increase in obesity may be because of changes to gut bacteria , " said Andrew Gewirtz , an Emory University immunologist and co-author of the study , published March 4 in Science .
The findings are the latest in a growing body of research about the long - unappreciated role of bacteria in our bodies .
Bacterial cells actually outnumber human cells in the body : From an outside perspective , people are not so much individual organisms as symbiotic human - bacteria collectives .
Disturbances to internal bacteria have been linked to asthma , cancer and many autoimmune diseases .
Gut flora have also been linked to obesity .
In 2006 , researchers led by Washington University microbiologist Jeffrey Gordon documented bacterial changes in the stomachs of mice who became obese on high - fat diets .
When transplanted , their gut bugs turned other mice obese , suggesting that altered bacteria were not only an effect of weight gain , but a cause .
The Science findings complement those , but also emphasize the immune system 's role and the possibility of appetite change .
" The reason why people are eating too much may not simply be because unhealthy food is cheap and available , but that their appetites may be driven by changes in gut bacteria , " said Gewirtz ,
In the Science study , Gewirtz and Emery microbiologist Matam Vijay - Kumar studied a strain of mice deficient in TLR - 5 , a gene that 's required for immune systems to recognize many types of bacteria .
They found that TLR - 5 – deficient mice are about 20 percent heavier than regular mice .
They overeat , have high blood pressure and high cholesterol , and are insulin - resistant .
In humans , that constellation of conditions is known as metabolic syndrome , and in both people and mice leads to obesity and diabetes .
Earlier research had found unusual patterns of bacteria in the guts of those mice .
When the researchers transferred bacteria from the stomachs of TLR - 5 – deficient mice to mice without gut bacteria , the recipients started to eat more , and soon developed metabolic syndrome .
" It 's a really exciting paper .
It confirms and supports a lot of the findings we 've had , and adds in the interaction between gut bacteria and the immune system , " said Peter Turnbaugh , a systems biologist who moved from Jeffrey Gordon 's lab to Harvard University .
" It 's been thought for a long time that maybe the immune system is an important regulator of what 's in the gut . "
How gut bacteria produce metabolic changes is n't known .
They may process nutrients directly , or alter the activity of metabolism - regulating genes .
Mice used in the research are not considered exact models of bacteria and obesity in humans .
Instead they 're models of these sorts of relationships likely to exist in people .
Gewirtz 's team is now investigating whether people with metabolic syndrome have unusual gut bacteria .
The findings do n't suggest obesity is literally contagious , said Turnbaugh .
But they do raise the possibility of altering the composition of gut bacteria , either directly or — more realistically — by learning what sort of environmental and lifestyle factors produce obesity - causing bugs .
One possible culprit is the ubiquitous presence of antibiotics , both prescribed and in the environment , said Gewirtz .
" It may be that an unintended consequence of this has been the upset of bacterial populations that are promoting obesity and metabolic syndrome , " he said .

Longstanding UK developer Rare is set to open a second studio in Birmingham , marking the first time the developer has ventured beyond its Twycross headquarters .
Rare wants to see some 90 staff at the studio , though as the outfit will be used for QA testing and usability tests , the workforce is bound to fluctuate .
The new offices will open in April , and the Microsoft - owned developer says the move comes as part of a “ change to the current model of games development working practices . ”
Rare Birmingham is positioned to attract contract staff from a large pool of talent , the firm said .
It will " accommodate Rare ’s evolving methodology in game creation ” , the group said .
“ Rare believes that the current model of massive teams has lead to a boom and bust cycle in staffing terms and sees a film production model as a far better and more efficient way of creating AAA games going forward , " read a statement .
Rare points out that the new studio is close to several universities and colleges ; “ ideally placed for recruiting new staff . ”
Rare studio head Mark Betteridge said “ the old way of making games just does n’t work anymore , we need to be much more flexible in how we staff a team and setting up new facility in Digbeth will help us to do this .
“ Its central location and the nature of other businesses in the area make it a very appealing environment in which to work .
While we are committed to keeping our headquarters in Twycross , we feel a second studio in a more urban location will be appealing to some staff . ”
Jane Holmes , an investment manager at regional body Advantage West Midlands , said that Rare ’s move is “ fantastic news for the West Midlands , not least because it will bring 90 high technology jobs to the region , along with a major , globally successful company .
“ The West Midlands has a long - established video games industry , accounting for one quarter of the UK games workforce , ” she added .
“ Rare ’s arrival will further strengthen the region ’s reputation around the world for excellence in computer games . ”

Crisscrossing Players and Plots and Not Losing Your Mind
After West Marches
I ran a long - term superhero game , New Century City .
Unlike West Marches it followed the more traditional “ the GM creates a situation and the players have fun with it ” model , which was fitting because superhero games are one of the most reactive genres you can play : villains hatch schemes , heroes react to stop them and re-establish the status quo .
Also unlike West Marches , the game was plot - heavy .
Absolutely thick with plot .
There was a big , over - arching thread that ran through the whole thing ( Worlds In Collision ) , a bunch of individual threads that were part of that main arc ( Queen of the Jungle , Emerald of Aktios , I am Maximus ) as well as assorted unrelated adventure arcs ( the lives and deaths of Dr. Null , the Echelon conspiracy ) .
Then there were individual “ rise & fall ” character arcs for NPCs ( Can we cure the Man -Beast ?
Is Nighthawk a villain or an undercover hero ? ) .
And then on top of all that , there were multiple personal threads for every player character ( Captain Danger ’s relationship with her sister , Moon Man finding out what really happened to him in those missing decades in space , the secret origin of the Eclipse , the dating life of the Eclipse , and so on , and so on ) .
In keeping with the comic book style , I wanted every session to be a self - contained episode with it ’s own arc , complete with an episode title announced at the start of the game .
So if you played any one game , it would be a complete adventure ( or part of a few session mini- series at most ) .
No bridging sessions , no filler sessions .
But coming right off of West Marches we had a big pool of great players .
We wanted to keep playing with everyone , but ten people at the table is way too crowded for anything close to meaningful roleplaying .
So again I opted for the mixed roster method : we ’d float a date and see who could play , keeping each game at about 3 - 5 players .
We rarely had the same combination of players at two sessions in a row , which was great for the stand - alone episode part but a potential nightmare for plot threads .
Each player is only seeing a fraction of the sessions , so how do you make sure what they ’re seeing makes any sense ?
You say , “ surprise !
Nighthawk is really a good guy after all ” and the players at this session look at you and say , “ uh , who ’s Nighthawk ? ” because they ’ve never been in a game with him before , or they missed the last bit that set up this bit .
Oops .
The cheap answer is to just let the players sort it out .
Confused why that guy did that thing ?
Maybe you better chat with the other players if you want to keep up .
While that was glorious in West Marches , where the whole theme was sandbox exploration , it seemed completely inappropriate in a character - centric game like this .
The superheroes are the center of the story , the axis around which the plot wheel turns .
Just hitting a player with plot X because I wanted to advance that plot and they happened to be there seemed aesthetically tragic .
So I took the harder approach : customizing every single session so it was lovingly hand - crafted to the characters that would be there .
And advanced the plots .
And made sense .
To keep track of all that , to understand the perspective of each character and figure out what plots they were involved in , I need a tool .
I needed a plot grid .
Everything goes in the Plot Grid
The grid was a list of every important thing I wanted to put in the game : plots , events , episodes , characters , scenes , revelations , the works .
Every single item had its own line on the grid .
Every revelation , every confrontation , every snippet that I thought needed to come out had its own line ( Captain Danger ’s sister has powers too !
Felicity is really Cathy Grant ! ) .
Every thing that needed to come back in response to something that happened in the game had its own line ( Maelstrom attacked those army choppers so the Feds are going to come after him , Captain Danger does n’t know she has that thing in her jacket pocket ) .
Every idea for a random situation , flashy encounter , or set piece had a line ( Speed Demon tries to set a record for banks robbed in a day , a sorcerer transforms part of downtown to ancient Aegypt ) .
It all went into the big hopper .
To the right I made columns for every single player character in the game ( 24 + characters ) .
For each line I would mark the box to show how relevant each item was to that character , how important it was to have that character there when that thing happened .
Characters were marked essential if they had to be there ( I ca n’t reveal the thing about Felicity being Cathy Grant without both Captain Danger and Guardian being there ) , or marked optional if they had some previous contact with this thread or had shown curiosity but were n’t required ( Eclipse and the Shadow would be interested to find out the truth about Mr. Midnight ’s background , but it ’s only essential to Moon Man since their origins are secretly intertwined ) .
For other characters that line was blank , meaning there was no special connection that character .
Some lines had no marks at all , meaning they were n’t attached to anyone in particular , and I could use them whenever I wanted — a lot of generic “ action ” encounters were this way .

So let ’s say we ’ve scheduled a game , and I ’ve found out who can play and which of their characters they want to play .
I take my big grid , and sort the lines so that all the items important to those particular characters will pop to the top .
That ’s my starting point for brainstorming what to put in the episode .
I mix and match , see what goes together and what emerges .
Ideally something jumps out as the main plot for the session : some items are big and clearly need to be the centerpiece of an episode , others are just supporting encounters or scenes ( it was a personal rule that each episode had a strong core concept , not just a mix of “ this week on … ” but that ’s just me ) .
Sometimes the unexpected combinations of characters led to surprising but cool plot cross-overs .
I did n’t foresee Dr. Daedalus returning with Moon Man to ancient Atlantis because he was only peripherally attached to that thread , but because his player was available and others were n’t that ’s what happened and it turned out to be a perfect match .
If you asked the players they would probably guess I planned it .
It was also nice because I could be flexible and follow my whims .
I could let threads simmer for ten , twenty games without being afraid that I would lose track of them .
I did n’t have to keep the game on tight rails .
Side Effects : It ’s All About Me
There ’s a counter - intuitive side effect : the less you play , the more the game is about you when you do play .
Yes , crazy , I know .
But if there ’s a plot that requires you ( and just about everyone in the superhero game had a background or origin plot — the genre demands it ) , then the less you play , the fewer opportunities there are to move that plot .
So if you ’re going to be in a game , I ’m more likely to push that thread up the stack .
Guardian is showing up for a game ?
Gotta move that “ Trials of Torvok ” plot while I have the chance !
Dr. Daedalus is in ?
Time for the “ Armor Wars . ”
Suffice to say , players did not mind this one bit .
The less frequent players got the spotlight , and the more frequent players did n’t mind because they already had the spotlight in a lot of games .
Information is addictive and columns are cheap
As the game went on I added more and more columns to track things like the scale of the adventure ( saving the world , saving the city , back alley brawling ) or the style of the game ( investigation , slugfest , personal issues ) , so I could sort and scan and see what kinds of games we ’d had , and even break down what kind of games each individual player had been in ( yeah , Mike had n’t played in the last six games , but I do n’t necessary want the next game he plays in be just like the game he played two months ago ) .
I had columns for all the major plot arcs , so I could mark which plot each item belonged to .
I could track how long it had been ( either in - game or real days ) since a particular thread had moved .
I could flag items as “ important , do it soon ! ” or “ maybe . ”
As items got used , I put the episode number in the far left column : that thing had happened , so it was cemented in place .
I ’d change the boxes to checks to show which characters were in that episode , editing the description to reflect what actually happened , morphing my adventure seeds neatly into game records .
Run the Numbers
If you ’re wondering how extensively this method was tested , or if you ’re wondering if it was overkill , I used it for 119 New Century City games , with nine players running 24 different characters ( after factoring out anyone who played fewer than ten games ) .
There were an average of 3.4 players per game , plus GM .
Yep , once again the average player only sees about a third of the games .
And no , I do n’t think you have to run such a big game to make it worthwhile .
It ’s potentially a useful technique for any sized game .
The White House predicted today that the president ’s health care reform plan will pass the House this week and , in a related development , even the public option is looking like a very real possibility .
Robert Gibbs , the president ’s press secretary , warned Republicans that if they make health care an issue in the November elections , “ they do so at their own peril . ”
“ Make my day , ” senior White House political advisor David Axelrod said .
“ Let ’s have that fight .
I ’m ready to have that – and every member of Congress ought to be willing to have that debate as well . ”
As of today , meanwhile , 41 Senators had either signed or issued statements of support for a letter to Majority Leader Harry Reid urging passage of the Public Option through reconciliation .
The senators are supporting a letter initiated by a freshman liberal , Rep. Alan Grayson , D - Fla. , who has introduced a bill into the House ( H.R. 4789 ) which would give the option to buy into Medicare to every citizen of the United States .
The Public Option Act , as it is officially named , is being called the Medicare You Can Buy Into Act by lawmakers .
“ If giving people the opportunity to choose Medicare as their insurance provider causes millions to ditch their current policy for a far better deal , what ’s wrong with that ? ”
Grayson asked recently after a public jobs forum in Orlando .
“ Obviously , the people want and need more competition in health coverage , and a public option offers that .
But its just as important that we offer people not just another choice , but another kind of choice . ”
Grayson said open enrollment in Medicare would force private insurance companies to lower premiums in order to remain competitive .
Despite the improved prospects for meaningful health care reform , labor and its allies say public pressure must continue .
They note that recent polls showing higher approval ratings for the president , the Democrats and health care reform have helped push some legislators off the fence .
The GOP , meanwhile , today lost several rounds in its bid to stall passage of the president ’s bill .
The first setback for them came when Sen. Robert Byrd , D - W.Va. , endorsed reconciliation as a means to pass the measure .
Republicans had hoped Byrd would back their claim that the president and Senate Democrats are breaking the rules to pass health care legislation .
In another setback for the obstructionists was the Catholic Hospitals Association came out in favor of the president ’s health care proposal .
The move destroys the Republican argument that abortion language in the bill weakens conscience protections for Catholic health providers .
Opponents of reform remain determined , however , to block passage of the bill .
Swing Democrats are being hammered with a multi-million dollar anti-health care campaign .
The United States Chamber of Commerce is singling out 27 Democrats who supported the health care bill last year and 13 who opposed it in an effort that will cost $ 30 million by the end of this week .
The campaign is directed at the same lawmakers President Barack Obama and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi lobbied last week .
Supporters of health care reform note , however , that the growing public demand for health care reform explains the shift in favor of it among some lawmakers this week .
Only three Democratic senators , for example , have come out opposed to the public option .
The measure could pass even with six defections .

Audit deems Pakistan aid program a failure
A $ 45 million USAID program aimed at improving the ability of Pakistani tribal leaders to govern a politically sensitive stretch of territory along the Afghan border has failed to achieve its primary mission of improving the delivery of basic services , according to an audit by the agency ’s inspector general .
The two year - old development program for the Federally Administered Tribal Areas ( FATA ) was designed to help improve living standards in one of Pakistan ’s poorest and most politically unstable territories .
So far , only $ 15.5 million has been spent on the initiative .
More specifically , the program — which is run by Development Alternatives , Inc. — was set up in January 2008 to aid local government officials and charities in developing the capacity to absorb the large amounts of Western assistance that have flowed into the area to challenge the political standing of the region ’s extremists .
It funds the activities of the FATA development authority , which employs 100 people , and FATA secretariat , which oversees nearly 30,000 local employees , including teachers and health - care workers .
But the " program has made little headway in achieving its two main goals , " according to the audit .
" It has not achieved the goal of improving the capacity of FATA governmental institutions to govern , " according to the audit , which was produced by the inspector general ’s office in Manila , the Philippines .
And it " did not increase the capacities of [ local ]
NGOs to promote good governance , although some progress was made . "
The report cites some advances , including training in financial management and program and development planning for 1,224 local officials .
The program also provided some training and office equipment for 42 nongovernmental organizations .
The program has been plagued by a deteriorating security situation that has prompted USAID to order Development Alternatives and other American contractors to relocate to Islamabad from Peshawar , where a USAID official was killed in November 2008 .
The report says that the program was further delayed after the contractor ’s chief representative resigned in September 2008 , leaving the position vacant until January 2009 .
It took 9 months to identify local charities to support , and 400 computers purchased for government offices remain in unopened boxes .
Another 72 laptops were unaccounted for at the time of the audit .
In a response , USAID ’s Pakistan mission director , Robert J. Wilson , said the agency would seek to ensure the delivery of the computers by the end of March .
He said that 55 of 72 missing laptops have been found and that USAID will bill the contractor and the Pakistani authorities for the rest if they do n’t turn up .
The report also faults a change of political strategy by the Obama administration , which is now calling for U.S. assistance to be channeled through local charities , for placing the program in limbo .
In June , USAID refused to provide full funding for a $ 15.3 million request from Development Alternatives as it began to rethink its practice of directing most of its funds to U.S. - based contractors .
In October , USAID asked the company to prepare a plan to shut down its operations , but never made a decision to close it .
In response to the audit , Wilson said that USAID had agreed in December to extend Development Alternatives ’ contract through the end of 2010 .
An iceberg the size of Luxembourg knocked loose from the Antarctic continent earlier this month could disrupt the ocean currents driving weather patterns around the globe , researchers said .
While the impact would not be felt for decades or longer , a slowdown in the production of colder , dense water could result in less temperate winters in the north Atlantic , they said Thursday .

The 2,550 square - kilometre ( 985 square - mile ) block broke off on February 12 or 13 from the Mertz Glacier Tongue , a 160 - kilometer spit of floating ice protruding into the Southern Ocean from East Antarctica due south of Melbourne , researchers said .
Some 400 metres ( 1,300 feet ) thick , the iceberg could fill Sydney Harbour more than 100 times over .
It could also disturb the area ’s exceptionally rich biodiversity , including a major colony of emperor penguins near Dumont d’Urville , site of a French scientific station , according to the scientists .
“ The ice tongue was almost broken already .
It was hanging like a loose tooth , ” said Benoit Legresy , a French glaciologist who has been monitoring the Metz Glacier via satellite images and on the ground for a decade in cooperation with Australian scientists .
The billion - tonne mass , 78 kilometres long and half - again as wide , was dislodged by another , older iceberg , known as B9B , which split off in 1987 .

Jammed against the Antarctic continent for more than 20 years , B9B smashed into the Metz tongue like a slow - motion battering ram after it began to drift .
Both natural cycles and man-made climate change contribute to the collapse of ice shelves and glaciers .
Tide and ocean currents constantly beat against exposed areas , while longer summers and rising temperatures also take a toll .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ Obviously when there is warmer water , these ice tongues will become more fragile , ” said Legresy , who works at the Laboratory for Geophysics and Oceanographic Space Research in Toulouse , southern France .
The Metz Glacier Tongue , fitted with GPS beacons and other measurement instruments , could provide crucial insights into how these influences should be apportioned .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ For the first time , we will have a detailed record of the full cycle of a major calving event — before , during and after , ” he said .
“ We are using the ice tongue as a laboratory to study the processes that might be impacted by climate change , including calving , ocean temperature , sea level change . ”
Since breaking off , the iceberg — along with the newly mobile B9B , which is about the same size — have moved into an adjoining area called a polynya .
ADVERTISEMENT
Distributed across the Southern Ocean , polynyas are zones that produce dense water , super cold and rich in salt , that sinks to the bottom of the sea and drives the conveyor - belt like circulation around the globe .
If these icebergs move east and run aground , or drift north into warmer climes , they will have no impact on these currents .
“ But if they stay in this area — which is likely — they could block the production of this dense water , essentially putting a lid on the polynya , ” Legresy explained .
The Metz Glacier Polynya is particularly strong , and accounts for 20 percent of the “ bottom water ” in the world , he added .

Eventually , the icebergs will die a natural death , but their lifespan depends on where they go .
Adrift , they could melt in a couple of decades .
If they remain lodged against the Antarctic landmass , they could persist far longer .

Holding a whiteboard and yelling about the cost of health care reform , former Senior Bush adviser Karl Rove melted down on ABC’s This Week Sunday .
Rove faced off against David Plouffe , one of President Barack Obama ’s senior advisers .
Rove is a paid contributor for Fox News where he rarely receives the kind of debate offered by Plouffe .
“ Is n’t there a point though , ” ABC ’s Jon Karl asked Plouffe , that “ there is some interesting accounting here ?
Is n’t it hard as a political factor for people to believe that a big new health care program is actually gonna cut the deficit ? ”
ADVERTISEMENT
“ First of all , Karl and the Republicans have zero credibility , about as much as Greece , ” Plouffe said .
Rove interrupted almost immediately , via satellite .
“ This is the CBO , ” he said .
“ These numbers are in the analysis from the CBO !
For God ’s sake , will you stop throwing around epithets and deal with the facts ? ”
Plouffe insisted the point of health insurance reform is fighting skyrocketing premiums .
“ We will see if they pass this bill , ” Rove countered .
“ I hope they do n’t .
I pray they do n’t .
It will be an economic disaster for the country if they do . ”

ABC News has the key quotes .
NBC host Luke Russert , son of the late Tim Russert , took exception to Rove ’s use of the whiteboard .
“ With all due respect to Mr. Rove , a man I find quite personable , a breakdown of #s on a whiteboard should only be done by 1 man , ” tweeted Russert .

Rove also claimed Sunday that Democrats would suffer huge losses in the fall if health care reform is passed .
Plouffe suggested that Rove should pull out the “ Mission Accomplished ” banner to prematurely celebrate Republicans ’ electoral gains .

Rove : “ This thing is paid for with Bernie - Madoff - style accounting . …
It ’s a gigantic disaster . ”
Plouffe : “ Karl and the Republicans would be familiar with that . ”
Rove : “ You will bankrupt the country if this bill passes . …
For God ’s sake , will you stop throwing around epitaphs [ sic ] and deal with the facts for once , David ? …
We will fight the election on this , . and the Democrats will have significant losses in the House and Senate as a result of this bill . ”
Plouffe : “ If Karl and a lot of Republicans want to call the election already , they ought to break out that ‘ Mission Accomplished ’ banner . ”
Rove : “ That ’s cheesy , David . …
You should not denigrate the mission of the USS Abraham Lincoln . ”

State legislation to allow the sale of raw farm milk to the general public moved a step forward Wednesday with some key changes , including the removal of an immunity clause for farmers .
By a 5 - 0 vote , the Senate Committee on Agriculture and Higher Education recommended approval of the bill that would allow raw milk sales direct from farms licensed by the Department of Agriculture , Trade and Consumer Protection .
The legislation is expected to be voted on by the full Assembly and Senate before the session ends in April .
Under the latest version of Senate Bill 434 , raw milk sales could only take place at farms where the milk was produced .
Farmers would have to post a sign declaring that raw milk does not provide the benefits of pasteurization and may contain disease - causing pathogens , and warns certain people of other health risks .
Farmers would be prohibited from advertising the sale of raw milk except for an on - farm sign .
Their milk would have to meet all of the requirements of a Grade - A dairy farm license , including delivery of a portion of the raw milk to a dairy plant where it would be tested for things such as pathogens and antibiotics .
Sellers of raw milk also would be required to obtain monthly tests for pathogens , and the results would be filed with the state Agriculture Department .
Temporary measure
The authorization for raw milk sales would expire Dec. 31 , 2011 .
Before then , some legislators hope to pass a permanent measure allowing raw milk sales .
Last week , hundreds of raw milk advocates packed a legislative hearing in Eau Claire , demanding the right to buy and sell unpasteurized dairy products that some claim have powerful health benefits but that detractors call dangerous .
Advocates say the dairy state 's handling of the issue will send an important signal to the rest of the country .
With the exception of limited , incidental sales , state law currently prohibits the sale of unpasteurized milk to the public because it could carry bacteria that cause food - borne illnesses .
The original legislation would have given farmers immunity from liability if someone became ill from their unpasteurized milk .
Immunity clause dropped
But the immunity clause was dropped after critics said it would set an unfair precedent in the food and beverage industry .
" A lot of people saw that we were granting immunity to this one group of people and not others , " said state Rep. Chris Danou ( D - Trempealeau ) , one of the sponsors of Assembly Bill 628 that would allow raw milk sales .
Former Indepedent Counsel Ken Starr ( left ) and former Deputy Attorney General Larry Thompson are among those criticizing Liz Cheney and others for attacks on lawyers who represented terrorism suspects .

A group that includes leading conservative lawyers and policy experts , former Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr and several senior officials of the last Bush administration is denouncing as “ shameful ” Republican attacks on lawyers who came to the Obama Justice Department after representing suspected terrorists .
Senate Republicans have demanded details of the lawyers ' past work and Liz Cheney ’s group “ Keep America Safe ” has questioned their “ values . "
A drumbeat of Republican criticism forced the Justice Department reluctantly to identify seven of them last week .
But the harshness of the criticism – Keep America Safe labeled a group of them the “ Al Qaeda Seven ” — has provoked a backlash from across the legal establishment .

“ We consider these attacks both unjust to the individuals in question and destructive of any attempt to build lasting mechanisms for counterterrorism adjudications , ” wrote the 19 lawyers whose names were attached to the statement as of early Monday .
The statement cited John Adams ’s defense of British soldiers charged in the Boston Massacre to argue that “ zealous representation of unpopular clients ” is an important American tradition .
The attacks on the lawyers “ undermine the Justice system more broadly , ” they wrote , by “ delegitimizing ” any system in which accused terrorists have lawyers , whether civilian courts of military tribunals .
The letter ’s signers include some of the top officials of a Bush Justice Department that wrestled at length with the legal questions surrounding terrorist detentions .
The Bush officials clashed repeatedly with some of the detainee lawyers , such as the current deputy Solicitor General , Neal Katyal , whom they are now defending .
The signers include former Deputy Attorney General Larry Thompson , John Ashcroft ’s No. 2 , and Peter Keisler , who served as acting attorney general during President Bush ’s second term .
They also include several lawyers who dealt directly with detainee policy : Matthew Waxman and Charles “ Cully ” Stimson , who each served as deputy assistant secretary of defense for detainee affairs ; Daniel Dell ’ Orto , who was acting general counsel for the Department of Defense ; and Bradford Berenson , a prominent Washington lawyer who worked on the issues as an associate White House counsel during President Bush ’s first term .
In 2007 , Stimson resigned as the Bush administration ’s top detainee affairs official after suggesting on a radio show that companies not hire law firms providing pro bono services to detainees .
He later apologized .
The lawyers ’ sharp support for the Democratic appointees reflects , in part , a rift that deepened late in President George W. Bush ’s term , in which allies of Vice President Dick Cheney fought pitched battles over the treatment of detainees with lawyers throughout the government seeking to bring terror suspects into a more familiar legal framework .
The letter ’s other signatories include Philip Zelikow and John Bellinger III , who were top advisers to then - Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , .
Also signing were David Rivkin and Lee Casey , officials in the Justice Department in the first George W. Bush administration .
Rivkin and Casey ‘s participation underscores the depth of discomfort with the attacks , as they have been among the most vocal defenders of Bush Administration detainee practices .
Last April , for example , they wrote in the Wall Street Journal that the controversial Department of Justice memos widely viewed as justifying harsh treatment in fact “ detail the actual techniques used and many measures taken to ensure that interrogations did not cause severe pain or degradation . ”
Separately , former Bush administration Solicitor General Ted Olson rose to the defense of lawyers representing detainees .
He noted , however , that some of those now defending current Justice Department lawyers were “ completely silent ” in the face of “ vicious attacks ” on Bush administration lawyers handling terrorism issues .
“ I of course think it ’s entirely appropriate for members of the legal profession to have provided legal services to detainees , ” Olson told POLITICO .
“ It is a part of the responsibility of lawyers and in the finest tradition of the profession to represent unpopular persons who are caught up in the criminal justice system or even in the military justice system .
I think that people who do so , do so honorably , ” said Olson , whose arguments before the Supreme Court helped win the presidency for George W. Bush in 2000 .
“ But I also think that some of the people being highly critical now of the criticism of the lawyers in the Justice Department , have been completely silent when it came to attacks — vicious attacks — on lawyers in the Department of Justice and the Defense Department who were providing legal assistance and advice to the United States of America during the last administration in connection with the attacks on the United States by terrorists .
“ So lawyers should be encouraged to provide legal advice conscientiously to their clients .
And that goes for people in the Bush administration and the Obama administration . ”
In 2007 , Olson co-authored an article in Legal Times in 2007 expressing similar sentiments about representation of detainees .
His co-author was Neal Katyal , one of the current Justice Department lawyers attacked by Cheney .
Liz Cheney ’s partner in Keep America Safe , Weekly Standard Editor Bill Kristol , wrote Sunday to dispute the notion that his group ’s sharp - edged ad constituted an “ attack ” on the lawyers .
His aim , he wrote , was to push for Justice to release their names and to raise “ the question of whether former pro bono lawyers for terrorists should be working on detainee policy for the Justice Department . ”
Other critics have compared the Justice Department appointees to mob lawyers , and argued that while they have a right to defend their clients , they do n’t belong in government .
Keep America
Safe is not alone in raising the issue .
And Republican leaders on Capitol Hill believe the attacks are politically effective , exposing what they see as concern for the rights of alleged terrorists outweighing the security of Americans .
A senior Republican congressional aide said that the line of attack is likely to broaden as the midterm elections approach .
Sen. Charles Grassley ( R - Ipwa ) has taken the lead in pressing the Justice Department first to reveal the number of its appointees who represented or advocated for detainees and then to confirm their names to Fox News .
Fox reported that most of the nine were big - firm lawyers who “ played only minor or short - lived roles in advocating for detainees , ” a popular pro bono cause at more than half of the country ’s large law firms .
A few were more prominent .
Assistant Attorney General Tony West of the Justice Department ’s Civil Division represented John Walker Lindh , the young California man captured among the Taliban early in the war in Afghanistan .
Jennifer Daskal , another political appointee at Justice , worked on detainee issues at Human Rights Watch , opposing the Bush Administration ’s policies .
But the highest profile attorney among the group is Katyal , who represented Salim Hamdan , Osama bin Laden ’s driver , in the case in which the Supreme Court declared President Bush ’s military tribunals unconstitutional .
“ The fact that he got 5 votes on the Supreme Court has to count for something , ” said Benjamin Wittes , a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution , who drafted the letter .
“ There has to be some space to disagree without someone running an ad suggesting you ’re an Al Qaeda agent , ” he said .
Here is the full statement and signatories as of early Monday :
The past several days have seen a shameful series of attacks on attorneys in the Department of Justice who , in previous legal practice , either represented Guantanamo detainees or advocated for changes to detention policy .
As attorneys , former officials and policy specialists who have worked on detention issues , we consider these attacks both unjust to the individuals in question and destructive of any attempt to build lasting mechanisms for counterterrorism adjudications .

As attorneys , former officials , and policy specialists who have worked on detention issues , we consider these attacks both unjust to the individuals in question and destructive of any attempt to build lasting mechanisms for counterterrorism adjudications .
The American tradition of zealous representation of unpopular clients is at least as old as John Adams ’s representation of the British soldiers charged in the Boston massacre .
People come to serve in the Justice Department with a diverse array of prior private clients ; that is one of the department ’s strengths .
The War on Terror raised any number of novel legal questions , which collectively created a significant role in judicial , executive and legislative forums alike for honorable advocacy on behalf of detainees .
In several key cases , detainee advocates prevailed before the Supreme Court .
To suggest that the Justice Department should not employ talented lawyers who have advocated on behalf of detainees maligns the patriotism of people who have taken honorable positions on contested questions and demands a uniformity of background and view in government service from which no administration would benefit .
Such attacks also undermine the Justice system more broadly .
In terrorism detentions and trials alike , defense lawyers are playing , and will continue to play , a key role .
Whether one believes in trial by military commission or in federal court , detainees will have access to counsel .
Guantanamo detainees likewise have access to lawyers for purposes of habeas review , and the reach of that habeas corpus could eventually extend beyond this population .
Good defense counsel is thus key to ensuring that military commissions , federal juries , and federal judges have access to the best arguments and most rigorous factual presentations before making crucial decisions that affect both national security and paramount liberty interests .
To delegitimize the role detainee counsel play is to demand adjudications and policymaking stripped of a full record .
Whatever systems America develops to handle difficult detention questions will rely , at least some of the time , on an aggressive defense bar ; those who take up that function do a service to the system .

Tree branch , even the â€˜last tree in the universe , ' not legal tender at Oklahoma County jail
The Oklahoma County sheriff 's department arrested an Oklahoma City man who broke out a window at the county jail after being told he could n't use a stick to pay for charges to be dropped , a department spokesman said .
Spokesman Mark Myers said Rondell Bailey , 37 , was doing donuts with his truck in a parking lot near the Oklahoma City Civic Center when he hit a trash can , making the truck go high center and get stuck .
Bailey then walked to the Oklahoma County jail , where he walked in with a tree branch he claimed was the last tree in the universe and tried to use the stick to pay for charges to be dropped .
A reserve deputy told Bailey the county did n't accept trees as payment and Bailey walked outside , picked up a landscaping brick and broke a window on the east side of the jail lobby .
Bailey went across the street to the U.S. Marshals office , then back to his truck where he was arrested , Myers said .
Deputies found a baggie containing a white , powdery substance believed to be methamphetamines .
Bailey was taken in on complaints of destruction of property and possession of a controlled and dangerous substance inside a penal institution .
Is the world really that cynical ?
Yes .
Unfortunately it is .

Barack Obama is still struggling to kick smoking , according to his first medical examination since becoming president .
Obama is sensitive about his cigarette habit and tetchy with reporters who raise it .
But after his 90 - minute medical at the Navy hospital outside Washington yesterday morning , his doctors confirmed he had not yet managed to conquer the habit and suggested he " continue smoking cessation efforts " .
The doctors said the president used medication to try to ease the pangs , they described it as " nicotine replacement therapy , self - use " .
Obama promised Michelle when he embarked on his campaign to become president he would quit ; at the time he said he was smoking about eight a day .
He told reporters last year he had quit but still had an occasional cigarette , without specifying how many .
His health was described as excellent and he does not have to return for another medical until 2012 .
Obama , who is 48 , has 20 - 20 vision , weighs 179 llbs in his shoes and clothes , and requires little medication .
Apart from the nicotine replacement , he uses a non-steroid anti-inflammatory medication associated with physical activity : he regularly plays basketball at the White House .
The doctors also recommended " moderation of alcohol intake " .
Welcome to our shop !
England was given an uncomfortable reminder last week of the impact of its swelling number of inhabitants .
Over the past two millennia , hundreds of its native plants and animals have been rendered extinct because the human population has risen from about one million to more than 51 million .
Victims have ranged from the great auk and the lynx to the humble blue stag beetle and Davall 's sedge .
More to the point , 480 of the 492 species made extinct since Roman times have disappeared in the past two centuries .
Rates of eradication are rising , a trend that bodes badly for the future of the countryside , a report states .
Produced by Natural England , the government agency responsible for the countryside , " Lost Life : England 's Lost and Threatened Species " focuses only on wildlife on English soil , although it has broad lessons for all of Britain .
We live on " a fortress built by Nature for herself " , Shakespeare claimed .
If so , she is now paying a heavy price for its construction , as the study makes clear .
According to the report , a total of 24 % of butterfly species and 22 % of amphibians have been wiped out in England , along with individual types of wildlife such as Mitten 's beardless moss ;
York groundsel , a weed only discovered in the 1970s ; and Ivell 's sea anemone , which was last seen in a lagoon near Chichester .
Add to this the wolf , the wildcat and other large mammals and the level of devastation of our wildlife becomes chillingly apparent .
Indeed , the situation is far worse than the one outlined in the study , its lead author Dr Tom Tew , chief scientist of Nature England , admitted last week .
The agency was as conservative and careful as it could in compiling the report , he told the Observer .
" We wanted to avoid accusations of being alarmist . "
As a result , " Lost Life " underestimates , by a fair amount , the numbers of extinctions of animals and plants in England that have taken place in recent years .
" There are many more species that we think we have lost , but we have not included them because they are not officially extinct . "
Examples include the golden eagle and the sturgeon .
Both are occasionally seen in England but no longer breed here .
In addition , the banded mining bee , the brilliant moon beetle and the lichen , Opegrapha paraxanthodes , have also been posted missing , presumed extinct .
The report highlights a number of culprits , though it is emphatic about the worst offender : habitat loss .
The great inroads made into the English countryside by farmers and builders has had a devastating effect on our wildlife , destroying food sources , shelter and homes for hundreds of species .
" Urban spread is one cause of habitat loss , of course , but farming has had the greatest impact by far , " added Dr Tew .
" We have ploughed over the landscape , ripped up woods and drained our wetlands – and rare mosses , damselflies and corncrakes have disappeared as a result . "
Intriguingly , analysis shows extinctions occurred in two main waves , both based on farming revolutions .
Dr Tew explained : " The first wave of extinctions occurred when the Victorians ' post - industrial revolution started to take effect on land management .
We started using steam tractors and devices like that .
In addition , there were large numbers of men still employed as gamekeepers . "
The impact in use of this machinery and intensive landkeeping was a peak of extinctions between 1900 and 1910 , a time when wildlife like the agile and moor frogs as well as the orache moth disappeared .
Then , after 1945 , there was a major push to ensure food security , with the use of chemical fertilisers and pesticides increasing .
Again this triggered a peak in extinctions that included those of plants like the purple spurge and insects like the Norfolk damselfly .
" Other factors are involved , of course – such as pollution and invasion by non-native species , " said Dr Tew .
" However , habitat loss remains the worst offender , although trends are beginning to shift .
Climate change is beginning to have an effect , and by the middle of the century I am sure it will be accounting for the vast majority of future extinctions of English wildlife . "

Kerry Whisnant , Iowa State University physicist , studies the mysteries of the neutrino , the elementary particle that usually passes right through ordinary matter such as baseballs and home - run sluggers .
Kerry Whisnant , St. Louis Cardinals fan , studies the mathematical mysteries of baseball , including a long look at how the distribution of a team 's runs can affect the team 's winning percentage .
Whisnant , a professor of physics and astronomy who scribbles the Cardinals ' roster on a corner of his office chalkboard , is part of baseball 's sabermetrics movement .
He , like other followers of the Society for American Baseball Research , analyzes baseball statistics and tries to discover how all the numbers relate to success on the field .
The results are ideas , analyses , formulas and papers that dig deep into the objective data .
Whisnant recently took up a decades - old formula written by Bill James , the baseball author and statistician who inspired sabermetrics and is a senior adviser for baseball operations for the Boston Red Sox .
The basic formula , which has been tweaked over the years , uses the number of runs scored per game ( RPG ) and runs given up per game to estimate a team 's winning percentage .
Whisnant took that formula a step further by considering run distributions .
What happens , in other words , when you consider how much a team 's run production varies ?
Does it help if a team consistently scores runs ?
Does it hurt if a team scores a lot of runs one day and very few the next ?
And is slugging percentage ( SLG , total bases divided by at bats ) a good measure of that consistency ?
advertisement
Whisnant 's answer , based on a Markov chain analysis that simplifies and simulates an infinite number of baseball games while eliminating the random fluctuations found by analyzing actual data from a finite number of games :
W1/L1 = ( RPG1 / RPG2 ) ^a ( SLG1 / SLG2 ) ^b
where a = 0.723 ( RPG1 + RPG2 ) ^.373 and b = 0.977 ( RPG1 + RPG2 ) ^( -.947 )
" I hated math in school , just write me a very condensed summary Kerry , " a baseball fan wrote to dugoutcentral.com , a Web site for baseball talk and analysis , when Whisnant posted his formula there .
Whisnant 's reply : " Bottom line : More consistent teams ( narrower run distribution ) tend to win more games for the same RPG ( runs per game ) .
Teams with higher SLG ( slugging percentage ) tend to have a narrower run distribution .
Given two teams with the same RPG , a team with a SLG .080 higher will on average win one more game a season .
If their pitching / defense has the same RPG allowed but a SLG allowed .080 lower , that would add another game . "
So there you have it : " The more consistent a team is in scoring runs , game to game , the better the team 's winning percentage for the total number of runs scored , " Whisnant said .
" My study shows that runs alone do n't tell the whole story , " he said .
" Consistency is another factor .
You want to score runs , and you want to be consistent . "
Across an entire 162 - game season , Whisnant said more consistency could mean two additional wins .
And that can be the difference between making the playoffs and calling it quits the first week in October .
Whisnant 's paper explaining the formula was recently named one of four finalists in a contest sponsored by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 's Sloan Sports Analytics Conference in Boston on March 6 .
And while he's at the conference to present his paper , other baseball researchers are telling Whisnant to introduce himself to general managers of Major League Baseball teams .
You never know , maybe the Cardinals are looking for a statistical consultant .
Nothing against neutrinos , Whisnant said , " but it would be a dream job to be a part - time analyst for the Cardinals . "
Some lawyers , economists and religious and civil society leaders have expressed similar views but it is unusual for someone with Professor Yu's official standing to make such direct and detailed criticisms of core Communist Party policies .
Professor
Yu is known as an outspoken insider .
As the director of social issues research at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences ' Institute of Rural Affairs he advises top leaders and conducts surveys on social unrest .
He previously has warned of the rising cost of imposing ' ' rigid stability ' ' by force but has not previously been reported as speaking about such immediate dangers .
'' Some in the so - called democracy movement regard Yu as an agent for the party , because he advises senior leaders on how to maintain their control , '' said Feng Chongyi , associate professor in China Studies at the University of Technology , Sydney .
'' I believe Yu is an independent scholar .
This speech is very significant because it is the first time
Yu has directly confronted the Hu- Wen leadership [ President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao ] and said their policies have failed and will not work . ''
Pointedly , Professor
Yu took aim at the policy substance behind two of Mr Hu's trademark phrases , '' bu zheteng ' ' [ ' ' stability ' ' , or '' do n't rock the boat ' ' ] and ' ' harmonious society ' ' .
His speech was delivered on December 26 , the day after the rights activist Liu Xiaobo was sentenced to 11 years in jail for helping to draft a manifesto for constitutional and democratic government in China , called Charter ' 08 .
The sentence , which shocked liberal intellectuals and international observers , followed a tumultuous year during which the party tightened controls over almost all spheres of China 's burgeoning civil society , including the internet , media , legal profession , non-government organisations and business .
Professor
Yu's speech has not been previously reported but has recently emerged on Chinese websites .
He cited statistics showing the number of recorded incidents of '' mass unrest ' ' grew from 8709 in 1993 to more than 90,000 in each of the past three years .
'' More and more evidence shows that the situation is getting more and more tense , more and more serious , '' Professor Yu said .
He cited a growing range and severity of urban worker disputes and said Mafia groups were increasingly involved in state - sponsored thuggery while disgruntled peasants were directing blame at provincial and even central government .
'' For seeking ' bu zheteng ' we sacrifice reform and people 's rights endowed by law …
Such stability will definitely bring great social disaster , '' he said .
Professor
Yu's speech reflects deep disillusionment among liberal thinkers in China who had hoped Mr Hu and Mr Wen would implement political reforms .
Dr Feng said he still hoped the two would '' do something ' ' to leave more than a ' ' dark stain ' ' on China 's political development before stepping down in 2012 .
'' The conservative forces are currently very strong , '' he said .
China 's security - tightening and potential for future loosening were linked to a leadership succession struggle between Mr Hu and the Vice - Premier , Li Keqiang , on the one hand , and the former president , Jiang Zemin , and the current Vice - President , Xi Jinping , on the other .
'' I have n't given up the hope that the Hu- Li camp may make some positive political changes to mobilise public support .'' .
The latest edition of the newspaper Southern Weekend broke a two - decade taboo by publishing a photo of a youthful Mr Hu with his early mentor , former party chief Hu Yaobang , who was purged in 1987 for his liberal and reformist leanings .
But Chinese internet search results for the names of both leaders were yesterday blocked for '' non - compliance with relevant laws ' ' .
A Beijing political watcher said such crackdowns were being led by officials who had the most to hide , which did not include Mr Hu or his allies .
'' Corrupt officials have such a high and urgent interest in controlling the media and especially the internet , '' he said .
'' The more they feel that their days are numbered due to the internet and free information , the more ferocious and corrupt they become , in a really vicious circle leading to final collapse . ''
Following publication this week of an MSNBC.com report about the record number of American citizens who are now legally licensed to carry guns for personal protection , there should be little mystery remaining about why the gun prohibition lobby has lost so much traction and credibility in recent years .
The American public has realized that everything the gun prohibition message is fundamentally fraudulent .
Anti-gunners repeatedly opposed concealed carry laws with forecasts of Wild West shootouts , widespread mayhem and more homicides .
That has not happened .
Instead , growing interest in personal protection confirms that Americans now understand that everything gun rights groups have been saying for years — that more guns does not equate to increased violence , and actually coincides with a reduction in homicides — is true .
The statistical data is available to back that up , and MSNBC.com senior news editor Mike Stuckey made good use of it in his report .
The story noted that Washington , D.C. — where handguns were banned for a generation — has had the nation ’s highest homicide rate , with more than 20 slayings per 100,000 population .
Conversely , Utah — a state that anti-gun extremists at the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence grade as the worst for their brand of so - called “ gun safety ” — has the lowest homicide rate , at slightly more than 1 per 100,000 .
Recall that the Utah Legislature passed a law to allow concealed carry on college campuses and the state had to force one university to comply with the statute by going to court .
While gun prohibitionists engage in manufactured hysteria against Starbucks Coffee because the chain allows armed customers on its premises so long as they comply with local and state laws , armed citizens — including those who openly carry — are a pretty responsible lot .
They are proving statistically that increased gun ownership does not lead to more violence .
Data from the FBI suggests quite the opposite .
According to MSNBC.com , there has been a 28 percent decline in firearm homicides during the same period that the number of Americans licensed to carry grew from 1 million to an estimated 6 million , and “ shall - issue ” statutes swept the nation .
This drop in the murder rate also came at a time when gun sales across the country have skyrocketed .
During the past four years , background checks for firearms purchases have gone up 55 percent .
Of course , anti-gun - rights extremism epitomized by Chicago Mayor Richard Daley ’s stubborn defense of his city ’s handgun ban now being challenged by the Second Amendment Foundation , Illinois State Rifle Association and four Chicago residents will undoubtedly continue .
If the Supreme Court strikes down Chicago ’s ban as expected , Mayor Daley will be forced to accept the fact that the Windy City is part of the United States , rather than his personal state of denial .
Daley ’s vehement opposition to private handgun ownership exemplifies the demagoguery which the entire gun prohibition movement embraces in its campaign of public disarmament .
The people have wised up .
As a result , anti-gun groups have lost so much momentum that they have been unable to push their agenda even with a Congress controlled by the far left fringe of the Democrat party , and with an anti-gun president in the White House .
Americans are not as gullible as the gun prohibition lobby thought .
The public has seen restrictive gun laws fail .
Gun - free zones have n’t stopped shootings at schools or shopping malls .
Gun bans have n’t prevented soaring murder rates in Washington , D.C. or Chicago , or stopped gang violence in California and elsewhere .
These measures have only given us a body count , and the MSNBC.com report suggests America has had enough .
Alan Gottlieb is founder and executive vice president of the Second Amendment Foundation , and chairman of the Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms .
North Korea walked away from talks on its nuclear programme last year North Korean leader Kim Jong- il has told China he is committed to ridding the Korean peninsula of nuclear weapons , Chinese state media has said .
His comments came during a visit to the North by senior Beijing envoy Wang Jiarui and prior to the arrival of senior UN envoy , Lynn Pascoe .
The diplomats are thought to be trying to restart multi-nation talks with the North on ending its nuclear programme .
Pyongyang pulled out of talks after the UN condemned its testing of missiles .
The BBC's John Sudworth in Seoul says Mr Kim 's statement is broad aspiration , containing no details about how and when the transformation would occur .
But coming amid the flurry of diplomatic activity , it has led to speculation that North Korea may be preparing to return to the talks , our correspondent adds .
Promises Xinhua said Mr Kim had reiterated North Korea 's " persistent stance to realise the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula " in the talks with Mr Wang , head of the Communist Party 's international department .
" The sincerity of relevant parties to resume the six - party talks is very important , " Xinhua quoted Mr Kim as saying .
He said North Korea was willing to strengthen communication and coordination with China .
Mr Wang delivered to Mr Kim a letter from Chinese President Hu Jintao , in which he said Beijing was ready to work with North Korea to maintain peace and stability on the peninsula and invited Mr Kim to visit China , Xinhua added .
Mr Wang was accompanied back to Beijing by the North 's nuclear envoy , Kim Kye- gwan , South Korea 's Yonhap news agency reported .
Citing unidentified diplomatic sources in Beijing , Yonhap said the North Korean envoy 's trip was believed to be aimed at discussing the six - party talks .
Treaty
The visit by Mr Pascoe , the top advisor to UN Secretary General Ban K-moon , marks the most senior UN trip to the North since 2004 .
He will urge North Korea to rejoin the nuclear talks and discuss the country 's relationship with the world body , the Associated Press news agency quoted a UN official in New York as saying .
Talks involving North Korea have a tortured history of stops and starts - formerly held under the six - party format which includes the two Koreas , the US , Russia , China and Japan .
Last weekend , the North released an American missionary detained since Christmas for illegal entry , and on Monday officials from the two Koreas met in a North Korean border town to discuss restarting joint tourist trips suspended in 2008 .
North Korea has made clear it wants sanctions lifted and a peace treaty to formally end the 1950 - 1953 Korean War before returning to the disarmament talks .
Washington has responded that Pyongyang must come back to the talks first before any talk about political and economic concessions .

In July 2005 , a coalition of 171 Palestinian Civil Society organizations created the global BDS movement for “ Boycott , Divestment and Sanctions against Israel Until it Complies with International Law and Universal Principles of Human Rights ” for Occupied Palestinians , Israeli Arabs , and Palestinian diaspora refugees .
Since 1948 , hundreds of UN resolutions and civil society actions condemned Israel ’s lawlessness ; its crimes of war and against humanity ; occupation ; discriminatory policies ; illegal home demolitions , land seizures and settlements ; oppression of a civilian population ; the Separation Wall ; the Gaza siege ; and preemptive imperial wars .
Nothing so far has worked .
Palestine is still occupied .
Its people continue to suffer .
Their human rights are denied .
World leaders ignore them .
This no longer can be tolerated .
In solidarity , people of conscience everywhere must pressure Israel with BDS initiatives that include boycotting Israeli companies , their products and services , and global ones supporting the occupation .
They ’re numerous , many with familiar names .
Below is a partial list , starting with global giants , Israeli companies following .
Others can be added , but use it as a good start along with a New Year ’s resolution to boycott them and encourage others to do it as well .
Motorola
The US Campaign to End the Israeli Occupation “ aim(s ) to change those US policies that both sustain Israel ’s 42 - year occupation of the Palestinian West Bank , Gaza , and East Jerusalem , and deny equal rights for all . ”
It started with a boycott campaign to “ Hang up on Motorola ” and its subsidiary , Motorola Israel , that support the worst of illegal occupation practices .
They produce :
980 Low Altitude Proximity Fuses for the MK - 80 series of high - explosive bombs used against civilian and other non-combatant targets with devastating effect ;
the “ Mountain Rose ” secure cell phone communication system , used exclusively in Occupied Palestine ;
Wide Area Surveillance System ( WAAS ) to monitor and secure the Separation Wall , built on about 12 % of stolen West Bank land ; and
radar detection devices and thermal cameras for dozens of illegal West Bank settlements .
Morotola consumer products are sold globally , including its cell phones , cordless and corded phones , the Droid phone , accessories , cable modems , digital video equipment , and more .
“ Hang up on Motorola ” and get others to do it , too .
Estee Lauder
Board Member Ronald Lauder chairs the Jewish National Fund and is former a JNF president .
In 1901 , the Fifth Zionist Congress established it to “ purchase , take on lease or in exchange , or otherwise acquire any lands , forests , rights of possession and other rights … for the purpose of settling Jews on ( Palestinian ) lands . ”
About 80 % of the land was confiscated , not bought from its rightful owners — expelled Palestinians in Israel ’s “ War of Independence . ”
JNF calls itself “ Caretakers of the land of Israel for over a century ( and ) a global environmental leader by planting 240 million trees , building over 200 reservoirs and dams , developing over 250,000 acres of land , creating more than 1,000 parks , providing infrastructure for over 1,000 communities ( and ) bringing life to the Negev Desert , ” exclusively for Jews on stolen Palestinian lands .
JNF develops land .
It does n’t sell it , but can lease it to Jews or any Jewish - controlled company , organization or entity .
It holds these lands on behalf of “ the Jewish People in perpetuity . ”
Non-Jews are entirely excluded from renting or buying property , getting financing , opening a business , or doing virtually anything on Jewish land under a strict apartheid policy .
JNF policies have been legally challenged , so far without success .
Besides Ronald , other Lauders are also involved – Leonard , Evelyn and William .
The company produces skin care , makeup , fragrance and hair care products that include Clinique , Aramis , Lab Series , Prescriptives and Origins .
Acquired brands include M* A*C , Bobbi Brown , La Mer , Jo Malone , Aveda , Bumble and Bumble , Darphin , and Ojon .
It ’s also the fragrance and beauty products licensee for Kiton , Tommy Hilfiger , Donna Karan , Michael Kors , Sean John , Missoni , Tom Ford , and Mustang .
Other products sold through alternative channels include American Beauty , Flirt ! , good skin , Daisy Fuentes , Coach , and Eyes by Design .
The company is headquartered in New York , with many stores nationally and in Canada operating Estee Lauder “ counters . ”
L’Oreal / Body Shop
The Palestinian BDS National Committee calls L’Oreal “ Makeup for Israeli apartheid , ” and asks consumers globally to boycott “ the products of the French cosmetics giant … due to its deep and extensive involvement in business relations with Israel… . ”
There since the mid-1990s , its L’Oreal Israel subsidiary operates a factory in Migdal Haemek in the Lower Galilee where the Migdal Haemek settlement expelled Palestinian residents , denies their right of return , and expropriated their land for exclusive Jewish use .
L’Oreal Israel makes a line of Natural Sea Beauty products using Dead Sea minerals .
However , one - third of its western shore is in the West Bank , and the entire area and its resources are off limits to Palestinians to let Israel exploit it for mining and international tourism .
In July 2008 , the company also gave a $ 100,000 “ lifetime achievement ” award to an Israeli Weizmann Institute scientist , a research center that clandestinely develops nuclear , chemical , and biological weapons for the IDF war machine .
In addition , L’Oreal Israel ’s chairman , Gad Propper , is the founding chairman of the Israel - EU Chamber of Commerce , and was heavily involved in promoting trade with Australia and New Zealand .
Since the mid-1990s , Israel has been L’Oreal ’s regional commercial center .
Its brands include Maybelline , Lancome , Matrix , Redken , Vichy / Dermablend , and Helena Rubinstein .
It also owns the Body Shop , a company reputed to be socially conscious , except when it comes to Palestine .
Intel
The technology giant produces computer processors and other hardware components employing thousands of Israelis .
It ’s been one of Israel ’s major supporters since opening its first development center outside America in Haifa in 1974 .
Ever since , it ’s heavily invested in the country and operates an annual billion dollar export business .
It has a microprocessor plant in Har Hotzvim , Jerusalem , another development center there as well , a plant in Lachish - Qiryat Gat , a branch for the development of network communications products in Omer , close to Beersheba , as well as other operations .
Its Qiryat Gat plant lies on Iraq al Manshiya village land where 2,000 Palestinians were expelled to construct the illegal settlement that replaced it .
Al - Awda ( the Palestinian Right to Return Coalition ) urges legal action against Intel for using it .
Intel Israel also supports apartheid education , saying the company :
“ promot ( es ) … higher education ( through ) scholarships for ( Israeli ) students ( and ) allocates considerable resources to funding research and purchasing laboratory equipment . ”
The company disdains Palestinian rights by supporting Israeli apartheid , lawlessness , and repressive policies .
McDonald’s
It ’s the world ’s largest fast food retailer , operating in about 120 countries globally , including in Israel since 1993 , with about 150 restaurants and a policy of firing Arab workers caught speaking Arabic .
McDonald ’s is also a major partner of the Jewish United Fund ( JUF ) and Jewish Federation .
Through its Israel Commission , JUF “ works to maintain American military , economic and diplomatic support for Israel ; monitors and , when necessary , responds to media coverage of Israel . ”
JUF is also a major fundraiser , and , through its “ Partnership to Israel ” program , contributes large sums annually to further illegal settlement development on occupied Palestinian land .
Coca - Cola
The company is the world ’s largest soft drink maker , with numerous brands sold virtually everywhere globally .
Since the mid-1960s , it ’s been been a staunch Israel supporter , and in 1997 , the country ’s Chamber of Commerce and Economic Mission praised its chairman , Roberto Goizueta , for 30 years of support and for refusing to honor an Arab boycott at the expense of lost regional business .
In 2002 , Coca - Cola announced plans to build a Kiryat Gat plant on stolen Palestinian land , and in 2005 , raised its investment in the Israeli - based Tavor Winery to 51 % .
In 2002 , the company also helped fund a pro-Israel propaganda lecture by National Public Radio ’s Linda Gradstein , claimed to be unbiased .
Disney
The company ’s Florida Epcot Center Millennium exhibition depicts occupied Jerusalem as Israel ’s capital , a joint effort by Tel Aviv and Disney to Judaize the city preparatory to legitimizing Israel ’s claim .
Israel ’s Foreign Ministry , in charge of the exhibit , says it highlights the city ’s importance to Muslims , Christians and Jews alike , but a formal statement asserts :
There is no doubt that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel ( and ) the position of Jerusalem as the key component to the Israeli pavilion … speaks for itself without a clearer or stronger statement being necessary .
Of the exhibit ’s $ 8 million cost , Israel paid less than one - fourth , Disney the rest .
Home Depot
As the world ’s largest home improvement retailer , it ’s second only to Wal - Mart in total retail sales .
Its founder and former chairman , Bernard Marcus , actively supports Israel , including through the Marcus Foundation promoting Jewish issues .
IBM
The company invests heavily in Israel , and according to former executive , Lawrence Ricciardi , “ This wedge of land and the huge ideals it represents are very important to IBM . ”
In June 2001 , the American - Israel Friendship League praised the company and two others at its Partners for Democracy Award dinner .
In May 2002 , the Israel - America Chamber of Commerce gave IBM the Ambassador ’s Award “ in recognition of its outstanding contribution to the development of the Israeli high - tech industry and ( for ) advancing trade between the US and Israel . ”
IBM began its regional operations in 1949 and was the first large US company with a wholly owned Israeli subsidiary .
Its Haifa Research Laboratories employs over 2,000 people doing extensive research cooperatively with the US - based operations .
For decades , it ’s also been involved with Israeli start - ups and venture capital funds .
Revlon
Billionaire Ronald Perelman controls the company , a major producer of cosmetics , skin care , fragrance and personal care products .
He also supports Israeli causes , and is a trustee of the Simon Wiesenthal Center , the notorious pro-Israel front group with over 300,000 global members and support from prominent figures like himself , George W. Bush , Barack Obama , Senator Charles Schumer , Hillary Rodham Clinton , and many others .
Starbucks
Chairman Howard Shultz is staunchly pro-Israel .
In 1998 , the Jerusalem Fund of Aish HaTorah gave him “ The Israel 50th Anniversary Friend of Zion Tribute Award ” for “ playing a key role in promoting a close alliance between the United States and Israel . ”
In 2002 , Israel ’s Foreign Ministry praised him for being key to the country ’s long - term PR success , through his provocative speeches accusing Palestinians of terrorism , calling intifada resistance anti-semitism , asking Americans to back Israel against a common enemy , and sponsoring fund raisers for Israeli causes .
Jointly with the Israeli - based Delek Group , Starbucks Coffee International operated a joint venture in Israel , opened six stores , then shut them after heavy losses .
The Limited
The company is a major retailer with five specialty brands , including Express , The Limited , Lane Bryant , Lerner New York and Structure as well as the major ownership of Intimate Brands .
Its founder and CEO , Leslie Wexner , is a board member of the pro-Israeli Emet News Service , and through his Wexner Foundation promotes “ strengthening Jewish Leadership in North America and Israel . ”
One of its initiatives finances up to 10 Israeli officials at Harvard annually for a year - long Master in Public Administration program ( MPA ) combined with intensive leadership development .
Many alumni return home to high ministerial positions and similar IDF ones .
Wexner also sponsors “ Birthright Israel ” that brings young American Jews to the country for intensive indoctrination .
He supports Hillel , Israel ’s bastion on college campuses , and in April 2003 , a leaked Wexler commissioned Luntz Research document revealed Israel ’s propaganda strategy following the Iraq war .
The report titled , “ Wexler Analysis : Israeli Communications Priorities 2003 ” had 11 key recommendations “ on behalf of Israel … in a post - Saddam world . ”
It called Saddam Hussein “ two of the most hated words in the English language ” and the ones ( tying ) Israel to America … .
The day we allow Saddam to take his eventual place in the trash heap of history is the day we lose our strongest weapon in the linguistic defense of Israel . ”
Replacing him are Al Qaeda , Hamas , Hezbollah , and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ’s Iranian government as designated “ terrorists , ” propagandized against to portray Israel as surrounded and threatened by hordes of hostile Muslims bent on its destruction , when , in fact , the Jewish state is the main regional threat .
The Luntz report also called the illegal settlements Israel ’s “ Achilles heel ” against which there ’s no good defense .
Wexner is one of its best .
News Corporation
It ’s the Rupert Murdoch - owned media giant that includes dozens of print publications , motion pictures , book publishing , and Fox News , what Fairness & Accuracy in Reporting ( FAIR ) calls “ the most biased name in news … with its extraordinary right - wing tilt ” that includes one - sided Israeli support , and no wonder .
Murdoch invests heavily in Israel and was one of three US companies the American - Israel Friendship League honored for their support at their June 2001 Partners for Democracy Awards dinner .
Murdoch , in fact , co-chaired the dinner , was a close friend of Ariel Sharon , calls himself a lifelong ally of Israel , and shows it through one - sided reporting allowing no wiggle room for staff deviation .

Ahava promises “ Beauty Secrets from the Dead Sea . ”
And wait until you hear those secrets !
Because Ahava is hiding the ugly truth — its products actually come from stolen Palestinian natural resources … .
Do n’t let the ‘ Made in Israel ’ sticker fool you — when you buy Avaha products you help finance the destruction of hope for a peaceful and just future for both Israelis and Palestinians .
Avaha uses Palestinian resources without their permission and pays no compensation for them .
In addition , Israel denies Palestinians access to the West Bank portion of the Dead Sea so companies like Avaha can exploit it .
Dorot Garlic and Herbs
Established in 1992 in Kibbutz Dorot , the company is now Israel ’s largest frozen seasonings supplier to food retainers , hotels , and restaurants in America , Canada and Europe .
The Strauss Group and Its Subsidiaries
Israel ’s second largest food and beverage company supports the Golani reconnaissance platoon , infamous for its decades of slaughtering Palestinians , most recently during Operation Cast Lead .
In the “ corporate responsibility ” section of its website , a sub- heading titled “ In the Field With Soldiers ” states :
“ Our connection with soldiers goes as far back as the country , and even further .
We see a mission and need to continue to provide our soldiers with support , to enhance their quality of life and service conditions , and sweeten their special moments … at the front to spoil them with our best products , ” including Max Brenner Chocolates — another brand to boycott because the company backs Israel ’s killing machine .
Sabra is another Strauss company in a joint venture with Pepsico .
It produces traditional Arab salads like hummus , baba ghanoush , and fried eggplant .
Agrexco
The company is half Israeli state - owned , exporting fresh fruits , vegetables , and herbs from Israel and the Occupied Territories , operating under the Carmel , Jaffa and Coral brands .
In the West Bank , Agrexco exploits Palestinian workers , including children , paying sub - poverty wages , no benefits , no sick or holiday pay , no rights , and no union .
Hadiklaim
The Israeli Date Growers ’ Cooperative sells 65 % of all Israeli and West Bank settlement - produced dates under the brand names King Solomon and Jordan River .
They also supply supermarkets and retail chains that market them under their own private brands .
Customers include UK - based Marks & Spencer , Sainsbury , Tesco and Waitrose .
Harvesting dates is hard work and why Israelis use cheap Palestinian labor for it — preferably children who are small , agile , work for less , and are easier to cheat .
The job entails days beginning at 5 AM , being hoisted atop date palm trees up to 12 meters , left there for up to eight hours with no break and no way down until mechanically returned at day ’s end .
Workers cling to trees with one arm , using the other for their quota , with no break , and if they complain or fall behind , they ’re fired .
Agrexco and Hadiklaim harvest and sell most dates produced in Israel or on illegal West Bank settlements , including brands mislabeled “ West Bank . ”
Gush Shalom ’s BDS Support
Translated from Hebrew , Gush Shalom means “ The Peace Bloc ” — hard core , especially in times of crisis .
Opposing the occupation , it supports an independent Palestine “ in all the territories occupied by Israel in 1967 ” with East Jerusalem its capital and diaspora refugees free to return or be justly compensated for lost land and property .
In July 2006 , it listed settlement - made products / factories to be boycotted , headed by the comment that “ A penny to the settlements is a penny against peace . ”

To paraphrase Chicago community organizer Saul Alinsky , the way to beat organized oppression is with organized boycotts against Israeli companies and global corporate giants allied with its government ’s war machine .
It ’s a democratic non-violent weapon of the powerless against the powerful , the tactic Gandhi preferred .
It fights fire with activism .
It ’s how South Africa ’s apartheid was beaten , and it can end decades of Israeli lawlessness the same way , bring peace and reconciliation , and give Palestinians their long - denied rights in their own state or together with Jews equally in one land , the way it should be in any just nation .

Employees at a government agency in Cleveland which processes President Barack Obama 's paycheck risk losing their jobs because they have failed credit report checks , according to Troy Marshall , a union leader at the Cleveland office of Defense Finance and Accounting Service ( DFAS ) .
He says tighter security clearance rules introduced by the Pentagon five years ago have cost 25 DFAS Cleveland workers their jobs and threaten another 42 .
The rules are unfair , he says , because these employees do n't handle classified information and are struggling to dig out of debt due to the economic crisis .
Tough Economy to Blame
" We 've had people who have tried to get their debt consolidated [… ] but in this economy you can't get loans , " says Marshall , who also works as a management assistant at DFAS and who claims he was suspended after 17 years because of $ 6,000 he owes on credit card and hospital bills .
Marshall says he has diabetes and heart disease ; his wife has leukemia .
" Cleveland is a very depressed area , it 's not like you can get another job , " he says .
Tom LaRock , a DFAS spokesman , said he could not immediately comment on particular employees .
But he confirmed that DFAS Cleveland processes Obama 's paycheck and that DFAS staff must have their credit checked as part of a wider background screening they must pass in order to stay employed .
The Department of Defense , which oversees DFAS , has conducted background checks for decades , but it was only in 2005 that DFAS ' entire staff fell into the " sensitive " clearance category and became subject to comprehensive background checks .
" All DFAS positions are considered sensitive because our employees have access to privacy act information such as names , social security numbers and bank account numbers , " says LaRock , explaining that DFAS ' main task is to pay military personnel and contractors .
Everyone at DFAS , including himself , submits to a background check that covers everything from U.S. allegiance to drug use .
" The credit check is just a portion of it . "
Marshall , however , argues that DFAS is making decisions based simply on the credit score .
He says workers who failed the credit portion began receiving termination letters in 2007 , and since then , 25 have been either fired or forced into early retirement .
Another 20 have been suspended , and the rest are waiting for their fate to be decided , he says .
The White House would not comment .
Lawmakers Angry
Rep. Dennis Kucinich , D - Ohio , slammed DFAS ' reported actions and says he will call for Congressional hearings to investigate .
" This thing is nonsense because you can't punish people for having bad credit , " he told ABC News.com .
" DFAS is being very tough on their humble employees while at the same time the people on Wall Street who committed financial misdeeds [ … ] are getting bonuses . "
Rep. Marcia Fudge , D - Ohio , says she has written to DFAS ' Washington - based director , Teresa McKay , demanding answers .
A New Trend
" Clearly we want to make sure that people who work in sensitive positions have clearances , but to say that someone is a risk to national security solely because of their credit is a stretch , " she told ABC News.com .
Like Fudge , Marshall says he's not opposed to credit checks in principal , but says he believes the government should take an employees ' performance and work history into account instead of relying just on a credit score .
He points out that all his performance reviews were marked " exceptional " or " highly satisfactory . "
Credit scores , which have dropped for many Americans since the start of the economic crisis two years ago , have been causing a lot of trouble recently .
As credit markets have clamped up , consumers with poor credit who would have once easily qualified for new loans are finding it difficult to keep up with their bills .
Many have been forced into foreclosure or bankruptcy , especially if they also lost income after falling ill or losing a job .
In addition , homeowners are discovering to their dismay that enrolling in the government 's loan modification program can cost them up to 100 points of their credit score .
Despite these pressures , and admissions by some employers that their workers have little control over their credit score during a recession , employee credit checks are becoming more popular .
Private companies , for example , are increasingly looking into candidates ' credit histories , trying to gain insights into their character .
Karen
Terry , a customer service representative at DFAS who was suspended last summer , says she does n't understand why the agency wo n't help her pay off her debt instead of threatening her with termination .
" We want the same privileges they give enlisted military members : let us set up an allotment and take it out of our paycheck to pay our debt , " says Terry , a mother of four .
She claims the Pentagon told her she was suspended after discovering a $ 6500 debt and a history of missed tax payments .
" We 're trying to deal with every day challenges , to keep a roof over our head and put food on the table . "
A woman who found her boyfriend masturbating over pornography was so outraged at what she called his “ cheating ” that she beat and stabbed him , resulting in his hospitalisation and her arrest .
The couple , residents of La Crosse in the state of Wisconsin , came to blows when the 23 - year - old woman returned to her home to discover her 24 - year - old boyfriend engaged in a bout of onanism , aided by some pornography .
She flew into a rage , accusing him of being a “ fucking cheater ” , or words to that effect , and attacked , punching him several times and kicking him in the groin .
Unsatisfied , she persisted in her rage , forcing him into the kitchen .
She there grabbed a knife , slashed his arms and finally stabbed him in the abdomen , and ignoring all efforts by him to remonstrate with her , instead telling him to leave .
The man was fortunately not severely injured , and managed to drive himself to hospital , where he was treated and soon discharged .
The berserk girlfriend seems to have gotten off lightly – she was charged with “ disorderly conduct while armed , ” and “ recklessly endangering safety , ” with stabbing someone in the stomach apparently not warranting charges of attempted murder .
We do not hear whether there was anything exceptional about the pornography in question , though it is claimed the man was doing some unspecified chatting over the Internet as well .
Via Heaven .
At least she did not cut off his penis , or worse …

Barack Obama won the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize
The internet is among a record 237 individuals and organisations nominated for this year 's Nobel Peace Prize .
The number of nominations surpasses last year 's record of 205 nominations .
The internet 's nomination has been championed by the Italian version of Wired magazine for helping advance " dialogue , debate and consensus " .
The director of the Nobel Institute , Geir Lundestad , told BBC News that the organisation had received " thousands of nominations " for the coveted prize .
" Some were nominated by one person , others by 10 , others by 100 , " he said .
The secretive organisation does not release the list of nominees , but nominators sometimes announce their choices .
The nomination for the internet is supported by 2003 Nobel Peace Prize winner Shirin Ebadi and the founder of the $ 100 laptop project Nicholas Negroponte .
Nominations can be put forward by former laureates , members of national governments and select university professors , among others .
Others on the shortlist are thought to include Russian human rights activist Svetlana Gannushkina and Chinese activist Liu Xiaobo .
The final list was decided by the Norwegian Nobel Committee - which has responsibility for the Peace Prize - at its first meeting of the year on 9 March , where the five - member panel was able to add its own nominations .
" The announcement of this year 's laureate will be made on the 8 October , " Mr Lundestad said .
" The prize amount is very likely be the same as in recent years . "
Last year 's 10 m Swedish kronor ( $ 1.4 m ) prize was awarded to US President Barack Obama .
It is unclear who would accept the prize if the internet were to win .
Internet for Peace , set up to help support the nomination of the internet , says the prize would be " a Nobel for each and every one of us " .
Chapter II
On the Birth of Love
Here is what happens in one ’s soul :
1. Admiration .
2 . You say to yourself , ‘ What a pleasure it would be to kiss her and be kissed by her ! ’ etc .
3. Hope .
You study her perfections and it is at that moment that a woman should give herself to you for the greatest possible pleasure .
Even with the most reserved women their eyes redden at the moment of hope ; passion is at its height and their pleasure is so alive that they visibly betray themselves .
4 . Love is born .
To love is to take pleasure in seeing , touching , experiencing with all your senses , and being as close as possible to the loveable object , which loves you back .
5 . The first crystallisation begins .
You take pleasure in embellishing the lady of whose love you are sure with a thousand perfections .
You look at all her happiness with an infinite feeling of contentment .
You end up by wildly exaggerating her qualities and look upon her as an angel fallen from Heaven .
While you do not yet know her you feel sure that you will soon possess her .
Allow the mind of a lover to reflect alone for twenty - four hours and here is what you will find :
At the Salzburg salt mines in the winter they throw a bare branch from a leafless tree into the abandoned depths of the mines .
When they return two or three months later they find that the branch is now adorned with sparkling crystals .
The smallest twig , no bigger than a tit ’s claw , is now covered with an infinite number of dazzling diamonds .
The branch first thrown in the mine is no longer recognizable .
This is what I call crystallisation .
It ’s the mental process by which everything is taken as yet further evidence of the loved one ’s perfections .
A traveller speaks of the cool respite from the hot summer days afforded by the orange groves by the sea at Genoa and you think only of sharing the experience with her .
One of your friends breaks his arm while out hunting and you think of what it would be like to be treated by the one you love .
To be with her always and to see her constant love would almost make the pain heavenly .
And from the broken arm of your friend comes more proof on the angelic virtue of your mistress .
In a word , no sooner is a perfection identified than it is attributed to the woman you love .
This phenomenon , that I have taken the liberty of naming crystallisation comes from Nature , which commands us to experience pleasure , and which sends the blood to our head .
It comes also from the feeling that the pleasure increases with each new perfection of the loved one , and from the idea that she is mine .
The savage does not have time to go beyond the first stage .
He experiences pleasure but all activity in his brain is occupied with the task of following the deer fleeing him in the forest .
For its meat will allow him to replenish his forces so he will not to fall under his enemy ’s axe .
At the other extremity of civilisation , I do not doubt that a tender lady can come to this point – and only find physical pleasure with the man whom she loves .
[ 1]
This is in contrast to the savage , but in civilized countries the lady has leisure whereas the savage is so occupied with survival that he is forced to treat his female as a beast of burden .
If the female animal is more content then it is because the male ’s ability to get food is more assured .
But let us leave the forests and get back to Paris .
A man in love sees all perfections in the one he loves and yet his attention can still be distracted because the soul soon tires of the same thing , even perfect happiness . [ 2 ]
Here is what appears to fix the attention :
6 . Doubt is born .
After ten or twelve glances , or any other series of actions , that may last a second or several days , have first given and then satisfied hope , the lover recovers from his initial amazement and growing accustomed to his happiness , or guided by the opinion that , always based on frequency of experience , one must only give one ’s attention to easy women , the lover , I say , asks for more positive assurances and wishes to drive his happiness home .
He finds that he may encounter indifference , [ 3 ] coldness or even anger if he shows himself to be too bold .
In France this is a touch of irony , which seems to say : “ You think yourself closer to my heart than you really are ! ”
A lady behaves in this way either because she awakes from a moment of intoxication to hear the voice of modesty , which she trembles at the thought of having disobeyed , or simply in the name of prudence or coquetry .
The lover comes to doubt the happiness that he had promised himself and becomes cynical of the reasons for hoping that he thought were there .
He decides to occupy himself with the other pleasures life has to offer but he finds these have lost all their attraction .
The fear of an awful misery seizes him and he thinks hard .
7. Second crystallisation .
And so begins the second crystallisation and its diamonds are the affirmations such as this :
She loves me .
Every quarter of an hour in the night , when doubts begin , after a moment of awful misery , the lover says to himself : “ Yes , she loves me ” , and the crystallisation recommences to be adorned with new attractions .
But tired - eyed the lover ’s doubts interrupt the process .
His lungs forget to breathe and he asks himself : “ But does she love me ? ”
And in the middle of all this delicious and dreadful questioning the poor man feels this : “ She ’s the only one is the world who can make me truly happy . ”
The truth is now clear and it is a path on the very edge of this awful precipice in reach of the most perfect happiness .
It is this that makes the second crystallisation so much better than the first .
The lover ’s mind endlessly shifts between the following three ideas :
1 . She is perfect in every way .
2 . She loves me .
3 . What can I do to win from her the clearest possible proof of her love ?
The most awful moment of a love still in its early stages is when the lover realizes that he has made an mistake and he is obliged to destroy a whole layer of crystallisation .
You start to doubt the whole process of crystallisation itself .
NOTES
[ 1 ]
If this characteristic is not present in man it is for the reason that he has no modesty to sacrifice .
[ 2 ]
This means that existence presents man with only a few moments of perfect happiness whereas the way in which he displays his passion changes ten times a day .
[ 3 ]
That which the novels of the seventeenth century call the stroke of lightening and which decides the destiny of the hero and his mistress is an impulse of the heart which actually occurs in real life where one can offer no defensive manoeuvre , although this effect has been spoilt by a never ending number of scribblers going over doing it .
The woman in love finds too much happiness in the way she feels to make such pretence impossible and , tired of being prudent , she forgets all caution and gives herself blindly to the delights of love .
Distrust makes the stroke of lightening impossible .

Improving Factor 's error messages
For all its amazing features , Factor has awful error reporting .
This is probably because reporting good error messages is not as sexy as performance tuning or writing new libraries , but nonetheless , error reporting is a huge , important part of a development environment 's user experience .
Just look at all the excitement over Clang giving better error messages than GCC .
Factor 's still a ways away from correcting spelling errors , but I did spend some time improving its error reporting in two particularly deficient areas : its reporting of syntax errors , and its handling of stack management errors .
The nerdy details are below ; the gist is : if you 've tried Factor before and given up on it because of its opaque error messages , now's a great time to give it another shot .
Or if you 've stuck with Factor despite its Gen - X apathy toward invalid code , enjoy the monkey that just got pulled off your back .
Syntax errors
Factor 's lexer keeps track of where in the source the next token should be read .
When a syntax error occurs , the lexer adds this pointer to the reported error message :
5 : swa pappend ; ^
No word named ``swa '' found in current vocabulary search path
This works well when syntax errors are detected and raised immediately after being read from the lexer .
However , Factor has extensible syntax , and many poorly written syntax handlers would undiscerningly read in their entire form , not verifying for correctness until a subsequent pass .
You used to get a lot of this :
12 : ) ; ^ “ intt ” is not a C type
leaving you to open the source code in your editor and search for " intt " to find where the problem actually was .
Going through and fixing these syntax handlers to parse and verify their input as it comes from the lexer lets the error messages give much better immediate feedback :
10 : intt bar , ^ “ intt ” is not a C type
There are some syntax errors that can't be detected and reported so immediately .
Though Factor does n't suffer much syntax that requires backtracking , it poorly handles missing closing tokens .
With its free - love approach to syntax , you can't really know for sure that your " } " or " ; " is n't just around the corner until you hit the end of the file you 're parsing .
For example , trying to parse this :
{ 1 2 3 } { 4 5 6 { 7 8 9 }
gives a pretty worthless error message :
4 : ^ Expected } but got end of input
The missing brace might be obvious in this case , but in a giant haystack of differently sized and punctuated definitions , finding where the needle needs to go could take a while .
Now , when an syntax error occurs , it displays the location of the innermost active syntax word in addition to the location the error was raised :
2 : { 4 5 6 4 : ^ Expected ; but got end of input
That makes it immediately clear which literal is incomplete .
The added context benefits other syntax error messages too :
4 : : foo ( x y -- z ) 5 : swa pappend ; ^
No word named ``swa '' found in current vocabulary search path
8 : FUNCTION : int foo ( 10 : intt bar , ^ “ intt ” is not a C type
Stack logic errors
Factor enforces much stricter stack discipline than many of its RPN kin : functions must take a declared number of inputs , yield a declared number of outputs , and when using " if " statements and loops , must keep the stack balanced among their branches .
The compiler will shun any function definition that rejects these tenets :
( scratchpad ) : derp ( -- ) 2 ; : errors - show 1 compiler errors ( scratchpad ) : errors Asset : derp Stack effect declaration is wrong inferred ( ( -- x ) ) declared (( -- ) ) ( scratchpad ) : derp ( ? -- x ) [ 2 ] [ ] if ; : errors - show 1 compiler errors ( scratchpad ) : errors Asset : derp Unbalanced branches [ 2 ] ( ( x -- x ) ) [ ] (( x -- ))
These error messages are fairly self - explanatory .
The problem comes when using higher - order functions .
The compiler inlines most common control flow functions ( such as map and reduce ) so that it can optimize them down to simple loops .
As it verifies a function 's stack usage , the compiler descends into the definitions of these inlined functions .
When it encounters a stack imbalance , it often ends up reporting the error from the perspective of whatever deeply nested inlined function it happened to have been walking through , leaving no breadcrumb trail back to your own code that caused it :
( scratchpad ) : derp ( x -- ) [ 2drop ] each ; : errors - show 1 compiler errors ( scratchpad ) : errors Asset : derp
The recursive function ( each - integer ) digs arbitrarily deep into the stack ( scratchpad ) : derp ( x -- ) [ drop ] [ drop ] if * ; : errors - show 1 compiler errors ( scratchpad ) : errors Asset : derp Unbalanced branches [ drop call ] ( x -- ) [ nip call ] ( x x -- )
The compiler could just as well have done away with the pretense of context and reported " ERROR " .
In a longer function definition , finding the one jenga tile knocking down the stack pretty much required single - stepping the code .
C++ suffers a similar problem with template expansion : too little verification of input parameters is done up front , and error reporting is postponed until the last minute when something goes undeniably wrong .
Just like the Boost library introduced a Concept Check library to enforce up - front constraints on C++ template parameters , the solution to Factor 's stack checking error problem is to have higher - order functions declare the expected stack effects of their input functions , and have the compiler enforce these effects .
The resulting error messages are much clearer and more useful :
( scratchpad ) : derp ( x -- ) [ 2drop ] each ; : errors - show 1 compiler errors ( scratchpad ) : errors Asset : derp
The input quotations to each do n't match their expected effects Input Expected Got [ 2drop ] (( ... x -- ... ) ) (( x x -- ) ) ( scratchpad ) : derp ( x -- ) [ drop ] [ drop ] if * ; : errors - show 1 compiler errors ( scratchpad ) : errors Asset : derp
The input quotations to if * do n't match their expected effects Input Expected Got [ drop ] ( ( ..a ? -- ..b ) ) (( x -- ) ) [ drop ] (( ..a -- ..b ) ) (( x -- ) ) : errors - show 1 compiler errors
Inlined higher - order functions are allowed a bit more leeway in how much stack they use and leave behind , as long as they leave the stack balanced across any loops or branches they set up .
( This allows for things like " reduce " being implemented in terms of " each " , by taking its accumulator as an extra input and leaving the updated value as an extra output . )
The " ... " , " ..a " , and " ..b " in those " Expected " columns are " row variables " that represent a number of values taken as inputs or outputs that has to be consistent among the stack effects using the same variable name .
Read the Factor help article about them for the details .
Don Meyer , the all - time leader in coaching wins in NCAA men's basketball history , will retire from coaching after the end of this season , Northern State University announced Monday morning .
Meyer , 65 , has accumulated 922 career victories in 38 seasons , while coaching at Hamline University in Minnesota , at David Lipscomb in Tennessee , and at Northern State , in Aberdeen , S.D. He was honored last July at the ESPYS with the Jimmy V. Perseverance Award .
Meyer will remain on staff at Northern State , helping to promote the school through public speaking and fundraising activities .
On Sept. 5 , 2008 , Meyer was leading a caravan of players on a team retreat and fell asleep at the wheel , and was involved in a head - on collision with a truck hauling 60,000 pounds of corn .
The accident was nearly fatal and eventually cost Meyer much of his left leg .
And on the night of his accident , the surgeon who worked to save his life discovered that Meyer had carcinoid cancer , a slow - growing form of the disease .
" After consulting with our physicians and meeting with my family , we have determined that I no longer posses the necessary physical or mental energy to continue administering the NSU basketball program at its highest possible level , " Meyer said in a statement released by the school .
" It is time for someone with more energy and time available to deal with the unique challenges of a basketball program like Northern State . "
Meyer has worked relentlessly at coaching , to the point where his three children , now all grown , assumed that his last moments would be in a practice or on the sidelines during a game .
But the trials of another coach crystallized for Meyer the thought that perhaps it was time for him to step down .
Meyer used a wheelchair to coach on the sidelines last season , and after getting a prosthetic leg during the summer , he has moved with the help of a cane .
However , he had been frustrated with the fact that he could not do more hands - on teaching .
Meyer wished he could get out on the floor and work with players directly , physically demonstrating a correction in their technique .
The schedule of long road trips within the Dakotas had been grueling for him .
As Don Meyer visited family in Nashville over the Christmas holiday , Florida football coach Urban Meyer -- no relation to Don Meyer -- announced that he was taking a leave of absence from his job , citing exhaustion .
For Don Meyer , this news changed his perspective .
If Urban Meyer -- more than 20 years younger than Don Meyer , and not beset by cancer -- was worn down , then of course coaching was bound to take a toll on Don Meyer .
A few days later , Don Meyer rose at 3:30 a.m. to write his resignation letter .
Beyond his record of success , Meyer also has deeply influenced the game as a mentor to high school , college and professional coaches , through his clinics and his instructional videos .
Among those : Tennessee 's Pat Summitt , the all - time NCAA leader in victories in women 's basketball .
" He taught me how to teach others how to play the game , " Summitt said in an interview last year .
" When I started coaching at Tennessee , I was 22 years old .
I had four players 21 that were seniors .
And I never coached a day in my life .
So did Coach Meyer help me ?
Tremendously . "
Meyer 's last home game will be on Feb. 27 .

Microsoft Windows is n’t restricted to just laptops and tower PCs :
It is also common for Windows to serve as the dominant operating system these days inside of ATMs , cars , vending machines , kiosks , taxi meters , medical imaging devices , advertising display boards and so many of the computerized screens that we gaze upon and take for granted every day .
That is , until they stop working .
Indeed , often the first indication that these things are run by Windows is when something causes them to crash , at which point the all - too - familiar Windows error messages or dreaded Blue Screen of Death ( BSoD ) splashes up on the device ’s display .
True , malicious software can cause BSoDs , which is the operating system ’s way of shutting down to prevent irreparable damage to the underlying system .
Just as often , however , a BSoD or critical stop error is the result of some kind of hardware malfunction , such as faulty memory , a failing power supply , or overheating .
It seems I ’ve been seeing these BSoDs and “ fatal error ” type messages in the oddest places lately .
Below is a gallery of just a few that I ’ve shot recently with my trusty iPhone ( aside from that last three , which came from friends and readers ) .
Click one of the images to cycle through a slideshow .
I do n’t know why I find these so fascinating , but it seems I ’m not alone , as there are quite a few repositories for these types of pictures .
For some reason ( probably because the displays overheat from being always - on ) , airports are a very common place to see BSoDs .
There several Web sites dedicated to Windows BSoDs and error messages in bizarre places .
Check out Miguel Carrasco‘s Top 10 BSoDs .
Flickr has an impressive collection of error pics tagged “ BSoD ” .
One of the largest examples of a very public BSoD came during the opening ceremonies at the 2008 Summer Olympics in China , when one of the massive LCD screens overhead suddenly went blue .
Surely , some of you readers have snapped your own photos of BSoDs or error messages in unexpected places .
If so , shoot them to me at krebsonsecurity at gmail dot com , and I may include them in this post .
Please do n’t send photos you do n’t want posted , and most especially only send me pics that are original and that you have the rights to publish .

The unincorporated village of Floral , Saskatchewan , has a fame in the hockey world wholly incommensurate with its tiny size .
It is of course the birthplace of Gordie Howe , greatest player of his day - " day " being loosely defined as a third of a century ! - and honoured member of the Extremely Short List of Greatest Hockeyists of All Time .
Floral now has a second claim to fame .
Simply by being in its place at the right time , it inspired one of the greatest hockey books it has been my pleasure to read .
In the mid-90s Newfoundland - based poet Randall Maggs was conducting a book tour through western Canada which took him on the road to Floral .
( Or should I say , the road through Floral . )
Just seeing the name " Floral , Saskatchewan " on its best - known building , a grain elevator older than Gordie Howe himself , transported Randy to a different time and place , a time when hockey was central to his life .
The seed that was planted that day took some time to sprout , but eventually flowered into a magnificent book , Night Work : The Sawchuk Poems .
As the title implies , the subject of Night Work is not Gordie Howe himself but his Detroit Red Wings teammate , Terry Sawchuk , the talented , troubled ' tender who is still ranked by many as the greatest goalie of all time .
Undeniably he was at the forefront of his own time , the so - called Golden Era of Goatending ( roughly , 1950 - 67 ) , emerging from that era with NHL records for games played , wins , and shutouts that each stood for decades .
Renowned for both his brilliance and his darkness , " Ukey " would become the perfect subject for an in - depth character study that was as long in the making as his records were in the breaking .
While Terry Sawchuk dominated the NHL in the early 1950s , Randy Maggs and his brother Darryl were growing up with their own dreams of hockey fame in Sawchuk 's home city of Winnipeg , skating on the same rinks that " Ukey " had skated ( scraped ? ) on .
Darryl would go on to play in the NHL , while Randy wound up in the Hockey Hall of Fame !
That was the setting when Night Work : The Sawchuk Poems was launched two years ago , there with the plaques of Sawchuk , Howe , and countless other greats of the age whom the Sawchuk poems recognize and remember with honesty and dignity .
There with the greatest prize they had all dreamed of and battled for , the Stanley Cup .
I have personally installed Night Work on my nightside table on the " to - be- reread " pile with Peter Gzowski's The Game of Our Lives , Scott Young 's The Leafs I Knew , Ken Dryden 's The Game , and Andrew Podnieks ' Portraits Of The Game : Classic Photographs From The Turofsky Collection At The Hockey Hall Of Fame .
Each is an enduring classic .
Having serendipitously initiated contact with the publisher , we at the Copper & Blue pressed our luck and requested an interview with the author .
We wound up with an interview and a half !
Randy responded to our questions graciously and loquaciously , his remarks as insightful as they were delightful .
( Now you know why I am not a poet . )
Read on following the jump for hockey - soaked reflections of the past and of today , of the game 's place in society and its role in ending the Cold War , of the motivations of men who play hockey and those who write poetry .
Two of the poems mentioned in the interview , " Guys like Pete Goegan " and " Different Ways of Telling Time " , can be found in this post ; I could n't resist adding a third at the very bottom , " One of You " , Ken Dryden 's favourite which speaks eloquently to the singular craft of goaltending .
Randall Maggs tours western Canada next week , giving readings from his award - winning book , Night Work : The Sawchuk Poems in Edmonton , Yellowknife , Whitehorse and Vancouver ( details here ) .
Stay tuned to the Copper & Blue for a chance to win a signed copy of the book .
Copper & Blue :
Why hockey ?
Why poetry ?
Why hockey poetry ?
Randall Maggs :
Why hockey -- why not ?
When I think back to my childhood and youth , I think about winters mainly and being at the rinks from morning until night .
In the writing of this book , though I was not consciously dealing with this at the time , I was looking at landscape and climate and how they shaped our natures , our lives and values .
The book has a strong cultural focus obviously though that kind of emerged unconsciously .
When you look at the subject matter of the poems , other than the 1967 section , there ’s not much that deals with game action .
I ’m looking at the people and the age as much as anything really and the game provides a pretty good way of getting at these .
When you think about games and their reflection of cultural values , this is probably not surprising .
Hockey is a marvel really .
Anyone who watched that last game when Canada and the US battled it out for 67 minutes knows this .
That ’s probably the game of my lifetime , the dramatic way it worked out , the fact that the Olympics were in Canada , Vancouver my hometown , Canucks my team , Luongo ’s past difficulties , etc .
A great moment for me in these Olympics .
. . when Luongo and Demitra paused with each other in the handshaking at the end -- Demitra having missed that open net at in the last minute of the Canada - Slovak game -- and that big delighted sympathetic grin on Luongo ’s face .
My own strong belief is that hockey played an important part in helping to end the Cold War .
People stopped paying attention to the government bullshit .
The Russian people came to know Orr and Gretzky .
We came to know Tretiak and Kharlamov and were saddened at Kharlamov ’s death in a car accident .
We did n’t want to fight the Russians , other than on the ice .
There will always be people who do n’t care about sport , fair enough .
But there ’s so much they do n’t see .
And so much they miss .
When I began working hockey into my writing , I was a long way from thinking about a book of poems about Terry Sawchuk .
" The Season of Wayward Thinking , " the oldest poem in the book , has nothing to do with Sawchuk and little to do with hockey really .
The game provided me with a metaphor to explore the difference between Western Canada , the world that I 'd grown up in and Newfoundland , the world that I was living in at the time .
What seems to have caught the interest of the media with this book was the mix of hockey and poetry .
To a lot of people they seemed incompatible .
These are just two aspects of life that have given me great pleasure .
In my view , you can write poetry about any subject , plums in the fridge , a wagon out on the lawn , if you find the right way to do it .
I do n't think I could write a good poem myself about goal scorers ( though I know one young poet who certainly can ) ; my interest was in defenders .
I find defenders more interesting psychologically , more subtle and complex , more aware of themselves .
I know there were people who had little interest in the poetry in Night Work because the subject was hockey , and others who were sports - minded but had little interest in the hockey because it was dealt with in a book of poems .
I 've been up against that kind of thing all my life .
Seemed I had my arts friends and my athletic friends , for the most part , two different crowds .
Sad , really .
The day before the launch at the Hockey Hall of Fame , I was interviewed on both Prime Time Sports and Classical FM 96.3 .
I got a kick out of that .
And I did discover there were a lot of readers who did enjoy both poetry and hockey , or were sufficiently open - minded to give the book a chance .
That was really uplifting .
By far , the best part of my experience with this book has been meeting so many people who appeared willing to venture into unfamiliar territory .
One woman who invited me to read in Nanaimo had to ask her husband what the blue line was .
She enjoyed the book primarily for its poetry but , in the process of her reading , became interested in the game as well .
One male on - line reviewer of hockey books mentioned that , because he knew nothing about poetry , he kept the book by his bedside and managed only to read a poem or two a night .
But still , for him , it was the " hockey book of the year . "
Copper & Blue : Why Terry Sawchuk ?
Randall Maggs : I played my minor hockey in Winnipeg , where he grew up and played himself .
My Silver Heights team played Elmwood and East Kildonan , his former teams , on the the same North End rinks as he'd once played on .
When I was playing midget and juvenile in Winnipeg , he was having those first five great years in Detroit .
With Gordie and Delvecchio , Kelly , Lindsay and Pronovost .
Terry had been the one player more than any other who had fascinated me .
There were plenty of players in the old NHL from Winnipeg but there was something always special about him .
I 'd always liked goalies .
I liked the gear .
Sawchuk -- that name just had all the magic of the game in it .
In my head I could hear it spoken by Danny Gallivan .
Foster Hewitt as well .
And both of them speaking with a kind of wonder and disbelief at what he could do in the Detroit net .
He was a great big - game goalie and then of course there was always the irony of his living the great Canadian dream and really being miserable and something of a tragic figure almost from the beginning .
Then things began to deteriorate for him and that was always a mystery to us .
The trade to Boston and all the fuss over the so - called breakdown .
And more and more there was the talk of how difficult he could be and how much a loner he'd become .
I was never able to reconcile that with my early idea of what he was like .
Finally in 1970 , the terrible and never satisfactorily explained death .
By then , though , expansion had arrived and I was n't watching much .
1967 had marked the end of my watching .
In the mid-90s , a reading tour through Saskatchewan brought me back to the prairie for the first time in many years and got me thinking about my growing up in that part of the world , in places like Claresholm , Vermilion and Winnipeg .
Driving into Saskatoon for a reading , we passed a small town with two elevators and not many more houses , and the name up on those elevators , Floral , really jolted me .
Floral was Gordie Howe 's birthplace , and everyone would have known that back in the days of the Six Team League .
Suddenly I was transported back to that time and that world .
Copper & Blue :
You mention many figures from the game 's " dark side " , for example Doug Harvey who is a frequent character in Night Work .
What drew you to explore this aspect of the game , and of humanity ?
Randall Maggs :
As I mentioned above , it was the dark side of Sawchuk that puzzled me because that was not my earlier sense of him .
I wanted to understand how that developed and that led me to looking at what it was like to play goal in his day .
That ’s why this book ended up being about all the great goalies of perhaps the greatest age of goaltending , Hall , Worsley , Plante , and Bower as well as Sawchuk .
To a lesser extent I ’m looking at all defenders , who seem to me much more complex in nature than offensive players .
They have much more responsibility and a much subtler role than offensive players .
Who gets the blame when the team loses ?
But what goalies were up against in that day was astounding .
And yet they were so good that they revolutionized the game , not just goaltending but offensive play .
Scorers had to develop new techniques to beat them , the slap shot and intentional deflection , for example .
Defensemen became more offensive .
Running the goalies became more prominent .
And in that transition period , the goalies had such poor equipment and coaching .
I bring in not just Harvey but [ Eric ]
Nesterenko because they also had battles with alcohol .
Harvey did n’t fare any better than Terry with the problem but Harvey was essentially different in that he sought out friends .
Remember that he left the coaching job in NY because he could n’t get anyone to go for a drink with him .
At least that ’s the story .
When he was working with Indianapolis he had his buddies from Newfoundland as drinking companions .
That story of the sweaters he gave them is a true story .
My brother was in Indianapolis at the time .
The story is that Harvey did die alone .
If that ’s true , that makes his tragedy even greater .
Nesterenko is included because of his common heritage with Terry as well as his common problem .
But he seems to have found a way to deal with it .
He was very receptive to my visiting him but would n’t talk about the game or the old days at all .
I thought for a while I 'd pretty much wasted my time travelling into the mountains to see him .
But I realized later that he had told me much more than I realized at the time .
Copper & Blue : I saw your brother Darryl play a number of games with various WHA teams over the years .
What role did Darryl play in offering insights , anecdotes , and connections ?
Randall Maggs :
You probably saw him play more than I did .
My brother was the key to the book .
I know hockey from my own years of playing the game .
I 'm still at it though not as quick and steady as I think I once was .
What I did n't know was the professional game .
That 's what he was able to provide for me .
My brother is quiet , very observant and in possession of a great and very dry sense of humour .
He 's acutely sensitive to the absurd .
All of this very helpful .
His mark is all over the book and he's got a copy on the bar of The Crystola roadhouse which he owns in Colorado .
The poem " Guys Like Pete Goegan " comes directly from one of his stories .
I also got the Harvey material from him .
He and I met up last month and drove from the Ute Pass just outside of Colorado Springs up through the mountains to Park City ; my daughter Adriana had a feature film being screened at Robert Redford 's Sundance Festival .
A brilliant young actress from Saskatchewan in the film , Tatiana Maslavy , won the Breakout Actor Award .
That was pretty special .
Copper & Blue : Many famous hockey names appear in the acknowledgements ; to name but one dozen of several , Johnny Bower , Ken Dryden , Red Fisher , Emile Francis , Glenn Hall , Bobby Hull , Dick Irvin , Red Kelly , Ted Lindsay , Dickie Moore , Red Storey , Gump Worsley .
Many of them make an appearance in the poems themselves .
How many of those individuals did you have the opportunity to interview personally ?
Randall Maggs :
All of them .
I talked to pretty much everyone I acknowledged in that list , either in person or on the phone .
Hull was the only exception that I can think of .
He and my brother were pretty good friends -- that 's why Darryl jumped to the WHA after an unforgettable year in Oakland with the Golden Seals .
About a year or two they ran into one another in Vail and stood outside and talked for several hours .
A few of the stories dealing with Hull came from that conversation as Darryl had mentioned the book to him and Bobby talked a lot about Sawchuk and especially that 67 series .
As for my travels to conduct interviews , I was everywhere from Vancouver to Vail to Lewisport NL .
Johnny Bower was a great help to me and I talked to him on several occasions .
Ralph Backstrom helped me make contact with several people .
Bill
White is a good friend of my brother and very good to me as well .
Dryden would give me practice passes to get into Maple Leaf Gardens and sent me to the National Research Centre where he had done his research for The Game .
Dryden 's favourite poem ( I 'm told by Leanne Ryan of CBC Gander ) is " One of You . "
Red Storey was wonderful to me .
None of the hockey people with the exception of Red Storey and maybe Bill White can tell stories like the Newfoundland guys I talked to however .
Copper & Blue :
Any particularly memorable personal encounters during your research ?
Randall Maggs : Lost it with Butch Bouchard , the big tough defenseman , captain of the Canadians in the early fifties who saw Sawchuk in his prime .
I just became a fan .
He was so impressive , so dignified and intelligent .
I watched two periods of a game in the bowels of that dreadful new arena the Canadians play in now .
Three stories down .
The large painting of Richard with the burning eyes staring out at us from the wall was impressive though .
Butch had brought a writer from La Presse along with him because he was insecure about his English .
No need of it though .
His English was fine .
Told me among other things that Ted Lindsay once tried to get between him and the boards .
" He only tried that one time , " Butch said .
Talking to Glenn
Hall out your way was also pretty impressive .
Copper & Blue :
Your work speaks in many voices and several different poetic styles .
How tricky was it to weave the many threads together into a coherent whole ?
Randall Maggs :
The different voices came naturally to the works as much of what wrote was based on stories and interviews .
So I was hearing those voices in my head as I thought about the subject .
And I thought and wrote about Terry ’s story over a period of ten years so those different voices got pretty familiar .
Often as in Red Storey ’s case , I ’d try to get behind their words so I was presenting what I thought that they were thinking as well as saying .
Then the narrator plays a part in some of the poems as the circumstances of the interviews as with Bergman and Nesterenko for example seemed relevant to me .
I did n’t worry too much about pulling this all together .
I knew I was n’t going to come up with any easy answer about why Terry was the way he was -- there were so many factors , the game , his position , his nature , his family situation -- his brother ’s death , his mothers withdrawal for example -- his growing up in a poor part of the city , being an immigrant in a not - very - tolerant period in this country ’s history . . .
Given all these contributing factors I thought a linear and orderly structure was n’t appropriate .
Most of the poems were written as individual pieces , each dealing with a particular incident or story or idea .
Sometimes one poem would open up into two or three etc .
I had no structure firmly in mind , was not really troubling myself to think of this aspect of the book , as I was working when I could grab some time on the individual pieces .
I was doing a lot of research as I was writing , reading and travelling and interviewing people as well as recalling my own experience and my brother 's stories of his experiences .
I first came up with the idea of focussing the attention on Terry 's complex nature using the Red Storey pieces which centre on the question Terry once asked him and which he could understand and never forget .
What I had was a mountain of information from many sources , and voices in my head that I 'd been hearing over the years of my research .
Getting closer to the end , I considered several different ways to organize this .
Then Phil Pritchard , vice president of the Hockey Hall of Fame and my good friend after ten years of working at the Hall , gave me the police report and Terry 's autopsy .
The passage on the scars on his face , even more , the cold clinical language that conveyed that information , jumped out at me .
I saw how I wanted to use that as a preface and then tell the human story behind that cold clinical report , but tell that story making use of all the different voices .
I knew I would never have any definitive answer , did n't want one really , so I would create a kind of collage of information and let the readers take away what they would .
I also began with a linear structure following the two Storey poems which make up the preface ; but when I hit " A Clever Dog " , the poem that looks at the upcoming meeting between Terry and Jack Adams , I break off that pattern intentionally .
What appears from there on is perhaps less orderly in appearance , which reflects what happened in Terry 's own life as a result of Jack Adams 's handling of him .
From then on there are sections more or less grouped together having little regard for any orderly historical unfolding of time .
Copper & Blue : Speaking of the Hockey Hall of Fame , what a thrill it must have been for you to launch your book in such an environment , with all the plaques and the Stanley Cup right there !
It seems as though Night Work has been well - received from the beginning , and continues to be today judging by its most recent recognition earlier this month with the Kobzar Literary Award .
Randall Maggs :
Thank you .
Anne , my wife , and I had a great time at the Gala .
For me , the experience was a kind of rediscovery of an important part of my western upbringing .
I had played with and against so many Ukrainian kids , not that we thought much about that in those days .
But my defence partner for several years was Paul Nedlec and the guy that always gave us fits was Peter Stemkowski , who went on to play with the Leafs and who appears as Sawchuk 's one friend in his Toronto days .
We had a pretty good team in Silver Heights ( west end of Winnipeg ) , Provincial Champions one year , and always close .
The president of the Shevchenko Foundation , which is based in Winnipeg , is Andrew Hladyshevsky , who is a lawyer practising in Edmonton .
Great guy , still playing hockey himself .
I 'll be seeing him some time over my two days in the city .
The most moving thing at the Kobzar gala was the number of people who came to tell me they loved the poems most that went into Terry 's mind and thoughts .
That was pretty affirming considering that these were Ukrainian people telling me this .
One always has doubts and fears about the validity of this kind of writing .
Copper & Blue : A key section of your book describes the Boston Bruins ' tour of Newfoundland in 1956 .
As a native Newfoundlander I found a whole lot of value - added " down home " references in this segment and enjoyed it immensely .
As a Newfoundland resident yourself , what sort of special joy did you take in researching and writing this segment ?
Randall Maggs :
That 's the section that people seem to most enjoy right across the country .
You can imagine the fun I had with it .
The character who scored on Terry , " Gerald , " I went looking for and found him up in the cottages in Lewisporte .
That entire section is pretty historical , including Gerry Regan 's participation ( ex- premier of NS and scouted my brother in junior ) and the Bay Roberts poem .
I 'm still looking for the photograph of Terry with the umbrella !
Copper & Blue : Another section of Night Work that I , childhood goalie , greatly enjoyed was the Goaltender Suite , featuring many of the game 's zanier characters : Frank " Ulcers " McCool , who skated off the ice during Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals for a drink of milk to settle his stomach and had to be convinced to return .
Wilf Cude , who threw a gameday steak at his wife and retired in the heartbeat between it hitting the wall and the floor .
Steve Buzinski " The Puck Goes Inski " ; Plante and his mask , the gregarious " Gump " Worsley , Sawchuk himself .
Do you agree with the old saw , " you do n't have to be crazy to be a goalie , but it helps " ?
Randall Maggs : Yep .
I played goal one year of Pee Wee hockey .
I loved the gear and I was a first baseman so I could catch the puck .
But one year was enough .
Goalies understand irony .
What 's more ironic than zero being the best you can do .
What I found out , though , was that goalies ( and to a lesser extent defenders generally ) are more generally complex individuals than offensive players and hence more interesting as subjects for poetry ( and probably art generally ) .
Like catchers in baseball .
Look at the epigraph ( Torborg 's line -- brilliant ) to the section you 're referring to .
[ " There must be some reason we 're the only ones facing the other way " -- Jeff Torborg , in Thomas Boswell 's Why Time Begins on Opening Day ]
Called Worsley and told him I was working on a book about goalies from his period , Sawchuk , Hall , himself , Bower and Plante .
He said , " you 're going to have a hell of a time talking to Plante . "
Copper & Blue :
When you first conceived this project , what one word first ran through your mind when you hear the name " Sawchuk " ?
Now that you 've published the book , what word runs through your head when you hear the name ?
Randall Maggs : Now I think " courage . "
Back then I guess I would have to say " conspiracy . "
I was wrong as it turns out .
Copper & Blue : I read early versions of several of the Sawchuk poems in the Spring 2005 edition of The New Quarterly : Canadian Writers & Writing , " Hockey Write in Canada " issue ( Jamie Fitzpatrick , Editor ) .
Each of the four poems changed a - little - to - a - lot over the three years before the publication of Night Work .
Comparing the versions gave me a small sense of the enormous labour of love this work must have been .
Noting your previous poetry work , Timely Departures , was published way back in 1994 leads me to ask how many years , how many hours , and how many rewrites went into Night Work : The Sawchuk Poems ?
Randall Maggs : Labour of love , you 've got that right .
Enjoyed it from beginning to end .
I could have gone on forever .
I expect I was intending to .
It was my friend and editor , Stan Dragland , who saved me .
He reached a point as I was rewriting and rewriting and adding new material , wanting to fix the rhythm in this line or chop a stanza in that poem where he finally said " the book is done .
Leave it alone . "
I guess I was getting pretty compulsive .
What I was up to I 'm not quite sure but there was a sense of obligation of some sort .
Copper & Blue :
Of all the poems in Night Work , my personal favourite may well have been " Different Ways of Telling Time " .
Turned out that " last minute of play " from that suite was the poem that set the stage for not just the last section but the very last line of the whole book , an infinitely satisfying punch line that I will leave for the reader to discover .
From a writer 's perspective , I 'm interested to know at what stage did you know you had captured the book 's concluding thought , and that you were gradually working towards that specific " finish line " ?
Randall Maggs : I often read " ice time " from this poem just to show how poetry can do something that fiction cannot in giving you a better concrete sense of a subject , and can generate more emotion in a reader .
I often read it at the beginning of a reading if I 'm feeling nervous as my own nervous energy transfers into the lines conveying Terry 's own nervousness .
You did read this book carefully .
I 'm impressed .
And a little humbled .
I certainly was n't working consciously toward that line .
I was carrying the whole in my head though , all the voices and images .
And that was one of the last poems I worked on .
The story about the Newfoundlanders came from Darryl from his Indianapolis days ( like that story about the move he put on Doug Harvey ? )
The line " Let the goalie go first , " and the way to end the poem just came to me .
I do n't want to be overly mystical but it was just there .
That 's why I say humbled .
I 'm not being falsely modest here .
It seems the best things in this book came to me from God knows where .
That 's the beauty of art maybe .
A CANBERRA woman has given a tearful account of how the Church of Scientology allegedly coerced her to have two abortions , as a fresh attempt was being made for a Senate inquiry into the organisation .
Senator Nick Xenophon 's effort to get an Upper House inquiry into the tax - free status of religious groups , including Scientology , failed last week , when both Labor and the Coalition voted against it .
The Senate will tomorrow vote on an inquiry with revised terms - looking at alleged abuse in the church , and whether criminal , consumer protection and occupational health and safety laws are adequate to deal with its practices .
It will not examine Scientology 's beliefs , following concerns an inquiry would impinge on religious freedom .
Senator Xenophon believes his bid could be successful .
" I 'm confident that my colleagues are thinking more deeply than they did a week ago , " he said today .
His efforts were backed by former Scientologist Janette Lang , who spoke out for the first time about her ordeal with the church .
Ms Lang says she was a Scientologist for 13 years , after falling pregnant at age 20 to a man who had recently been recruited to the organisation .
Her boyfriend 's Scientologist bosses coerced them into terminating the pregnancy , she alleged .
" We fought for a week , I was devastated , I felt abused , I was lost and eventually I gave in , " she said , fighting back tears .
" It was my baby , my body and my choice , and all of that was taken away from me by Scientology . "
The pair married and had two daughters , but Ms Lang 's husband was sent to the US to train as a spiritual counsellor .
" While he was over there , I was forbidden to contact him , " she said .
" After a year , we agreed to a divorce . "
As a full - time employee of the church , Ms Lang alleges she earned $ 2000 a year and was sometimes forced to work until 2 am , with her two daughters asleep in the office .
After her divorce , she fell pregnant to another Scientologist and the church threatened her with excommunication if she did n't have another abortion .
" My children would not be able to see their father , I would not be able to see my sister and I was told I would get cancer and die , " she said .
" ( Prime Minister ) Kevin Rudd and ( Opposition Leader ) Tony Abbott : please do n't let us suffer in silence . "
The Church of Scientology rejected Ms Lang 's claims , saying it did " not condone nor force anyone to undertake any medical procedure whatsoever " .
Church spokeswoman Virginia Stewart questioned why Ms Lang was making the allegations at a press conference : " These are serious claims and rightly should be reported to the police immediately .
We would cooperate fully with any investigation of persons allegedly involved . "
The allegations of coerced abortions , separation from family members and workplace law breaches by the Church of Scientology echo others that have been aired in recent weeks .
Canberra couple James and Liz Anderson , whose story was featured on the ABC's Four Corners program , also fronted reporters today .
The couple is seeking meetings with both Mr Rudd and Mr Abbott ahead of the Senate vote .
They and other former Scientologists plan to make themselves available to parliamentarians outside Parliament House tomorrow .
Update : May 2012 - A letter from the Church of Scientology
On 17 March 2010 , you ran a story entitled Scientologists forced me to have two abortions , ex-disciple says , reporting allegations made against the Church of Scientology by SA Senator Nick Xenophon and a former Church member , Janette Lang ( nee Vonthethorff ) .
The Federal Police conducted a thorough investigation into these allegations and concluded there was no evidence to back them .
The AFP has discontinued its investigation .
I ask that your organisation now place on file the corrected information to ensure this falsehood is never repeated
The facts are :
* Senator Xenophon declared in the Senate ( Hansard , March 18 , 2010 ) that the Church of Scientology forced former Church volunteer , Ms Janette Lang ( nee Vonthethorff ) to have two abortions against her will .
* This was categorically denied by the Church .
The Church provided evidence to the Senate Privileges Committee as part of documentation concerning numerous false statements uttered by the Senator .
We also responded to media questions .
* It should be noted that the Senator made no attempt at any time to verify this damaging and false accusation before putting it on the public record and to the national media , including your organisation .
* The Australian Federal Police ( AFP ) subsequently investigated the matter and concluded the investigation .
The official findings of December 9 , 2010 , stated :
“ Over the past few months , continued investigation has been unable to progress this matter further .
“ Of note , no criminal offences have been identified , all reasonable lines of enquiry have been exhausted and it is recommended that the investigation be finalized . ”
Please see the attached document obtained from the AFP under Freedom of Information .
* Additionally , after the AFP investigation was completed , Senator Xenophon failed to correct the Parliamentary record and rescind his unverified accusation .
* This was a very serious accusation and deserved a correction at least when it was found to be untrue .
The Senator ’s Chief of Staff was dealing directly with Ms Lang and was aware of the conclusion of the investigation .
It is not Church policy nor practise to counsel expectant mothers or any of its staff on what to do with their own bodies and it does not advise on any medical procedures , including abortions .
This is between an individual and their doctor .
Indeed , at no time was the Church even aware that Ms Lang was pregnant .
Ms Lang only advised members of the Church of her abortions after the event .
Pertinent to this issue , she has three children and two of her children were born while she was a religious volunteer with the Church of Scientology .
Like many parishioners of any religion , Ms Lang has made her own personal choices and acted of her own free will independent of her religion and her Church .

Some rape victims would n’t have been raped if they had dressed properly , according to some religious nuts handing out pamphlets in Virginia .
So basically if you dress like a tramp , you ’re asking for it — and leading good men away from Godliness by giving them impure thoughts .
Sexual assault program directors say they deal with this mentality all the time .
However , it ’s usually not printed and distributed in this way .
People of all ages are victimized by rape , not just the young and pretty who dress to impress .
The pamphlet that was handed to 19 - year - old Keshia Canter read , in part :
Image Source
“ You may have been given this leaflet because of the way you are dressed , ”  it begins .
“ Have you thought about standing before the true and living God to be judged ? ” 
At the time , Canter was wearing boots , jeans and a pink zebra shirt with a black jacket zipped up over it .
The woman who handed her the paper told her that even though she was n’t showing skin , her clothing made men want to be sinful .
The pamphlet goes on to blame rape victims and insult men by basically saying they have no self control or choice in whether to rape , it ’s all in the tempting — done by the woman .
We ’d love to talk to the group who created this religious pamphlet , but the thing is signed “ anonymous ” .

Toby Keith is talking about his patriotic anthem ' Courtesy of the Red , White and Blue ( The Angry American ) ' on an upcoming FOX News special hosted by Sarah Palin , but his appearance on the TV show appears to be news to the singer himself .
" Toby was not asked to participate nor has he ever done an interview with Sarah Palin , " the superstar 's publicist tells PopEater .
Footage of Toby talking about the song was taped back in 2008 , as was an interview with actor / hip - hop star LL Cool J who expressed his surprise to his Twitter followers , saying , " Fox lifted an old interview I gave ... to someone else and are misrepresenting to the public in order to promote Sarah Palin 's show . "
FOX has since announced it will remove the LL Cool J [ real name : James Todd Smith ] segment from Palin 's program , which is titled ' Real American Stories . '
The network writes in a snarky letter to TV Newser , " As it appears that Mr. Smith does not want to be associated with a program that could serve as an inspiration to others , we are cutting his interview from the special and wish him the best with his fledgling acting career . "
' Real American Stories , ' which according to the Los Angeles Times will spotlight " real - life tales of overcoming adversity , " debuts this Thursday ( April 1 ) on FOX News .

Sunderland boss Steve Bruce has backed hat - trick hero Darren Bent to make England 's World Cup squad .
Hat - trick makes striker third - top scorer in Premier League
Relieved
Sunderland boss Steve Bruce has backed hat - trick hero Darren Bent to make Fabio Capello 's World Cup squad this summer .
Bent grabbed a second - half hat - trick on Tuesday night as Sunderland won for the first time in 14 Premier League games with a 4 - 0 win over Bolton .
It took the former Tottenham striker 's tally to 18 in the league this term , with only Manchester United forward Wayne Rooney ahead of him as the highest - scoring Englishman .
Capello has been unconvinced by his credentials thus far , but Bruce believes it is time the Italian sat up and took notice of his star striker , who has been carrying the Black Cats with his goals .
" It 's a magnification return and he must be knocking on the door , " Bruce told Sky Sports .
" When you consider the position we are in - 18 goals in the bottom half of the table is quite magnificent .
" I 'm sure there is still a lot more he can add before the end of the season and that will give him that chance of playing in the World Cup .
" A goalscorer is a goalscorer .
For me , we have n't got many ( English ones ) in the Premier League .
" We look at ( Jermaine ) Defoe , who is a natural goal - scorer and of course ( Wayne ) Rooney .
But after that you think ' who is the most natural goalscorer ' .
" He 's ( Bent ) always got goals in the Premier League and , for me , he deserves his chance .
" Bruce appeared relieved at having ended the long sequence without a win , which has seen a promising season turn sour over the past three months .
The former Wigan boss insists his side had to up their game to overturn their fortunes and praised Fraizer Campbell 's 41 - second opener for setting the tone of the match .
" You need something like that to give everybody a huge lift , " said Bruce .
" I was delighted with Fraizer .
I 've asked him to play in a different position to what he 's used to and he 'll get better at it and that will do him the world of good .
" When a little bit of luck deserts you we need a performance and a victory to give everybody that lift and that little bit of confidence .
" As you could see towards the end , everybody wanted the ball , everybody wanted to take part in it .
Last week we could n't get anybody to take part .
" That 's what happens but we 'll certainly learn from it .
It 's been a tough time but , thankfully , we 've got a result tonight . "
Bruce never appeared to be under pressure from the Sunderland faithful during the lean spell , but he admits it was difficult to stay positive during the 14 games without victory .
" The one thing you have to do in management is keep at it and stay positive , which is very difficult to do when you have n't had a win in three months .
" But you learn from it and you get experience from it and I do n't want it to happen again , but the support from everyone has been great "
She hated doing that & was on the verge of tears
U.S. Rep. Betsy Markey , a Democrat from Fort Collins , was one of 39 Democrats who voted against the House health reform bill .
She has also positioned herself as a conservative Democrat by joining the Blue Dog coalition .
But the freshman lawmaker , who won a traditionally Republican seat from Marilyn Musgrave in 2008 , is vulnerable , independent pollster Floyd Ciruli said .
" Betsy is obviously in trouble , " Ciruli said .
" Just on the ground there is a Republican majority ; now you add to it that there are independents going against incumbent Democrats , and Republicans are extremely invigorated . "
Markey has earned a reputation for voting against her party when she feels it is the right thing to do , said her campaign spokesman , Ben Marter .
" She is going to continue to represent her district , not rethink the entire campaign because of what people in Massachusetts said yesterday . "
“ I read the interview and what I see in my friend Kurt Schrader is a desperate attempt at self - rationalization , ” said Rep. Scott Bruun , who has served in the Oregon House of Representatives since 2004 .
“ Kurt is a good man , I admired him when he was in the Oregon Legislature .
I would still call him a friend , although I ’m not sure he would think the same of me .
The Kurt I knew in the Oregon Legislature was independent and since he has gone to Washington has been in lock step with Nancy Pelosi and the DNC . ”
Bruun announced in October he will be running for Schrader ’s seat , that is if he can make it past the May Republican primary , where he faces Fred Thompson of Salem .
Thompson agreed with Bruun ’s characterization of Schrader .
“ Kurt Schrader has voted more than 98 - percent of the time with Nancy Pelosi , ” Thompson said .
“ That ’s wrong , because she is not right 98 percent of the time .
We do n’t need San Francisco politics here in Oregon .
This is Oregon .
Blue Dogs -- most of whom have voted more frequently with the GOP than with the Democrats this past year ( at least on substantive issues ) are heading for the hills .
One of the worst , Alabama multimillionaire and reactionary , Parker Griffith , first voted with the GOP approximately 85 % of the time , then announced he would vote against Nancy Pelosi for Speaker next year and finally made the jump into the Republican cesspool .
Other are just retiring , Arkansas ' Marion Berry being the latest .
When you hear talk about Democrats losing seats in November , the most likely losers are actually not real Democrats at all ; they 're Blue Dogs who vote with the GOP .
But conventional wisdom is so skewered rightward Inside the Beltway that contrary to all good sense , the Blue Dogs have actually picked up four recent converts : Betsy Markey ( CO ) , Mike Arcuri ( NY ) , Scott Murphy ( NY ) and Kurt Schrader ( OR ) .
Unlike her batshitcrazy predecessor , the universally loathed Marilyn Musgrave , everybody likes freshman Democrat Betsy Markey of Fort Collins .
Just the other day one of her admiring colleagues described her to me as having been " on the verge of tears " when Hoyer and Van Hollen told her they had the votes they need to pass healthcare reform and that she should vote against it .
And she did , poor thing .
Since getting into Congress one year ago , Markey has voted -- on substantive matters ( so not on naming post offices or voting to honor girl scout cookies ) -- about 41 % with the Democrats and 59 % with the Republicans .
This is how Hoyer and Van Hollen think a Representative from a Republican - leaning district ( PVI is R+9 ) should vote .
She beat Musgrove 187,347 ( 56 % ) to 146,028 ( 44 % ) but Insiders do n't seem think that means voters in CO - 04 were looking for change so they have positioned Markey as a Republican - lite agent of non-change .
And it is n't working .
I called Marter this morning to ask him what made his boss decide to join the Blue Dog caucus and in the hopes that he could explain to me how it is she felt voting against healthcare -- regardless of the verge of tears stuff -- was " the right thing to do . "
He did n't call back .
Progressives always call back .
Republicans never call back .
Blue Dogs ... sometimes .
I also called Josh Schwerin , the communications director for freshman Scott Murphy , another newly minted Blue Dog .
I noticed that he googled my name , checked outand then did call back .
Murphy won the special election for the 20th congressional district -- the one Gillibrand represented -- that went for Obama and that is safer for Democrats than Markey's .
Yet only half a dozen Democrats voted more frequently with the GOP on substantive issues than Murphy -- characters like Travis Childers ( Blue Dog - MS ) , Gene Taylor ( Blue Dog - MS ) , Bobby Bright ( Blue Dog - AL ) , Dan Boren ( Blue Dog - OK ) and Charlie Melancon ( Blue Dog - LA ) .
Murphy could n't join the Old Confederacy so instead he joined the Blue Dogs .
He 's voted with Boehner more than 75 % of the time -- although he does vote with the Democrats on naming post offices .
He has the worst voting record in the House for any Democrat not in a " Strong " or " Leaning " Republican district .
( Oh , and I do n't want to get Josh in any trouble for calling me back ; no need to worry : he did n't answer any questions . )
Neither Mike Arcuri's comm director nor and Kurt Schrader 's bothered calling back .
I guess Arcuri feels that the help he got from Blue America when he first ran has been amply paid back through the constant barrage of automated , canned , saccharine e-mails soliciting donations .
Schrader 's office , apparently is just too busy fighting off the GOP charges that he's " changed " and become too much of a Democrat .
On substantive issues , Schrader has voted with his own party 53 % of the time , 47 % with the obstructionist Republicans but two the two crazy wingnuts running against him , that 's just short of communism .
It 's also untrue .
Where does Thompson come up with the 98 % figure ?
Did he just pull it out of his ass ?
Well , possibly , but more likely he got it from the NRCC , which is telling all their candidates to say that about their opponents .
So 53 % of substantive matters becomes 98 %-- even though if you countSchrader voted on since he was elected , post office naming , girl scout cookies and all , he voted with the Democrats 91 % of the time .
But now that he 's joined the Blue Dogs , we can probably expect his scores to veer drastically right anyway .
I doubt he has the capacity to effectively defend himself in the reralm of ideas from this Republican calumny .
Oh , and the deadline for filing for the Oregon primary is March 9 .
If you follow Blue America , you probably know that we 've already found some solid progressives who we 're trying to help in races against Blue Dogs and other reactionaries .

And now , ladies and gentlemen , right here on our stage , a fine and terrifyingly hilarious -- or is that hilariously terrifying ?
-- spectacle , for your disquieting reading pleasure .
Please , remove the children .
Ready ?
Behold , an item known henceforth as the National Impact Survey of the Radical Homosexual Agenda in California Public Schools , as recently and furtively received / discovered by yours truly , your humble and sexually perverted and imperfectly liberal , very - straight - but - very - gay - rights - supporting satire columnist , in a roundabout manner I cannot divulge right now lest I might get shot waiting in line at Starbucks .
What is the NISRHACPS , you ask ?
Why , it 's a document .
It 's a mailer .
It 's a survey of sorts , a short , wretched little questionnaire made entirely of sadness and bile and fear .
It 's a piece of paper sent out en masse to particular members of the Republican party who are so openly terrified of all homosexual personages , they fully believe said gays are actively bewitching and recruiting your innocent children behind the locked doors of hugely perverted schoolhouses near you .
This document is , apparently , highly confidential .
Everything about it -- the shouty ALL CAPS HEADLINES , the copious red ink , the simpleton second - grade language -- screams that I 'm not supposed to be reading it , given how I have , you know , a functioning intellect , can walk upright , enjoy copious amounts of sex , and speak in complete sentences .
Often all at the same time .
I know !
In fact , most liberals , moderates , chimps , garden gnomes and humans with intact brainstems have likely never seen this document , given how it is carefully targeted only at persons of dangerously limited consciousness , people who clearly think book learnin ' is for elitists , the vagina was created by the devil and Sarah Palin is like , super - duper smart , and stuff .
You perhaps think I am exaggerating ?
I am not exaggerating .
Behold :
< snip >
RADICAL HOMOSEXUAL AGENDA IMPACT RESEARCH SURVEY BACKGROUND : American standards of sexual morality have eroded to the point that almost nothing is off - limits in our schools . [...]
Graphic details of perverted sex practices are being taught to high school children , and parents are being locked out of assemblies lead by radical homosexual activists .
How long will it be before sex between adults and children is just the next barrier to be torn down ?
How long will it take before radical homosexual activists achieve their next evil objective ?
</snip >
That 's the first paragraph , more or less .
It was difficult to transcribe verbatim , given how it 's such a bizarre arrangement of verbiage , such a sickening cluster of sentences , I could n't really write it without my heart clenching and my brain actively recoiling .
Also , it 's tough to type when you 're laughing , shaking your head , and slamming Maker 's Mark to numb the savage karmic pain , all at once .
There are 10 questions in the NISRHACPS .
They are all , as you imagine , completely silly , front - loaded , leading questions along the lines of " Pimply spidermutants from planet Fukulon - 7 like to devour the severed heads of newborn baby deer like popcorn .
Do you support this practice ?
Yes [ ]
No [ ] Do n't Know [ ] "
In other words , they are n't really questions at all , and are far more like validations of an outlandish kind of ignorance , a repressed sexual fantasia , the honest belief that godless heathens have penetrated the public school system using giant strap - on dildos and are secretly teaching your little ones about , presumably , leather chaps , Adam Lambert , love and other such abominations .
I shall not attempt any sort of itemized correction of this amazing document .
I am not here to shine a light on all the obvious lies and misstatements contained in this " survey . "
The fact that it 's total nonsense , or that the framing device is hilariously lopsided , is not for this column to remedy .
Besides , it 's nothing really new .
This kind of shrill fearmongering and right - wing propaganda has been going on since Rush Limbaugh was knee high to Pat Roberston 's gay bathhouse towel boy 's coke spoon .
What 's more , if you 're reading this column , odds are extremely good you 're already many , many times smarter than the target demographic of this survey .
But oh , what a target .
Allow me to point up one aspect of the NISRHACPS I find particularly distressing .
It is this : the document comes from -- and is aimed straight at -- women .
True .
The survey is apparently the dark creation of a little D.C. splinter clan called Concerned Women for America ( CWA ) , who in my imagination are n't really women at all , but are far more like bulky bundles of bad skin and beige polyester with only faintly female characteristics , such as thigh stubble , cankles and a creamy fondness for Jay Leno and lumpy pancake batter and cats .
In other words , I imagine the Concerned Women for America much like I imagine neo -Nazi skinheads in rural Idaho , wacky black metal dudes from Norway , or " Real Housewives " cast members ; a weird and ragtag huddle of unstable , nervous humans smelling faintly of stale Doritos and light beer , who have endured a complete lack of agreeable sexual contact since , well , ever .
Unfortunately , the NISRHACPS is not easily dismissed .
Many of you will note it was exactly this kind of trickery and lie- mongering used to scare thousands of already overanxious Mormons into giving millions of their kids ' underwear money to help pass Prop 8 .
This new campaign plays on the same sort of heartless fears , only this time it 's targeting one of the weakest and most gullible of all American demographics : mal - educated conservative moms who do n't know any better .
Sad does n't begin to cover it .
The NISRHACPS ends with a petition to Gov. Schwarzenegger to please put an end evil homosexual propaganda in our public schools , and instead help " promote views toward sexuality that support our nation 's traditional moral values . "
Do you remember those values ?
The moral codes that have helped shaped America lo these many years of joyful Christian goodness and open - hearted love ?
I bet you do .
From the top , they include : Unchecked sexual guilt , shame , hysteria , pedophilic priests , failed abstinence programs , banning birth control education in schools , dangerous illegal abortions , widespread teen pregnancy , the 50 - percent divorce rate , and freaking the hell out over a single exposed nipple on primetime TV .
Also , by extension , unhappy marriages , sexual unfulfillment and a deep misunderstanding of God , love and simple human connection .
You know , values just like mom used to enjoy .
Thanks for reminding us , CWA !

Perhaps , the most important move in Jonas Gustavsson ’s fledgling hockey career did n’t take place on the ice .
It possibly occurred in the Maple Leafs ’ dressing room when goaltending coach Francois Allaire shifted Gustavsson ’s locker from across the room to the one beside newcomer Jean - Sebastien Giguere after the veteran arrived in a late January trade with Anaheim .
Gustavsson jokes that ’s it ’s better for conversation to have the “ two most clever guys ” sitting next to each other , but it is no coincidence that the rookie has played some of his best hockey since taking up residence next to the 12 - year NHLer at both the Air Canada Centre and the team ’s practice facility .
Sure , other factors are at play too in Gustavsson ’s four - game win streak .
The Leafs are playing better in front of him .
He got a boost of confidence from being part of Sweden ’s Olympic team .
His health has stabilized after early - season heart troubles and the pattern of playing every other game seems to agree with him .
But there is also the impact of the affable Giguere who , perhaps more than any other NHL goaltender , is willing to share tricks of the trade with a young apprentice .
Rather than feeling threatened by a partner who is playing well , Giguere has become a mentor for a freshman who is trying to develop a similar style of netminding under Allaire .
“ It ’s important to be a team within the team , ” says Giguere , who clearly did not graduate from the Ed Belfour school of looking out for No. 1 .
“ No one else knows what we ’re going through on a daily basis .
I think it ’s important for us to support each other .
You ca n’t do that when you ’re across from each other in the dressing room .
I think it ’s important that you talk to each other .
I ’ll ask him if he thought I made a mistake or the other way around .
Stuff like that . ”
Said Gustavsson : “ It ’s good for us to give advice to each other .
Maybe Giguere has more to give me than I have to give him .
It ’s good .
We can share ideas about how to play out there , equipment , everything . ”
Gustavsson is headed for restricted free agency this summer .
Though the two sides have yet to begin contract talks , the expectation is that Giguere , with a year remaining on his deal at $ 7 million , and Gustavsson will form Toronto ’s goaltending tandem again next season .
So the example Giguere sets for Gustavsson will only help the Leafs in the long run .
“ The first thing I saw was how hard ( Giguere ) works out there .
That makes me want to work even harder , ” said Gustavsson .
“ If you can push yourself every practice , you ’re going to be a better goalie .
There are small things like how to move better and so on .
It ’s not that he ’s been telling me how to do everything .
Of course not .
But we always share ideas . ”
While head coach Ron Wilson acknowledges Giguere ’s role in helping Gustavsson , he scoffs at how Toronto fans and media rush to judgment and anoint a player as the next big thing after a few solid games .
“ I chuckle .
He ’s won four games in a row and now , I suppose , everybody wants to nominate him for the Vezina Trophy .
A month ago everybody was ready to throw him under the bus because he was struggling a little bit , ” said the coach .

“ We ’ve played well in front of him .
His confidence has improved when he knows he ’s going to play .
He ’s got a great relationship with ( Giguere ) and I think ( Giguere ) has helped him out a little bit with how to work and relax and mentally prepare for a game . ”
Wilson continued .
“ It happens way too often here .
As soon as a young player plays two good games , he ’s now a star .
The goalie has won four games in a row .
Part of it is we ’re playing better as a team but we jump to conclusions here .
It ’s a long season .
We ’re glad some of these younger guys are starting to show some results , but they have long way to go . ”

Finding could advance sequencing studies of ancient animals .
Researchers have extracted DNA from the fossilized eggs of moa and other extinct birds .
The Natural History Museum , London
Extremely well - preserved DNA discovered in the fossilized eggshells of extinct bird species suggests that they could be a source of ancient genetic material for sequencing efforts .
Eggshells are commonly found at fossil sites worldwide .
But , to date , no one has described recovering DNA from them successfully .
Now , evolutionary biologist Michael Bunce and his graduate student Charlotte Oskam at Murdoch University in Perth , Western Australia , together with an international team of scientists , have recovered DNA from fossil eggshells by dramatically improving on the process used to extract it .
Conventionally , scientists remove calcium salts from fossil eggshells using decalcifying solutions before extracting DNA .
Unless they are removed , the salts prevent DNA from sticking to the silica column used during the purification process .
But eggshells are predominantly ( 97 % ) made up of calcium carbonate crystals that are embedded in a protein matrix that forms the shell .
This led Bunce and Oskam to wonder if the decalcification process itself might be washing away DNA preserved within the shell .
To find out , the team separately measured the amount of DNA in both decalcified eggshell powder and the waste solution used to decalcify them .
They found DNA in the decalcification solution but not in the powder — suggesting that researchers have been throwing away precious ancient DNA .
" This is a quite exciting piece of work .
It is rather embarrassing for the ancient - DNA community that we have not tried this before , " says biologist Michi Hofreiter of the University of York , UK .
“ It is rather embarrassing for the ancient - DNA community that we have not tried this before . ”
But just discovering that ancient DNA was housed within the eggshell 's calcium matrix was not enough — the team wanted to recover more of it for further studies .
" Collecting ancient DNA is a numbers game and our job gets a whole lot easier if we can maximize DNA yields , " says Bunce .
In a bid to recover every shred of DNA from fossil eggshell , the team next tried raising the temperature to relax the eggshell 's crystalline matrix and release the DNA .
When they heated up the DNA extraction solutions to 95 °C for 10 minutes , the team found that eggshells yielded twice as much DNA as they did without heating .
Unscrambling egg DNA
The researchers tested their method on 18 fossilized eggshell specimens , from species including moa ( Dinornithiformes ) , emu ( Dromaius ) and elephant birds ( Aepyornis and Mullerornis ) from New Zealand , Australia and Madagascar .
The eggs were between 400 and 19,000 years old , and the team collected good - quality DNA from all specimens — a feat that no - one has reported before .
" To date , the 19,000 - year - old emu egg DNA is the oldest DNA that has ever been recovered from Australian fossils , " says Bunce .

" This may bring birds a bit more into the spotlight of ancient DNA research — they have been neglected so far , " notes Hofreiter .
Ancient DNA has been recovered from the fossilized bones of mammals , such as polar bears that are around 130,000 years old , but these fossils are usually found in cold , dry environments that protect the DNA .
" I find it intriguing that it was possible to recover ancient DNA from warm environments like those of Australia and Madagascar , which are thought to not be favourable for long - term preservation of DNA , " says molecular biologist Charlotte Lindqvist of the University at Buffalo in New York .
The team speculates that DNA finds its way into eggshells because when the egg forms inside the female , some of her cells slough off and get mixed into the calcium carbonate and protein matrix .
They think that the DNA stays well preserved because eggshells form a barrier against water and oxygen that would otherwise damage the DNA .
Pure and simple
The fossilized eggshell DNA is not only well preserved , but also very pure compared with DNA from fossilized animal bones , which is often badly contaminated with the DNA of bacteria that fed on the animal after its death .

When the team compared the level of bacterial DNA contamination in moa bone and moa eggshell from the same period , the level of microbial DNA contamination was 125 times lower in the DNA extracted from eggshells than from bone .
The researchers do not know if this difference between bone and eggshell contamination is because bacteria cannot get into the eggshell matrix or if it is because discarded shells provide little food on which bacteria can grow .
" These findings show great promise for the recovery of DNA from ancient birds , and perhaps reptiles , " says Lindqvist .
" It would be exciting to see if using this technique on eggshells from climates that are more favourable for DNA preservation , like permafrost , push back the date for ancient DNA recovery even further . "
Let the insanity begin .
These guys are awesome & on a totally different level .
Gaia lent an unhelpful hand
IN THE 1990s cap - and - trade — the idea of reducing carbon - dioxide emissions by auctioning off a set number of pollution permits , which could then be traded in a market — was the darling of the green policy circuit .
A similar approach to sulphur dioxide emissions , introduced under the 1990 Clean Air Act , was credited with having helped solve acid-rain problems quickly and cheaply .
And its great advantage was that it hardly looked like a tax at all , though it would bring in a lot of money .
The cap - and - trade provision expected in the climate legislation that Senators John Kerry , Joe Lieberman and Lindsey Graham have been working on , which may be unveiled shortly , will be a poor shadow of that once alluring idea .
Cap - and - trade will not be the centrepiece of the legislation ( as it was of last year 's House climate bill , Waxman - Markey ) , but is instead likely to apply only to electrical utilities , at least for the time being .
Transport fuels will probably be approached with some sort of tax or fee ; industrial emissions will be tackled with regulation and possibly , later on , carbon trading .
The hope will be to cobble together cuts in emissions similar in scope to those foreseen under the House bill , in which the vast majority of domestic cuts in emissions came from utilities .
This composite approach is necessary because the charms of economy - wide cap - and - trade have faded badly .
The ability to raise money from industry is not so attractive in a downturn .
Market mechanisms have lost their appeal as a result of the financial crisis .
More generally , climate is not something the public seems to feel strongly about at the moment , in part because of that recession , in part perhaps because they have worries about the science ( see article ) , in part , it appears , because the winter has been a snowy one .
The public is , though , quite keen on new initiatives on energy , which any Senate bill will shower with incentives and subsidies whether the energy in question be renewable , nuclear , pumped out from beneath the seabed or still confined to research laboratories .
So the bill will need to raise money , which is why cap - and - trade is likely to remain for the utilities , and revenues will be raised from transport fuels .
A complex way of doing this , called a linked fee , would tie the revenues to the value of carbon in the utility market ; a straightforward carbon tax may actually have a better chance of passing .
Energy bills have in the past garnered bipartisan support , and this one also needs to .
That is why Senator Graham matters .
He could bring on board both Democrats and Republicans .
Mr Graham 's contribution has been to focus the rhetoric not just on near - term jobs , but also on longer - term competitiveness .
Every day America does not have climate legislation , he argues , is a day that China 's grip on the global green economy gets tighter .
He also thinks action on the issue would be good for his party .
While short - term Republican interests call for opposition , the party 's long - term interests must include broadening its support .
Among young people , for example , polling suggests that the environment , and the climate , matter a great deal .
Unfortunately for this argument , tactics matter , and young voters are unlikely to play a great role in the mid-term election .
Other Republicans may think it better to wait before re-establishing the party 's green credentials .
Lisa Murkowski of Alaska , for example , is happy to talk about climate as a problem , and talks about the desirability of some sort of carbon restriction — perhaps a tax , or some version of Maria Cantwell 's “ cap- and - dividend ” scheme .
But she expresses no great urgency about the subject .
And she has introduced one of two measures intended to curtail the power the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) now has to regulate carbon , on the ground that that is a matter for legislation sometime in the future .
The EPA 's new powers undoubtedly make the charms of legislation greater .
Some industrial lobbies may decide that the bill will provide the certainty they need to decide about future investment , and get behind it .
The White House has been supportive of late , inviting senators over to talk .
But it remains an uphill struggle , and the use of reconciliation to pass health care could greatly increase the gradient of the hill , as Mr Graham has made abundantly clear .
If the bill does not pass , it will change environmental politics in America and beyond .
The large , comparatively business - friendly environmental groups that have been proponents of trading schemes will lose ground , with organisations closer to the grassroots , and perhaps with a taste for civil disobedience , gaining power .
Carbon - trading schemes elsewhere in the world have already been deprived of a vast new market — Waxman - Markey , now dead , would have seen a great many carbon credits bought in from overseas — and if America turned away from cap - and - trade altogether they would look even less transformative than they do today .
And as market - based approaches lose relevance , what climate action continues may come to lean more heavily on the command - and - control techniques they were intended to replace .
Chris Jarvis , aged 31 : the force may be with you .
Jarvis is the Southend Jedi knight who refused to dehood in his jobcentre and has now received an apology from the manager for the lack of respect given to his " religion or beliefs " .
Being a Jedi knight , though , and committed to struggling unceasingly for justice and civilisation , Chris spurns such mouthings as empty , choosing rather to endure to the final triumph , and is planning to sue for discrimination .
You may argue that the history of the galaxies would look a great deal different if Darth Vader had taken a similar course , and would certainly have been far less exciting ; I thank Jarvis for showing us what happens when The Earthly Powers That Be try to fight the forces of indiscriminate discrimination with the forces of indiscriminate nondiscrimination .
It was ever a planetary folly to attempt to legislate on belief in beliefs ; it leads inevitably to what some have termed The Barking Side , where lie the burka bar , the Sikh bind , the cross patch , and worse .
Jarvis says : " I am a Star Wars follower .
It means following the Way of the Jedi ...
The main reason is I want to wear my hood up and I have got a religion which allows me to do that . "
Hmmm .
According to reported glosses from the Equality and Human Rights Commission ( EHRC ) to accompany Harriet Harman 's new equality bill , Jediism seems to have been excluded on the grounds that it is not " heartfelt " ; other definitions include " worthy of respect " ( which excludes , apparently , believers in human sacrifice ) .
Tricky , is n't it ?
This , after all , by census measure , is supposedly our fourth most popular religion .
I can see those who follow the way of the white wig and the black gown having no end of a tussle over that one , which would surely test even Alec Guinness , if not the entire Council of Twelve .
Thus , too , this from the EHRC : " A belief need not include faith or worship of a god or gods , but must affect how a person lives their life or perceives the world . "
Sports fans , Archers listeners , bankers , followers of Top Gear and Yorkshiremen : the way is clear for you , if I might mix my starships , to boldy go where no man has been before , not even Tim Nicholson , Bill Shankly or Charlie Whelan .
And if I were Unite , I 'd get in there first before Willie Walsh proclaims himself The Sky Pilot of the World 's Favourite Faith System ( Coming In on a Wing and a Prayer ) .
One slight hitch , though .
I note the case of Daniel Jones , 23 , Jedi knight of Bangor , also known as Morda Hehol , who was similarly asked to dehood by his local Tesco last September .
Tesco , now the nation 's leading arbiter of manners and dress code , said this : " We would ask Jedis to remove hoods .
Obi-Wan Kenobi , Yoda and Luke Skywalker all went hoodless without going to the Dark Side . "
I would be grateful for some Jedi input on this important doctrinal point .
Veteran artist / executive Dez Dickerson then joked , " Pretty soon , they 're going to have a cart outside Best Buy -- a little hot dog cart selling new releases . "
Across the hall at a panel on the shrinking label market , EMI A&R executive Steven Melrose noted that the physical retail landscape -- already decimated by the loss of Tower Records and hundreds of independents -- continues to shrivel .
Big box retailer Best Buy , for instance , recently cut the number of titles the outlet carries from the label by half , Melrose said .
The odds , to put it mildly , are n't in the favor of the 2,000 bands performing during the music industry 's annual spring break gathering .
" It was a really simple industry , " Bengloff said of the music business 20 years ago .
" What you tried to do was get your music played on AM / FM radio .
If it got played on the radio , it pushed people into record stores , where they bought these round plastic discs .
If they bought these round plastic discs , we made a living . "
Rich Bengloff , who leads the American Assn. of Independent Music , dropped some updated industry stats that he said were courtesy of Nielsen SoundScan .
Ten years ago , 28,000 full - length albums were released .
That number swelled to 134,000 in 2009 .
More stark , of the 103,000 albums released in 2008 , only about 6,000 sold more than 1,000 copies .
As sponsored parties toss away free beer and questionable tacos , it 's easy to get swept up in the revelry .
Impressive sets have arrived from such little - known indie acts as the Besnard Lakes and industry legends such as Roky Erickson , but as rootsy punk rockers Titus Andronicus sing , one can't necessarily get by on " merit and merit alone . "
As the annual South by Southwest conference in Austin , Texas , reaches its midway point , artists and labels were splashed with some cold , hard facts as an early morning wake - up call Friday .
Two early discussions called into question the relevancy of signing with a label , either major or indie , and illustrated the uphill battle that the nearly 2,000 bands performing in the Texas capital will face .
It 's pretty much taken as fact in 2010 that the Internet has provided opportunities for independents and the do - it - yourself community that never before existed .
Priyanka Dewan , who joined Warp Records in 2005 as U.S. office manager , said her initial year was the first time the stateside offshoot of the English label turned a profit .
Last year , fueled by the success of quiet harmonizers Grizzly Bear , Warp turned in its best year in its decade - plus history .
Good news , right ?
Bengloff cautioned the roomful of artists against celebrating .
Bengloff noted that he 's approached routinely by artists asking for advice .
" They say , ' I pressed about 1,000 CDs . '
Great .
That 's not the answer , " he said .
Indeed , what emerged was a picture of an industry still controlled by a handful of gatekeepers .
Bengloff 's panel largely expounded on the benefits of linking with an independent label , especially when he noted that the trade group estimates there are more than 5 million music pages on MySpace .
" You can get your music on iTunes , but how do you get it noticed on iTunes ? "
Dewan said .
" We have the relationship with iTunes where you can get a button on the front page . "
Adam Farrell , who overseas marketing for the Beggars Group ( which co-owns indie stalwarts Rough Trade , XL and Matador , among others ) hinted that the market will continue to shrink at the major label level .
" We sell records to people who buy 25 to 30 per year .
What we 're talking about on the top end is the people who bought three records per year .
They bought a Kings of Leon record , and that was their first album in a year .
But you can have a nice business marketing solely to the people who buy 25 to 30 records per year . "
As major labels experiment with 360 - deals , which essentially view the album as a loss - leader and instead take a cut of an artist 's touring and merch revenue , Farrell said Beggars is sticking with its old - school model .
" Sigur Rós does n't help on their merch or touring business , " he said .
" We 're not even looking at the stuff .
It 's not our position on the market right now .
Our value right now is helping bands market themselves and sell records . "
Labels , said Bengloff , have gotten better at understanding their fan bases .
He pointed to Roadrunner Records , and said the hard rock - leaning label once had an e-mail list of 500,000 names , and was losing fans by spamming Slipknot die - hards with Nickelback news .
Today , Bengloff said Roadrunner has trimmed its mailing to list to about 100,000 names .
At a panel on the future of online video , Erick Snowden , a creative director at Warner Music Group 's Altantic Records , suggested the way forward for labels is to market direct to consumers .
" The biggest problem the music industry has faced is one that has n't been talked about , and that 's transitioning to being a direct - to - fan business , " Snowden said .
" We 've always had people in between us , whether that 's retailers or iTunes . "
It 's an approach , ultimately , that sees major labels having to act a bit more like indies .
Summed Dickerson , " It 's not about being made legitimate by signing someone who makes your dream comes true .
That 's not reality ...
It 's not either / or .
It 's both / and .
Will there be a place for majors ?
Absolutely .
You ca n't get to big without it . "
In other news from Austin this morning . . . .
A mobile video battle is brewing :
An early panel on the future of online video hinted at a potential showdown between Apple and the major labels .
Sony Music 's online video guru John Sasso noted that the iPhone is currently responsible for somewhere in the range of 30 % of all streamed online content in the mobile space .
With the impending launch of the iPad , the mobile video market seems primed to mature .
One snag :
The majors are hitched to Adobe 's Flash , which offers greater control over content , but Apple wo n't support it .
" We 're supporting all the phones that are going to be supporting Flash , which is every smartphone but iPhone , " said Atlantic 's Snowden .
" We 're building iPhone apps for our artists . "
A frustration , said Sasso , is the lack of standardization .
" It 's impossible to standardize because there 's all these different formats .
So you have to build for all these formats . "
Alexander Kisch , vice president of Vevo , a video and entertainment site co-owned by Sony Music and Universal Music , was on the panel as well , and though no stats -- or the status of the company 's talks with Warner Music Group -- were revealed , Kish noted that the company was prepping an iPhone app and would soon launch overseas editions .
He said Vevo is also digging up rare and vintage content , including old MTV and BBC shows , as well as obscure international music programs from decades past .

The hearing is starting six years after the claim was first made
The European Court of Human Rights ( ECHR ) has begun hearing a complaint from collapsed Russian oil company Yukos against the Russian government .
Yukos first faced allegations of tax fraud in 2002 and was ultimately liquidated in 2007 .
But the firm claims that it was " targeted " by the Russian authorities and illegally driven out of business .
Yukos representatives first filed the claim with the ECHR in 2004 .
They are seeking $ 98bn ( £ 65 bn ) in compensation .
Yukos founder Mikhail Khodorkovsky was jailed for eight years in 2005 for tax evasion and other offences .
' Arbitrary and discriminatory '
Russian authorities began pursuing Yukos in 2002 , accusing it of creating shell companies to hide revenue from the tax authorities .
Yukos founder Mikhail Khodorkovsky was jailed in 2005
Yukos , once Russia 's biggest oil company , struggled to survive after facing a series of tax demands totalling $ 27bn .
It eventually had its assets frozen and was forced to sell its shares in other companies .
The firm was declared insolvent in 2006 and was liquidated the following year .
Yukos claims that the Russian government 's actions were " unlawful , disproportionate , arbitrary and discriminatory , and amounted to disguised expropriation " of the company .
The ECHR agrees to hear about one in 20 applications that it receives .
Its rulings are binding on all 47 members of the Council of Europe , which includes Russia .
Past rulings have obliged governments to amend legislation and administrative practices .
General relativity , our current best understanding of gravity , has passed yet another test — this time on a much larger length scale .
Ever since relativity 's first confirmation in 1919 , when Sir Arthur Stanley Eddington observed that the light from distant stars was shifted by the mass of the sun , direct tests have been confined to length scales smaller than our solar system .
No test to date has stringently probed general relativity 's applicability to the length scales of the universe itself .
A paper that is published in the current edition of Nature reports on research that incorporates gravitational lensing , galaxy clustering measurements , and growth rates of large scale structures to measure a single parameter that can be compared to the predictions of general relativity .
To probe the effect of gravity at large length scales — on the order of two to 50 megaparsecs ( MPc ) at a redshift of 0.32 — the authors describe a variable E G that incorporates three physical parameters and can be used to differentiate between competing theories of gravity .
The bulk of the matter in the universe ( dark matter ) cannot be seen , which would seem to cause problems for any direct measurement that is using electromagnetic radiation as its input .
But E G is insensitive to " galaxy bias " and matter perturbations on the length scales of interest .
This means that , in their method , no second measurement is needed to estimate how lumpy a given region of space is .
The " source " of the gravity , be it dark or normal matter , is irrelevant , making the method more robust and less dependent on models than other proposed tests .
The authors used data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey that encompasses 70,205 distinct galaxies , covering over 5200 square degrees of the night sky .
The galaxies represent a redshift range of 0.16 at the recent end to 0.47 at the far past end , corresponding to a median look back in time of 3.5 billion years , when the universe was about 77 percent of its current size .
Using these survey galaxies as inputs , the authors arrive at an E G parameter equal to 0.39 ± 0.06 .
Calculating the value using general relativity and the ΛCDM model of our universe produces a value of 0.408 ± 0.029 .
The calculation and measurement statistically overlap each other at one standard deviation .
This suggests that general relativity holds true , even at length scales 1011 times greater than previous tests .
However , general relativity is not alone in the world of cosmological theories .
Any of the Modified Newtonian Dynamics ( MOND ) gravity theories , or other extensions to general relativity , must also be capable of generating an E G value in the range of the measured one to be considered valid .
Testing a flavor of a version of MOND known as tensor - vector - scalar ( TeVeS ) theory , the team computed an E G value of 0.22 , which is lower than the measured value by more than 2.5 standard deviations .
Similar calculations using f( R ) theory — an extension of general relativity — reveal an E G value of between 0.328 and 0.365 .
Not exact , but not far enough outside the error bars to be ruled out as statistically unlikely .
As is often the case , more data from future sky surveys will help to reduce the uncertainty in the measured value .
But even the current value places another hurdle in the way of any theory of the universe that seeks to challenge general relativity .
Not only must any new theory be capable of explaining what general relativity does , but it must be able to reproduce this new constraint as well .

The Catholic Church ’s Latest Abuse Scandals
A series of explosive child sex abuse scandals has hit Western Europe in recent months , sending the Catholic Church into damage - control mode .
While such scandals have become depressingly frequent since major allegations came out in the United States in 2002 , the latest charges have been particularly damaging , implicating senior members of the Vatican hierarchy , including Pope Benedict XVI himself , and coming at a time when the church is already losing popularity on its home turf .
IRELAND
The scandal : Serious accusations have rocked the Irish church since the U.S. scandal broke .
But it was not until the middle of last year — when a government report detailing Irish clergy child abuse was released — that the extent of the problem was entirely clear .
The report alleged 2,000 cases of abuse over a 60 - year period .
A second government investigation , released by the Irish government in November 2009 , fanned the flames by revealing the collusion of Irish police in systematically covering up cases of child abuse by Dublin clergymen .
For Ireland , this is only the latest part of the clergy abuse saga — the Associated Press reports that since the mid-1990s there have been nearly 15,000 complaints leveled against the church — with legal claims topping $ 1.5 billion .
The church ‘s response :
The archbishop of Dublin responded swiftly to the latest report , saying on Nov. 26 , “ No words of apology will ever be sufficient , ” and “ The report highlights devastating failings of the past . ”
The Irish police commissioner also expressed his regret in the police force ’s role .
The Vatican , however , was less effective .
In September 2009 , a Vatican official responded to growing criticism by defending the clergy ’s action , citing statistics that showed only 1.5 to 5 percent of clergy have been involved in cases of child sex abuse — a leaky argument that acknowledges sexual abuse by up to 20,000 priests worldwide .
This February , the pope finally personally addressed the issue by summoning 24 Irish bishops to the Vatican to discuss the by - then highly publicized scandal .
He also vowed to pen a “ clear and decisive ” letter addressed to Irish Catholic constituents that would outline definitive steps the church would take to protect children from further abuse .
Four bishops have resigned in the reports ’ wake , but others have complained of unfair treatment by the Irish press , pointing out that journalists have focused on the church even though problems of abuse are societywide .
THE NETHERLANDS
The scandal :
In late February , a Dutch radio station and newspaper broke the story of alleged abuse in Dutch Catholic boarding schools in the 1960s and 70s .
The last Catholic boarding school may have closed in 1981 , but victims have not forgotten their traumatic experiences .
Once again , the trickle of a few lone voices surged into a torrent — nearly 200 allegations surfaced in the weeks following the radio program .
Victims told stories of priests who shamed them into thinking they had done something wrong , which accounted for their silence .
Even when accusations were leveled , priests tended to brush off evidence .
The church ‘s response : The Dutch church was quick to offer an apology to victims of abuse and on March 9 ordered an investigation into any claims .
The Vatican , perhaps learning from its PR mistakes in the case of Ireland , highlighted the timely Dutch response as a demonstration of the church ’s transparency in dealing with child abuse .
The Vatican also credited church officials for speeding up the process by encouraging victims to step forward .
Critics have shot back , saying such investigations are “ a typical Vatican coverup ” and that the church has done little to systematically deal with the problem .
AUSTRIA
The scandal : In early March , the head of a Benedictine monastery in Salzburg confessed to sexually abusing a child more than 40 years ago , before he was ordained .
His offer to resign was immediately accepted .
A few days later it was reported that another priest in southeast Austria was suspected of having abused approximately 20 children in his parish .
Anonymous accusations of abuse at a boarding school at Mehrerau Abbey have also been confirmed and allegations of abuse within the world - famous Vienna Boys ’
Choir have also surfaced .
The church ‘s response : On March 11 , two Austrian archbishops made international headlines when they separately questioned , in a Catholic magazine and during a television interview , whether the church ’s tradition of celibacy had increased the likelihood of abuse .
They stopped short of blaming celibacy for the Roman Catholic Church ’s growing record of abuse , saying that if celibacy were the principal cause , pedophilia would not exist elsewhere in society .
The next day , the Vatican shot down a discussion of celibacy when the pope stated that the tradition would not fall to “ passing cultural fashions . ”
GERMANY
The scandal :
The latest and most salient crisis is now taking place in Germany , where allegations of abuse have surfaced this year for the first time .
At least 300 cases of abuse have emerged , and elite Jesuit boarding schools across the country have been accused of mistreating pupils .
Eighteen of the 27 German archdioceses are now being investigated for child abuse while the German Justice Ministry says that Vatican secrecy has hamper ed investigations for the past decade .
Such explosive accusations are a direct attack on Pope Benedict himself , who has been criticized for sending a confidential letter in 2001 to every Roman Catholic bishop , advising them to keep allegations of sexual abuse secret for at least 10 years .
The letter went on to say that investigations into abuses would be done internally .
The German cases have been particularly dangerous for the pope , who was the bishop of Munich from 1977 to 1981 .
Already he has been accused of allowing a priest who was a known molester to continue serving .
Even the pope ’s older brother , Father Georg Ratzinger , has been accused of allowing abuses to occur at a school choir he directed from 1964 to 1994 .

A MILITANT atheist was found guilty of leaving grossly offensive religious images in a prayer room at Liverpool 's John Lennon airport .
Jurors took just 15 minutes to convict Harry Taylor , 59 , of leaving obscene material depicting figures from Christianity and Islam , often in sexual poses , in the multi - faith room with the intention of causing harassment and alarm .
Taylor , who labelled himself a “ militant atheist ” admitted placing the items in the prayer room on three separate occasions , but insisted he was simply practising his own religion of “ reason and rationality ” .
Taylor told jurors he had left the items in the room in memory of “ his hero ” John Lennon before reciting the words from the song Imagine .
He said : “ The airport is named after one of my heroes and his view on religion was pretty much the same as mine .
I thought it was an insult to his memory to have a prayer room in his airport . ”
Giving evidence in his own defence , Taylor admitted being “ strongly anti-religious ” after being treated badly by the Catholic Brothers as a boy growing up in Dublin .
But he insisted people would only be offended if their faith was “ weak ” and that the images were meant as satire .
But the jury of 10 women and two men , who all swore their oath on the Bible , rejected his defence .
They had heard from airport chaplain Nicky Lees who told of her alarm after finding the images .
She said : “ I was insulted , deeply offended and I was alarmed . ”
As the unanimous verdicts were delivered , smartly - dressed Taylor simply raised an eye - brow , but showed no other emotion .
Taylor , of Griffin Street , Salford , Greater Manchester , declined to comment after his conviction on all three counts of religiously aggravated intentional harassment , alarm or distress from November 2 , 26 , and December 12 , 2008 .
Earlier in the day he had posed for a photographer outside court .
Neville Biddle , prosecuting , who had told Liverpool crown court jurors they were acting as the “ conscience of our society ” revealed Taylor already has two convictions from May 18 , 2006 for using abusive , insulting words or behaviour .
He told how on that occasion Taylor had left similar offensive material in St Anne 's Church in the centre of Manchester .
Judge Charles James said he wanted to know all the details from Taylor ’s previous convictions .
He also ordered a pre-sentence reported be prepared on him , but gave no indication of the sentence .
The judge granted Taylor bail until sentencing on April 23 with a condition not to enter John Lennon airport .
The FCC is asking the nation 's broadband and smartphone users to use their broadband testing tools to help the feds and consumers know what speeds are actually available , not just promised by the nations ' telecoms .
Starting Thursday , netizens can go to the FCC's Broadband.gov site , enter their address and test their broadband speed using one of two testing tools .
i Phone and Android users can go to their respective app stores and download the FCC 's first ever mobile app , which will report to the feds exactly how slow your connection actually is .
The FCC is requiring the street address " it may use this data to analyze broadband quality and availability on a geographic basis . "
Broadband connection testing is n't new , and is freely available online , but this might mark the first time that individual tests help to lead to informed policy making .
Crowdsourcing this data is a brilliant move , given that telecoms have long fought against telling federal regulators what areas they cover and at what speed , arguing that information will be used by competitors to poach their customers .
The data can also be used as a way to prevent telecoms from over - promising and under - delivering on upload and download speeds .
If you listen closely you might actually hear the telecom companies hitting the backspace key to revise the speed numbers on their promotional fliers .
But the FCC is n't forgetting about those left out of the broadband revolution and is asking those who live in a broadband " Dead Zone " by filling out a report online , calling the FCC at - 888 - CALL - FCC , faxing the e-mail or even sending a letter through the Postal Service .
The announcement comes just six days before the FCC presents the first ever national broadband plan to Congress .
Goals include 100 million Americans with 100 Mbps service by 2010 , bringing affordable broadband to rural and urban areas , and helping digital laggards get online .
The FCC is collecting IP addresses , along with physical addresses , but is not asking for names or e-mail addresses .
They promise not to release the street addresses , with some exceptions noted in the privacy policy .
A free Java plug - in is necessary to run the test .
Gentleman , start your browsers .

Australia is on the top 10 list of countries on Hulu 's international expansion plans , its director of international business development , Simon Gallagher , said at the Media 2010 event .
The web TV service has had explosive growth since it launched in 2007 , delivering popular shows to American homes via broadband .
A collaboration between Fox and NBC Universal , it aims to combat online piracy of television programs .
The strategy has worked , Gallagher said , citing figures that show a significant fall in pirated shows when the programs were available on Hulu .
The service is free for viewers and shows are aired online immediately after they are broadcast in Hawaii ( the latest broadcast time in the US ) .
However , he said , significant challenges must be addressed before such a service can be introduced in Australia .
These include collaboration between the networks and the cost and speed of broadband access .
'' In the US , six out of seven internet users now view internet video every month , '' he said .
It was only a matter of time .

Ms Hume fell down the shaft in July 2008 as she made her way home
An inquiry into the death of a woman who fell down a mine has heard she lay for six hours because safety rules banned firefighters from rescuing her .
Alison Hume , 44 , fell about 40ft into the shaft in Galston in July 2008 .
A fatal accident inquiry into her death is being held at Kilmarnock Sheriff Court .
It has been told that fire crews could not aid Ms Hume because regulations stated their equipment was for saving themselves , not members of the public .
The 44 - year - old solicitor , who worked with the Renfrewshire legal firm McCusker McElroy and Co , was discovered by her daughter and eventually freed by mountain rescue experts .
She died after suffering a heart attack just as she was brought to the surface .
Christopher Rooney , the first senior fire officer at the scene , told the FAI it would have been possible to pull her from the shaft had it not been for a health and safety memo .
Solicitor Gregor Forbes asked Mr Rooney : " On the basis of the manpower and equipment you had available , is it your view it would it would have been possible for the firefighters to have brought the person to the surface before the mountain rescue team ? "
We heard Alison moaning and making distressed noises
Christopher Rooney
Former firefighter Mr Rooney , 51 , replied : " Yes , I believe so . "
The now retired fireman said the memo was circulated around Strathclyde Fire and Rescue stations in March 2008 - just four months before the tragedy .
Mr Rooney agreed with Mr Forbes , representing Ms Hume 's family , that the restrictions placed on the crews that night prevented them from acting as they may otherwise have done .
Mr Forbes said : " Your position is that while you were supplied with safe working at height equipment , while this could be used to bring up firefighters it could not be used to bring up a member of the public ? "
Mr Rooney told the court : " Yes , that 's correct . "
He added that all 18 firefighters at the scene were trained and capable of using the equipment .
The inquiry was also shown video footage of crews at the scene of the accident .
Mr Rooney said he arrived at the scene at 0230 BST but was hampered by darkness and mist reducing visibility in places to just 1 m .
He said Ms Hume 's family led him to the 10 m diameter hole which was partially concealed by bushes and long grass .
" We heard Alison moaning and making distressed noises , " he added .
' Excessive delay ' Fireman Alexander Dunn was lowered down with oxygen and first aid equipment but because of the safety rule could only wait with Ms Hume until the mountain rescue team arrived .
The inquiry heard how he spent four hours with Ms Hume at the bottom of the shaft until he was joined by mountain rescue team members .
They strapped her into a special stretcher and she was finally brought out at 0742 GMT .
Mr Dunn , 51 , who is now retired , described the time it took to rescue her as " excessive " .
He was critical of the fire service debrief after the incident , saying he did not learn anything from it and it made no recommendations for the future .
He added that after seeing her injuries - an apparent swollen stomach and signs of a head injury - he wanted to " just pull her out . "
Mr Dunn said the debrief failed to address key points including " what we could do in the future if anything like this happened again " .
The inquiry continues .

C - Span executives said they hoped that its search filters would be up to the task .
Mr. Lamb said , “ You can see if politicians are saying one thing today , and 15 years ago were saying another thing . ”
He added , “ Journalists can feast on it . ”
One of the Web site ’s features , the Congressional Chronicle , shows which members of Congress have spoken on the House and Senate floors the most , and the least .
Each senator and representative has a profile page .
Using the data already available , some newspapers have written about particularly loquacious local lawmakers .
C - Span was established in 1979 , but there are few recordings of its earliest years .
Those “ sort of went down the drain , ” Mr. Browning said .
But he does have about 10,000 hours of tapes from before 1987 , and he will begin reformatting them for the Web soon .
Those tapes include Ronald Reagan ’s presidential campaign speeches and the Iran - Contra hearings .
In a tour of the site last week , Mr. Browning said the various uses of the archives were hard to predict .
He found that a newly uploaded 1990 United Nations address by the Romanian president Ion Iliescu was quickly discovered and published by several Romanian bloggers .
While C - Span does not receive Nielsen ratings , a recent poll by Fairleigh Dickinson University found that 52 percent of voters said they watched it at least once in a while .
The poll did not distinguish among C - Span ’s three channels .
The original one , C - Span , shows every House of Representatives session ; C - Span2 does the same for the Senate ; and C - Span3 shows committee hearings , briefings , conferences and other events .
The archives of all three channels have been mostly uploaded , but they can only be streamed .
Mr. Browning said video downloads were on his agenda .
Users can embed the videos on other Web sites and clip small sound bites for repeat viewing .
Last week we had the good fortune to visit Firaxis and get a firsthand look at Civilization V Firaxis is committed to maintaining the depth the fans have come to expect .
The +whole+game+has+a+very+painted+look .
It's+all+worth+it+once+you+start+shooting+flaming+arrows+at+cities .
The first suspicions of a market - driven compromise are usually generated by the dreaded " A " word , accessibility .
While it 's true that some game systems , like religion and espionage , have been removed , fears that Civilization Revolution on the console has dumbed down the gameplay of the PC sequel are unfounded .
In the case of Civilization V , accessibility just means the developers want to make it easier to understand and manipulate the complexity within the game .
Most of these are merely matters of convenience rather than cutting back and , with that in mind , it 's clear that the interface for Civ Rev has definitely impacted the presentation in Civ V Basic commands and notifications have been simplified and pushed into the corners of the art deco interface .
The few unit actions that players use all the time will be aligned on the lower left edge of the screen , but you can expand the list to include the whole range of possible actions .
Small icons will pop up each turn to notify players of new events that might require attention and clicking on those icons will take players to the location in question .
The idea is to give the player as much information they need without ever taking them out of the game itself .
Advisors are also making a return to counsel new players on particular aspects of the game but their overall tone will be much more serious than in previous versions of Civ .
New players will also be saved from wasting time by having the " End turn " button transform into a " Choose production " button if a city happens to be sitting idle .
Even with the streamlined interface , veteran players will still be comforted to see that the top line of the screen reveals the presence of the hardcore elements , tracking things like science and gold production , happiness , culture , resources , and even the time remaining on any Golden Ages .
One of the biggest changes to the game is the new one - unit - per - hex restriction .
Previous Civ games have been dominated by the " stack of doom " where players create an unstoppable super unit by piling all of their units in a single square .
That strategy is not available in Civ V , which should , the designers reason , pull combat away from the cities .
Now when an invading army enters your territory , you 'll want to send your spearmen and warriors and swordsmen out to fight them in the fields around your towns .
Cities will automatically defend themselves now , and can benefit from increased defense based on certain structures or technologies , so you do n't necessarily need to garrison a unit for defense but you can if you want to .
Because you 're limited to just one unit per hex , battles have the potential to be much more tactical , both with regard to the placement of your units and geographical obstacles .
We saw a few battles that highlighted the significance of the new system .
In one , two groups of units were facing off against each other around a one - hex lake .
An archer unit was able to fire at enemy units on the far side of the lake and stay protected from melee attack by two allied units on either side .
In another battle , a small group of powerful units were able to hold off a much larger attacking army in a narrow mountain pass .
Because the attacker could only bring one unit into the fight at a time , the defender was able to eliminate the numerical disadvantage .
Civ fans are already very familiar with the terrain - based combat modifiers ( crossing rivers , holding hills , etc. ) and appropriate unit match ups .
Adding in the additional burden of managing an army spread out over a large area just means doing it all on a different scale and making sure that your ranged units stay clear of melee .
Fortunately , the game will allow adjacent allied units to swap positions , so you can keep fresh troops engaged with the enemy and rescue your ranged units from contact with melee fighters .
As fun as they are , battles are just the basic components of victory and without a clear direction you can win every fight and still lose the game .
A lot of effort is being made to ensure that the AI in Civilization V behaves in a way that makes sense .
As we watched a test game play out in front of us , AI programmer Ed Beach explained the way the AI uses subsystems to create and execute its strategies .
At the lowest level , the tactical AI uses the forces at hand to win a battle on a local scale .
One step up from that , the operational AI picks which battles to fight and makes sure that the necessary forces are available .
Moving even higher , the strategic AI manages the empire as a whole , focusing on where to build cities and what to do with them .
At the top of the ladder is the grand strategic AI , which decides how to win the game .
If the grand strategic AI decides to go for a conquest victory , the strategic AI will build the infrastructure needed to wage war and the operational and tactical AIs will choose and fight the battles .
That way the tactical AI wo n't be fighting battles merely for the sake of fighting battles , but because those battles are relevant in the grand strategic AI 's big picture .
In the case of the conquest victory , the AI will be aiming to capture the other civ's capitals , which is all that 's needed for a military victory this time .

Our family has set up this campaign for the following reasons :
These are some things you may wish to do for now to support our campaign :
Family of Ian Tomlinson
This website and the Ian Tomlinson Family Campaign has been set up by Ian 's family .
We are grateful for the huge amount of public support received since Ian ’s tragic death on April 1st 2009 at the G20 protests in London .
It has been very hard for our family particularly following the release of images of the police assault on Ian emerged .
Ian is deeply missed by us and we simply want justice for him .
We may have a long and difficult journey ahead to achieve justice and we will rely on your continued support . •
To demand a full investigation into Ian ’s death that scrutinises the individual conduct and operational command tactics of police officers present at the G20 protest and those in command of them when Ian was assaulted and died •
To call for full criminal charges to be brought against any officer whose actions or failure of duty resulted in Ian ’s death •
To campaign for change to any police policies , tactics or frequent abuses of power which may effectively endanger people ’s lives rather than protect them , so that future deaths and injuries to the public can be prevented •
To raise awareness of any issues we may experience as a family seeking justice through statutory and judicial systems that are a cause for public concern •

What ’s This Module For ?
Reading and writing files formatted using “ YAML Ain’t Markup Language ” ” ( YAML ) , and converting YAML syntax into native Python objects and datatypes .
What is YAML ?
According to the website which houses the YAML Specification :
YAML ™ ( rhymes with “ camel ” ) is a human - friendly , cross language , Unicode
based data serialization language designed around the common native data
structures of agile programming languages .
It is broadly useful for
programming needs ranging from configuration files to Internet messaging to
object persistence to data auditing .
My introduction to YAML came several years ago in the context of messaging , and I then had a run-in with YAML as a logging format ( actually , I was trying to parse a MySQL slow query log by coaxing it into YAML format ) .
However , when I started writing Python full time , working on several different initiatives , YAML quickly became the standard configuration format .
Why ?
Simplicity .
Using YAML for our config files and PyYAML to parse them , any developer can figure out what ’s happening in our application in a matter of minutes , even if Python is not their primary language .
It ’s also nice that the YAML syntax is parsed into native Python datatypes , so Python coders looking at a config file can start to get a pretty good picture of how the program basically works .
The other thing that makes it simpler than some other config - specific options is that there ’s not a lot of underlying “ stuff ” to know about .
YAML is n’t a configuration engine , it ’s essentially just a way to deal with data structures without locking the format to a specific language .
I also happen to like that it ’s not config - specific , because it means that if I later need a messaging format , I already know one , and am familiar with a certain Python module to work with it !
Basic Usage
Let ’s write a very simple YAML configuration for the logging portion of anapplication :
%YAML 1.2 --- Logging : format : " % ( levelname ) - 10s %( asctime )s %( module )s : %( funcName ) s ( ) % ( message ) s " level : 10 ...
I ’ve put logging - related configuration in its own “ section ” ( really data structure ) here so when I want to configure other things in the application I can do so without shooting myself in the foot and having to be careful not to use the same key names , etc .
I ’ve stored this configuration in a file called ‘ log.conf ’ .
From there you can easily play with it in an interpreter session :
>>> import yaml >>> config_file = open ( ' log.conf ' , 'r ' ) >>> config = yaml.load( config_file ) >>> config {' Logging ' : {' format ' : '% ( levelname ) - 10s %( asctime ) s %( module )s : %( funcName ) s ( ) %( message )s ' , ' level ' : 10}} >>>
With the configuration out of the way , let ’s look at the code that would use it :
#!/usr /bin/env python import logging import yaml def doit ( uid ) : logging .debug ( " Working with uid : %s " % uid ) if __name__ == " __main__ " : config_file = open ( ' log.conf ' , 'r ' ) config = yaml.load( config_file ) config_file.close ( ) logging.basicConfig(** config [ ' Logging ' ] ) doit ( 22222 )
logging.basicConfig ( ) takes a keyword dictionary of optional configuration items .
Here I ’m just using the ‘ format ’ and ‘ level ’ options , but there are more .
The only thing I do inside the doit ( ) function is use logging to output the value of ‘ uid ’ passed in .
This is really a test that the format I ’ve configured is actually being used .
The format is fairly intuitive : indentation defines a block , just like in Python .
The ‘— ‘ and ‘…’ lines denote the beginning and end of the YAML document .
You can have several documents in a file if you so choose .
This might be done if you ’re storing a feed or email threads in YAML format .
Type Conversion
Type conversion to the built in Python primitives works very well and is very intuitive in my experience .
The above would be parsed as a string for the ‘ format ’ key , and an ‘ int ’ for the ‘ level ’ key .
The entire block above will become a dictionary , and there is YAML syntax you can use to create lists and lists of lists , etc. , as well .
For example , let ’s say I ’m creating a Django - like web application framework and I ’ve decided to store my URL - to - handler mappings in a YAML file .
You could easily do it with a list of lists , which looks like this in YAML :
RequestHandlers : - [ / , framework.handlers.RootHandler ] - [ / signup , framework.handlers.RegisterNow ] - [ / login , framework.handlers.Login ] - [ / faq , framework.handlers.FAQ ]
This will form a list of lists that you can work with in your code that looks like this in the config dictionary :
{' RequestHandlers ' : [ [ '/' , ' framework.handlers.RootHandler ' ] , ['/ signup ' , ' framework.handlers.RegisterNow ' ] , ['/ login ' , ' framework.handlers.Login ' ] , [ ' / faq ' , ' framework.handlers.FAQ ' ] ] }
If for some reason type conversion does n’t work as you expect , or you need to represent , say , a boolean using a string like “ y ” or “ Yes ” instead of “ True ” , you can explicitly tag your value using tags defined in the YAML specification for this very purpose .
Here ’s how you ’d explicitly tag “ Yes ” as a boolean , to insure it ’s not parsed as a string :
verbose : !! bool " Yes "
When this is parsed by PyYAML , it will be a Python boolean , and the value when printed to the screen will be ‘ True ’ ( without quotes ) .
There are several other explicit type tags , including ‘!!int ’ , ‘!! float ’ , ‘!! null ’ , ‘!! timestamp ’ and more .
If you like , you could alter our URL mapper from above and create a list of tuples .
Note the use of the !!
omap tag , which is short for ‘ ordered mapping ’ :
RequestHandlers : !!omap - / : framework.handlers.RootHandler - /signup : framework.handlers.RegisterNow - /login : framework.handlers .Login - /faq : framework.handlers.FAQ
The resulting config dictionary looks like this :
{' RequestHandlers ' : [ ('/' , ' framework.handlers.RootHandler ' ) , ( ' / signup ' , ' framework.handlers.RegisterNow ' ) , ( ' / login ' , ' framework.handlers.Login ' ) , ( ' / faq ' , ' framework.handlers.FAQ ' ) ] }
More than once I ’ve gone back to my YAML configuration to alter the type of data structure returned to better suit the code that uses it .
It ’s pretty convenient , and making the changes to both the configuration file and the code are typically easy enough to be considered a non-event .
Beyond Basic Data Types
The ‘ level ’ option in logging .
basicConfig can be specified either as a word or a numeric value ( internally , logging .
DEBUG maps to the integer value 10 ) .
But what if you did n’t know this , or you did n’t have the option of using an integer ?
Specifying ‘ logging .
DEBUG ’ in the config file would n’t have worked , because it would ’ve come in as a string , and not an exposed module name .
If you do n’t care about locking your configuration file to a language , PyYAML will let you do what you need using language - specific tags .
So , for the purposes of our program , the following two lines in YAML produce the same effect :
level : 10 level : !!
python/name:logging.DEBUG
You might also choose to do this because reading ‘ logging .
DEBUG ’ , even with the added tag overhead , is probably easier to understand than trying to figure out what “ 10 ” means .
If you ’re developing code that allows users to write plugins , you can also let them add their plugins by adding a simple line to a ‘ plugin ’ section of the YAML config file in such a way that the config dictionary itself will contain an actual new instance of the proper object :
Plugins : - !!
python/object/new:MyPlugin.Processor [ logfile=' foo.log ' ] - !!
python/object/new:FooPluginModule.CementMixers.RotaryMixer [ consistency = ' chunky ' ]
The above will produce a list of plugin instances with ‘ args ’ in the appended list fed to each classes __init__ method .
Do n’t forget that if you want to access the plugins by name instead of looping over a list , you can easily make this a dictionary .
Also , PyYAML supports passing more intialization info to the class constructor .
Anchors and Aliases
You can create a block in your YAML config file , and then reference it in other sections of the configuration , and it can save you a lot of lines in a more complex configuration .
This is done using anchors and aliases .
An anchor starts with “ & ” and an alias ( a reference to the anchor ) begins with a “ * ” .
So , let ’s say you have multiple plugins loaded ( continuing on from the example ) , and they all need their own configuration , but they ’ll all connect to the same exact database server , and use the same credentials and db name , etc .
Just create the db config once , make it an anchor , and reference it as needed :
DB : & MainDB server : localhost port : 6000 user : dbuser db : myappdb
Plugins : loghandler : !!
python/object/new:MyLogHandler args : [ ' mylogfile.log ' ] db : * MainDB
When this is read in , the dictionary defined in & MainDB will appear as the value for the dict key [ ‘ Plugins ’ ] [ ‘ loghandler ’ ] [ ‘ db’ ] .
If you wanted to pass the * entire * config structure to your plugin , you technically would n’t need this , but I typically would only pass the portion of the config structure specifically dealing with the plugin , because configs can get large , and there could be lots of stuff that have nothing to do with the plugin in the rest of the config .
Moving Ahead
Although 90 % of your use of PyYAML might well consist of loading a YAML file or message and working with the resulting data structure , it ’s nice to know that it does provide quite a bit of flexibility if you ’re willing to look for it .
Here are some links for further reading about PyYAML , including a couple of items not covered in this tutorial :
Pass more initialization data to classes specified with !!
python/object/new
Create your own app - specific tags , a la ‘!! bool ’ and ‘!! python ’ .

IT IS not just a sense of fairness that seems to be calibrated to social circumstances ( see article ) .
Mating preferences , too , vary with a society 's level of economic development .
That , at least , is the conclusion of a study by Ben Jones and Lisa DeBruine of Aberdeen University , in Scotland , published this week in the Proceedings of the Royal Society .
Dr Jones and Dr DeBruine , themselves a married couple , examined what might be called the Deianira paradox .
Hercules , demigod and paragon of masculinity in the ancient world , was indirectly done for by his own sexual prowess — his jealous wife , Deianira , accidentally poisoned him with a potion she thought would render him eternally faithful .
Deianira 's predicament is a woman 's ultimate dilemma .
In a man , the craggy physical characteristics associated with masculinity often indicate a strong immune system and thus a likelihood of his producing healthier offspring than his softer - featured confrères will .
But such men are also more promiscuous and do not care as much about long - term relationships , leaving women to raise their kids alone .
Nowadays , sound parenting is often more important to the viability of a man 's offspring than Herculean strength .
That , some researchers suspect , may be changing the physical traits that women look for in a mate , at least in some societies .
A study carried out in 2004 , for example , discovered that women in rural Jamaica found manly types more desirable than did women in Britain , which led to questions about whether those preferences were arbitrary or whether women in different parts of the world might be adapting to circumstances that place different emphasis on manliness in the competitive calculus .
Dr Jones and Dr DeBruine therefore looked to see if there is an inverse relationship between women 's preference for masculine features and national health .
Sure enough , they found one .
In environments where disease is rampant and the child - mortality rate is high , women prefer masculine men .
In places like America and Britain , where knowing how to analyse health - care plans is more important than fighting off infection , effeminate men are just as competitive .
To test their thesis , Dr Jones and Dr DeBruine showed around 4,800 women from 30 countries 20 pairs of faces , in their online laboratory , faceresearch.org .
The faces were masculinised and feminised versions of the same features .
The women , who were all Caucasian in order to control for racial differences , were asked to rate each face for its attractiveness .
The results allowed the researchers to calculate an average “ masculinity preference ” for women from the countries in question .
Having done so , they compared their results with national - health indicators in each of those countries , including child mortality , life expectancy and the prevalence of communicable disease .
Since there is a strong correlation between these variables and a country 's wealth , they controlled for GNP per head by measuring whether it alone accounted for the difference in mating strategy .
They also tried to control for cultural factors using a questionnaire called the sociosexual orientation inventory index , which measures differences in mating patterns across cultures — specifically whether women prefer long - or short - term relationships .
Neither wealth nor mating pattern had much impact on women 's preferences for manly men .
Disease rates , by contrast , seemed to be directly related to how they went about choosing a mate — the healthier the society , the less women valued masculinity .
Hygiene and wimps , it seems , go hand in hand .
These results echo earlier research by Dr DeBruine 's thesis adviser , evolutionary biologist Bobbi Low .
She found that polygamy is more common in societies that have more disease .
In those societies , a modern Hercules can have his way because women prefer to share him rather than have a wimp to themselves .
Healthy living , though , seems to have tipped the balance towards Deianira .
I am one of four people who , in the week before Easter , made their way onto Swan Island , a secretive intelligence and special forces training base off Queenscliff , Victoria .
We were seeking to intervene in the eight - year - old war in Afghanistan by taking responsibility for what is happening in our local area .
Two members of our group stood in front of the gate leading to the base and the other two made their way inside the compound , where they switched off power to at least one sector and a satellite dish .
Our group is called the Bonhoeffer Peace Collective , named after Dietrich Bonhoeffer , a German theologian and Lutheran pastor who was executed for actively resisting Hitler .
Prime Minister Kevin Rudd has referred to Bonhoeffer as " the man I admire most in the history of the twentieth century " — however , Rudd ’s $ 100 billion long - term military spending plan and his pursuit of the war in Afghanistan belie a commitment to his hero , who acted to end war .
Our own actions were taken after much thought , and after we had tried other approaches also .
We have marched , held vigils , written letters to politicians and Defence staff , and held public meetings .
Yet despite the fact that more than half of Australia opposes this war , politicians have continued to use our military to wage it .
We decided it was time to act democratically — not with our votes but with our bodies and our lives .
In the mainstream media , people who take action are often marginalised by being painted as irresponsible fringe radicals .
" Activist " is made to sound like a dirty word .
Yet the four of us are actually very ordinary people .
Each of us has a family — two of us are married with children .
We are all Christians with stable jobs and responsibilities ( despite the epithets hurled at us by our arresting officers , such as the stereotypical , " Why do n’t you get a job , you f*** wit ? " ) .
I , for example , am a church minister .
It ’s unfortunate that many Christians have historically been compliant , if not complicit , in the wars of empires .
This is despite the fact that the Church remained true to the active nonviolence of its founder for its first 300 years .
Far from sanctioning wars and violence , Jesus calls us to love our enemies , to be peacemakers , and to overcome evil not with more evil , but with good .
But Jesus refuses to be passive in the face of injustice , and encourages us to employ the weapon of active nonviolence .
One of the most well known Bible stories is that of Jesus overturning the tables in the temple .
Jesus , having ridden into Jerusalem on a donkey in a parody of kingly rulers of the time , then proceeds to the temple .
Aware of how this system oppressed the poor and vulnerable , he symbolically and actually disrupts that system .
While he hurts no one , this act of civil disobedience is the final straw for authorities bent on doing away with this dangerous subversive , and they crucify him .
It was this story which inspired our action , and it was for this reason that we chose the week before Easter .
But the simple act of switching off some equipment being used to support war has given me reason to reflect on what it might mean if we all took more responsibility for switching off what we think is wrong about the world , and accepted the consequences .
Significantly , this term " switching off " has a dual meaning in our society .
First , we often talk about " switching off " after a day at work , maybe channel surfing through different TV shows to distract us from " real life " .
Second , as I have used it above , the phrase could denote intervening in a situation of injustice , making it difficult for that situation to continue .
One is passive ; the other requires something of us .
One is escape from reality ; the other runs headlong into it .
Much of our society is geared towards escape .
Generally speaking , we can avoid being confronted by the reality of starvation in our world , or by the brutalisation and terror of war , or the indignity of poverty — we just change the channel .
Engagement in issues of global justice — or even local justice — is often restricted to clicking a Facebook link or wearing a t - shirt .
At least when the drumbeats of war began to sound for the 2003 invasion of Iraq , the country turned out in the streets ; hundreds of thousands of people declaring , " Not in my name " .
But then the war began , and the people returned to their homes , most never to reappear .
I wonder what might have happened if instead of the personal distancing of " Not in my name " the slogan had indicated personal responsibility — something like , " Over our dead bodies " or " If you want to get to them you ’ll have to go through us " ?
Could it be that our refusal to be personally involved , to bear personal consequences , is the reason this war has dragged on for so long against our will and against the national interest ?
Here are the facts : Australia has invaded and occupied Afghanistan for more than eight years .
This war has killed tens of thousands of civilian men , women and children in two countries ( Afghanistan and Pakistan ) , both from starvation and direct killing ( 2,412 civilians killed directly in 2009 alone ) .
The war has caused millions of people to become homeless , or terrorised by the possibility that , at literally any moment , unmanned Predator drones could drop their deadly payload of Hellfire missiles on their home .
We have been militarily propping up an unrepresentative , corrupt , inept government in the country for that period , and have inflamed and fuelled an internal civil war .
Collectively US and ISAF forces have spent more than US $ 1 trillion doing this to one of the poorest countries on the planet , instead of spending that money building peace .
In the face of all this , Australians have , by and large , been silent , ignorant , and inert .
If Gandhi was right , that " nonco-operation with evil is as much a duty as co-operation with good " , then our failure to intervene carries moral responsibility too .
Perhaps it ’s because , in the developed west , war usually requires little of us .
With the significant exception of the men and women of our armed forces who bear a disproportionate degree of responsibility and reap a corresponding degree of brutalisation , including physical injury and mental illness , it ’s easier for us to go on with our regular lives , paying our taxes and delegating responsibility and real costs to others .
In contrast , an engaged peace requires personal work , time , resources , even preparedness to accept suffering .
The reality is that this war will soon enter its 10th year , with few signs of slowing or of achieving any of the purported reasons for our being there .
We all face the choice of whether or not we will merely " switch off " on the war or take responsibility for " switching off " the war ourselves .
The Bonhoeffer Peace Collective will face Geelong Magistrates Court on 12 May on charges of trespass on Commonwealth land .
Simon Moyle will be speaking at a free forum at Melbourne University ’s Centre for Theology and Ministry this Sunday 11 April for people considering taking action for peace in Afghanistan ( for more information , click here , or call 03 9893 4946 ) .
There are also monthly vigils for peace around the city of Melbourne .
The next one will be on the steps of Flinders Street Station , April 20 , 4 - 6 pm .
All are welcome .
" Capacitive Touch Janko Keyboard for Moog Werkstatt "
Blatant Blurb for Synthesizer Class
It ’s all over the news these days , because it ’s A Good Thing : the Web will be smarter and faster and better .
And for other reasons involving politics and vituperation .
I love parts of HTML5 , but it ’s clear that other parts are a science project .
And as a sometime standards wonk , I ’m puzzled by aspects of the way the spec ( not the language , the spec for the language ) is put together .
What ’s Good · I suspect I agree with most external observers : what ’s cool are the new elements like video , audio , and canvas .
And since I ’m a protocols guy , the closely - related Web Socket work ; more on that below .
I ’ve also enjoyed how the video element has shone a remorseless and very useful light on the patent - troll infestation standing in the way of better Web multimedia .
Progress is well under way on implementing the pleasing parts of HTML5 , and there are people thinking seriously that it may soon remove the need for compiled “ native ” applications on a variety of platforms .
That ’s good !
What ’s Bad ·
The process is clearly hard to manage .
On a couple of occasions I ’ve tried to take a sip or two of the HTML5 waters , and instantly been overwhelmed by the volume and intensity of the conversation ; “ drinking from a firehose ” applies .
It ’s something that you really have to do full - time to do at all , I think .
It ’s also self - evidently troubled .
This week we have HTML5 Editor Ian Hickson publicly accusing Adobe of placing a “ secret block ” on the HTML5 spec .
Adobe hotly denies it .
Simon St. Laurent writes up the story and then hostilities break out in his comments .
Not a pretty picture .
Is it possible that they ’ll fight through all this swampy stuff and get a good result ?
We ’ll see .
The Networked - Object - Model Experiment ·
One of the distinguishing features of the Web is that it has never specified APIs or Object Models .
Interoperability has been at the level of syntax : I send you these bits , here ’s what they are defined to mean , in response you send me those bits , here ’s what they ’re defined to mean .
And so on .
I have always felt that this is why the Internet and the Web took off so well , exceeding by orders of magnitude the deployment of other attempts to build networked application frameworks ( CORBA , DCOM , Jini ) that were based on objects and APIs .
The lesson , it seems to me , is that we just do n’t know how to do that , and interoperability should happen at the level of syntax .
The HTML5 draft seems to disagree .
It provides detailed algorithms for parsing HTML , even in the face of severe syntax errors , and specifies how the results of parsing should be used to construct the Object Model .
Thus , the syntax is ephemeral ; the Object Model , interoperable across the network , is what matters .
The theory is that if all the User - Agent providers implement all these algorithms exactly as specified , complete interoperability will be achieved and people who build Web applications need no longer concern themselves with the differences between User Agents .
Which would of course be wonderful .
Will it work ?
Nobody knows ; it ’s a science experiment .
Just because nobody has ever succeeded in specifying a workable networked object model does n’t mean this project will likewise fail .
But it does mean that when considering the future of HTML5 , we should recognize that this is a very hard problem , and there ’s no guarantee that that part of it will come off .
Which may not matter that much ; User - Agent implementors are increasingly subject to market pressure to be compatible , plus Web application authors increasingly work at a higher level , thinking in terms of things like Rails or jQuery constructs , thus insulating themselves somewhat from the compatibility nasties .
So for my money , I see little harm in the speculative parts of HTML5 if we get those tasty new elements , even at the current imperfect level of interoperability .
How To Spec ? · [ Note :
At this point , I launch into a detailed discussion of the design of specifications for network protocols ; the content will be of interest to a very small group of people , including almost nobody who just wants < video > to be here and work today . ]
This was provoked by Joe Gregorio ’s recent ( amusing ) Joel - in - a - box , calling out the excellence of the Web Socket protocol spec , which was produced by the same group and editor as HTML5 , and is in a similar style .
Joe admired the way it was “ clearly directed at someone that is going to be implementing the protocol ” , finding it refreshing compared to many other current RFCs .
By the way , Joe did an outstanding job as co-editor of RFC5023 .
So I went and read the Web Socket protocol and my reaction was more or less the opposite .
I like the protocol and I gather it ’s already been implemented and works .
But I found the spec hard to read , amazingly long and complex for such an admirably simple protocol , and missing information that seemed important .
Like HTML5 , it does n’t just specify the bits to be interchanged and what they mean , it provides detailed algorithmic guidance , and I quote for flavor from Section 4.2 Data framing : “ the user agent must run through the following state machine for the bytes sent by the server ” .
I assumed “ must ” meant “ MUST ” , and was relieved to find in Section 2 .
Conformance : “ Conformance requirements phrased as algorithms or specific steps may be implemented in any manner , so long as the end result is equivalent . ”
Thus , we understand that the algorithms are provided for their explanatory value .
Let me deep - dive on a couple of the sections to examine the difference between styles of specification .
I ’ll start with that state machine that was mentioned earlier .
Framing ·
The section describing the data framing has six numbered top - level sections , three steps for receiving data and another three for sending them .
The receiving - data part has two sub-lists of seven and five steps respectively .
It ’s all in a almost - pseudocode style and extends across a page and a half .
Here ’s how framing ’s done :
Messages sent by either side have to consist of Unicode characters encoded in UTF - 8 .
They have to be framed by a leading 0x00 byte and a trailing 0xFF byte .
Either side has to accept ( but discard ) message frames where the first few bytes , with the high bit set , give the message length .
Thus , a frame beginning with 0x81 0x82 0x83 0x04 has a length of ( 1 * 128 * 128 ) + ( 2 * 128 ) + 3 , or 16643 bytes .
( Presumably these are artifacts of an earlier version of Web Sockets ? )
When clients see busted UTF - 8 , they replace the damaged text with U+FFFD REPLACEMENT CHARACTER .
When servers see busted UTF - 8 , the behavior is undefined .
That ’s all .
Headers ·
If you go to the first illustrative example at the top of the spec 1.7 Writing a simple Web Socket server , you find :
Listen on a port for TCP / IP .
Upon receiving a connection request , open a connection and send the following bytes back to the client :
48 54 54 50 2 F 31 2E 31 20 31 30 31 20 57 65 62 20 53 6 F 63 6B 65 74 20 50 72 6 F 74 6 F 63 6 F 6C 20 48 61 6E 64 73 68 61 6B 65 0D 0A 55 70 67 72 61 64 65 3A 20 57 65 62 53 6 F 63 6B 65 74 0D 0A 43 6 F 6E 6E 65 63 74 69 6 F 6E 3A 20 55 70 67 72 61 64 65 0D 0A 57 65 62 53 6 F 63 6B 65 74 2D 4 F 72 69 67 69 6E 3A 20
Send the ASCII serialization of the origin from which the server is willing to accept connections .

At this point , I was wide - eyed ; exactly what is going on here ?
Maybe I ’m just not supposed to bother my pretty little head about what I ’m sending down the pipe ?
So I poured the hex into a little scrap of Ruby to find out what I ’d be sending :
HTTP/1.1 101 Web Socket Protocol Handshake Upgrade : WebSocket Connection : Upgrade WebSocket - Origin : server to accept connections from WebSocket - Location : script to run
Gosh , that sure looks familiar .
And , in fact , it turns out that the Web Socket protocol handshake is a lot like HTTP , in that the messages back and forth begin with a request or status line just like HTTP ’s and and continue with CRNL - separated name / value pair headers just like HTTP’s .
So , if I were an implementor , my first question would be “ Can I use my existing HTTP header library to read and generate headers ? ”
The answer turns out to be “ probably ” .
Web Sockets forbid continuation lines ( good ! ) and in some cases require that headers appear in a particular order .
It ’s possible that your HTTP library might do continuations or store the headers up in a hash and spit them out in a different order .
In fact , if you go to Section 4.1 Handshake , you ’ll find a algorithm with 24 (! ) steps detailing header handling .
Steps 15 through 21 , with conditionals and GOTOs , detail how to pick apart standard HTTP - header syntax : Name , colon , optional space , value , CRNL .
Um , wow .
For the Purposes of Comparison · Creating a spec in the HTML5 style seems like a whole lot of work .
The Web Socket draft is long , and contains mind - numbing amounts of detail , much of it replicated in multiple places in the draft .
I was a little uncomfortable that the draft leaves many of its design decisions unexplained ( e.g. why client and server must read and discard message frames with a leading byte - count ) .
I ’m wondering if the extreme difficulty of writing a spec in this style leads to a certain amount of triage on such niceties .
More evidence of the difficulty is that although this is labeled as draft number 75 , it ’s still at what I ’d call an early / middle state of maturity .
There are obvious quality / consistency issues here and there : monocasing of header names , whether to give messages as hex byte sequences or ASCII literals , fractured text about error handling , fuzzification in the counted - frame description .
Nothing terribly serious ( I ’ll submit reports in one of the appropriate places ) , and since there are apparently interoperable implementations , the spec empirically seems to work .
But I still found it strange and counter - intuitive .
I think this argument between the traditional and HTML5 style of specification is interesting , maybe important , and will be with us for a while .
So , as a contribution to the discussion , I whipped up an alternate version with the procedural specifications replaced , where I thought reasonable , by declarative versions .
I omitted all the sections which are the same as in the original version and all the closing material .
The top - level section numbers are the same , and also the subsections of Section 1 , except for I added a Web Sockets and HTTP Headers subsection .
Please note :
I am not proposing to replace or amend the Web Sockets draft ; this is purely for comparison of specification styles .
I am not claiming that my version of the spec is complete or accurate ; I only put a couple of hours into this .
On the other hand , if there are things I got really wrong , that ’s useful information because I ’m experienced at reading these things , thus others are likely to go similarly astray .
The declarative version is much shorter .
Is it better or worse ?
No , that ’s the wrong question .
For what kinds of specification is the HTML5 style better and for what kinds does the declarative style win ?
Policing the War on Drugs
Quotable :
“ We need to consider what drug prohibition has done to the vital profession of law enforcement .
It has divided police officers from the communities we serve , alienated us from young people , sent our call - loads through the roof , placed huge financial strains on police budgets and , sometimes , my colleagues have been injured or murdered while enforcing these drug laws .
Every police officer should question whether the War on Drugs is worth fighting , particularly when there are other policy options that would result in less crime , addiction , disease and death . ” — David Bratzer
I want to restore the rightful place of the police as public servants who protect and serve .
I want the people to feel that they can turn to the cops in times of need .
“ Divided from the communities they serve ” is exactly what we have now .
And that needs to change .

Something struck me when reading about the scandal in San Francisco regarding their drug lab ( and the fact that police apparently knew about the problems and did n’t share them with defense attorneys ) .
What hit me was the numbers .
San Francisco prosecutors may be forced to drop a total of 1,400 cases in the growing scandal at the police drug lab , including hundreds in which defendants have been placed in drug treatment programs .
The list of cases that could be dropped as soon as this week now encompasses 1,000 awaiting trial and 400 in which defendants are in drug rehabilitation programs
1,400 drug cases , with 1,000 awaiting trial ?
What is this – an assembly line ?
Those 1,400 cases come on top of 500 that have already been dropped , including 46 on Friday when prosecutors told judges they could not “ ethically go forward ” with the prosecutions .
That ’s a lot of drug cases .
How is it that they have time to do it right , or to do anything else ?
Oh .
A rare study that tracked thousands of children through adulthood found the heaviest youngsters were more than twice as likely as the thinnest to die prematurely , before age 55 , of illness or a self - inflicted injury .
Youngsters with a condition called pre-diabetes were at almost double the risk of dying before 55 , and those with high blood pressure were at some increased risk .
But obesity was the factor most closely associated with an early death , researchers said .
The study , published Thursday in The New England Journal of Medicine , analyzed data gathered from Pima and Tohono O’odham Indians , whose rates of obesity and Type 2 diabetes soared decades before weight problems became widespread among other Americans .
It is one of the largest studies to have tracked children for several decades after detailed information on weight and risk factors like high cholesterol were gathered .
“ This suggests , ” said Helen C. Looker , senior author of the paper and assistant professor of medicine at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York City , “ that obesity in children , even prepubescent children , may have very serious long - term health effects through midlife  that there is something serious being set in motion by obesity at early ages . ”
Dr. Looker added , “ We all expect to get beyond 55 these days . ”

Trans -Atlantic Irritation European Parliament Rejects Bank Data Deal
In a vote that American officials are calling a " setback for US - EU counter - terror cooperation , " the European Parliament on Thursday voted to reject a deal allowing US terrorism investigators access to international bank transfer information .
Europe , however , sees a victory for data protection .

The Palestinian Authority is funding and even participating in violent demonstrations against the construction of the West Bank security barrier , defense officials said on Thursday , warning that if not controlled the protests could escalate into a new wave of a Palestinian resistance .
The IDF has noted a growing presence of PA government officials at the weekly demonstrations north of Modi’in Illit , in Bil’in , Na’alin and near the settlement of Neveh Tzuf ( Halamish ) , where a top PA official was spotted two weeks ago .
According to information obtained by Israel , the escalation and funding has been endorsed by the PA ’s President Mahmoud Abbas and Prime Minister Salam Fayyad .
“ We have reason to believe that the PA is supporting and funding these demonstrations , ” one official said .
“ We are afraid that this will spin out of control . ” IDF sources described the Friday demonstrations as violent , noting that more than 100 Israeli security personnel have been injured in the past two years .
“ They throw rocks and sharp objects , ” one source said .
“ Once the demonstrators see that they have the PA ’s support , they are encouraged to act violently .
” While the IDF is not concerned that a third intifada will begin – due to the tight grip it has on Palestinian territory and the effective crackdown by PA security forces on Hamas infrastructure – there is concern that the new wave of violence could develop into a new conflict and undermine efforts to restart negotiations .
Abbas has in the past publicly endorsed the idea of a popular protest .
“ There are about 2,000 people who participate weekly in these demonstrations , ” the military source said .
“ While this is a minute percentage of the Palestinian population in the West Bank , it could grow and undermine all of our efforts to ease restrictions in recent years .
” The IDF is cracking down on the organizers behind the protests and on Thursday morning arrested Muhammad Khatib , a member of the Popular Committee against the Wall from Bil’in and the coordinator of the Popular Struggle Coordination Committee .
IDF sources said that Khatib was arrested because he had failed to sign in every Friday at a nearby police station , as ordered by an Israeli court following an earlier arrest .
Khatib ’s arrest , his Web site said , was the most “ severe escalation in a recent wave of repression again the Palestinian popular struggle and its leadership .
” Khatib , the site claimed , was the 35th resident of Bil ’in to be arrested on suspicions related to the Friday protests .
Will the health care reform bill that the Democrats are trying to figure out a way to ram through Congress end up being the biggest tax increase in U.S. history ?
Unfortunately , a close reading of the bill leads to the inescapable conclusion that it will be .
You see , the crafters of this legislation were smart .
They realized that if they included one huge tax increase in the health care bill it would make headlines all over the country , so they chopped up the taxes into a bunch of smaller pieces in order to make them easier to swallow .
In fact , one review of the Senate version of the health care bill identified at least 19 tax increases .
When you put all of the tax increases together they add up to the biggest tax increase in the history of the United States .
Considering the fact that the U.S. economy is already on the verge of economic collapse , the last thing that the American people need is a massive tax increase .
But that is exactly what they are about to get .
So let ’s take a closer look at some of these taxes … .
* In Section 5000 ( A ) of the Senate version of the bill ( which can be found here ) , there is a requirement for all Americans to purchase health insurance .
Those who do not obtain health coverage will be hit with an annual tax penalty of $ 750 .
* Barack Obama is trying to sneak a large Medicare tax increase for wealthy Americans into the final version of the health care bill .
Under Obama ’s proposal , individuals who earn more than $ 200,000 and couples who earn over $ 250,000 would pay an additional 2.9 % surtax on unearned income from interest , dividends , annuities , royalties and rents .
Up until now , employers and employees have each contributed 1.45 % of each paycheck to Medicare .
But if Obama ’s proposal makes it into the final bill , wealthy Americans will see their Medicare taxes absolutely skyrocket .
* In Section 9008 of the Senate version of the health care bill , a $ 2.3 billion excise tax would be imposed on the pharmaceutical industry .
This tax would not be based on income .
It would solely be based on market share .
So even if a company was losing hundreds of millions of dollars it would still have to pay .
* Section 9009 of the Senate version of the health care bill imposes an “ annual fee ” on medical device manufacturers and importers .
Once again , this $ 2 billion “ excise tax ” would be based on market share and not on income .
* Section 9010 of the Senate version of the health care bill would also impose an “ annual fee ” on health insurance providers .
This $ 6.7 billion tax would also be allocated based on market share .
So how much of these new taxes on health insurance companies , drugmakers and medical device manufacturers do you think will be passed on to consumers ?
Anyone want to take a guess ?
Just because a particular tax increase is not directed at you does not mean that it wo n’t take money out of your pocket .
Let ’s look at some more ( yes , there are more ) of the tax increases … .
* Section 9001 of the Senate version of the health care bill contains an excise tax on “ Cadillac ” health plans .
In other words , if you have provided your family with the very best in health coverage you get to be taxed extra .
This tax is particularly harsh .
Section 9001 imposes a 40 percent tax on the portion of insurance premiums exceeding $ 8,500 a year for individuals and $ 23,000 a year for family plans .
In order to hide the tax , it will be imposed on the health insurance companies who issue the policies .
But do you think that they will not pass that cost on to their customers ?
So now the American people will be highly penalized for getting really good health care plans .
* Section 9017 of the Senate version of the health care bill imposes an excise tax on elective cosmetic medical procedures .
Any voluntary cosmetic procedures will now be subjected to a 5 percent tax .
All of those boob jobs are about to get a lot more expensive .
* The House version of the health care bill would impose a 5.4 percent income tax increase on individuals making more than $ 500,000 and on couples making more than $ 1 million .
So if you are living the American Dream you are about to pay a lot more for it if the House version of the health care bill gets adopted .
Let ’s break this down a little bit .
Currently , the top income tax rate in the United States is 35 percent .
If existing Bush tax cuts expire in 2011 as Barack Obama wants them to , the top tax rate will go back up to 39.6 percent .
But this new “ health care tax ” would jack things up even higher .
Another 5.4 percent would take the highest tax rate in America to 45 percent .
That is before any state , local or property taxes are even paid .
Pretty soon it wo n’t even be worth it to work hard in America anymore .
But that is not the end of the tax increases .
A PricewaterhouseCoopers ’ analysis for America ’s Health Insurance Plans found that family health insurance premiums would be approximately $ 4,000 a year higher if the health care reform bill is passed .
Can you afford to pay over $ 300 a month more for health insurance for your family ?
Are you starting to get the idea ?
This health care reform bill will be an absolute financial disaster for America .
But considering the fact that the Senate version of the bill is 2409 pages long , hardly anyone will ever take the time to read the whole thing .
And yes , the Democrats are likely to tweak things a little more as they try to figure out how to sneak a final version through , but there is now one thing that seems virtually certain .
This is going to be the biggest tax increase in U.S. history .
Is n’t that exciting ?
A couple of weeks ago — or maybe it was a couple of years ago , I ’m not sure — the administration announced it would withdraw funding from the World Health Organization .
Here ’s what that does to the overall picture .

Patrick Andrade for The New York Times
For the past two years , thousands of taxi drivers overcharged passengers a total of more than $ 8 million by switching the meter to double the rate , the Taxi and Limousine Commission said Friday afternoon .
Using G.P.S. technology installed in cabs , the commission discovered more than 1.8 million trips where passengers were charged the higher rate .
The total amount of the overcharge was $ 8,330,155 , or an average of $ 4.45 per trip , the agency said .
The agency said that drivers manually switched the meter from the standard rate of 40 cents per fifth of a mile to the 80 - cents - per - fifth - of - a - mile rate that cabbies are allowed to charge in Westchester and Nassau Counties , but not in New York City .
To combat the overcharges , the commission said that within two weeks , a system would be installed in all taxis that would post an alert on the back - seat television screen when the meter is switched to the higher rate code .
The alert would stay on the screen until the passenger acknowledged it .
The scam was primarily perpetrated by a small number of drivers , with 3,000 of them overcharging more than 100 times , the agency said .
While the 1.8 million overcharged trips is a large number , it represents only 0.5 percent of the 361 million taxi trips taken during the 26 - month period the agency studied .
A single cabby was accused this month of overcharging passengers a total of $ 40,000 .
The commission has referred the overcharges to the Department of Investigation .
Former Liberal treasurer Peter Costello has launched a scathing attack on the Federal Opposition 's paid parental leave plan , accusing leader Tony Abbott of engaging in a " race to the bottom " with Labor .
Writing in Fairfax newspapers this morning , Mr Costello says Opposition Leader Tony Abbott 's plan is against Liberal party principles and will lead to higher taxes .
The scheme would give parents six months leave paid at full salary and be funded by a new levy on big business .
Mr Costello says Mr Abbott is engaging in a policy race to the bottom .
" [ Mr Abbott ] keeps being told he needs to appeal more to female voters .
So he adopts the Crocodile Dundee approach , " he said .
" In the movie a New York mugger pulls a switchblade on Mick Dundee .
Our hero laughs at the blade ' That 's not a knife , this is a knife ' .
The terrified mugger disappears into the night .
" The point of Abbott 's proposal is to tell the public that Rudd does not have a maternity leave scheme .
' This is a maternity leave scheme ' , he declares . "
" In this kind of politics if your opponent has a bad idea you try to outflank it .
Your opponent has a mildly bad idea so you come up with a more extreme one and race him to the bottom . "
The former treasurer also criticised Prime Minister Kevin Rudd 's health funding plan , saying that taking a third of the states ' GST is a bad principle .
Finance Minister Lindsay Tanner has seized on Mr Costello 's criticisms .
" Good on him for having the courage to point out how bad Tony Abbott 's scheme is , " he told AM .
" It 's interesting and very significant that somebody from the Liberal Party , and a Liberal icon like Peter Costello , would come out there and criticise Tony Abbott 's plan . "
But Coalition finance spokesman Barnaby Joyce told ABC2 New Breakfast that just because Mr Costello has spoken out , it does not mean his words are " gospel " .
And he denied Mr Costello 's comments have damaged the Coalition 's strategy .
' I do n't think so , " he said .
" We 've said that this is a levy and in the long - term we intend , like all levies , to remove them .
" Peter Costello was very good at bringing in levies and removing them . "
Jörg Kachelmann sitzt im Gefängnis : Der Moderator soll seine Ex -Freundin vergewaltigt haben .
Kachelmanns
Anwalt bestreitet die Vorwürfe , seine Firma glaubt an ein " Missverständnis " .
Deutschlands bekanntester Wettermoderator sitzt in Untersuchungshaft : ARD - Meteorologe Jörg Kachelmann steht unter dem Verdacht der Vergewaltigung und ist verhaftet worden .
Die Bundespolizei teilte mit , Kachelmann sei am vergangenen Samstag am Frankfurter Flughafen bei der Einreise festgenommen worden .
Auch Kachelmanns Firma Meteomedia bestätigte , dass der Moderator wegen Vergewaltigungs - Verdacht in Untersuchungshaft sitzt .
Laut bild .de wurde der Schweizer direkt festgenommen , nachdem seine Maschine aus Vancouver gelandet war .
Dort hatte Kachelmann von den Olympischen Winterspielen berichtet .
Die Staatsanwaltschaft
Mannheim hatte zuvor berichtet , dass sie gegen einen 51 - jährigen Journalisten und Moderator ein Ermittlungsverfahren wegen des Verdachts der Vergewaltigung führt .
Nach den bisherigen Ermittlungen werde diesem vorgeworfen , Anfang Februar seine langjährige Freundin nach einem vorangegangenen Beziehungsstreit gewaltsam zum Geschlechtsverkehr gezwungen zu haben .
Tatort soll ihre Wohnung im Rhein - Neckar - Kreis gewesen sein .
Im Februar hatte die Frau ihn angezeigt .
Danach erhärtete sich der Tatverdacht laut Staatsanwaltschaft .
Das Amtsgericht erließ Haftbefehl wegen Fluchtgefahr , denn Kachelmann hat keinen festen Wohnsitz in Deutschland .
Kachelmanns Anwalt , Professor Ralf Höcker aus Köln , wies die Anschuldigungen scharf zurück .
" Die Vorwürfe sind falsch und frei erfunden " , sagte Höcker der Deutschen Presse - Agentur ( DPA ) .
Die Beschuldigungen würden " jeglicher Grundlage entbehren " .
Auch Meteomedia - Sprecherin Stephanie Schleß bezweifelte den Wahrheitsgehalt der Vorwürfe : " Wir halten das für ein Missverständnis , das sich sicherlich schnell aufklären wird . "
Sollte Kachelmann dennoch vor Gericht kommen und wegen Vergewaltigung verurteilt werden , müsste er laut Staatsanwaltschaft mit einer Haftstrafe " nicht unter einem Jahr " rechnen .
ARD : " Es gibt ja noch mehr Moderatoren "
Auch die ARD - Programmdirektion wurde von den Meldungen überrascht .
Die Pressestelle wollte stern .de zwar keine offizielle Erklärung zum Fall geben , allerdings werde die Moderation " für ' Das Wetter im Ersten ' für den Rest der Woche jemand anderes übernehmen " .
Es gebe " ja noch mehr Moderatoren von Meteomedia " .
Obwohl die Verhaftung angeblich schon am Samstag erfolgte , habe auch die Pressestelle der ARD " erst heute von dem Fall erfahren - wahrscheinlich später als Sie " .
Im Laufe der Woche wolle die ARD aber eine Erklärung abgeben .
Wie lange Kachelmann in U - Haft sitzen muss , ist noch nicht abzusehen .
Ein Sprecher der Staatsanwaltschaft sagte , es sei nicht bekannt , ob ein Haftprüfungstermin beantragt wurde .
Seit 1990 für die ARD tätig
Kachelmann hat in der Vergangenheit öffentlich Aktionen gegen häusliche Gewalt unterstützt .
Noch Mitte Dezember präsentierte der Wetterkundler in Berlin beim Start einer Kampagne gegen die Misshandlung von Kindern ein Plakat mit der Aufschrift " Gewalt hinterlässt Spuren " .
Im deutschen Fernsehen ist der 51 - Jährige vor allem wegen seiner lockeren Wetterpräsentation eine feste Größe .
Er produziert Wettersendungen in der ARD - seit 1994 vor der 20 - Uhr - Ausgabe der " Tagesschau " und seit 2002 nach den " Tagesthemen " .
Seine Karriere bei der ARD hatte er 1990 als " Weatherman " beim Radiosender SWF 3 ( inzwischen SWR ) gestartet .
Damals hatte er sich in Bächli bei St. Gallen mit seinem Hobby selbstständig gemacht und die Meteomedia gegründet .
Mit dem Start des ARD - Frühstücksfernsehens im Jahr 1992 begann seine Fernsehkarriere .
In den 90er - Jahren machte er sich auch in der Fernsehunterhaltung einen Namen .
Er war seit 1997 viele Jahre Moderator der MDR - Talkshow " Riverboat " .
Keinen Erfolg hatte er als Quizmaster , als er 1998 die Neuauflage der legendären Show " Einer wird gewinnen " übernahm , die Hans Joachim Kulenkampff berühmt gemacht hatte .
To say that Minnesota is in a state of crisis when it comes to sexually transmitted infections is like saying sure , it gets a little cold here in the winter .
To say that Minnesota is in a state of crisis when it comes to sexually transmitted infections ( STIs ) is like saying sure , it gets a little cold here in the winter .
In 2009 , there were 17,000 new cases of STIs , the highest - ever level in the state .
Now , we have learned that new HIV infections have risen by 13 percent , the highest level in 17 years .
These numbers are surging for all ages and races and throughout the state , but no group is more affected than the teens and young adults of Minnesota .
Much has been saidabout how the abstinence - only education policies of the Bush era has led to the recent increase in pregnancy rates across the country .
Much less has been said about how those policies have led to an increase in rates of infections for STIs , but the evidence is mounting , especially in Minnesota .
According to a newly - released study by Planned Parenthood Minnesota , chlamydia rates for young adults have tripled in the last 14 years , and teens and young adults now account for 60 percent of all gonorrhea infections in the state .
Many of these teens and young adults came of age and went to school during the seven years during which Governor Tim Pawlenty has been governor .
Even before he began making drastic cuts in the health care budget that have become the signature of his current run for president , Pawlenty has spent years appeasing his conservative , evangelical supporters by cutting budgets for family planning , reproductive health care and sex education , instead championing abstinence - only education and providing more dollars to “ positive alternative ” groups that simply dealt with the resulting unwanted pregnancies by offering baby cradles and bible verses .
“ Although the Minnesota State Legislature passed legislation to promote comprehensive sex education , including programs that contain information about both abstinence and risk reduction , the legislation was abandoned under threat of veto by Governor Pawlenty , ” states the report from Planned Parenthood .
“ This lack of comprehensive , prevention - focused sex education has resulted in a generation of young people who are at an increased risk of acquiring an STI or HIV , and who are without the information or means necessary to protect themselves . ”

Planned Parenthood uses the study to call for a strategic response from legislature that includes greater funding of comprehensive sex ed programs , which they see as key to turning around the increase in STI rates .
They propose that these programs be “ evidence - based , culturally relevant and age - appropriate , ” and include both abstinence messages and information about contraceptives and health care needs .
But does such a program have a shot when you have a governor who is running for president by moving as far to the right on fiscal and social issues as possible , as well as fearlessly waving a veto pen in front of the legislature ?
And how likely are we to see “ controversial ” programs like evidence - based sex ed when so many legislative leaders are running for governor themselves ?
“ The problem we have right now is the budget deficit in the state , ” said Sarah Stoesz , Chief Executive Officer of Planned Parenthood Minnesota , North Dakota , South Dakota .
“ I think many of our legislative leaders would see this as an important issue to address , and would be glad to do so .
But this budget deficit and revenue stalemate has made it very difficult to advance a public policy for addressing the issue , and because of it our young people and the public health of the state has been abandoned . ”
“ The Minnesota Department of Health needs to acknowledge that this is a problem that must be addressed , and begin to speak out on the problem , They need to become activly involved in studying policy alternatives and putting it out there . ”
The public health community does n’t bear the sole responsibility for beginning discussions on lowering STI rates .
Parents , teachers and others need to recognize this public health crisis directly affecting our youth , both their current health and future fertility .
“ Unfortunately , ” Stoez said , “ because it is related to sexuality it becomes uncomfortable to talk about . ”
It ’s getting the conversation started that appears to be the major roadblock , as the solutions to the STI epidemic are ready to be implemented as soon as everyone is ready to start fixing broken policies like abstinence - only education and lack of contraceptive knowledge .
“ These are things we can address , ” according to Stoesz .
“ It ’s not like we have to embark on a longterm study on how to treat it .
It ’s all about [ the ] unwllingness of leaders beyond the healthcare community to grapple with this particular problem . ”
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. regulators are looking into how Wall Street firms like Goldman Sachs GS.N helped debt - stricken Greece arrange derivatives deals that critics say were used to disguise the size of its budget deficits .
Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bernanke arrives to testify before a Senate Banking , Housing and Urban Affairs Committee hearing on “ The Semiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress on Capitol Hill in Washington February 25 , 2010 .
REUTERS / Kevin Lamarque
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke made the disclosure on Thursday and suggested securities regulators also wanted the information .
“ We are looking into a number of questions related to Goldman Sachs and other companies in their derivatives arrangements with Greece , ” Bernanke said in response to a question from U.S. Senate banking Committee Chairman Sen.
Christopher
Dodd before testifying to the group for a second day on the state of the U.S. economy .
Bernanke said the Securities and Exchange Commission similarly was “ interested ” in Wall Street ’s activities in helping Greece do derivatives deals .
He stopped short of saying an official inquiry of Goldman Sachs ’ activities was under way by either the Fed or SEC .
The SEC had no immediate comment when contacted .
“ Obviously , using these instruments in a way that potentially destabilizes a company or a country is counterproductive , ” Bernanke said .
“ We ’ll certainly be evaluating what we learn from the activities of the holding companies that we supervise here in the U.S. ”
Goldman Sachs spokesman Michael DuVally said , “ As a matter of policy , we do n’t comment on legal or regulatory matters . ”
FED HAS STRONGER HAND NOW
In the midst of the severe financial crisis that swept the U.S. economy from 2007 to 2009 , Goldman and other Wall Street firms converted to bank holding companies , putting supervision of them more firmly in the Fed ’s hands .
Goldman Sachs has come under scrutiny for deals it did with Greece before it staggered into a debt crisis that has raised fears of a sovereign debt default and forced the European Union to say it will help if necessary to avert one .
The Greek crisis has pressured the euro and EU partners fear it may spread to weaker euro zone economies like Portugal and Spain .
Goldman Sachs entered into currency swaps with Greece , which critics say helped it disguise its debt , and has defended them as neither uncommon at the time nor inappropriate .
Cross-currency derivatives that Goldman Sachs conducted for Greece in 2001 helped reduce the size of its debt at a time when the country was keen to meet criteria for entering the EU and adopting the euro .
Goldman Sachs has a particularly high profile in Washington , having produced numerous alumni including former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson , many of whom still play active roles in key agencies like Treasury .
It also has attracted a heavy share of public anger over gold - plated banker pay packages , not helped by comments such as chief executive Lloyd Blankfein ’s assertion last November that the bank was doing “ God ’s work . ”
The bulk of Bernanke ’s testimony was a repeat of remarks he made on Wednesday when he told the U.S. House of Representatives that a weak U.S. job market means interest rates must stay low for a long time to try to spur activity .
A key uncertainty is whether the economy can grow fast enough in future to bring unemployment down at an acceptable rate , Bernanke said , a particularly poignant remark in view of a Labor Department report on Thursday that showed unemployment insurance benefit claims rising for a second straight week .
FINANCIAL SERVICES TOO BIG
With the Senate working toward a bill on financial regulatory reform , expected to be unveiled by Dodd early next week , Bernanke said in response to questions that he hoped it would lead to a downsizing in the importance of the financial services sector , which he said has become too big .
He appeared to pour cold water on the idea of a “ Volcker rule ” that would ban banks from engaging in so - called proprietary trading -- using government - guaranteed capital to make bets for their own account -- as the Obama administration had advocated but Congress seemed to be moving away from .
“ We all agree that we do n’t want excessive risk - taking , particularly not on a ‘ tails I win , heads you lose basis , ’ certainly , “ Bernanke said , but added there could be “ unintended consequences ” from such a rule .
He has said that banking regulators should get more powers to monitor and stop some bank trading activities if they deem it necessary to protect financial stability .
One key theme that Bernanke turned to repeatedly during a question - and - answer session was the need for lawmakers to come to agreement on measures for shrinking soaring U.S. budget deficits .
Republicans are reluctant to raise taxes and Democrats have measures before Congress , including healthcare reform , that would at least initially raise deficits , leaving the two sides stalemated on a wide range of fiscal issues and making progress on deficit reduction next to impossible .
“ It could become a problem tomorrow if bond markets are not persuaded that Congress is serious about bringing down the deficit over time , ” Bernanke warned .
Big deficits can erode confidence in a country ’s ability to repay debt , in turn driving the value of currency down and push inflation up .
The FBI and local police are investigating threats directed at House Democrats following passage of the health care bill , Majority Leader Steny Hoyer told reporters earlier today .
At least two acts of vandalism are being examined .
Hoyer said that he did not know the exact number but estimated " more than 10 " Democrats had received some kind of threat or harassment .
He added that some posters depict a lawmaker 's face in the crosshairs of a target .
No additional security has been added , Hoyer said .
" The incidents of threats whether in person or through telephones or through other communication devices have given great concern to members , for the safety of themselves and their families , " Hoyer said at a briefing .
" Clearly our democracy is about participation .
Our democracy is about differing and debate , and animated debate and passionate debate — but it is not about violence , " he added .
" It is about making sure that everybody in America feels free to express their opinion ... without subjecting themselves , their family or others to behavior , and frankly criminal behavior , in some respects , that undermines our democracy . "
House Republican leader John Boehner of Ohio said in a statement that while many Americans are angry over passage of the health care bill , " violence and threats are unacceptable . "
" That 's not the American way , " Boehner said .
" We need to take that anger and channel it into positive change . "

Lynchburg " Tea Party " member Mike Troxel claimed responsibility for posting the address , which he thought was the congressman's .
He urged voters to drop by for " a good face - to - face chat " to " express their thanks " for his vote for the overhaul .
" Just in case any of his friends and neighbors want to drop by and say hi and express their thanks regarding his vote for health care , " he wrote .
" I personally believe it's so important for representatives to remain fully grounded and to remember exactly what it is their constituents are saying and how they are telling them to vote .
Nothing quite does that like a good face - to - face chat .
It has a much more personal touch to it . "

Prescott , Arizona could n't handle it .
It was just too much for the Tom Tancredo - minded town folk .
A Spanish - language banner encouraging people to participate in the census is gone from downtown Prescott after at least four dozen citizens and two city council members questioned its appropriateness .
The banner spanned Gurley Street next to Washington Traditional School , assuring Spanish - speaking people that the U.S. Census would protect their personal information for 72 years and noting that the census helps get federal money for local hospitals and streets .
A similar banner in English continues to hang over Gurley Street about a block farther west on Elks Hill .
It does have two words in Spanish that translate to " make yourself count . "
Council members Steve Blair and John Hanna were among those who questioned the need for the banner in Spanish .
Blair said he received about 20 calls from people questioning the need for the sign , and Hanna said he fielded about 25 from unhappy people .
City of Prescott Executive Assistant Patty Crouse said she also fielded five or 10 calls from people angry about seeing a banner in Spanish near the entrance to the city .
Hanna said he personally did n't like the sign , either ... read on
SSL is the cornerstone of secure Web browsing , enabling credit card and bank details to be used on the ' Net with impunity .
We 're all told to check for the little padlock in our address bars before handing over any sensitive information .
SSL is also increasingly a feature of webmail providers , instant messaging , and other forms of online communication .
Recent discoveries by Wired and a paper by security researchers Christopher Soghoian and Sid Stamm suggests that SSL might not be as secure as once thought .
Not because SSL itself has been compromised , but because governments are conspiring with Certificate Authorities , key parts of the SSL infrastructure , to subvert the entire system to allow them to spy on anyone they wish to keep tabs on .
With SSL , any two parties on the Internet can make a secure connection between them , through which information can be passed without eavesdroppers being able to listen in .
However , the core technology used in initiating SSL connections has some problems .
The first problem is that although it allows you to create a secure connection between two parties , it does n't allow either party to prove that the person they 're talking to is the one they think they 're talking to .
The second is that if an eavesdropper can intercept the initial negotiation they can sit between the two other parties and decrypt and then re-encrypt the data sent between them , allowing them to see what 's being sent , without either party knowing .
Such attacks , where someone sits between the two parties and listens in on their conversation , are known as " man - in - the - middle " attacks .
They 're a big threat when trying to perform private communication over an insecure medium .
Fortunately , there 's a solution .
Until now , it had been broadly assumed that the CAs were honest and would n't give certificates to people they should n't , thereby keeping the entire system trustworthy .
The solution to both of these problems is cryptographic certificates .
A certificate provides an unforgeable proof of identity , allowing one person to verify that they are indeed talking to their bank ( rather than a hacker ) , and by incorporating certificate data into the set - up of the secure connection , the man in the middle can no longer decrypt and encrypt the traffic without being detected .
The problem with certificates is that on its own , a certificate announcing " I am Amazon.com " does n't mean much — anyone could make one .
To deal with that , certain organizations are trusted by SSL software .
If a certificate is issued by one of these companies , it will be trusted by SSL software .
The reason these companies are trusted is that they make some promise to verify who people are before issuing them with certificates .
In other words , before they 'll give me a certificate that lets me claim to be a bank or a well - known online retailer , they 'll check that I really am the bank or retailer , and only if I am who I say I am will they give me the certificate .
These organizations are called Certificate Authorities ( CAs ) , and their role in the system is essential .
Most Web browsers and operating systems have a set of certificates from a few dozen CAs , and will verify that the certificates used in any SSL connection can be traced back to one of those CAs .
If the certificate can't be traced back , the software will typically display a warning about an untrusted connection , and might even refuse to connect entirely .
The weak link here is that if a CA could be persuaded to issue a certificate to , say , Amazon to someone who was n't actually from Amazon , then all the protections fall apart .
Anyone connecting to the person with that certificate would think that they were connecting to the real Amazon .
Moreover , if the person could intercept traffic between would - be customers and the real Amazon , they could do the decryption / re-encryption trick to listen in on any traffic sent to and from the company .
Untrustworthy certificate authorities
Until now , it had been broadly assumed that the CAs were honest and would n't give certificates to people they should n't , thereby keeping the entire system trustworthy .
Though there have been attacks on certain aspects of the cryptography and handling of certificates by software , the basic design of SSL has been solid , and these specific problems have been solved by tightening policies and fixing software .
Unfortunately , these untrustworthy CAs render all the encryption technology irrelevant , as it can now be bypassed .
The security researchers found out that an Arizona - based network security company , Packet Forensics , was covertly selling a piece of hardware designed to perform these man - in - the - middle attacks — just as long as it could be provided with a suitable certificate .
The existence of such a product makes no sense without the ability to retrieve such certificates — which meant that CAs must be handing over certificates so that they could be used with the device .
Software for security researchers and / or hackers that could perform this kind of man - in - the - middle attack has been around for some years , but its utility has always been limited due to the difficulties in getting appropriate certificates ; the tools are useful in demonstrating the kind of attacks mentioned above , but have little practical value .
The existence of hardware changes things substantially — nobody goes to the expense of designing and creating hardware devices unless they can use them .
Packet Forensics initially denied that it even sold the devices , but eventually admitted that they were real .
The company sells hardware to law - enforcement agencies and similar groups , so these certificates might well be issued on demand of a court order .
But equally , they could be coerced by blackmail , or even outright theft .
This strikes a blow at the entire trust system integral to SSL .
If CAs can't be trusted , the SSL can't be used safely .
And it gets worse .
It gets worse
The set of CAs trusted by default by different browsers and OSes vary , but there are some commonalities between them all .
A few big CAs like VeriSign are supported as standard across the board .
These CAs might in turn be victims of court orders , blackmail , and so on .
But many platforms go further , and include government CAs .
That is , certificate authorities operated not by private , independent corporations , but by government departments ( typically government telecommunications monopolies ) .
The reason for this is to allow governments to avoid a dependence on external third parties for their cryptographic needs , but the result is this : any one of those governments could produce a certificate purporting to be from any site in the world , feed it into one of Packet Forensics ' machines , and use it to eavesdrop on encrypted traffic .
Because the browser will automatically trust a certificate issued by one of these government authorities , it wo n't provide any alert to the user that something is wrong with the certificate .
Everything will appear to work as normal .
It just wo n't be secure .
Now , a careful observer might be able to detect this .
Amazon 's certificate , for example , should be issued by VeriSign .
If it suddenly changed to be signed by Etisalat ( the UAE 's national phone company ) , this could be noticed by someone clicking the padlock to view the detailed certificate information .
But few people do this in practice , and even fewer people know who should be issuing the certificates for a given organization .
Even this is limited ; if VeriSign issued the original certificate as well as the compelled certificate , no one would be any the wiser .
The researchers have devised a Firefox plug - in that should be released shortly that will attempt to detect particularly unusual situations ( such as a US - based company with a China - issued certificate ) , but this is far from sufficient .
This gives governments considerable ability to intercept and eavesdrop on supposedly secure communications .
It 's true that the case is , at present , only circumstantial .
Just because a company is selling man - in - the - middle hardware that requires the use of court - ordered certificates , and just because companies like VeriSign make a lot of money from security and surveillance does not necessarily mean that anyone has actually bought or used the technology .
But it seems unlikely that a company would develop or promote a man - in - the - middle system if it could not be used .
Though the weakness of the CA system is well - known , the prospects of real attacks on CA trust seemed slim .
Not so any more .
VeriSign , for its part , refuses to comment on the matter ; other CAs , such as GoDaddy , insist that no such request has ever been made , nor would such a request be granted .
Update : VeriSign has commented to say , " VeriSign has never issued a fake certificate , and to do so would be against our policies . "
The value to governments — enabling largely undetectable spying on , say , Gmail accounts — could be substantial , as such tools are widely used among both terrorists and freedom fighters alike .
It 'd be useful in the growing international industrial espionage business , too .
And governments are certainly known to be interested ; Etisalat last year rolled out a BlackBerry patch that embedded spyware into RIM devices enabling monitoring of e-mail , so it can hardly be considered trustworthy ( in spite of its widespread appearance in trusted CA lists ) .
A robust solution is hard to devise .
The Electronic Frontier Foundation has made suggestions ; certificates could be independently certified by notaries ( though this only extends the level of coercion required ) , and the TOR anonymous routing system could be used to ensure that the same certificate was used regardless of location .
This would detect compromises made in , say , a hotel , Internet café or ISP , but would be ineffective if the monitoring equipment were placed close to the target server .
It might also be desirable to get browsers and OSes to trim their list of trusted CAs .
In particular , those that are prone to control by oppressive regimes such as the Chinese CNNIC would be good candidates for removal , to ensure that browsers at least present a warning when connecting to sites with their certificates .
In spite of the concerns , however , SSL is still the best system we have , in general , and for connecting to public sites like Gmail or banking , it 's the only option we have .
Checking for those padlocks is still worth doing — even if it does n't mean quite as much as we once thought it did .
NEW YORK , Jan. 6 ( UPI ) -- A U.S. Census Bureau spokesman said the use of the term " negro " on the 2010 Census is intended to offer some older African - Americans a new identifier .
The New York Daily News said while some African - American residents of New York questioned the use of the term in this year 's census , bureau spokesman Jack Martin called it a term of inclusion .

" Many older African - Americans identified themselves that way , and many still do , " Martin said .
" Those who identify themselves as Negroes need to be included . "
" Negro " has appeared on previous Census forms and the term 's newest inclusion was approved by the U.S. Congress a year ago , the Daily News said .
New York resident Greg Melvin , 41 , admitted while the term does not offend him , there are better alternatives to use for the Census .
" They do n't need it , " Melvin said .
" It should just be black or African - American .
It 's definitely unnecessary in this day and age . "
" It 's a bad vibe word , " New York resident Kevin Bishop , 45 , offered .
" It does n't agree with me , does n't agree with my heart . "
The life expectancy of a cat is about 12 years .
The popular notion is that one cat year is the equivalent of seven man years , but like so many human pronouncements about cats it is ( 1 ) interesting and ( 2 ) inaccurate .
The usual allotment of 12 years seems to be enough time for the cat to do all she might care , or reasonably expect , to do , and is quite long enough for her to become a fixture in human lives and for sadness to be felt at her departure .
The cat begins life as an appealingly helpless little critter , blind , deaf and toothless .
Its four - inch body wears a first thin coat of fur , marked and colored in the pattern which will distinguish it as an adult . .
The kitten is soon able to smell and taste , and then hear .
The eyes remain tightly closed , however ; sight is still a week or so away .
The kitten eats and sleeps — a completely self - centered existence , warm , soft and nourishing .
The opening eyes are blank and blue , and will be highly sensitive to strong light for some days to come .
As a rule , the eyes open in anywhere from eight days to two weeks , and are adaptable to extremes of light and dark at a month or five weeks .
But the timing in these developments is subtle and very much up to the individual .
Once it can see , the kitten naturally seems perkier , although it actually is still very limited in its capacity to support itself and move around .
Dear Dr. Roach :
My mother has been on anxiety medication for one year .
Her anxiety level continues to increase to the extent that she is unable to rest .
She currently takes 30 mg ...
PolitiFact has checked hundreds of claims about health care reform and read the plans under consideration by Congress .
As the Democrats move toward a final vote , we 've selected 10 facts about the actual health care legislation that every voter should know .
Agree with the measure or not , here 's what it intends to do and where the big unknowns are .
We 've linked to our previous reporting on each issue throughout the story ; click through for even more sources .
1 . The plan is not a government takeover of health care like in Canada or Britain .
The government will not take over hospitals or other privately run health care businesses .
Doctors will not become government employees , like in Britain .
And the U.S. government intends to help people buy insurance from private insurance companies , not pay all the bills like the single - payer system in Canada .
The key parts of the current U.S. system -- employer - provided insurance , Medicare for the elderly , Medicaid for the poor -- would stay in place .
The government would create health insurance exchanges for people who have to buy insurance on their own , so they could more easily compare plans and prices .
2. Insurance companies will be regulated more heavily .
They will be told the minimum services they must cover , including preventive care .
They will have to pay out a certain percentage of premiums for patient care .
By 2014 , when the exchanges open , insurers wo n't be able to deny customers for pre-existing conditions .
3 . Everyone will have to have health insurance or pay a fine , a requirement known as the individual mandate .
The government intends to cap premiums for people who make below a certain income .
For people who buy insurance on the exchanges , a family of four making $ 88,000 would have a cap of 9.5 percent of their income .
Lower incomes would have lower caps .
The fine for not having insurance would be a minimum of $ 695 per person per year , with exemptions for financial hardship and other special cases .
4. Employers will not be required to buy insurance for their employees , but large employers may be subject to fines if they do n't provide insurance .
But Congress wanted to encourage employers , especially large employers , to offer insurance .
So they created a fine for employers with more than 50 workers :
If those employees buy insurance on the exchanges and qualify for a low - income credit from the government , then the employer would have to pay a fine .
Fines are calculated based on number of employees ; for large firms , the fines could be significant .
5 . The vast majority of people will not see significant declines in premiums .
When President Obama talks about premiums going down , he usually means they wo n't go up as much as they would otherwise .
For the four out of five people who get their insurance through their employer , the savings would land in the 0 to 3 percent range by 2016 , according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office , or CBO .
People who buy insurance on their own , but who do n't qualify for government subsidies , could actually see their premiums rise by as much as 10 to 13 percent , but that 's largely because they 'll be getting beefed - up policies that would pay for more basic services , especially preventive care .
Low - income people who qualify for new credits to buy insurance would see the biggest drops .
6 . The plan might or might not bend the curve on health spending .
Critics say there are n't enough provisions to reduce waste or fraud , but Democrats say they 're not being given enough credit for new cost - saving pilot programs that could be rapidly expanded .
The most recent estimate of the plan , released Thursday by the CBO , said that it would spend $ 940 billion over 10 years .
But new taxes , penalties and cost savings would offset that spending , according to the CBO , so that overall the plan pays for itself , dropping the deficit by slightly $ 138 billion over 10 years .
Obama has said the plan will save more than $ 1 trillion in the second 10 years , but that estimate , according to the CBO , is highly speculative .
7 . The government - run Medicare program will keep paying medical bills for seniors , but it will begin implementing cost controls on health care providers , mostly through penalties and incentives .
The legislation would reduce payments for hospital - acquired infections or preventable hospital admissions .
For Medicare Advantage , the federal government intends to reduce extra payments , taking away subsidies to private insurance companies .
Insurers will likely cut benefits in order to not lose profits .
The bill does not address the " doctor 's fix , " an expected proposal that Congress usually passes to prevent doctors '
Medicare payments from severe cuts .
8. Medicaid , a joint federal - state program for the poor , will cover all of the poor , instead of just a few groups the way it currently does .
Right now , to qualify for Medicaid , a person has to be poor and also disabled , elderly , pregnant or a child .
Under the new plan , all poor adults would qualify .
9 . The government wo n't pay for elective abortions .
But under the Senate plan , people will be able to buy insurance that covers abortion on the new health insurance exchanges , as long as the insurance company pays for the services with patient premiums , not taxpayer subsidies .
Medicaid has an exemption for cases of rape , incest or the life of the mother .
10 .
No one is proposing new benefits for illegal immigrants .
Some House members had hoped that illegal immigrants would be able to buy insurance with their own money through the new exchanges , but that now appears unlikely .
How do dolphins SLEEP ?
How much do dolphins eat ?
How smart are dolphins ?
And , lots of other interesting facts ...
How do dolphins sleep ?
Dolphins have to be conscious to breath . [ 1 ]
This means that they cannot go into a full deep sleep , because then they would suffocate .
Dolphins have " solved " that by letting one half of their brain sleep at a time .
This has been determined by doing EEG studies on dolphins .
Dolphins sleep about 8 hours day in this fashion .
A dolphin's behavior when sleeping / resting depends on the circumstances and possibly on individual preferences .
They can either :
1. swim slowly and surface every now and then for a breath
2. rest at the surface with their blowhole exposed
3. rest on the bottom ( in shallow water ) and rise to the surface every now and then to breath . [ 2 ]
How smart are dolphins ?
The short answer to this is that we do not know .
There is no reliable method to measure intelligence in humans across cultures , so it is not surprising that comparing humans , dolphins , apes , dogs , etc. is impossible .
There are some indications of their potential : they are fast learners and can generalize ( which is also true of pigs ) .
Also they can learn to understand complicated language - like commands ( which is also true of the great apes ) .
How much do dolphins eat ?
Bottlenose dolphins eat several kinds of fish ( including mullet , mackerel , herring , cod ) and squid .
The compostion of the diet depends very much on what is available in the area they live in and also on the season .
The amount of fish they eat depends on the fish species they are feeding on : mackerel and herring have a very high fat content and consequently have a high caloric value , whereas squid has a very low caloric value , so to get the same energy intake ( calories ) they will need to eat much more if they feed on squid than if they feed on mackerel or herring .
On average an adult dolphin will eat 4 - 9 % of its body weight in fish , so a 250 kg ( 550 lb ) dolphin will eat 10 - 22.5 kg ( 22 - 50 lb ) fish per day .
How long do dolphins live ?
The maximum age for bottlenose dolphins is between 40 and 50 years .
The average age a dolphin can get ( the life expectancy ) can be calculated from the ASR Annual Survival Rate ( the percentage of animals alive at a certain point , that is still alive one year later ) .
For the dolphin population in Sarasota Bay , the ASR has been measured to be about 0.961 .
This yields a life expectancy of about 25 years .
For the population in the Indian / Banana River area , the ASR is between 0.908 and 0.931 .
This yields a life expectance between 10.3 and 14 years .
So the actual life expectancy differs per region . [ 3 ]

Placing small amounts of milk protein under the tongues of children who are allergic to milk can help them overcome their allergies , according to the findings of a small study at Johns Hopkins Children 's Center and Duke University .
The findings were presented Feb. 28 at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Allergy , Asthma & Immunology .
The approach , known as SLIT ( sublingual immune therapy ) , involves giving children small but increasingly higher doses of the food they are allergic to until their immune systems " learn " to tolerate the food without triggering an allergic reaction or triggering only mild symptoms .
Previous research from Hopkins Children 's showed that a similar approach known as oral immunotherapy can successfully treat children with milk allergies .
Unlike SLIT , oral immunotherapy involves consuming milk protein rather than merely placing it under the tongue .
The current study suggests that both approaches could be effective in treating milk allergies in most patients , authors say , but that oral immunotherapy appears to be slightly more effective than SLIT .
The investigators caution that the results are preliminary and that the two approaches must be compared in larger groups before their equal efficacy can be confirmed .
While both approaches work by exposing the patient to progressively higher doses of the allergenic food , SLIT is done with lower doses -- and therefore with lower risk for a severe allergic reaction .
Researchers caution that both therapies can lead to violent allergic reactions in some patients , and should be always done under a doctor 's supervision .
" We are very excited to see that both approaches can achieve significant improvement in children with milk allergies , but we continue to see slightly better tolerance in children on oral immunotherapy , " says lead investigator Robert Wood , M.D. , director of Allergy & Immunology at Hopkins Children's .
" Nonetheless , SLIT emerges as a new , if slightly less powerful , weapon in our arsenal . "
In the study , all 30 children ages 6 to 17 were treated with milk drops under the tongue ( SLIT ) for several weeks until they built up their tolerance .
Once minimum tolerance was achieved , the children were divided into two groups .
Ten children continued their SLIT treatment while the other 20 consumed milk powder by mouth ( OIT ) .
After three months of treatment with increasingly higher doses of milk protein , all children underwent a food challenge , which involved drinking milk under a doctor 's supervision .
All children in the " by mouth " group were able to drink on average seven times more milk without an allergic reaction or with mild symptoms compared to their baseline milk challenge before the treatment .
Nine of the 10 children treated with milk drops under the tongue , were able to do so .
Children in both groups experienced allergic symptoms equally often during the treatment .
In the " under the tongue " group , 33 percent of the 3,619 doses of milk administered caused symptoms , compared to 35 percent of the 3,773 doses in the " by mouth " group .
Most symptoms were mild , with the most common ones being mouth and throat itching and irritation .
Abdominal and respiratory symptoms occurred very infrequently , the researchers report .
Almost two years ago to the day , a team of officials from the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York quietly moved into the headquarters of Lehman Brothers .
They were provided desks , phones , computers — and access to all of Lehman ’s books and records .
At any given moment , there were as many as a dozen government officials buzzing around Lehman ’s offices .
These officials , whose work was kept under wraps at the time , were assigned by Timothy Geithner , then president of the New York Fed , and Christopher Cox , then the S.E.C. chairman , to monitor Lehman in light of the near collapse of Bear Stearns .
Similar teams from the S.E.C. and the Fed moved into the offices of Goldman Sachs , Morgan Stanley , Merrill Lynch and others .
There were plenty of reasons to send in these SWAT teams .
With investors on edge about the veracity of valuations on Wall Street — and with hedge fund managers like David Einhorn publicly questioning Lehman ’s numbers — the government examiners rifled through Lehman ’s accounts .
They also interviewed executives about various decisions , and previewed the quarterly earnings reports .
A ' quiet and lovely girl ' who lived in a small rural market town was named yesterday as the latest suspected victim of the deadly ' legal high ' mephedrone .
The death of 24 - year - old Lois Waters , a bacon factory worker , was confirmed as MPs attacked Home Secretary Alan Johnson for his continued failure to ban the so - called party drug .
Meow meow , as it is nicknamed , has now been linked to at least six deaths .
Found dead : Lois Waters , 24 , is believed to have taken party drug mephedrone - known as Meow Meow - in the lead up to her death
The Government 's chief drugs advisor has hinted that his committee will announce the drug should be made a Class B banned substance .
But it could take several months to complete the classification process .
Police investigating Miss Waters 's death warned of the nationwide threat posed by mephedrone , which is marketed as a plant food and is widely available online .
Detective Chief Insp Nigel Costello , of North Yorkshire Police , said : ' I do n't think people should be under the misconception that it 's only readily available in big cities .
It is n't - it 's available in small market towns also . '
Miss Waters 's body was found at a friend 's house in Norton , North Yorkshire , on Monday .
Family and friends said she had been taking mephedrone ' freely ' in the 48 hours leading up to her death , possibly with other substances .
Missed : Miss Water 's family today described her as a ' really lovely girl '
Her tearful mother , Alison , said last night the death of her daughter was devastating and that she was a ' really lovely girl ' .
The chairman of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs , Les Iversen hinted the drug would be banned .
He told the home affairs committee that it was ' amphetamines by another name ' .
Putting it in the same class as amphetamines - Class B - would mean carrying the drug would be punishable with a jail term of up to five years and dealing in it with up to 14 years .
His committee 's report will be published on Monday , but the mother of a girl killed by another ' legal high ' has already stepped up her campaign for emergency banning powers .
Maryon Stewart - whose daughter Hester , 21 , died after taking dance drug GBL - sent a mini-manifesto to all political parties detailing the action needed to protect youngsters .
Last week meow meow was linked to the deaths of Louis Wainwright , 18 , and Nicholas Smith , 19 , in Scunthorpe .

The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has released a report " State Tax Changes in Response to the Recession " in which the center notes that " national recession has had such a devastating effect on state finances that states took in $ 87 billion less in tax revenue from October 2008 through September 2009 than they collected in the previous 12 months .
This 11 percent decline , the steepest on record , resulted from the impact on tax collections of lost jobs , reduced wages , and lowered economic activity . "
And here we are , missing the forest for the Greek tree , and discussing evil CDS speculators ' role in Greece barely able to make a € 5 billion bond auction , when we should be all over the evil Municipal CDS speculators wreaking havoc in our own back yard .
And it actually gets worse : as we have pointed out , states are now running on fiscal fumes , as record unemployment insurance claims bleed the vast majority of state not only dry , but well in credit to the Federal government .
" At the same time , the recession has driven up the number of people needing various state services .
This , along with the requirement that states have balanced budgets , has increased the pressure on states to deal with the unprecedented revenue shortfalls in a variety of ways .
Nearly all states have cut spending .
In addition , most have opted for a balanced approach that includes revenue . "
So while Obama is about to break all campaign promises about taxing everyone , let alone those who make under $ 250,000 , individual states have already raised taxes by substantial amounts in an unprecedentedly short period of time .
In 20 states , tax changes are providing a significant boost to revenues — that is , they are producing additional revenue of more than 1 percent of the prior year ’s total revenues .
Ten of those states have raised taxes by more than 5 percent of the prior year ’s collections : California , Delaware , Florida , Indiana , Massachusetts , Nevada , New Hampshire , New York , North Carolina , and Oregon .
Personal income taxes and sales taxes , the two largest sources of state tax revenue , experienced the greatest changes .
Overall , 13 states raised new revenue from personal income taxes , 17 enacted sales tax increases , 22 increased excise taxes on tobacco , alcohol , or motor fuel , 17 increased business taxes , and 24 increased fees or other taxes .
Surely no sane man can believe that the tax respone will be appropriate or meaningful , as ever more people decide instead to either cheat , or to outright decline to pay these exorbitant tax increases .
But at least we can now proudly tell Papandreou that austerity has come to the US as well .
And to save the mainstream media some time in finding the next scapegoat , we present the Municipal CDX index .
Just in case it is not obvious to the ambulance chasers , here is tomorrow 's MSM headline bold , ALL CAPS glory : OH NO , MUNICIPAL CDS IS SURGING !
KILL THE CDS TRADERS , KILL THEM ALL !!!!
IT IS NOT THE STATES ' FAULT THEY ARE ALL BANKRUPT , IT IS THOSE SPLIT - TONGUED , SULFUR - SMELLING SPECULATORS WHO ARE WREAKING MARKET HAVOC !!!
Here 's an idea - why not just sell MCDX ?
If you think the market is so mispriced , just take the other side of the trade .
Ugh , logic .

I renamed my very first brush engine , sumi-e , I wrote a long time ago .
It was Google Summer Of Code 2008 , the year I joined the Krita team .
This brush engine started my joy over the brush engines .
I have improved it lately .
In hairy brush you do n’t define the brush mask , but you define the bristles .
Every bristle has a position and lenght .
For setting up the bristles I used to use Guassian .
I like this function for it ’s naturalness , that ’s why I used it .
The value of the function defined the lenght of the bristle .
But in turned out that it is not very effective .
It produces masks you never had enough control over its dimension .
You had to understand the sigma in Gaussian and not every artists care about math .
So I decided to reuse the brush dialog that is shared among the other paintops and use pixel masks to define the bristles .
Every pixel define the bristle .
The intensity and alpha of the pixel define the lenght of the bristle .
The position is computed according the center of the brush .
What it gives ?
Many new possibilities for shapes of the hairy brush .
You could have only round shapes before , now you can have any shape .
If the pixel is transparent , the bristle is not in the brush – that is the trick to have any shape .
Other bonus is that you can have colourful shape also , that was not possible before .
Confeti brush can define position and the length of the bristle
You can control the hairs spacing in the brush shape by parameter scale .
This parameter scales the position of the bristle from the center of the brush .
Next parameter is random offset .
The path of the bristle is randomly deformed according this parameter .
You can setup the limit of the offset of the bristle from the initial position .
So far the scale has been always controlled by the pressure .
I made this optionally now by adding the size sensor and implement that support in hairy brush .
So you can turn off the change of the size according pressure or you can control the size by different sensor like time or distance or tablet ’s tilt .
And now you can paint also grass more easily as enkithan reported to me .
Lukáš Tvrdý – Developer tries to paint grass
There were some performance problems also with sumi-e , now hairy brush .
I benchmarked and fixed the related bug and I introduced also some feature that helps with performance .
Usually the more bristles , the more slowdown .
I added possibility to control the amount of the bristles .
You can specify the percentage of the density of the brush .
Quite useful when you need big brush .
Related feature is also threshold according the pressure .
Now when you paint , only the bristles which are able to touch the canvas , will be painted .
Before I used opacity to control the used / unused bristles .
Now it is more fun .
You can turn off the size sensor and use threshold to control the size of the brush stroke .
Or you can combine as these features complement .
Next feature is called soak ink in Ink options .
Bristles can be colorified according the first contact with the canvas .
So you can use photo as the source of the color .
Or you can process some photo like I did to demonstrate the feature
Hairy brush used for post - processing image to give hairy look
I have some other ideas how to improve Hairy brush .
Rotation has to be also controllable according the sensors .
Ink depletion has to be reconsidered , more color effects has to be added .
The bristles should be more anti-aliased .
We will see .
Feel free to contact me if you have anything related to hairy brush features .
Here is the crop of the sketch that Boud , the Krita maintainer , did with hairy brush lately .
I like especially the hairs and the eyes .

The Shambles is one of York 's most popular tourist attractions A cobbled lane in York which dates from the Middle Ages has been voted Britain 's most picturesque street .
Shambles , which is lined with 15th Century buildings , took the prize in the Google Street View Awards .
The Royal Crescent in Bath and Grey Street in Newcastle came second and third respectively in the vote .
Hampshire 's Stockbridge High Street was voted " best foodie street " and Milsom Street , in Bath , " best fashion street " .
More than 11,000 people voted .
They voted for their favourites after five streets were shortlisted in each category by a panel of experts , including travel editors .
Ian Addyman , who owns a shop on Shambles , said it was full of " historic charm " .
He said : " There is a real feeling of community amongst shop owners and I think we all feel privileged to work in such a beautiful place .
The shops here are all strikingly different and unique .
" Most people say that if you visit York , then at some point you will walk down the Shambles .
" It has been the backdrop for many a jigsaw , chocolate box and railway poster and once you visit you will see why . "
The buildings on Milsom Street in Bath were originally grand town houses , but most are now used as shops , offices and banks .
Stockbridge High Street was praised for its independent specialist shops , tea rooms , pubs and restaurants , many of which serve local produce .
Do you live in a particularly picturesque street or area ?

" We have always related better with the British through the Conservatives than Labour , " he said .
" We have a better chance with David Cameron than with Brown . "
I 've been building websites with ASP.
NET for a little over 10 years now , and I have a dirty little secret to confess : I 've never Internationalized a single one of them .
It 's not from lack of trying , I can tell you .
I 've got a good dozen false starts under my belt , and plenty of hours spent studying the code from other people 's sites that implement Internationalization ( abbreviated as i18n for us lazy typists ) the way that Microsoft wants you to do it .
And my conclusion is that it 's just plain not worth the effort .
I18n is hopelessly broken in ASP .
NET .
Let 's look at this nice snippet of sample code to see why :
<!-- STEP ONE , in MyPage.aspx : Create Runat= " Server " Literal Control : --> < asp: Literal ID =" lblPages " runat= " server " meta:resourcekey =" lblPagesResource1 " Text =" Pages " /> <!-- STEP TWO , in MyPage.es-ES.resx : Create Message Key / Value : --> < data name = " lblPagesResource1.Text " xml:space= " preserve " > < value > Browse</ value > </data >
Notice that you need to make every single piece of localized text into a runat= " server " control .
And that you then need to add this crazy long attribute ( that Intellisense does n't know about , so you have to type out in full ) to each one of those controls so that ASP .
NET can find them in one of the Resource files that you need to generatefor every text fragment in your entire website .
If it sounds like a ridiculous amount of work for your developers , you 're probably being charitable .
In practice , it ' sextra work that nobody actually does it .
That , my friends , is the reason you hardly ever see any multi-language websites written with ASP .
NET .
Recently , however , my hand was truly forced .
We 're getting pretty close to launching FairTutor to the public , and since it has target audiences in both the United States and Latin America it pretty much needs to work in Spanish as well as English .
This is the part where I start wistfully looking back to a couple Django projects we did not too long ago , and the absolute breeze it was localizing those sites .
If only the rest of Django was n't so crap , we could just port this project across and …
Hang on a sec .
Port .
Yeah , how about we simply port that amazing Django i18n stuff over to ASP .
NET instead .
That was a week ago .
Today , I 'm releasing some code that I hope will single - handedly fix i18n in ASP .
NET .
It 's based on the way that everybody else does it .
Let 's pause a minute to let that sink in , since many of my fellow .NET devs might not have been aware of this fact :
There 's another way of doing i18n , and it's so simple and straightforward thatother web framework uses it in some form or another to do multi-language websites .
In Django , PHP , Java , Rails , and pretty much everything else out there , you simply call a function called gettext ( ) to localize text .
Usually , you alias that function to _( ) , so you 're looking at like 5 keystrokes ( including quotes ) to mark a piece of text for internationalization .
That 's simple enough that even lazy developers like me can be convinced to do it .
Better still , frameworks that use this gettext ( ) library ( it 's actually a chunk of open source code from the GNU folks ) , also tend to come with a program that will sift through your source and automagically generate translation files for you ( in .
PO format , which is basic enough to be edited in notepad by non -tech - savvy translators , but is popular enough that there are several existing editors built just for it ) , containing every text fragment that was marked for i18n .
The whole process is so simple and straightforward that you 're left to wonder why Microsoft felt compelled to spend so much time and effort reinventing it all to be worse .
Introducing FairlyLocal
I really want ASP.
NET to stop forcing people to monkey with XML files and jump through hoops just to show web pages in Spanish , so I 'm going to package up all this code and release it as Open Source :
At the moment , there 's not a whole lot to it .
It 'll find where you 're using the FairlyLocal .
GetText ( ) ( or its _( ) alias ) and generate .
PO files for you .
And it'll suck in various language versions of those files and translate text on your website .
Not much there , eh ?
But then that 's the whole point : i18n is supposed to be simple and straightforward .
Hopefully , FairlyLocal will make that an actuality for the ASP.
NET community .
I look forward to hearing your feedback .

We ’ve been trying to reform our health care system for almost 80 years .
Do you really want to start over ?
Bowel cancer is the third most common cancer in the UK A chemical cocktail may be able to destroy growths in the gut which have the potential to become colon cancers , say scientists .
Bowel polyps are not malignant - but patients may need to have them removed then undergo regular check - ups .
A team of US scientists reported in the journal Nature that their drug - so far tested on mice - could persuade the growths to disappear .
However , one specialist said it was too early to say if the cocktail was safe .
Many research teams are looking for effective ways to suppress or prevent polyps from forming among the healthy cells which line the colon .
These are a particular problem for people with a condition called familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ) , which increases the risk of both polyps and the cancers linked to them .
This can mean frequent colonoscopy checks , in which a camera is inserted into the lower bowel , to make sure new polyps or cancers are not present .
Side - effect hope
Any treatment to prevent polyps would have to be used long - term , so relatively gentle methods , which include supplements or diet changes , are being investigated .
The University of Texas study focused on the type of polyp which causes three - quarters of the 33,000 colon cancers in the UK each year .
The researchers attempted to directly target the mechanism which controls whether the cells in the polyp live or die .
In normal cells , this process of " programmed cell death " , or apoptosis , happens automatically , but in the polyps , the process does not work as well .
In laboratory tests , the experts found that their combination of two chemicals resulted in apoptosis in the polyp , without affecting surrounding tissues .
In mice bred to have large numbers of polyps and eventually tumours , the cocktail reduced the polyps four - fold and significantly extended lifespan .
The scientists say that because other cells appear to be unaffected , it is possible that the treatment could be used long - term with a minimum of side - effects .
Omega - 3 focus However , Professor Mark Hull , from the University of Leeds , said that the two chemicals involved would not necessarily be tolerated by the body over the decades of treatment required .
He is hopeful that his own research into an omega - 3 fatty acid , which has shown promising results in an early trial , will eventually lead to a way of decreasing polyp growth .
He said : " I believe that to be worthwhile , any form of chemoprevention should be beneficial in more than one way , perhaps in terms of heart health as well as polyp prevention .
" This is why I 've focused on omega - 3 , for which there is evidence of other significant benefits . "
He said that it was unlikely that any long - term treatment for polyps would remove the need for colonoscopy entirely , but that it might greatly increase the intervals between checks .

Wisconsin suffers record number of coronavirus deaths , hospitalizations
Wisconsin reported a record number of deaths linked to the coronavirus pandemic on Wednesday , with 27 more people losing their lives .
Sure , the maze gets boring every so often .
And yeah , there 's not much variety in the food .
But compared to the kill or be killed world of the wild , being a lab rat is a pretty good life .
So good , in fact , that researchers at the National Institute on Aging ( NIA ) believe many lab rats are so overfed they distort research results from experiments intended to help cure everything from cancer to Alzheimer 's to , you guessed it , obesity .
A sweeping year - long probe into racism at Ryerson University has found a staggeringly diverse campus where some visible minority students say they feel harassed and excluded , where profs do n't always deal with offensive comments made in class and some non-white staff report a " chill " that shuts them out of the power loop .
The 107 - page report , commissioned by the university after a string of racist incidents in 2008 , calls for immediate anti-racism training for senior staff , sharper targets for hiring visible minorities , more courses on diversity and the collection of race - based statistics on staff and students so the university can track whether equity is improving .
While noting most students and staff call the booming downtown campus " a great place to learn and work , " the report , to be released Monday , cites a worrying lack of diversity in faculties such as communication and design , a need for more ESL support in programs such as nursing and business , and more black professors across the board .
Ryerson is the latest Ontario university to examine how it approaches its growing diversity ; York University , the University of Western Ontario and Queen 's University have reviewed aspects of how they approach minority rights and cultural tension in recent years .
" Each and every one of us needs to take responsibility for the university becoming a truly inclusive environment , " declared the study by the task force of staff , students and community members that was co-chaired by Ryerson professor Grace - Edward Galabuzi and University of Toronto professor Eileen Antone , a member of the Oneida of the Thames First Nation .
Some of the incidents that prompted the appointment of the task force include the burning of an African students ' club bulletin board and death threats against a student leader for being a " race traitor . "
The report by the Task Force on Racism at Ryerson tells of students who say overt and subtle racism makes it difficult for them to fit in and at times makes the learning environment " toxic . "
" Fostering a racism - free and inclusive environment requires bold leadership , action and vigilance on the part of everyone in the Ryerson community , and there are key gaps the institution needs to address , " said the report , a copy of which was obtained by the Star .
" Many minority faculty believe there is a `chilly climate ' at Ryerson that includes stereotyping , double standards , isolation , exclusion and condescension .
One member put it this way : ` Many of us feel we are in a game that we do n't really know the rules of . ' "
A five - month task force at York University last year also examined ways to diffuse racial and political tensions on that campus .
The Ryerson task force used face - to - face interviews , surveys and forums to uncover a campus where some Muslim students resent having to lift their face - coverings to enter the library , where Jewish students have reported eight incidents of anti-Semitic harassment in 18 months and native students say security guards have mistaken them for homeless trespassers .
Others longed for teachers who look like them , especially aboriginal and black students .
The report calls for a powerful new Office of Equity , Diversity and Inclusion , with a vice - president or vice - provost at the helm , to give teeth to harassment investigations and spearhead new anti-racism curriculum .
The office should also organize a pilot " Census Day " where staff and students are asked to fill in questionnaires about their race , language and culture to allow Ryerson to begin tracking the demographics of student achievement and equal employment .
Some of the anecdotes are poignant .
Black students reported problems finding classmates willing to do group work with them , saying they sometimes feel shunned on the basis of stereotypes about not being hard - working or being " dumb . "
Some observant Muslim students complained teachers often use jokes about sex that can make them uncomfortable .
One professor who was teaching students how to modulate their voices for radio told the class to pretend they were having sex and to imagine the voice they heard when they experience " pleasure . "
Other students joined in and began making " very weird noises , " leaving some students very uncomfortable .
Among the report 's recommendations :
- evaluate managers and department heads in part by how well they have fostered diversity ;
- have the Learning and Teaching Office develop guidelines for dealing with unwanted classroom behaviour ;
- develop a course on anti-racism , anti-colonialism , anti-Semitism , Islamophobia , sexism , homophobia and disability that is open to all students and could be considered as mandatory in future ;

LOGAN -- Logan police are working on a sadistic animal cruelty case .
They say a man held his dog upside down and shot it with Airsoft bullets .
Those bullets are n't lethal , but they do hurt at close range .
When police learned of the crime , they took the man to jail .
The Jack Russell terrier , named Bean , was taken to the Cache Humane Society shelter .
When Bean showed up last week , kennel manager Joanna Gardner was surprised at how well he interacted with people -- especially after police say his former owner shot his testicles several times with an Airsoft gun .
" Honestly , it breaks my heart , " says Gardner .
" I mean , I do n't understand how people can do that to an animal . "
Bean , the Jack Russell terrier , was brought to the Cache Humane Society Shelter after police arrest his owner on animal cruelty charges .
" We had an anonymous call[er ] who was aware of the situation , who came forward and told us about what had happened , " says Logan police Capt .
Jeff Curtis .
Logan police arrested 22 - year - old Emilio Hoy .
He was charged with animal cruelty .
" He was holding the dog by its tail , upside down , and he was shooting it with an Airsoft gun at close range , " Curtis says .
Hoy is now in jail .
Investigators say when they first went to his house to ask him questions about the dog , he acted like he did n't know what they were talking about .
" He denied any abuse with the dog , " Curtis says .
That 's when police told him they had video from inside his Logan house of him shooting the dog .
Turns out , someone recorded the incident and gave the video to police .
Bean was taken to the shelter , where people have already called about adopting him .
" We 've gotten three calls today , and that 's quick , " says shelter director Michael Bishop .
It looks like the rest of Bean 's story is going to include a loving family .
In a strange twist to this case , when police went to Hoy 's house they found he had a gunshot wound .
Hoy told police he got into a fight with a man trying to steal parts from his car , and that he removed the bullet himself .
Police say they 're now working on that case .

BEIJING - North Korea said yesterday that it will begin to allow in more American tourists after years of heavy restrictions on visits to the isolated country , according to a tour operator .
The United States has never had diplomatic relations with North Korea since the Korean War ended in a truce , not a peace treaty .
More recently , tensions have remained high over the North ’s nuclear program .
Only about 2,000 tourists from the United States have visited since the country opened to Western tourism in 1987 , according to the founder of a China - based tour group that says it has taken most of those visitors into the isolated country .
But the Koryo Group , which specializes in North Korea tourism , said it received an e-mail from the state - run Korea International Travel Company yesterday afternoon saying the country will accept more American tourists this year .
The message gave no explanation for the move and said more specific information would come later , the agency ’s founder , Nicholas Bonner , said .
“ This is a big , big change , ’’ he said .
Tensions with the outside have risen in recent years over the North ’s pursuit of nuclear weapons , with Pyongyang saying this week that it would not resume negotiations aimed at ending such programs until its relations with the United States improve and international sanctions against it are lifted .
The United States rejected the proposal .
In recent years , Americans have been allowed to visit North Korea only briefly during the country ’s Mass Games , a synchronized propaganda spectacle with a cast of 100,000 .
Bonner said his Beijing - based agency escorted about 280 American tourists to the country last year , but estimated those numbers could jump to about 1,000 per year if restrictions were eased .
He said his agency handles about 90 percent of the Americans visiting North Korea .
North Korea is governed by a secretive , hard - line communist regime whose motivations and decision - making processes remain obscure .
The US State Department has no travel warning for North Korea .

Two new Gallup polls reveal Americans are becoming less concerned about the state of the environment .
A survey released yesterday shows just 34 percent of the public is worried a “ great deal ” about the environment , down from 40 percent the year before .
Meanwhile , a poll published today reveals Americans are less troubled about pollution , global warming , deforestation , and animal and plant extinction than at any point in the past 20 years .
There are two ways to decipher these numbers .
One is that the public is more content with environmental progress than before , so they have less to gripe about .
Obama is certainly a more eco-friendly president than Bush , the climate bill is a buzzed - about legislative possibility , and the stimulus was a relative boon for the planet .
But the statistics may also indicate public indifference or even apathy .
Thanks in large part to partisan bickering and scandals such as Snowpocalypse and ClimateGate , confusion over global warming has reached a fevered pitch .
At the same time , the economic slump is swallowing the public ’s attention .
What we may be witnessing is an endemic shift in prioritization , which raises the question :
What , if anything , can instill a renewed sense of purpose ?
( CNN ) --
All 64 students and crew on a Canadian ship that sank 300 miles from the Brazilian coast have been rescued , a Canadian air force officer said Friday afternoon .
The Canadians were aboard the West Island College Class Afloat school ship Concordia as part of a 10 - month accredited high school and university program .
The ship was traveling between Recife , Brazil , and Montevideo , Uruguay .
" It 's a tragedy to lose a ship , but a victory that they were rescued , " said Maj.
Denis McGuire of the Canadian Joint Rescue and Coordination Center .
The students and crew had been aboard three lifeboats in the Atlantic Ocean and were picked up by two nearby merchant vessels , McGuire said .
The Canadians will be transferred to a Brazilian navy ship and taken to shore , McGuire said .
Brazilian media reported that the transfer will be done by helicopter .
The Concordia started sending out a distress signal Thursday , West Island College said on its Web site .
It was not immediately known when or why it sank .
The ship left Recife on February 8 and was scheduled to dock in Montevideo next week , the Brazilian navy said in a news release .
The discovery set off a scramble to ensure voting machines had not been compromised and to contain the fallout .
City officials said the theft would not disrupt the election .
How a Realtime SMS Questions Service Scaled To Super Bowl Traffic with Rails
When the UK - based Rails team at kgb was given ten weeks to scale their SMS question - answering " microwork " service for a Super Bowl ad , they did n't have much headroom left for more traditional Web scaling approaches .
In this article , KGB developer J. Nathan Matias looks at how they prepared a high traffic Rails app to " scale down " during an expected rush of Super Bowl traffic .
Credit
J. Nathan Matias was a software engineer at the Knowledge Generation Bureau , where he wrote code to instrument , performance test , and scale their Rails - based SMS service until April 2010 .
A regular speaker at arts and technology events , he is also founder of the World University Project and has a passion for using technology to advance education and human understanding .
Intro
Our SMS question - answering " microwork " service ( 542 542 ) was already modular in a performance - friendly way ( the subject of our RailsConf 2008 talk ) .
Not much in our Turk - like answers system is cacheable .
More mongrels would only overload our database .
We did n't have time to shard .
Our Super Bowl ad , the business told us , would generate two orders of magnitude greater volume than our historical peak .
Over 100 million people would be watching , and nearly every text sent in by Super Bowl customers needed a human response !
With such a tight deadline , we needed two things above all : clarity about our goals , and good - enough solutions we could build in no time flat .
Over the next few weeks , I 'm going to be posting occasionally about what we did to scale our Rails apps for the Super Bowl .
Where applicable , I 'll try to include practical examples and insight from the experts at EngineYard , Percona , MX Telecom , and New Relic who helped us out .
Graceful Degradation on SMS Services
I 'll write in later posts about what we did to measure and improve Rails performance .
Yet even as we tried to scale our apps , we had to be prepared for the likelihood that those efforts would n't be enough .
We had already run performance tests .
We regularly keep an eye on our NewRelic instrumentation .
Everything we knew about our architecture , MySQL scaling , and our apps ' actual performance clearly put that our peak capacity far below the customer spikes we could expect from a Super Bowl ad .
On most web apps , when customer volume amps up beyond the capacity , the right response is usually graceful degradation -- serving simplified or reduced functionality to handle the load ( c.f. Brewer 's excellent " Lessons from Giant - Scale Services " ) .
For noncritical areas , simply serve a fail whale and ask people to try again later .
The servers can then breathe a little more freely to handle the important stuff .
These approaches work fine on the web , but are simply unacceptable for our realtime microwork service at kgb .
For both web and SMS apps , response time is absolutely critical to customer satisfaction .
Differences between these techs require different scaling approaches , and we work with both at the same time .
Almost every SMS gets passed directly to our workers on the web , who we call " agents " .
An agent 's response then travels from the web to the customer via SMS .
So for each question answered , we faced three scaling issues not commonly confronted on web - only apps :
Incoming questions could exceed our agents ' capacity to answer them
System load from thousands of agents on our web app could hurt our ability to process incoming text messages , resulting in frustrated agents and dissatisfied customers
Floods of incoming questions could slow down our answering app , spiralling down our agent efficiency .
The growing backlog would further send our performance problems out of control
Choosing Graceful Degradation Approaches
Planning for graceful degradation requires a solid understanding of your system bottlenecks , your technical options for degrading , and your business requirements .
Early on , we made a big list of everything we could simplify or turn off .
I think these examples represent the kind of choices anyone might face in a similar situation :
The first approach is to simplify the interface .
Since SMS is plaintext , we could n't simplify our SMS frontend any further .
On the web side , we did n't have time to retrain our agents on a simpler UI .
Turning off interface elements is easy with our modular architecture ( talk | github ) .
But some of our most expensive controller actions actually reduce system load -- by taking one request to do several jobs .
Nor can we resort to fail whales and simply turn things off .
Mobile carrier policies and government regulations require our service to step through dances such as " opt- in " and " opt- out " , two common billing protocols where positive confirmation is required for customers of paid SMS services .
The SMS equivalent of a 503 error when a user tries to cancel the service could give us problems with the carriers or a regulation authority .
503s were also unacceptable on the web ; they would simply increase the risk of falling behind customer demand .
Instead of radically changing the interface or sending out error messages , we focused on alternative logic for our controllers which could be activated without a restart .
For example , we could reduce agents ' choice over which questions to answer .
Agents might be less happy and we might face other product tradeoffs but our overall service would be healther .
Some parts of the system , like the model which verifies that answers meet business rules , had to remain untouched .
Our very last resort would be to automatically log out a percentage of random agents .
Unlike many traffic spikes , we knew when this one would happen , and when it would probably end .
So we could safely turn off nonessentials , such many of our cron jobs , business reports , and the AI which schedules our shifts .
Using Daemons to Make Scaling Decisions
On some ideal imaginary service , graceful degradation is like peeling an onion .
As things get worse , you keep peeling away the least important layer of service .
For our system , with its competing risks from human and system capacities , we needed quick decisions from a complex mix of factors .
Some decisions absolutely require human decisions , and we built a dashboard for making them .
But we put as much power as possible into a ruby daemon we built to keep track of our system and make those decisions itself .
If you 're not familiar with Rails daemons or how to write one , you can check out Railscast # 129 : Custom Daemon , or Tammer Saleh 's great slides -- " Angels and Daemons " -- from RailsConf 2007 for an overview .
In most cases , you probably should n't focus your daemon on system monitoring .
It 's probably much better to base decisions on simple business reports .
Rules like this do n't make sense if you 're planning to run hot :
If the database load average is too high , kick agents off the system to cool things down
In contrast : rules like these make sense as business decisions :
If most questions are taking too long to answer , send apologies about the wait
If messages are sending at too low a rate , turn off or delay some outgoing message types
Seriously - resist the temptation to waste your time writing a system monitoring daemon .
System metrics are simply not specific enough , and they say nothing about what will happen next .
Look at what happened to us on Super Bowl Sunday :
Within seconds of our TV ad , we were slammed by a massive spike of incoming messages
Our servers soon hit their peak capacity for receiving questions , which started to pile up outside our system
The rate of incoming messages was well over our agents ' answer rate
Load average on the servers was freaking out
Under the load , response times slowed down to more than twice their healthy average
If you expect the system to reach its peak performance , system metrics only show you what you expect : that the system is struggling .
System load information can't tell you what part of your app is suffering .
Response times are more specific , but momentary bottlenecks in one controller might be caused by an ugly query somewhere else .
Result : needless panic .
In contrast , decisions based on business metrics can focus on your actual experience and business priorities .
We already knew the shape of TV - driven volume from our other ads .
So we expected a spike of traffic which would tail off gently .
If questions came in faster than we could answer them , we wanted to deal with the spike as quickly as possible by pushing the system as hard as it could go .
On Super Bowl Sunday itself , a trigger - happy monitoring daemon could have kept our servers happy but delivered a bad customer experience .
Instead , our business - focused rules held their fire .
The backlog of questions nearly reached the decision threshholds , and then returned to safe levels as the spike tailed off .
Job done .
SMS Steam Valves
The SMS nature of our business could have been our demise .
In this case , I think it played in our favour , smoothing out the traffic spike and giving us one last resort for fault tolerance .
Most webservers have the luxury of a logical connection to the client .
On SMS , we must deal with a highly asynchronous client interaction in exchange for the ability to charge micropayments .
On Super Bowl day , we expected this nasty gang of issues to stand in the way of good customer experience :
We can't know how long it took for a message to reach us , since SMS does n't consistently timestamp the message origin
Some carriers do n't tell us how long a message takes to reach our customer , although we are eventually told if it arrived
We switched off those SMS delivery reports for some carriers to gain extra capacity , so we would n't know until later if our messages had arrived
We should be prepared for mobile networks ( which famously run close to capacity ) to have throughput problems , even outages
Mobile network outages tend to hit our system hard .
As soon as the carrier fixes something , our system gets slammed by the backlog of messages
All of these risks were amplified on Super Bowl Sunday .
We were spending a lot of money on ads which touted the speed of our service -- on the day when network reliability is least knowable .
If a message takes ten minutes to reach us , the customer is already lost before we start .
Without any record of send time , we have no easy way to prioritise service .
Even if our star agents fired out super - speed texts of pure enlightenment , our perfect answers might limp along with Kafkaesque inefficiency .
On the other hand , the complexities of mobile networks gave us a great last - resort load balancing option .
Each carrier 's network is a bit different , so we use an SMS gateway by MX Telecom .
They manage our connections to the networks ; we simply send and receive messages via a web service .
MX queued our incoming and outhoing messages to smooth out our connection to the carriers .
Then , if our systems were well and truly up against the wall , MX could turn on a simple Super Bowl SMS quiz to save customers and give our servers a break .
As you can see in this graph , the queuing at MX Telecom made it possible for us to survive the customer onslaught .
Delays are bad for customer satisfaction , but we were also trying to prevent too much volume from overloading our servers .
SMS network latency also probably helped us .
Between the queuing and SMS latency on Super Bowl Sunday , the load was smoothed out just enough to make the last resort unnecessary .

Merida , March 22nd , 2010 ( Venezuelanalysis.com ) – On Sunday the Venezuelan government added 24 public internet or “ info- centres ” to its current 644 and president Hugo Chavez turned over 15 of the centres to communal council control .
On his show ‘ Hello President , ’ broadcast from the National Library in Caracas Sunday , Chavez inaugurated one of the info - centres , which includes a special area for disabled people and trained attendees to assist them , along with the standard free computer and internet access .
Added to the 23 other new info -centres in 10 different states across the country , the government approved BsF 50 million ( US $ 11.6 million ) to be spent on 200 new info - centres this year .
“ The Bolivarian revolution is inclusive , socialism is inclusive , capitalism is exclusive .
These [ info - centres ] would be impossible under capitalism , unless people paid a fortune , ” Chavez said .
In 2000 there were over 800,000 internet users and at the start of last year there were 7,552,570 users , an increase of over 900 % , Chavez said .
Thirty - eight percent , or nearly three million people use the info - centres , and 30 % of those use the centres daily .
Also , according to Chavez , 53 % of the total population have access to the internet , the highest figure in Latin America , and well above Latin America ’s average of 35 % , according to a 2008 Latinobarometro report .
This has been made possible by CANTV ( the state owned telecommunications company ) expanding its fibre optic network and installing satellite technology and 2,000 antennas in hard to reach rural areas , along with the info -centres .
“ No one reports this , instead they spread the false news around the world that we ’re going to ... restrict [ internet ] services , but our main strategy is to transfer power to the people and the most important type of power is knowledge , ” Chavez said .
Last week , after Chavez publically criticised one website for falsely reporting the assassination of a government official , private national and mainstream international media accused the Venezuelan government of wanting to censor the internet .
Chavez also read out an act of management transfer , where a list of 15 info - centres were handed over from the state or its institutions to some of the strongest and well organised communal councils .
These communities will be able to collectively control the centres , will also need to maintain the centres and promote activities carried out there , will promote links between the centre and other community organisations , will authorise use of the centre for community work , and will complete quarterly reports to the government on activities carried out .
“ The info - centre project should have as its main aim , strengthening popular power ... in order to accelerate the construction of socialism through the use and appropriation of information and communication technology , ” Chavez said .
“ The info - centres have helped communities to elaborate their own ... news , promote events , and use community media , ” he added .
Mr. President and Gentlemen of Virginia : I have had the honor to present you , sir , and this Convention my credentials , as Commissioner from the Government of South Carolina , and , upon your reception of these credentials , I am instructed by my Government to lay before you the causes which induced the State of South Carolina to withdraw from the Union , and the people of South Carolina to resume the powers which they had delegated to the Government of the United States of America .
In performing this duty , gentlemen , I am not instructed by my Government , nor is it my intention to endeavor to make before you an argument in proof of the right of secession .
My State , in its sovereign capacity , assumed that right , and my ministry here is only to lay before you those reasons which she deemed sufficient to enforce upon her the necessity of exercising that right .
The very learned and comprehensive argument of my countrymen from Georgia and Mississippi , confine me into a very narrow scope of statement .
In laying these causes before you , it will be quite sufficient , as preliminary to this statement , that I should submit for your consideration a few historical facts bearing upon the relations of these States to each other , and to the late Federal Government of the United States .
It will be recollected by all that the British Colonies of North America , save by contiguity of territory , held no nearer political Union with each other than they did with the Colonies under the same Government at remote parts of the empire .
They had a common Union , and a common sovereignty in the Crown of Great Britain .
But when that Union was dissolved , each colony was remitted to its own ministry as perfectly as if it was separated from the other by the oceans of the empire .
But being of joint territory , and having common interests , and having identical grievances against the mother country , the people of these colonies met together , consulted with each other at various times for a long series of years , and in various forms , but , as you may remember , most generally , in the form of a Congress of independent powers .
They began their conflict with the mother Government each for itself , and the battles of Lexington , of Bunker Hill , of Fort Moultrie in the colony of South Carolina , and the battle of the Great Bridge in the colony of Virginia - all occurred before their common Declaration of Independence on the 4th of July , ' 76 .
The Colonies , then in Congress , made a joint declaration of their freedom from Great Britain , of their independence and of their sovereignty .
As. you may remember , gentlemen - for I am now reciting what is present to your memory , with a view to bring it to your consideration , trusting as I may recite it you may discover , what has been certainly running through the minds of my people for years past - finding , that , individually , they could not carry on this contest for independence and sovereignty , they united in certain articles which are known as the Articles of Confederation .
In these articles there is the reiteration of the original declaration of the sovereignty and independence of the parts of it .
All rights , all powers , all jurisdiction therein delegated produce no limitation upon the ultimate and discretionary sovereignty of the parts of it .
Under these considerations , and with these reservations , they prosecuted the war with the mother country successfully ; and when that country recognized their success and their independence , she did so not by the positive recognition of the agency of this Confederation , but in absolute acknowledgment of the independence and the sovereignty of the parts of that agency .
Four years later than this , it became apparent that their alliance was not sufficient for conducting the faculties of peace as it had been for conducting the faculties of war ; and the remedies for this insufficiency resulted in that instrument known as the Constitution of the United States of America , and the amendments thereto proposed by the States individually .
Now , gentlemen of Virginia , we all know that in this instrument there is no one clause , no one phrase , no one word which places the slightest limitation , or indicates the slightest transmission of the sovereignty of the parties to that compact .
On the contrary , the whole spirit and genius of that instrument goes to recognize itself as a mere agency for the performance of delegated functions , and to recognize the parts of it as the original holders of the sovereignty .
In proof of this , the States at various times , under various forms , with a treaty reservation , consented to this compact .
Now since that period , of course there has been no legitimated change of the relations of the parts under this compact .
On the contrary , all the contemporaneous and juxta - contemporaneous constructions of the instrument , especially that made by the voice of Virginia through Mr. Madison , whom your distinguished President , , [ Mr. JANNEY ] , has characterized as the chief architect of the Constitution , declare the relations of the parts in these words : " The Constitution of the United States was formed by the sanctions of the States , given by each in its sovereign capacity . "
And again , " the States then being the parties to the constitutional compact , and in their sovereign capacity , it follows of necessity that there can be no tribunal above this with authority to decide in the last resort whether the compact made by them be violated , and consequently as parties to it , they must decide in the last resort , such questions as may be of sufficient magnitude to require their interposition . "
Then , are these questions of sufficient magnitude to require the interposition of sovereignty ?
Unquestionably , the interpreter means those questions which involve the prerogative of that sovereignty itself , and those were of sufficient magnitude to require its interposition , and such as are of themselves dangerous to the great purposes for which the Constitution was established ; and among these great purposes we know there are expressed those of justice , right , equality , general welfare and the blessings of liberty to us and our posterity .
Gentlemen , in these relations of the States to each other and to the Federal Government , the people of South Carolina have assumed that their sovereignty has never been divided ; that it has never been alienated ; that it is imprescriptibly in its entire ; that it has not been impaired by their voluntarily refraining from the exercise of certain functions of sovereignty which they had delegated to another power , and upon this assumption , they contend that in the exercise of this unrestricted sovereignty , and upon the great principle of the right of a sovereign people to govern themselves , even if it involves the destruction of the compact which by its vitiation has become in imminent peril , that they have a right to abrogate their consent to that compact .
I have thus , gentlemen , as rapidly as possible , grouped before you a few facts and principles involved in the action of the State which I represent , and I shall now proceed , with as much rapidity as possible , to exhibit to you the reasons why , upon these facts and these principles , the people of South Carolina have deemed proper to abrogate their consent to the compact of the Constitution of the United States .
As preliminary to this statement , I would say , that as early as the year 1820 , the manifest tendency of the legislation of the general government was to restrict the territorial expansion of the slaveholding States .
That is very evident in all the contests of that period ; and had they been successful to the extent that some hoped , even then , the line that cut off the purchase from France might have been projected eastward to the bottom of the Chesapeake and sent Virginia and half of Tennessee and all of Kentucky , Virginia proper , after she had given to non-slavery her northwestern empire , to the non-slavery section .
That might be the line .
The policy , however , has been pushed so far as to deprive this Southern section of that line of at least seven - tenths of the valuable acquisitions of the government .
Besides this , I would state .
as preliminary , that a large portion of the revenue of the government of the United States has always been drawn from duties on imports .
Now , the products that have been necessary to purchase these imports , were at one time almost exclusively , and have always mainly been the result of slave labor , and therefore the burden of the revenue duties upon imports purchased by these exports must fall upon the producer who happens also to be the consumer of the imports .
In addition to this , it may be stated , that at a very early period of the existence of this Government , the Northern people , from a variety of causes , entered upon the industries of manufacture and of commerce , but of agriculture scarcely to the extent of self support .
This may have arisen from a variety of causes ; among them , perhaps , an uncongenial climate , a barren soil , but an alluring sea coast adapted to commerce , besides an inherent tendency upon the part of the people of these latitudes to the arts of manucraft and traffic ; and while , therefore , it was important that all the sources of the revenue should be kept up to meet the increasing expenses of the Government , it also manifestly became of great importance that these articles of manufacture in which they have been engaged should be subject to the purchase of their confederates .
They , therefore , invented a system of duties partial and discriminating , by which the whole burden of the revenue from this extraordinary system fell upon those who produced the articles of exports which purchased the articles of imports , and which articles of import were consumed mainly , or to a great extent , by those who produced the exports .
Now , the State of South Carolina being at the time one of the largest exporters and consumers of imports , was so oppressed by the operations of this system upon her , that she was driven to the necessity of interposing her sovereign reservation to arrest it , so far as she was concerned .
This interposition , together with the rapid spread of the principle of free trade all over the world , did arrest the iniquity in the shape in which it was then presented .
It could no longer be the avowed policy of the Government to tax one section for the purpose of building up another .
But so successful had been the system ; to such an extent had it already , in a few years , been pushed ; so vast had been its accumulations of capital ; so vastly had it been diffused throughout its ramifications as seemingly to inter - weave the very life of industry itself , in the two sections into each other in the form of mechanics , of manufactures , ships , merchants , and bankers .
The people of the Northern States have so crawled and crept into every crevice of our industry which they could approach , and they have themselves so conformed to it , that we ourselves began to believe that they were absolutely necessary to its vitality ; and they have so fed and fattened , and grown so great and large as they feed and fatten upon this sweating giant of the South , that with the insolence natural to sudden and bloated wealth and power , they begin to believe that the giant was created only as their tributary .
Now , strange as it may seem , it is nevertheless true , that while they were thus building up their wealth and their power from these sources , step by step , we will see latterly that , with this aggregation of wealth was growing up a determined purpose to destroy the very sources from which it was drawn .
I pretend not ta explain this ; I refer to it merely as history .
This , gentlemen , brings me directly to the causes which I desire to lay before you .
For fully thirty years or more , the people of the Northern States have assailed the institution of African slavery .
They have assailed African slavery in every form in which , by our contiguity of territory and our political alliance with them , they have been permitted to approach it .
During that period of thirty years , large masses of their people have associated themselves together for the purpose of abolishing the institution of African slavery , and means , the most fearful were suggested to the subject race - rising and murdering their masters being the charities of those means .
In pursuance of this idea , their representatives in the federal government have endeavored by all the means that they could bring to bear , so to shape the legislation as almost to limit , to restrict , to restrain the slaveholding States from any political interest in the accretion of the government .
So that as my distinguished colleague [ judge Benning ] , stated to you on yesterday , the decree goes forth that there are to be no more slave States admitted into the Union .
Secondly , then , in pursuance of the same purpose that I have indicated , a large majority of the States of the Confederation have refused to carry out those provisions of the Constitution which are absolutely necessary to the existence of the slave States , and many of them have stringent laws to prevent the execution of those provisions ; and eight of these States have made it criminal , even in their citizens to execute these provisions of the Constitution of the United States , which , by the progress of the government , have become now necessary to the protection of an industry which furnishes to the commerce of the Republic $ 250,000,000 per annum , and on which the very existence of twelve millions of people depends .
In not one of these seventeen States can a citizen of one of the fifteen States claim his main property , and in many of them the persons of the citizens of these States have been violated , and in numerous cases the violence has resulted in murder .
Third .
The citizens of not less than five of our confederates of the North have invaded the territory of their confederates of the slaveholding States , and proclaimed the intention of abolishing slavery by the annihilation of the slaveholders ; and two of these States have refused to surrender the convicted felons to the demand of the invaded States ; and one of these - one of the most influential - one , perhaps , recognized as the representative of what is called American sentiment and civilization , has , in its highest solemn form , approved of that invasion ; and numbers of people , scattered throughout the whole extent of these seventeen States , have made votive offerings to the memory of the invaders .
Fourth .
The most populous , and by far , the most potent of our late confederates , has for years proclaimed , through the federal legislature and by her own sovereign act , that the conflict between slavery and non-slavery is a conflict for life and death .
Now , there is the calm , oft - reiterated decree of a State containing three millions of people , conducting four - fifths of the commerce of the Republic , with additional millions diffused through the whole of these 17 States .
And many of these States themselves have decreed that the institution of slavery is an offence to God , and , therefore , they are bound by the most sacred attributes which belong to human nature , to exterminate it .
They have declared , in their most solemn form , that the institution of slavery , as it exists in the States of their political confederates , is an offence to their social institutions , and , therefore , that it should be exterminated .
Finally , acting upon the impulse of their duties of self - protection and self - preservation , majorities , large majorities throughout the whole of these 17 States have placed the executive power of the Federal Government in the hands of those who are bound by the most sacred obligations , by their obligations to God , by their obligations to the social institutions of man , by their obligations of self - protection and self - preservation , to place the system of slavery as it exists in the Southern States upon a course of certain and final extinction .
Twenty millions of people , having in their hands one of the strongest Governments on earth , and impelled by a perfect recognition of the most powerful obligations which fall upon man , have declared that the vital interests of eight millions of people shall be exterminated .
In other words , the decree , the result of this cumulation which I have endeavored to show you , was inaugurated on the 6th of November last , so far as the institution of slavery is concerned , in the confederates of the Northern non-slaveholding States .
That decree is annihilation , and you can make nothing shorter of it .
Now , gentlemen , the people of South Carolina , being a portion of these eight millions of people , have only to ask themselves , is existence worth the struggle ?
Their answer to this question , I have submitted to you in the form of their Ordinance of Secession .
Gentlemen , I see before me men who have observed all the records of human life , and many , perhaps , who have been chief actors in many of its gravest scenes , and I ask such men if in all their lore of human society they can offer an example like this ?
South Carolina has 300,000 whites , and 400,000 slaves .
These 300,000 whites depend for their whole system of civilization on these 400,000 slaves .
Twenty millions of people , with one of the strongest Governments on the face of the earth , decree the extermination of these 400,000 slaves , and then ask , is honor , is interest , is liberty , is right , is justice , is life , worth the struggle ?
Gentlemen , I have thus very rapidly endeavored to group before you the causes which have produced the action of the people of South Carolina .
Had I endeavored to go into detail of it , it would occupy half the history of this Republic .
For half the period of its existence , from the days of the younger Adams to this hour , the untiring and unflinching purpose of the Northern representation in our federal legislation , and of the people of the Northern States , has been first to restrict and restrain the people of the Southern States within the limitations which they have prescribed , then to subsidise , then to destroy .
They were baffled , they were checked in one course of this , But with that untiring energy of nature which belongs to them , they soon turned to another .
Defeated in this , by the lingering and sturdy fragments of a dying patriotism among themselves , or the pointed resistance of their victims - they have still held on with the fierce grip of avarice , with the mad rage of fanaticism , until it has pleased God to curse them with a triumph which may plunge this continent into civil war , and destroy , perhaps forever , the fairest forms of liberty that ever human philosophy grafted upon the institutions of men .
Now , gentlemen , for one moment look at the other side of the picture .
For thirty years , by labor , by protest , by prayer , by warning , by every attribute , by every energy which she could bring to bear , my State has endeavored to avert this catastrophe .
For this long series of years in the federal legislature what has been her course ?
What has been the labor which she has performed ?
What has been the purpose which she has avowed ?
Has she not given to this all her intelligence , all her patriotism , all her virtue - and that she had intelligence ; that she had patriotism ; that she had virtue is in proof , because that marble sits in the hall where the sovereignty of Virginia is consulting upon the rights and honor of Virginia .
[ Applause . ]
All this she did in the Federal Government .
Failing in this more than a year ago , seeing the storm impending , seeing the waves rising , she sends to this great , this strong , this wise , this illustrious Republic of Virginia , a grave commission , the purport of which , with your permission , gentlemen , I will venture to relate .
" Whereas the State of South Carolina , by her ordinance of A. D. 1852 , affirmed her right to secede from the Confederacy whenever the occasion should arise , justifying her , in her own judgment , in taking that step ; and in the resolution adopted by her Convention , declared that she forbore the immediate exercise of that right , from considerations of expediency only :
And , whereas , more than seven years have elapsed since that Convention adjourned , and in the intervening time , the assaults upon the institution of slavery , and upon the rights and equality of the Southern States , have unceasingly continued with increasing violence , and in new and more alarming forms be it therefore , 1 .
Resolved unanimously ,
That the State of South Carolina , still deferring to her Southern sisters , nevertheless respectfully announces to them , that it is the deliberate judgment of this General Assembly that the slaveholding States should immediately meet together to concert measures for united action .
2 . Resolved unanimously ,
That the foregoing preamble and resolution be communicated by the Governor to all the slaveholding States , with the earnest request of this State that they will appoint deputies , and adopt such measures as in their judgment will promote the said meeting .
3 . Resolved unanimously ,
That a special commissioner be appointed by his Excellency the Governor to communicate the foregoing preamble and resolutions to the State of Virginia , and to express to the authorities of that State the cordial sympathy of the people of South Carolina with the people of Virginia , and their earnest desire to unite with them in measures of common defence . "
This , gentlemen , was one year ago and no more .
Failing in that effort , the people of South Carolina , for the first time in over 20 years , joined with the political organizations of the day , in the hopes - of deferring the catastrophe .
Failing in effecting that through them , she then calmly , as the last hope , for she earnestly , honestly , and with the most anxious solicitude , desired the success of that party which she supposed would defer this catastrophe - cast her vote with that party in the Presidential contest ; but failing in this , from the causes I have enumerated , and from the parties I have enumerated as arrayed against her - she then quietly and unostentatiously , without clamor , having asked her sister States , especially having asked Virginia , to unite with her in consultation , passes this act in these few simple words which I shall take the liberty of reading to the Convention :
We , the People of the State of South Carolina , in Convention assembled , do declare and ordain , and it is hereby declared and ordained , That the Ordinance adopted by us in Convention , on the twenty - third day of May , in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and eighty - eight , whereby the Constitution of the United States of America was ratified , and also , all Acts and parts of Acts of the General Assembly of this State , ratifying amendments of the said Constitution , are hereby repealed ; and that the union now subsisting between South Carolina and other States , under the name of " The United States of America , " is hereby dissolved .
After this simple act of excision still she has not been satisfied , and now still she is seeking aid , she is seeking counsel , she is seeking sympathy , and , therefore , gentlemen , I am before you here today .
Now , gentlemen of Virginia , notwithstanding these facts which I have so feebly grouped before you , notwithstanding this patience which I have endeavored to show you she has practised , my State , throughout this whole land , throughout all Christendom , my State has been charged with rash precipitancy .
Is it rash precipitancy to step out of the pathway when you hear the thunder crash of the falling clouds ?
Is it rash precipitancy to seek for shelter when you hear the gushing of the coming tempest , and see the storm cloud coming down upon you ?
Is it rash precipitancy to raise your hands to protect your head ?
[ Loud applause . ]
Gentlemen of Virginia , never since liberty came into the institutions of man have a people borne with more patience , or forborne with more fortitude than have the people of these Southern States in their relation with their confederates of the North .
As long as it was a merely silly fanaticism or a prurient philanthropy that proposed our destruction , we scarcely complained .
Even when a long series of unjust , partial and oppressive taxation was grinding us into the very dust of poverty , with one convulsive struggle we bore that happily .
Even when a number of our confederate States refused to carry out the provisions of the Constitution , vital to our interests , by municipal and State regulations - even when hordes of their people , under the sanction of these regulations , robbed us of our property and murdered our citizens , and bands of wild fanatics , under the same sanction , invaded slave territory and proclaimed the destruction of slavery by the annihilation of the slaveholder - even when some of our confederates proclaimed in the federal legislature and by their sovereign decrees that we ought to be driven from the civilization in which we lived - even when one of our confederates sought to defame and vilify us before the ' civilized world , we bore all these accumulating calamities , and continued to give them our blood and our treasure to build up the grandeur and maintain the power of that Republic .
And , in addition to this , when all that malignant fanaticism , that baffled avarice , that moral turpitude could invent to defame and vilify us , was proposed by the people and by the States of our confederates , still we gave them our blood and sweat and offered them our hands and called them brethren .
I draw no fancy picture .
I make no declamatory assertion here .
There is not one man here who cannot cite twenty cases to fill every item of this category .
But when at last this mad fanaticism , this eager haste for rapine , mingling their foul purposes , engendered this fell spirit which has seized the Constitution itself in its most sacred forms and distorted it into an instrument of our instant ruin ; why , then , to hesitate one moment longer seems to us not only base cowardice , but absolute fatuity .
[ Applause . ]
We felt , in the South , that if we submitted one hour to such a domination as that , we would have merited that destruction which we had earned by our folly and baseness .
Tn South Carolina at least , we felt , if there was one son of a South Carolina sire who could give counsel to such submission as this , that there was not a hill side or a plain from Eutaw to the Cowpens , from which the spirit of his venerated sire would not have started forth to shame him from the land which discarded him .
[ Applause . ]
I pray you , gentlemen of Virginia , to pardon me for referring with some particularity to the position of my State in connection with these matters , because she has been much spoken of and not much praised .
I am here , gentlemen , as the Commissioner of these people , certainly not their eulogist .
I am sent here as I thought mainly because among them I have always , with some pride , proclaimed that I sprang from this soil , and because they believe that I would tell an honest , earnest story of their wrongs and their trials ; and if you will permit me , I will still farther allude to it .
Never , gentlemen of Virginia , since liberty begun her struggles in the world , has a mightier drama been enacted on the trembling stage of man 's affairs or been opened with a spectacle of purer moral sublimity , than that which has been manifested in this revolution in which we are now engaged .
Scarcely had this decree of our subjection , to which I call your attention , been borne to our cars on the Northern breeze , than , as if from the very caverns of the earth , there rose up one voice , one voice only , from the people of South Carolina , who shouted back resistance to the death .
Their Legislature then in session , caught that spirit , and with one voice , and one voice only , proclaimed resistance to the death .
The people of the State again in their sovereign capacity , as you are , with one voice , and one voice only , ordained resistance to the death .
And now , gentlemen , there is not , in the borders of that little State , one man from sixteen to sixty who can walk or stand , who is not armed , standing ready to resist to the death .
[ Applause . ]
We are very small - very weak - but if war , that fire - storm with which we are threatened , should fall upon us and consume us , hereafter the pilgrim of liberty , perhaps from this State , who may be searching beneath the ruins of Charleston , will find the skeleton of our sentinel standing at every sea gate .
[ Applause . ]
Gentlemen of Virginia , do not believe - do not be persuaded that in taking the steps which we have , we have been forgetful of those things which are cherished among you .
We have not been forgetful of the great and hallowed past , nor have we been reckless of our duties to our children .
It is our memory of the great and hallowed past , of our sons , of our sacred obligations to our children which has nerved our arms to this act , and no sense of ourselves .
For years and years , gentlemen , we have paused , we have hesitated , as I have shown you .
We paused , and paused , as we raised the curtain with our own hands ' and gazed back at that great and hallowed past , that fairest temple , as we all thought , in which liberty had ever found a shrine - that which Washington , Jefferson , Adams , Franklin , Henry , Madison , the Lees , Masons , the Rutledges and the Pinckneys - that conclave of demi-gods - had builded up as a tabernacle for us and our children to dwell in forever , and which they had consecrated by the blood of our own fathers - that which the Father of his Country deemed the palladium of human right - that precious monument and refuge of human hope all over the world .
We paused with reverence and pity as we gazed back on all these scenes ; and yet , gentlemen , with these hands we have dragged them down to the earth - with these feet we have trampled them out of life - with this breath we have scattered them on the winds of Heaven : and yet we do not tremble .
We are not appalled as we gaze on our hands , because those hands are unstained , pure , clear and unterrified as we raise them in confident appeal to the God of justice and of Truth .
[ Applause . ]
Armed , then , in this panoply , with calm hearts , with unfaltering step we are ready to drop the curtain and move onward through the coming scenes of this solemn drama .
Gentlemen of Virginia , I believe that these Southern States are no noisy faction clamoring for place and power .
They are no hungry rabble ready to answer back in blood to every appeal to their brutal passions .
We are no shouting mob ready to take for our government some glittering epigram or some fustian and infidel theory .
We are no festering fanatics .
With us liberty is not a painted strumpet , drazzling through the streets , nor does our truth need to build itself in pools of blood .
We are a calm , grave , deliberate and religious people , the holders of the most majestic civilization and the inheritors , by right , of the fairest estate of liberty .
Fighting for that liberty , fighting for our fathers ' graves , standing athwart our hearth - stones and before our chamber doors , for days and weeks the people of our little State stood alone - that little State around whose outermost border the guns fired at her capital might almost be heard ; whose little scope of skv was so small that scarce one star had space to glitter in it .
So small , so few , we begun this fight alone against millions ; and had you piled millions upon millions , under God , in this fight we should have triumphed .
[ Applause . ]
But that God , gentlemen , cares for his people - cares for liberty , and right , and justice - and we are no longer alone .
Very soon our own children from Florida and Alabama answer back to the maternal call , and our great sister , Georgia , marshaled forth her giant offspring ; and from the grave of the gallant Quitman , on the banks of the Mississippi , there came forth his well - known clarion tones , [ applause ] ; and Louisiana proved her paternity in the appeal of liberty ; and now young Texas has raised her giant form and marches to the right of this majestic column of confederated sovereignties .
[ Applause . ]
Ah , gentlemen of Virginia , wherever outside of the borders of Virginia , the voice of a son of Virginia has spoken in this fight , it too has been known , because he spoke in the ancient tongue of his mother .
[ Applause . ] 1 , one of the humblest of her sons , told my countrymen , that before the spring grass grows long enough to weave one chaplet of victory , they will hear the sound as of the tramp of a mighty host of men , and they will see floating before that host the banner whose whole history is one blaze of glory , and not one blot of shame .
[ Applause . ]
Aye , they will hear coming up from that host one voice like their own , but it will be the resounding echo of that voice which has thundered into the hearts of your God - like sires - " give me liberty , or give me death ! " [ Applause . ]
And on that banner will be written the unsullied name of Virginia .
[ Applause . ]
Gentlemen of Virginia , have I promised too much for our mother ?
To suggest a doubt , would be more than blasphemy .
I believe she will come .
I believe she will take her place which she has held for one hundred years - the foremost of all the world in the ranks of liberty and of justice .
[ Applause . ]
The world knows her history , and knows no history above it in the niche of fame - and , knowing that history , none dare doubt where Virginia will be when her own offspring , and liberty and justice , call her to the fight .
[ Applause . ]
Mr. President , I fear that I am deluded by the scene and place to go beyond my intention ; but yet , with your permission , and that of the Convention , I shall ask to steal a few more minutes of your time .
I have endeavored thus far , although perhaps somewhat erratically , to confine myself specifically to the question in hand of my own mission .
And in connection with that , gentlemen , if you will permit me , I will take a few moments of your time , and will assume your permission , while I endeavor to exhibit to the Convention some of the reasons which the people of my State deemed as fundamental causes why there can never again be a re-construction of the late Federal Union .
The truth seems evident , gentlemen , to every mind which dares to speculate advisedly upon the principles of this revolution through which we are now passing , that these principles do involve irreconcilable differences between the systems on which slave and non-slaveholding communities may be calculated upon as enduring .
Now , we believe that these diversities pertain to every attribute pervading the whole of these two systems , and we therefore believe that this revolution , with this separation , with this disintegration , is not a mere accident ; that it is not the mere casual result of a temporary cause ; that it is not a mere evanescent bubble of popular error or irritation ; that it is not a mere dream of philosophy , and that it is not the achievement of personal or individual ambition .
We believe , gentlemen , that it has a far profounder cause than all this .
We believe that it is not only a revolution of material necessity , but that it is a revolution resulting from the profoundest convictions , ideas , sentiments , and moral and intellectual necessities of earnest and intelligent men .
We believe that it is not only the never - dying struggle between the freedom of labor and the despotism of power , but that it is that still sterner conflict which shivered Greece , and disintegrated the huge and solid armies of Rome ; that conflict which gathers into its contending armies not only all the necessities , but all the customs , all the laws , all the intelligence , all the sentiments , all the passions , which constitute the civilization of man .
We therefore believe , that although you may centralize a coercing power at the city of Washington , stronger than the Proetorian band when the eagles of Rome soared from Leuconia to the Caucasus , you can no more coalesce the people of Virginia and the people of Vermont , the people of the St. Lawrence and the people of the Gulf of Mexico , the people of the Rio Grande and the people of the Hudson , than could Rome make one coalition of the Gaul , the Briton and the Tonian .
No community of laws , no community of language , of religion , can amalgamate , according to - our faith , people whose severance is proclaimed by the most rigid requisitions of universal necessity .
African slavery cannot exist at the North .
The South cannot exist without African slavery .
[ Applause . ]
None but an equal race can labor at the North ; none but a subject race will labor at the South .
Now , for these reasons and for others , perhaps , we believe that the political socialisms of these two systems , of these two sections , have assumed shapes so diverse , that their continuity of action is an absolute impossibility .
Only to cite one or two instances , gentlemen , for I am only making these suggestions for your consideration :
At the North , in the free States , the pure , the simple , the isolated , the exclusive , the absolute principle upon which all political and social organism is constructed , is that of a pure Democracy , saving a scarcely reconcilable modification in the shape of a vague and indefinite system of representation .
There can be no other principle introduced into the Northern socialisms , save this , in its utmost and extremest intensity .
It is the vitalizing principle ; it is the breath of life to the Northern institution .
The almighty power of numbers , of simple physical numbers , from one to countless millions , is the sole basis of political and social agreement in the Northern States .
Now , a fearful manifestation exists at this moment .
Here is the Government of the United States , as we all I - , now , established for the protection of all parties equally , and yet , by the accession of this number , that Government has limited a section of the parties territorially .
That Government has unduly taxed a section of the parties .
That Government has threatened with immenent peril , if not with instant destruction , parts and sections of the parties to it , and the people and the States North are at this moment consulting together whether , by the mere power of numbers , they shall not subjugate parties to this Government .
Now , the modification of this principle at the South is so essential , that it cannot co-exist with the same principle in its unrestricted form as I have exhibited at the North .
At the South it is modified , it is controlled , it is made absolutely subject .
The recognition of a specific property is essential to the vitalization of the political organism .
Now , this indicates that the instant you engraft one of these rules into the forms of the other section , that instant the section which you have invaded perishes .
If you institute property as an element of Northern political or social organism , you destroy the whole system which exists at the North .
If you exclude it from the South , you subvert the whole system on which the Southern civilization exists .
Now , gentlemen , there is another which we regard as of more weight , more potential , by far , than either territorial or geographical segregation - that of political and social diversity ; and that comes of the profound sentiment , the moral and religious sentiment , exhibiting itself in its religious form - that profound sentiment which pervades the people of both these sections , having arrayed itself on the sides of these sections .
We know - we cannot conceal it from ourselves at this moment if we dare contemplate it - that this cause of diversity is at this moment arraying itself in forms as bloody as it has ever exhibited since Christ came upon the earth , and its representative , the Church , has already , and is daily keeping her arm bare for this conflict .
Already her drawn sword is flashing in the twilight of fanaticism , and the world knows that where that sword cuts asunder , no human surgery can re-unite the wound .
But , gentlemen , we cannot conceal it from ourselves one moment longer - there is not a Christian man , a slaveholder , in this assembly who does not feel in his inmost heart as a Christian , that the point of this sword of the church is at this moment dripping with the last blood of sympathy which bound him to his Christian brethren of the North .
They set the lamb of God between our seed and their seed .
Now , gentlemen , from this and other repellant diversities , we believe , and have so acted , that the political union is an unnatural and monstrous one , and , therefore , that its offspring must be abortive or fruitless , save of that brood of evils which always come from such unnatural unions .
We believe , gentlemen , that it is a perfectly natural and reasonable deduction , that from these diversities there have arisen these differencies of construction of principles and parties of our political confederation , - which has so early in the period of its existence , as we are in the habit of terming it , converted a government of popular consent into a government of force - which has driven from it seven sovereign States and five millions of people ; which has enabled that government in the face of the people of Virginia to keep loaded bomb - shells for sixty days ready to be fired upon the women and children of Charleston , and which in less than sixty days will have the refuse of New York and Boston , re-enacting at Portsmouth and Hampton the scenes of 1813 .
No , gentlemen , where these conventional and natural diversities are , the conflict is for life , subjugation - and that conflict is upon you .
Now , you are very strong , gentlemen of Virginia , and you own an empire .
You are advanced in the arts of civilization ; you are strong , powerful and skillful , and you may conjoin remote oceans .
You may , by your force and art drag down your mountain tops , fill up your valleys ; you may encircle the earth with your canals and your iron bands ; you may pull down civil dynasties and religions , and re-build upon their ruins forms of liberty and faith ; but I tell you , there is no human force , there is no essay of human art , there is no sanctity of human touch that can re-unite the people of the North and the people of the South .
[ Applause . ]
No , gentlemen , never , never , until you unfix by your power , your art and your virtue the unchangeable economy of the Eternal God .
When you have done that , you may make one people of the people of the North and the people of the South .
A profound instinct of these diversities is at this moment enforcing upon the people of the Southern States the necessity of this recognition - and they are building up their institutions at this time .
The same profound instinct is operating upon the people of the Northern States , and they are at this moment manifesting this by preparation with the aid of expiring , crumbling powers and the agents of anti-slavery , known as the army and navy of the United States .
With these aids and weapons in their hands , they are recognizing the absolute existence of these diversities .
I believe , gentlemen of Virginia , that the question which you now have to decide is whether you , the representatives of the sovereignty , the power , the glory , the hope of Virginia , will be content like a modern Egyptian to skulk for protection beneath the crumbling fragments of an ancient greatness , and under the scourge of a haughty but mean task - master , or whether you will step forth and hush this storm of war and keep the ancient glory of your name .
[ Applause . ]
Gentlemen , the people and State of South Carolina , in the language of its various compacts with its confederates , have declared that they have never parted with their sovereignty or their independence ; that they had a right to exercise that sovereignty and according to their will ; that they did , in connection with their confederates , establish an agency for the formation of a government ; that that government has failed of its purpose , and , therefore , that they are justified in abolishing it , and establishing another .
She has therefore , gentlemen , ordained , as I have read to you , and has maintained that ordinance for a reasonable time , by arms , that political connection with the Government of the United States is dissolved .
The admitted rule on which she has made this declaration , I have copied , for the purpose of reading to you : " That a violation of a perfect right , either committed or committing , or with which a people is threatened in the future , justifies the undertaking of war - amicable means having been tried in vain .
When it is evident that it would be useless to try such means , justice requires a resort to arms . "
Therefore , the people of South Carolina contend that justice has required of them a resort to arms , in the protection of a principle of right .
She has maintained this position , as I have indicated to you , a reasonable time .
She has maintained it against falsehood and prejudice ; she has maintained it until six sovereign States have come to her aid , and have formed a Government which the six have announced to the world by the eminent and patriotic citizen who has been put in charge of the Executive department of that Government .
She has maintained this position ' [ the State of South Carolina ] , until this government has been formed , in which there can be no cause for doubt , that the courage and patriotism of the people of the confederate States will be found equal to any measures of defence which our honor and security may require .
Farther obstacles may retard the progress of that government , but they cannot long prevent the progress of a movement sanctified by its justice and sustained by a virtuous people .
Reverently let us invoke the God of our fathers to guide and protect us in our efforts to perpetuate the principles which , by his blessing , they were able to vindicate , establish and transmit to posterity ; and with that continuance of his favor ever gratefully acknowledged , we will hopefully look forward to success , peace and prosperity Now , gentlemen of Virginia , believing the interests involved and the rights violated to be identical with the interests and the rights of Virginia , and remembering their ancient motto and their common glory , the people of South Carolina have ordered me to ask and urge that the people of Virginia will unite with her and her confederates in the protection of those rights and those interests .
I have now performed this , my mission , and have only , in the name of my government , to return to this Convention my earnest acknowledgement of the honorable courtesy with which it has accepted my mission .
On my own behalf , gentlemen , accept my sincere and honest thanks , I should say my deprecating thanks , for the kindness , courtesy and patience with which you have listened to the delivery of this mission .

Video : Progress bar illusion
Making progress , but the waiting game is not over yet ( Image : Robert Daly / Stone / Getty )
Twiddling our thumbs while waiting for files to download is one of the great frustrations of our high - speed , technologically interconnected world .
Computer scientists are unlikely to eliminate the waiting any time soon – but they ’ve done the next best thing .
Chris Harrison at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , working with Zhiquan Yeo and Scott Hudson , has shown that animated pop -up download progress bars which use visual illusions make the process seem around 10 per cent faster than it really is .
Apple already uses a a basic visual trick of this kind in its Mac OS X operating system , but Harrison ’s research suggests such techniques could be used to greater effect .
Advertisement
Previous research suggests that rhythmic stimuli can seem to create time - warping effects ( PDF ) and that the way we perceive motion depends on its context ( PDF ) .
With this in mind , Harrison ’s group generated a series of animated progress bars : some pulsated between pale and dark blue at varying speeds , and others had pale blue ripples moving either left or right , also at different rates , as the bar crept forward ( see video ) .
They then showed different pairs of either pulsing or rippling animations to 20 volunteers , with each mocked - up download lasting exactly 5 seconds .
Many participants said that progress bars which pulsated increasingly quickly made the download time seem shorter than those that pulsated increasingly slowly .
A significant number also said downloads were faster when ripples in the progress bars moved to the left rather than to the right .
Apple beater
Apple uses left - moving ripples that travel at a constant velocity for progress bars in Mac OS X .
However , many of the volunteers in Harrison ’s study said that this type of animation appeared slower than one in which the left - moving ripples slowed down as the download neared completion .
In a second part of the study the researchers sought to quantify the time - bending effect of the visual illusions by asking the volunteers to compare a progress bar with slowing ripples with a bar that neither pulsated nor rippled .
During these tests the time it took the rippling progress bar to complete the mock download was gradually lengthened , while the download time for the standard bar was left the same , until the volunteers felt that both had completed the operation in the same length of time .
They found that , on average , a 5.61 - second rippling progress bar appeared to take the same amount of time as a 5 - second standard bar , and a 16.75 - second - long rippling bar seemed to take as long as a 15 - second - long standard bar – illusory speeding - up effects of 10.9 per cent and 10.4 per cent respectively .
A watched bar
That could matter to computer users , says Harrison .
“ A good number of progress bars are between 5 and 15 seconds , ” he says .
“ For longer operations , you might go on to other tasks and not look at the progress bar . ”
“ It is not uncommon for [ such ] illusions to have a measured magnitude of around 10 per cent , ” says George Mather , a psychologist at the University of Sussex , UK .
Harrison and colleagues will present their work at the Association for Computing Machinery 2010 Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems in Atlanta , Georgia , next week .

Learn to Make the Most of Your Food Dollar
The economy is rough right now and many people have to cut expenses just to make ends meet .
Food is a much larger expense than many people realize .
A few years back it was enough for most people to cut back on dining out and to cook more meals at home .
But for many people that 's no longer enough .
More people than ever are struggling just to put food on their tables .
These days , people need all the help they can get to save money on food .
So I decided to share my tips and tricks for eating well on a tight budget .
Please share any money saving food - related tips you may have in the comments at the bottom of this page .
1. Discount Food Stores
Do n't forget to pay attention to prices , even in discount food stores !
I have found good quality food at such discount food stores as Aldi and Save - a - Lot .
They generally carry such staples as milk , butter , cheese , eggs , rice , fruit , and potatoes at prices below average .
My favorite discount grocery store is Aldi , mainly because of some of the imported European foods they carry on a regular basis .
My favorite is an indulgent , silky textured 5.29 oz .
dark chocolate bar made in Austria that sells for less than $ 1.50 .
I also love the 10 - pound bag of baking potatoes they sell for under three bucks .
Dollar stores can also fall into this discount food store category but only for certain products .
While their groceries are generally all under a dollar per unit , they tend to slip in items for a dollar that cost less than a dollar at the regular grocery store or dedicated discount food store .
However , one category which they beat most other stores hands - down for cost on is herbs and spices .
While the selection is n't always great , they often carry staple herbs like basil and oregano and spices such as cinnamon and peppercorns .
2. Save Money on Food at Ethnic Grocery Stores
Try something new and spend less
My major sources for more exotic , quality ingredients are ethnic markets .
The labeling and packaging is a bit different but the quality is as good , if not better than similar products purchased at a regular grocery store .
My theory on ethnic markets is that people buy the things they long for from their childhood or from their country of origin .
They only long for what would be considered the " good stuff , " so markets stock these things .
Asian markets often have surprising deals on high quality ingredients .
For example , that package of roasted chestnuts at the gourmet market that runs $ 7 sells for less than $ 2 at the Asian grocery .
A can of coconut milk often costs less than a dollar , less than half the cost of an often inferior product found at an average American grocery store .
They also stock a wide variety of dried beans , a good , cheap source of non-meat protein .
But , for me , the big money saver at the Asian grocery store is rice .
You can buy a big bag of jasmine rice for far less per pound than white rice from the regular grocery store .
You can also find treasures at the Mexican grocery store or supermercado .
I get many seasonings and sauces , fresh tortillas , tasty baked goods , and good quality meats from the local supermercado .

3. Do n't Buy More Than You Will Use
People waste an awful lot of food .
So when you stock up on things on sale , only stock up on non-perishable items such as canned goods or have a plan in place to preserve the extra food .
Bread can get popped into the fridge or freezer to extend its life and fruit can be washed , cut up and frozen , or cooked and canned .
Vegetables can be blanched quickly in boiling water and frozen for later use .
If you can't freeze it , can it , or eat it inside a week , do n't buy it .
To prevent waste , immediately package and refrigerate or freeze any leftovers in serving sizes .
Clearly mark all leftovers and write the date on them so you 'll know how soon they have to be used .
4. Farmer 's Markets and Flea Markets
Buy local , buy fresh , and save money on quality food .
In season , local farmer 's market and flea markets provide fresh produce at excellent prices .
You can also feel good shopping at the farmer 's market because the produce is mostly locally grown and has n't spent days riding around in fuel - guzzling trucks to get to you .
Shop local to save money on groceries and to be kind to the environment .
5. Pay Attention to Unit Prices
Most American grocery stores have labels on every shelf which not only tell you how much the items cost but how much they cost per ounce or pound .
They 've done most of the math for us !
When comparing value between brands or sizes , use the unit price guide .
Just be sure they are calculated in the same units .
Companies have gotten wise to shopping patterns and know that most shoppers think that a bigger package or " value size " package is cheaper per serving than smaller packages of the same product .
But it 's not always true — one large package may not be cheaper than two smaller packages .
That is why checking the unit price is important .

6. Angelfood Ministries
Angelfood Ministries provides food relief for people struggling to make ends meet .
Each month they sell boxes of assorted food items at roughly half the cost those items would run in a grocery store .
I know Angelfood Ministries is intended to help poor people get food but if you are reading this , you probably are n't rolling in the dough — if you catch my drift .
Food quality is good but the boxes tend to run a bit meat heavy for my tastes .
You can check out what comes in their boxes and find out where you can buy and pick them up at through their website .
They sell to people of any income and they even accept food assistance cards for payment .
7. Do n't Shop When Hungry or Anxious
This goes double if you have kids along .
Have a snack or meal before shopping and get yourself in as relaxed a state of mind as possible .
People are more apt to buy luxury food items if they are hungry or stressed out .
Play soothing music on the way to the store or even just take a couple of deep breaths before entering the store .

8. Buy Generic or Store Brand Products
Try store brand and generic products instead of name brands .
I say try , because you might not like the generic as much as a name brand product .
But in most cases , store brands are just as good , if not better than name brands .
If you are fortunate enough to have Aldi stores where you live , they have some really excellent store brand products .
In fact , I prefer their canned fruit ( peaches , apricots , pears ) to name brand products .
But if a name brand product you use and prefer is on sale for less than the generic — stock up !
9. Coupons Plus Sales
Only buy sale products that you normally use to make the most of your grocery dollar .
This part gets a little dicey .
Cutting coupons can save you money but often coupon use can inspire you ( or at least me ) to buy unnecessary products sometimes .
The thing to do is to make a strict rule that you do n't even clip a coupon for a product you do n't already use or did n't desire before finding the coupon .
But then there are sales .
Check the sales fliers to your local stores online each week because many of them offer a search feature .
That way , you can look at your coupons and search for those items as well as items you are out of .
Whenever a sale item matches a coupon , savings are greatly increased .
Combined coupons and sales can even sometimes get you free or nearly free grocery items .
10 . Plan Ahead
Plan your meals before making your grocery list .
Tailor your grocery list to your meal plan and do your best to stick to it .
Only make exceptions if you discover that something you usually buy is on sale , then stock up on it if it is n't perishable .
Do n't just plan your meals ; plan what you 'll use the leftovers for as well .
It prevents waste and it saves money .
11 . Clearance Racks
Save money on close - dated or seasonal groceries .
Check out the non-perishable clearance racks , especially right after holidays — Christmas cookies taste just as good in January and chocolate hearts are still delicious on February 15th .
Also , there 's no reason canned pumpkin or cranberry sauce can't be eaten at times other than the winter holidays .
Check out the day old bakery rack and the marked down produce in your grocery store .
Our local Meijer store also has a discounted cheese bin in the cheese cooler .
Sometimes , I can get wonderful fancy cheeses for just small change .
12 . Replace Meat With Other Proteins
Save money on groceries and eat healthier , too !
Cutting out or drastically reducing your meat consumption can cut up to 50 % from your grocery bill , depending on how much meat your family usually consumes .
Pound for pound , ounce for ounce , meat is more expensive than vegetables , grains , and fruits .
Eating less meat , particularly red meat , is also better for us and for the environment .
Replace some or all of your meat protein with eggs , dairy , and legumes and you 'll save big on groceries .
One of the big objections people have to eating more beans and lentils is that while dried beans are extremely inexpensive they take a long time to cook .
My solution to this is to invest in a crock pot or slow cooker .
If you can't afford a crock pot right now , simply bring the beans to a boil whenever you have an opportunity .
Then , turn off the burner and cover the pot .
Allow the beans to cool down then stick them in the refrigerator until you are ready to cook them .
This will knock a long time off of their cooking time and you can do this days ahead of when you need them .
13 . Do n't Pay for More Processing , Shipping , and Packaging Than Necessary
Buy in bulk and make your own single - serving packages .
Do n't buy pre-packaged convenience foods .
What you are paying for is not more or better food but more labor and packaging .
Buy regular package sizes , whole vegetables , and ingredients rather than prepared meals .
Invest in re-sealable sandwich bags to put individual portions of snacks in or better yet , be environmentally responsible and buy some small , plastic containers or re-use product packaging such as margarine tubs .
Buy every member of your family a lunchbox , lunch bag , or bento box to take home made meals with them to work or school .
Skip the bottled water entirely .
Buy water bottles and a filter if necessary .
Reusable bottles are better for the environment and it's cheaper to buy and use a filter than to buy water in a bottle .
Besides , most bottled water is just filtered tap water from some municipal water supply .
How do you stretch your food budget ?

frugalfinance lm on October 29 , 2012 :
Great tips here , thanks for sharing !
I agree that buying brand names vs generic and own brand labels is the way forward .
I personally can't taste any difference !
anonymous on July 10 , 2012 :
All good tips .
Especially the one about buying generic .
I 've read that some products are literally the same thing , made together in the same facilities , then some is sent off to get a brand name label while some is sold to stores and gets their label .
I hate the thought of paying more specifically because of packaging .
It 's downright insulting if you think about how poor food quality truly is and how much advertising tricks us all into thinking big brands are somehow better .
Some might not take these seriously , but they are researched articles even though it 's a comedy site .
Sources are linked .
Read them and be horrified .

With the increase in food prices over the last couple of years , it is always nice to try to save when you can .
I always try to stock up on things like chicken breasts when they are on sale , and I freeze what I wo n't use that week for later .
Tony Payne from Southampton , UK on October 23 , 2011 :
Excellent information .
We love shopping at Farmers Markets , and in the UK you can often buy meat at a Farm Store , where it 's not only at supermarket price , but fresh and locally sourced too .
Where possible buy cheaper brands of products , buy fresh produce rather than pre-processed , and it is possible to save a significant amount .
It 's hard in these days where costs keep rising , and incomes are either frozen or in our case shrinking .
Nicely presented , blessed .

Oh my goodness , excellent tips for us all !
I live on my Squidoo income , so I do n't waste a thing .
I 'm grateful for a food basket ~ the last one had a big pack of frozen chicken and 4 packages of cheese . , which I shared .
My sister also sends me a care package at least once a month with everything from soup to nuts .
She often sends cans of chicken and I freeze the juice to flavor soup .
She also sends rocks , just because she knows I like them .

I know I can save but I have learned even more
CCGAL on October 07 , 2010 :
The biggest thing I think a person can do to stretch his or her food dollar is to learn to cook from scratch .
Never buy a convenience food if you know how to do it yourself for less .
The other " secret " I can share is to read some depression era cookbooks - some of our family 's favorite dishes are from those old cookbooks .
Very nice lens , this .
Useful and well laid out .

Great resource ; I frequently pick up a treat from the baker 's clearance shelves .
Normally I would n't buy those items but they are so inexpensive when they are marked down .
I do n't have to worry about them getting eaten in a flash so they are a nice choice as a treat .

What an excellent group of ideas for stretching your grocery dollars !
I 'll have to check into visiting an Asian market !
sheriangell on January 31 , 2010 :
Excellent tips here !
I am on a constant mission to cut costs on this gigantic expense .
I try to visit my local grocery store bright and early on Monday mornings as I 've found that meat not sold over the weekend is marked down dramatically .

We love Aldi ... mainly because it has far LESS choice than major supermarkets ... and less choice is surprisingly better .
My grocery shop for 4 of us at Aldi costs half of what it does in Tesco ... and takes 30 mins as opposed to 2 hours .
Great lens .

Oh , P.S. I 'm lensrolling this to mine about 100 ways to save and spend less .
Deb Kingsbury from Flagstaff , Arizona on January 30 , 2010 :
Definitely lots of good advice here .
And you 're so right about those dollar stores .
Many of the food items they sell for a dollar are less in the regular grocery store , so that can be deceiving .
Certainly , cooking from scratch versus buying things like frozen dinners can save quite a lot .
Heather Burns from Wexford , Ireland on January 30 , 2010 :
Very useful tips and a great lens !
Leanne Chesser on January 30 , 2010 :
Great tips on how to stretch your grocery budget !
Planning ahead and not buying more than you 'll use are really important , I think .
ElizabethJeanAl on January 30 , 2010 :
My husband and I have trimmed our budget and then some .
Our grocery bill is a lot lower than it used to be .
We have a ways to go , but we 're getting there .

A very interesting lens with a lot of information !
It is interesting for me to hear about Aldi - which is one of the biggest discount stores in Germany .
tsmart on January 29 , 2010 :
Hello , I really love this lens !
It has some great tips .
One thing I learned last week while standing in line at Walmart , basket full of groceries , is that they will honor the area 's store deals .
A woman in front of me was buying her groceries , and she had gone through all of the local grocery store adds , and pointed out the items that were less than walmart .
The checker gave her the price shown on the add .
I did n't know Walmart did that !
Honestly I was surpirsed !
Another thing , while shopping , and comparing the price per oz .
on food items , I noticed it is n't always cheaper to buy in bulk anymore .
They are really tricky on this now days .
And last , about the generic being as good , you are very right about having to try the brand .
For instance , Great Value sloppy joe mix does n't taste as good as hungry man , but it also does n't have high fructose corn syrup in it , ( an ingredient on the naughty list in our house ) , so I buy it and chop up some onion and " tamed " jalepenos to spice it up a bit .
No complaints from the family !
Good luck everyone with your shopping !
For its critics in the Vatican , it is a matter of " deep concern " .
For its proponents , it is " evidence of great courage " .
Amid national controversy , the Kepler scientific secondary school today became the first in the Italian education system to install condom vending machines for students .
The machines , in the girls ' and boys ' toilets , will sell cut - price condoms just a few miles from the Vatican ; the Kepler is in a lower - middle class district of Rome , just outside the city 's ancient walls .
Cardinal Agostino Vallini , who stands in for the pope in his capacity as bishop of Rome , deplored the initiative as " trivialising sexuality " .
The head of the capital 's doctors ' association said he too disapproved of the project .
" This is like recognising you can have sex at school , " said Dr Mario Falconi .
" I would not want a scholastic use of the condom to be authorised in this fashion , especially considering there is no problem of availability of prophylactics in our country . "
The condoms went on sale at € 2 ( £ 1.82 ) for a packet of three – less than half the usual retail price .
The Kepler 's headteacher , Antonio Panaccione , invited other schools " not to take fright , and do the same " .
His comments and those of others reflected the continuing influence in Italy of Catholic teaching on sexual matters .
" At the outset , " Panaccione said , " there was some hesitation among some of the parents and teachers , motivated by fear and insecurity .
But then , by discussing it , that was all got over . "
The Italian student 's union , which noted that the French Lycée in Rome had been making condoms available to its pupils since 2001 , said in a statement : " Only in Italy would this cause a stir . "
It added : " A number of secondary educational institutions in western countries distribute condoms , as do many schools in the US . "
Pope Paul VI 's 1968 encyclical Humanae Vitae ( Of Human Life ) condemned " any action which either before , at the moment of , or after sexual intercourse , is specifically intended to prevent procreation . "
Despite Aids and talk of a rethink after Pope Benedict was elected five years ago , the Vatican has remained solidly opposed to artificial methods of contraception ever since .
Italy 's very low fertility rate – estimated last year at 1.31 births per woman of child - bearing age – indicates that many couples do use contraception .
But the prejudice against artificial methods remains strong .
Annalisa Chirico , a student leader standing in an election this month for the regional assembly in Lazio , the region around Rome , said figures from the Italian society of gynaecology and obstetrics last month showed " 40 % of [ teenage ] girls do not use any method of contraception and another 20 % entrust themselves entirely to the withdrawal method . "
The Kepler school 's initiative followed the adoption by the provincial administration of a resolution in favour of the distribution of condoms in schools .
The local politician behind the resolution , Gianluca Peciola , said : " The Kepler school , its headmaster and the school council are showing they have great courage . "
The Online Electric Vehicle ( OLEV ) , towing three carriages , runs along a blue line under which power strips are buried for recharging , at an amusement park in Gwacheon , south of Seoul .
S.Korean researchers launched an environmentally - friendly public transport system using a " recharging road " -- with a vehicle sucking power magnetically from buried electric strips .
South Korean researchers Tuesday launched an environmentally friendly public transport system using a " recharging road " -- with a vehicle sucking power magnetically from buried electric strips .
The Online Electric Vehicle ( OLEV ) , towing three buses , went into service at an amusement park in southern Seoul .
If the prototype proves successful , there are plans to try it out on a bus route in the capital .
The Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology ( KAIST ) , which developed the system , says OLEV needs a battery only one - fifth the size of conventional electric vehicles and eliminates the need for major recharging .
It also avoids the need for overhead wires used to power conventional trams or trolley buses .
Guests including Seoul mayor Oh Se - Hoon and KAIST president Suh Nam - Pyo were given a 2.2 - kilometre ( 1.4 - mile ) ride Tuesday around the zoo at Seoul Grand Park .
Recharging strips have been installed in four segments totalling some 400 metres along the route .
Pick - up equipment underneath OLEV collects power through non-contact magnetic charging from strips buried under the road surface .
It then distributes the power either to drive the vehicle or for battery storage .
If the system is used on Seoul bus routes , underground power lines would have to be installed on only 20 percent of the route at places like bus stops , parking places and intersections , KAIST said in a statement .
The technology was first developed in a project involving the University of California ( Berkeley ) but KAIST said that produced no tangible results .
The state - funded institute says it has applied for more than 120 patents in connection with OLEV , which it describes as safe , clean and economical .
" Of all the world 's electric vehicles , this is the most economical system , " Suh told reporters , adding the operating cost is only about one - third of ordinary electric vehicles .
" The potential for application ( of this technology to public transport systems ) is limitless .
I dare say this is one of the most significant technical gains in the 21st century , " Suh said .
Suh said KAIST plans to use OLEVs to shuttle delegates at the G20 summit which Seoul will host in November .
Project director Cho Song - Ho said technical breakthroughs included an improved way of transmitting power to the pick - up device on the vehicle chassis .
Cho said a gap of at least 11 centimetres ( 4.4 inches ) was needed to take account of bumpy roads , while OLEV can suck power across a gap of up to 25 cm .
Given a normal gap , the vehicle can turn more than 70 percent of the charge into energy for the vehicle , he said .

Editor 's note : Dr. Louann Brizendine is a member of the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology and the National Board of Medical Examiners , and a clinical professor of psychiatry at the University of California , San Francisco .
She is founder and director of the Women 's Mood and Hormone Clinic .
She wrote " The Female Brain " and , just released , " The Male Brain . "
Brizendine will appear on HLN's " The Joy Behar Show " Friday at 9 .
( CNN ) --
Although women the world over have been doing it for centuries , we can't really blame a guy for being a guy .
And this is especially true now that we know that the male and female brains have some profound differences .
Our brains are mostly alike .
We are the same species , after all .
But the differences can sometimes make it seem like we are worlds apart .
The " defend your turf " area -- dorsal premammillary nucleus -- is larger in the male brain and contains special circuits to detect territorial challenges by other males .
And his amygdala , the alarm system for threats , fear and danger is also larger in men .
These brain differences make men more alert than women to potential turf threats .
Meanwhile , the " I feel what you feel " part of the brain -- mirror - neuron system -- is larger and more active in the female brain .
So women can naturally get in sync with others ' emotions by reading facial expressions , interpreting tone of voice and other nonverbal emotional cues .
Perhaps the biggest difference between the male and female brain is that men have a sexual pursuit area that is 2.5 times larger than the one in the female brain .
Not only that , but beginning in their teens , they produce 20 to 25 - fold more testosterone than they did during pre-adolescence .
If testosterone were beer , a 9 - year - old boy would be getting the equivalent of a cup a day .
But a 15 - year - old would be getting the equivalent of nearly two gallons a day .
This fuels their sexual engines and makes it impossible for them to stop thinking about female body parts and sex .
And so begins the ' Man Trance '
All that testosterone drives the " Man Trance " -- that glazed - eye look a man gets when he sees breasts .
As a woman who was among the ranks of the early feminists , I wish I could say that men can stop themselves from entering this trance .
But the truth is , they can't .
Their visual brain circuits are always on the lookout for fertile mates .
Whether or not they intend to pursue a visual enticement , they have to check out the goods .
To a man , this is the most natural response in the world , so he 's dismayed by how betrayed his wife or girlfriend feels when she sees him eyeing another woman .
Men look at attractive women the way we look at pretty butterflies .
They catch the male brain 's attention for a second , but then they flit out of his mind .
Five minutes later , while we 're still fuming , he 's deciding whether he wants ribs or chicken for dinner .
He asks us , " What 's wrong ? "
We say , " Nothing . "
He shrugs and turns on the TV .
We smolder and fear that he 'll leave us for another woman .
Not surprisingly , the different objectives that men and women have in mating games put us on opposing teams -- at least at first .
The female brain is driven to seek security and reliability in a potential mate before she has sex .
But a male brain is fueled to mate and mate again .
Until , that is , he mates for life .
Despite stereotypes to the contrary , the male brain can fall in love just as hard and fast as the female brain , and maybe more so .
When he meets and sets his sights on capturing " the one , " mating with her becomes his prime directive .
And when he succeeds , his brain makes an indelible imprint of her .
Lust and love collide and he 's hooked .
The ' Doting Daddy Brain '
A man in hot pursuit of a mate does n't even remotely resemble a devoted , doting daddy .
But that 's what his future holds .
When his mate becomes pregnant , she 'll emit pheromones that will waft into his nostrils , stimulating his brain to make more of a hormone called prolactin .
Her pheromones will also cause his testosterone production to drop by 30 percent .
These hormonal changes make him more likely to help with the baby .
They also change his perceptual circuitry , increasing his ability to hear a baby cry , something many men can't do very well before their wives are pregnant .
And a word to the wise for all the young mothers who are reluctant to let your husbands hold and care for your newborn .
The more hands - on care a father gives his infant , the more his brain aligns with the role of fatherhood .
So , hand over the baby .
His emotions run deep
Although men have earned the reputation for being more stoic than women , they actually have stronger emotional reactions than we do .
They just do n't show it very often .
Studies of men's faces show that the male brain 's initial emotional reaction can be stronger than the female brain's .
But within 2.5 seconds , he changes his face to hide the emotion , or even reverse it .
The repeated practice of hiding his emotions gives men the classic poker face .
It 's his poker face and his analytical response to personal problems that can put him in the doghouse .
She 's crying as she talks about what 's wrong with the relationship , and instead of hugging her , his mind is racing to find a way to resolve the problem as soon as possible .
With practice and because of the way their brains are wired , men use their analytical brain structures , not their emotional ones , to find a solution .
They enjoy this advantage , but women often take affront to it .
When you 're telling your husband your problem and he tries to solve it instead of hearing you out , you may think he 's being insensitive .
But that 's not what 's going on in his brain .
He 's working to solve the problem so he can relieve your pain as quickly as possible .
Not because he does n't care or does n't want to listen , but because he loves you .
' Lovable Grandpas ' and ' Grumpy Old Men '
As men age , the male brain hormones change and the male brain and body goes into the stage of life called andropause .
The king of male hormones -- testosterone -- goes down and the queen of female hormones -- estrogen -- goes up .
Whether Grandpa is your kids ' hero or the grouch they hate to visit depends a lot on how he handles these hormonal changes .
For example , if his testosterone levels drop to an abnormally low level , he can feel tired , irritable and even depressed .
Some men in this condition seek hormone replacement therapy and others find relief in exercise , more frequent sex , and spending more time with other people .
The grandpa that kids can't wait to see is the one who 's feeling the effects of the hormone oxytocin , often called the " cuddle hormone . "
He 's fun and playful and likes to hear what his grandchildren have to say .
He 's much more patient with your children than he was with you , when you were growing up .
The love circuits of the mature male brain can be hijacked by his grandkids , even more than they were by his own children .
The ' Lonely Hearts Club '
Not only is the mature male brain more receptive to closer bonds , but it 's also more sensitive to loneliness .
Nobody thrives when they 're lonely , but it seems to take a major toll on older men .
Sixty percent of divorces in couples over the age of 50 are initiated by women , leaving their husbands shell - shocked and devastated .
Once his wife leaves , unless he makes a point of socializing more with other people , his brain stops getting the social workout it needs to make him feel good about himself .
If he becomes a loner , his social - approval circuits do n't get activated .
In brain scan studies of older males researchers have found that the brain 's pleasure and reward areas , the VTA and the NAc , remain more active in men who are social .
So do n't begrudge the divorcee or the new widower some socializing and seeking female companionship .
The bottom line
The human brain is the best learning machine on the planet and human beings are capable of making major changes in our lives .
But there are some things that the male brain and female brain are not likely to change anytime soon .
And it makes more sense to deal with these brain realities , than to argue with them or ignoring them .
The best advice I have for women is make peace with the male brain .
Let men be men .

The media world — it changes .
A few years ago , Conde Nast was a golden castle on the hill , and the internet was a squatter 's hovel / " artist 's colony " far below .
But lo !
Now , former Nasties are flooding the internet themselves .
In the wake of former House & Garden editor Dominique Browning 's chronicle of her post - layoff descent into egg - obsessed madness John Koblin has taken an informal survey of the former editors of Conde Nast magazines that were shuttered in the Great Magazine Die-Off .
Cookie 's Pilar Guzman is creating a website .
Domino 's Deborah Needleman is starting a website .
Jane 's Brandon Holley is already running a website .
It 's worth noting what none of these former queens of the magazine world are doing : running a magazine .
These are former Conde Nast editors .
They should , ostensibly , have their pick of magazine jobs — if not ones quite as prestigious as their last ones , at least somewhere close on a masthead elsewhere .
Instead , they 're all fleeing magazines altogether in favor of the web .
And many of them are planning to start websites , a pretty brazen gamble even during good economic times .
Magazine jobs are no longer secure , lucrative , or abundant enough to even be a viable option for those who would have had a whole buffet of them to choose from not long ago .
Internet media jobs are no more secure ( trust us ! ) , but the barrier to entry is low .
Might as well give it a shot !
There 's always the Peace Corps if this does n't work out .

Most of the time , the simple things get to me .
Like really get to me .
And today was no different .
Today , I was introduced to the latest project from local Web designer Chris Kalani , an incredibly simple and beautiful site that seems to have pared finding Portland Web developers , designers , illustrators , and photographers down to just the bare essentials .
And the only difficult thing about using it , is spelling it .
Introducing PRTLND .
PRTLND was built in a weekend and launched today .
The best part about it ?
It ’s an incredibly useful resource already .
And besides — seriously — great domain name .
The idea is to collect every person in Portland who makes things in one place for easy discovery .
Pretty simple .
Right now I ’m accepting designers , developers , and photographers and I will continue to add categories as we fill up the site .
Now , I ’ve tried running sites like this , and it ’s a little more taxing than you ’d think .
But the pure simplicity of Kalani ’s site has me thinking that it could fill up pretty quickly .
Especially if his other sites like yay !
everyday are any indication .
And if he does ?
He ’ll branch out to include other interesting Portland people .
So , if you ’re a Portland Web developer , designer , illustrator , photographer , or any combination thereof , I ’d highly suggest you head over to the site and add yourself to PRTLND .

The firebrand youth leader of South Africa 's ruling party has made it clear that he will not be silenced , demanding Zimbabwe - style land seizures from white farmers and vowing to keep singing a controversial song .
Under pressure after the murder of white supremacist Eugene Terreblanche stoked fears of racial strife , the African National Congress ( ANC ) told members to avoid inflammatory songs and comment .
Youth League leader Julius Malema said he would accede to the demand to drop the phrase " Kill the Boer " from a song that dates from the era of the struggle against apartheid but would keep singing the rest of it .
Boer is the Afrikaans word for a farmer .
" We will take out the ' Kill the Boer ' in the song , " Mr Malema told a press conference .
" We do so because the ANC says we should restrain ourselves . "
Mr Malema , 29 , is accused by critics of encouraging racial division 16 years after the end of white minority rule .
Opposition parties have called on president Jacob Zuma to rein him in .
But Mr Malema has a passionate following within the youth wing and among many other black South Africans who complain they have not benefited as much as they should from majority rule .
Mr Malema dismissed accusations that his singing of " Kill the Boer " was a factor in Saturday 's murder of Mr Terreblanche by two black workers - which police suspect was over a pay dispute .
" We have no blood on our hands , " said Mr Malema , who threw a British journalist out of the news conference , saying he had a " white tendency " .
Mr Malema was speaking after his return from a visit to Zimbabwe where he met president Robert Mugabe and hailed the seizure of white - owned farms to give to landless blacks as a success South Africa should emulate .
" We are in a serious economic struggle that seeks to redistribute the wealth to the people , " he said .
" This is what we need the ANC to champion .
Land reform in Zimbabwe has been very successful . "
Mr Malema says land seizures in South Africa should be " aggressive " and " militant " but says he is not calling for violence .
Mr Mugabe 's critics say his land confiscations helped ruin the country 's rich agriculture and drove more than 3 million Zimbabweans overseas - most to seek work in South Africa .
Parliament in South Africa is set to review a draft policy later this month for a new land tenure system , although the government controlling Africa 's biggest economy and largest maize producer says this will not mean nationalising land .

The AIDS virus escapes treatment inside progenitor blood cells .
HIV hides away inside progenitor blood cells .

HIV infection can persist despite treatment because the virus stays dormant inside cells , ready to multiply again after therapy stops .
Now , researchers have discovered that progenitor cells that develop into immune cells are an important reservoir for the virus .
These cellular reservoirs are resistant to the immune response of the host and the highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) administered to patients .
That means the virus can attack white blood cells known as CD4 +
T lymphocytes — which help the body to mount an immune response — after treatment .
" There are so many instances where patients stopped taking drugs and the virus rebounded , " says Kathleen Collins , a cellular biologist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor , lead author of the study published in Nature Medicine1 today .
" There is no way to get people off the drugs . "
HAART can stop the spread of the virus by preventing the viral genome from integrating into new cells .
The combinations of drugs used do n't attack the cell that makes copies of the virus , but they can prevent the newly made virus from infecting more cells .
The researchers show that HIV can target haematopoietic progenitor cells ( HPCs ) from the bone marrow before they give rise to white blood cells .
The team took these cells from HAART - treated patients who have shown no detectable traces of the virus for at least six months .
When the researchers forced the cells to differentiate into white blood cells in the lab , they found the HIV genome in these cells in about 40 % of the donors .
They also took cells from the bone marrow of healthy people and showed that the virus killed some cells , but in other cells the virus integrated into the cells ' chromosomes and did not reproduce .
These cells grew as if they were uninfected by the virus .
" If the drugs are on - board , the virus is still being made but it is not doing much harm because it can't spread , " says Collins .
In the absence of the drugs , the infection renews , and patients need to return to the therapy and stay on it .
" If you shorten the therapy even to two years , that would dramatically change things , " she says , by bringing down costs and allowing the therapy to be used more widely in poor countries .
Dangerous dormancy
Previous research2 conducted by Robert Siliciano , a molecular biologist at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore , Maryland , established that CD4 +
T cells can be latent reservoirs for the virus .
But he and his team showed that residual levels of virus in the blood of patients on HAART were often dominated by a virus population they could n't find in CD4 +
T cells .
The new work may provide an explanation of that observation , Siliciano says .

If HIV is in these long - lived progenitor cells , the reservoirs can last for the entire life of the host cell .
But there may be a way to target these reservoirs , says Collins " One way is to find a way to push the cells from latency to go into an active infection while patients are still on their drugs , " she says .
This work helps us understand the obstacles to eliminating the virus that survives despite effective antiretroviral treatment , says Clyde Crumpacker , a virologist at Harvard University in Boston , Massachusetts , who works with HPCs and HIV .
Other work , he says , has suggested that HPCs are resistant to HIV infection3 .
" One of the hopes has been that HPCs are a protected sanctuary , " says Crumpacker .
" This paper forces us to reexamine that hope . "
Siliciano adds , " Eradication efforts will only be successful if all of the reservoirs for HIV are identified and eliminated . "
GOP operative Caroline Hunter could face disbarment , according to first in series of investigative reports at RAW STORY
Related : Disgraced vote cager , Rove protégé Tim Griffin now running for Congress ...
Brad Friedman Byon 3/31/2010 , 8:05 am PT
[ Updated below with details on the second part of Jacobson 's series , just posted at RAW STORY , in which he ties together Hunter 's EAC appointment and dubious tenure , representing the RNC 's nefarious " voter fraud " fraudster wing ( which is to say , pretty much the entire RNC these days ! )
The second in the series offers important info and a good reminder of the names you 'll be seeing again soon , singing the same old phony , discredited " voter fraud " songs once again as November nears , as sure as the sun rises in the East . ]
Brad Jacobson has filed the first in a series of exclusives at RAW STORY concerning GOP operative and Bush - appointed FEC commissioner Caroline Hunter .
[ Disclosure : Jacobson has blogged at The BRAD BLOG in the past . ]
Here 's the lede for his first excellent investigative report yesterday :
Caroline Hunter , a Bush - appointed Federal Election Commissioner who remains in office , provided misleading statements under oath in an effort to conceal Republican National Committee involvement in vote suppression activities during the 2004 presidential election , a Raw Story investigation has found .
Legal experts say Hunter 's submission of such statements under oath is a serious ethical and professional breach which could warrant a bar review and potential disbarment .
At the time , Hunter was serving as deputy counsel to the Republican National Committee .
The report goes on to detail how Hunter --- who , as The BRAD BLOG has highlighted over the years , had previously been allowed to serve as a commissioner on the U.S. Election Assistance Commission ( EAC ) --- deceptively misrepresented the facts , on behalf of the RNC , in a 2004 voter caging hearing in federal court .
Jacobson quotes election law experts , including two long - time former DoJ Voting Section attorneys , who argue that while the way she couched her sworn testimony may " shield her from perjury charges , " the statements she gave may " still pose ethical problems that potentially could result in her disbarment . " ...
Garry Hebert , who spent more than twenty years prosecuting voting rights cases at the DoJ told Jacobson after reviewing the Hunter matter : " If a lawyer makes a misleading statement in sworn testimony to the court , and then the court not only finds that the statement was misleading but it turns out to be ' belied ' by the actual facts in the case , I think a state bar would be interested in that . "
Both Deborah Rhode , a Stanford University legal ethics professor , and Joe Rich , a long - serving former DoJ Voting Section chief , offered similar assessments .
While it was n't mentioned in Jacobson 's first article in the series , Hunter was appointed to her position at the FEC after serving as a commissioner on the EAC , the dreadfully - failed body responsible for overseeing federal certification for the nation 's electronic voting systems .
As The BRAD BLOG detailed in 2007 , after being nominated for the EAC post by George W. Bush that year , Hunter , despite her known record of involvement in voter caging chicanery in Ohio in 2004 and her lack of election administration experience ( as required by law for commissioners ) was approved for the commission without either a public hearing in the Senate Rules Committee , as chaired by Sen.
Dianne Feinstein ( D - CA ) , or even a recorded vote in the U.S. Senate .
She was allowed to take her position on the EAC by simple unanimous consent on the floor .
Be sure to check out Jacobson 's superb reporting for the details on exactly what Hunter is accused of having done , and the slippery way in which she did it .
* * *
A related connecting - the - dots post - script :
The BRAD BLOG has filed dozens of reports on RNC vote caging over the years , including details on one of the lead GOP operative / cagers from 2004 , former Karl Rove protégé Tim Griffin .
Griffin was the one who had authored a number of the voter caging - related e-mails that Hunter misleadingly testified in regard to , as Jacobson details in his story .
( Our articles concerning Griffin are indexed here ) .
In the wake of Bush's U.S. Attorney Purge scandal in 2007 , Griffin , who had replaced one of the purged U.S. Attorneys in Arkansas ' Eastern District , was forced to tearily resign his new post as his role in the caging schemes during the 2004 Presidential Election came to came to light during Congressional hearings .
Nonetheless , as most shamed GOPers do , Griffin is now attempting his return from ignominy and is now running for the U.S. Congress in Arkansas ' 2nd District .
Old vote suppressors never die .
They just count on the media forgetting about --- or never having covered in the first place --- their nefarious , anti-democracy schemes .

UPDATE 3/31/10 1:23 pm PT : Part II of Jacobson 's series has now been posted at RAW .
This chapter picks up on Hunter 's EAC ascendancy , as we briefly noted above , and offers a detailed , connect - the - dots report on the various nefarious RNC players who gamed the EAC --- as assisted by Hunter --- to bury reports on the GOP 's " voter fraud " fraud and more .
Long time readers of The BRAD BLOG may be familiar with much of what Jacobson reports in Part II , but he 's done a tremendous job in tying together many of the various odds and ends that we 've covered in separate articles over the year .
His second report ( assisted by Muriel Kane this time out ) is very well worth the read even if you think you 're familiar with all of these data points , as even I picked up a few items that I had n't been previously familiar with !

1953 : Central Intelligence Agency director Allen Dulles authorizes the MK - ULTRA project .
The agency launches one of its most dubious covert programs ever , turning unsuspecting humans into guinea pigs for its research into mind - altering drugs .
More than a decade before psychologist Timothy Leary advocated the benefits of LSD and urged everyone to " turn on , tune in , drop out , " the CIA 's Technical Services Staff launched the highly classified project to study the mind - control effects of this and other psychedelic drugs , using unwitting U.S. and Canadian citizens as lab mice .
Dulles wanted to close the " brainwashing gap " that arose after the United States learned that American prisoners of war in Korea were subjected to mind - control techniques by their captors .
Loathe to be outdone by foreign enemies , the CIA sought , through its research , to devise a truth serum to enhance the interrogations of POWs and captured spies .
The agency also wanted to develop techniques and drugs – such as " amnesia pills " – to create CIA superagents who would be immune to the mind - control efforts of adversaries .
MK -ULTRA even hoped to create a " Manchurian Candidate " , or programmable assassin , and devise a way to control the minds of pesky despots , like Fidel Castro – giving credence forevermore to claims by the tinfoil - hat contingent that the government is out to control our minds .
In addition to drugs , the program included more than a hundred sub-projects that involved radiological implants , hypnosis and subliminal persuasion , electroshock therapy and isolation techniques .
( The MK in the project name referred to the Technical Services Division that oversaw the project , and ULTRA was a security classification applied to top- secret intelligence . )
More than 30 universities and institutions participated in CIA - funded research , though not all were aware the spy agency was their benefactor , because funding was sometimes laundered through shell organizations .
Under the guise of research , LSD , whose psychedelic properties were discovered by a Swiss chemist in 1943 , was secretly administered to CIA employees , U.S. soldiers and psychiatric patients , as well as the general public .
One federal drug agent who worked as a " consultant " for the CIA for a project dubbed " Operation Midnight Climax " hired prostitutes to slip the drug to unsuspecting clients , then watched through two - way mirrors as the clients tripped out .
He also reportedly slipped the drug to patrons at bars and restaurants .
The CIA ultimately concluded that the drug was too unpredictable for reliable research , but that was too late for Frank Olson .
Olson was a 43 - year - old civilian germ - warfare researcher for the U.S. Army who was also a CIA employee and an unwitting recipient of CIA acid .
During a 1953 meeting at a mountain retreat with MK - ULTRA head Dr. Sidney Gottlieb and other CIA employees , Olson and four other scientists drank a glass of Cointreau that had been secretly spiked with LSD .
They were told about the drug about 20 minutes after ingesting it .
Olson apparently had a severe reaction and left the retreat in an agitated state and later threatened to resign .
The CIA claimed he suffered a sudden bout of extreme paranoia and depression and sent him to a psychiatrist in New York for consultation .
He died in a " fall " from the 10th floor of his New York hotel room .
A CIA employee who had accompanied him to New York reported that he awoke at 1:30 a.m. to see Olson hurl himself through the closed window .
Olson left a 38 - year - old widow and three children under the age of 10 .
In the absence of other evidence , Olson 's family reluctantly accepted the CIA 's puzzling explanation that the scientist had been suddenly seized by a fatal depression .
When news of the CIA 's secret LSD program finally leaked out 20 years later , the family learned through a congressional inquiry that Olson had been slipped some of the hallucinogen days before his death .
The CIA continued to insist that Olson had committed suicide , but at President Gerald Ford 's urging , the family was paid $ 750,000 .
It was n't until the 1990s , when Olson 's son had his father 's body exhumed and examined , that he discovered that his father might have actually died from a blunt force trauma to the head , which may have been received prior to his fall from the window .
Olson was n't the only casualty of the CIA 's drug tests .
A tennis pro who had gone to the New York Psychiatric Institute for depression following a divorce fell into a coma and died .
He 'd been administered a derivative of mescaline .
There were other cases of suspect deaths and lives left in ruin .
The victim 's families might have sued to obtain records of the secret program , but CIA Director Richard Helms had ordered the MK - ULTRA project files destroyed in 1973 .
The program was brought to light in 1975 through investigations by the Church Committee and Rockefeller Commission that were established to investigate government surveillance operations in the wake of the Watergate wiretapping scandal and other domestic - spying revelations .
By then , the MK - ULTRA project had supposedly been closed .
But this was by no means the end to misguided covert government programs , such as the remote - viewing project at SRI .
Another , less - organized military project , inspired the story behind the recent film The Men Who Stare at Goats .
Dulles gave the go - ahead for MK - ULTRA , as it turns out , on the very day that Ian Fleming 's first James Bond novel , Casino Royale , appeared .
Coincidence ?
You decide .

Well it turns out there 's a big difference between adopting moral platitudes from thousands of years ago , and trying out their sex advice .
Some of the " tips " from the Kama Sutra seem to be setting people up for serious injury should they be performed incorrectly , or in some cases , if they 're performed at all .
Vatsyayana 's Kama Sutra was a strategy guide for the interaction of penises and vaginas in Gupta - era India ( 320 to 550 CE ) , meant to be read by sexual partners to enhance their lovemaking .
That 's around the same time the New Testament was made official , and people still take that book pretty seriously .

7 The Suspended Congress
" When a man supports himself against a wall , and the woman , sitting on his hands joined together and held underneath her , throws her arms round his neck , and putting her thighs alongside his waist , moves herself by her feet , which are touching the wall against which the man is leaning , it is called the ' suspended congress .

Oh it 's just a little standing position .

Well , to most men , the idea of having sex standing up is a slippery , pride - greased slope towards repeating the phrase , " I 'm so sorry , " over your naked heap of a body and his own rapidly blue - ing balls .

So : Visa and Mastercard — who 've helped ensure that your brokeass stays broke after buying things that leave you broke — waived fees on Haiti donation transactions .
Wells Fargo did n't .
Somebody on the internet bitched about it .
Wells Fargo 's response is hysterical :
Michael Klosterman , a spokesman for Wells Fargo , defended the bank 's response to the Haiti disaster , saying the money it donated to Haiti more than makes up for their transaction fees .
" We have given $ 100,000 to the American Red Cross , and on January 19 we pledged an additional $ 250,000 to support the non-profits in Florida that are mobilizing the relief efforts , " Klosterman said .
" We decided that donating a sum of money would be quicker and more beneficial than waiving transaction fees because the funds would get to the people quicker .
It would take the equivalent of $ 35 million in transactions to raise the amount of money we actually donated . "
Get why this is funny ?
1. Because the amount Wells Fargo has given is so small !
$ 350,000 is , um , nothing .
That 's a house .
A small house .
That 's not even a studio in Manhattan .
Is that even a college education ?
2 . There probably wo n't be $ 35 M in transactions , which is the slimy inherent reasoning Wells Fargo uses to justify not waiving the fee , widely missing the point that transaction fees are the banking customer 's bane of existence , and thus , might get in the way of getting money to Haiti .
Also , they put out a press line that also subtly tries to advertise their low banking fees , which is as insensitive as it is stupid .
3. Bank of America donated $ 1 M , waived fees , and are matching employee contributions , and they 're just the worst .
What 's that make Wells Fargo ?
Seeing as how their stock price is thirteen points ahead of Bank of America's , for one thing , the more valued stock of the two companies for a reason , but for another , fucking cheap .
Anyway , the point is that a liquidated bank could turn Haiti from a Third World Country into a First World Country sometime by the middle of February , but because banks are institutions predicated on nothing more than trying to grow money when they 're not separating their customers from their money and making it theirs , they 'll simply throw a few bucks Haiti's way because they think it creates good will amongst
The People and that it makes
The People want to bank with them , and for the dumbest ones , it does !
So really it 's a choice between evil and really evil , and in this case , Wells Fargo won The " Really Evil " Trophy while Bank of America wins The " Bullshit Good Graces " Ribbon .
If anything , it certainly makes choosing between buying the two stocks easier .
Update : A reader corrects my embarrassingly bad misreading of Google Finance .
" Probably a better way to compare the value of the two companies is to look at the total value of their stock , which would be the price of one share times the number of shares they 've issued .
On Google Finance it 's listed as Mkt Cap ( market capitalization ) , and BAC's is 131.31B ( 8.65 B shares x $ 15.18 per share ) , while WFC is 147.23B ( 5.18 B shares x $ 28.43 per share ) .
So WFC is worth , as a company , more than BAC , but only about 12 % more .
They just have n't issued as many shares ( 5.1 billion vs. 8.6 billion ) , so each share is more valuable because it represents a larger piece of the company .
Google , for instance , has a market cap of 168B ( about 12 % more than WFC ) but has only issued 317 million shares , which is why a single share costs $ 530 . "

The epicenter was about 95 miles ( 152 km ) south - southwest of the capital , Santiago , and about 90 miles ( 145 km ) away from Valparasio , where Pinera was to be inaugurated .
Television footage showed the inauguration proceeding without a hitch .
The quake was almost 22 miles deep and centered 95 miles southwest of Santiago , according to USGS .
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said in a statement that " a destructive Pacific - wide tsunami is not expected " and there is no tsunami threat to Hawaii .
[ Posted at 9:54 a.m. ]
An earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 7.2 has struck south of Santiago , Chile , the United States Geological Survey reports .

Participating : Fernando ALONSO ( Ferrari ) , Jenson BUTTON ( McLaren ) , Lewis HAMILTON ( McLaren ) , Felipe MASSA ( Ferrari ) , Michael SCHUMACHER ( Mercedes GP ) .
Q. A question to all of you .
What are you most looking forward to during this season ?
Who is going to start ?
The World Champion .
Jenson BUTTON :
The same as all of us I think , and that is getting out there .
It has been a few months since we actually raced for three of us here , so getting out there and racing , that 's what we all love .
Testing is part of the job but racing is the bit what we really enjoy .
I am looking forward to getting out there .
It is such a competitive season , it looks like .
It is possibly one of the most exciting seasons we have seen in Formula One , so just being a part of that is very special .
Q. Lewis , what are you most looking forward to ?
Lewis HAMILTON : Just getting on the track .
Testing was good fun but obviously we did not have as much testing as we have had in the past and the more time in the car the more fun we have .
Just looking forward to it all kicking off and to see where everyone else sits .
Q. Felipe ?
Felipe MASSA : Well , to get back to racing after eight months .
It is a long time .
I am looking forward to getting back to racing , to starting in a good direction after as Lewis said not many tests .
But it is nice to be back racing .
Q. Michael , after an even longer absence what are you looking forward to ?
And welcome back .
Michael SCHUMACHER : Thank you .
The green light or the red light going off .
Q . The green light or rather when the red goes off ?
MS : Yes .
FM : You are very motivated .
You are already in the overalls .
MS : Exactly .
Q. Fernando ?
Fernando ALONSO :
The same as everybody .
Just starting the competition , the racing .
Testing is okay but it is just preparation for the race itself , so looking forward to Sunday .
Q. Who has walked around the circuit ?
Any of you ?
Michael , what are your thoughts on the new section of the circuit ?
It is all probably fairly new to you .
MS : The first part looks quite exciting .
The later part a little less exciting , but then you have to drive it and feel it in reality .
Q . Has anyone else been around the circuit to have a look at it ?
Jenson , been around the circuit ?
JB : No , we are going out this afternoon .
Q. Lewis ?
LH : The same .
Q. Jenson , a new team .
What are the greatest changes and challenges for you ?
JB : I think moving teams .
I was with my previous team for seven years , so moving teams can be tricky .
It is a completely new environment , it is a real challenge and most of us do not really like change , but it has been good .
Even after sort of two months I really feel part of the team .
We have not even gone racing yet and I feel a big part of the team .
I have always worked very hard to make myself fit into a team reasonably well but the team have been great .
They are so hungry for a good season .
Last year for them was not the best and it has made them hungry for success this year .
It has been good and having the simulator there has helped me a lot to get used to the environment of being in this car .
I spent a lot of time at the factory , not just with the engineers , just spending time at the factory , so I am part of the furniture there .
Testing has gone well as well .
It is important to really use every second or every minute you are with the team as it comes around very quickly .
We have Friday and Saturday morning before qualifying but it is not a lot of time , so you have got to be ready for when you arrive here in Bahrain .
Q. Having number one and being World Champion on the car .
How motivating is that or is it even restrictive ?
JB : I can't see it as restrictive in any way .
You should look at it in a positive way .
Stepping into the car and seeing the number one on it is a very special feeling , especially here in Bahrain at the first race .
Just before I put on my helmet and I look at the car and see the No 1 it is going to be an emotional moment but as soon as you step into the car and close your visor last season is out the window and you are purely focussed on this year .
Q. You won here last year .
Is it a good circuit for you ?
JB : I like it .
It is a fun circuit to drive and it is a place you can overtake which is great .
The new section is pretty slow .
There are nine new corners on the circuit and most of them are slow now , so it is tricky and I look forward to getting out there and seeing what we make of it as it is difficult walking around it and trying to understand it .
The simulator is useful but still in reality it is nice to get out there and feel it in the car .
I hope it does make overtaking better but I am not sure if that is going to be the case .
I think it could possibly make the racing more exciting as it is very tricky , so I look forward to getting out on the circuit tomorrow morning .
Q. Lewis , the man next to you is the reigning World Champion .
How does that change things for you ?
Is that extra motivation ?
LH : I do n't think it makes a huge difference .
Jenson has been welcomed into the team and he seems to be doing a great job , very productive , enthusiastic and he has really brought a lot of energy and enthusiasm to the team .
I can only see it as a positive .
On my side , for me , just from coming from not so good a year last year but to finish on quite a high I feel just as determined as ever if not more .
Q. Which of the rule changes has been the most challenging as far as you are concerned ?
LH : Probably just being a little bit heavier .
Otherwise it has been pretty straight forward .
Just trying to understand the tyres a little bit and understand the approach to the long stints being a little bit different to last year on lighter fuel but otherwise it is pretty straight forward .
I am sure this weekend will be a challenge for everyone but we are all in the same boat .
Q . You finished second here in 2007 , the first time you came here .
LH : That seems like a long time ago .
We had a good car back then .
The last two years things have n't been particularly special but hopefully this weekend will be a new start for us and hopefully a positive for me and Jenson .
Q. Felipe , a big welcome back to you .
What is it like to return , to be back in the car and back at a race meeting again ?
FM : It is just nice to be back in business .
That is my job for many years .
I have lost a bit of races and just nice to be back .
I feel really happy and a lot of motivation to get back to the job .
Q . You are a former winner here , but also in the past you have had some slow parts to the season .
Is that something you are conscious of and determined to change ?
FM : I think it is something that we understood in the past that the first race is important to finish , important to score points .
Even in the last years we always had some problems in the car to finish the race .
That I hope does n't happen .
I hope we can finish most of the races in good points as we know at the end of the season it is always important to be there on a good amount of points .
Many people say at the beginning of the season what is important is the reliability .
Reliability is always important .
It is important to finish the race .
We did a lot of kilometres in the winter test which helps when you have a good car to start the season .
Q. Michael , what 's it like to be back at a race meeting when you are a driver and fully involved after an absence of three years ?
MS : Well , naturally it is a bit more intense .
From the morning to the evening with lots more details than you want and naturally you have to pay attention .
Q. How much are you still team building ?
People have spoken how you built a team at Ferrari .
What is happening at Mercedes now ?
MS : I think it is difficult to say right now what is going to be the development .
Naturally you have to adapt , you have to evolve developing into the team .
It is probably the thing that you will find some potential , you still can improve , to understand how at certain moments the team will work , why it will work , how you can combine the two things .
But so far I have to say that the guys are good guys .
It is good harmony , particularly due to knowing the boss quite well and he knows me too .
It makes things a lot easier , a lot smoother , but otherwise I am sure there is some potential we will have to develop .
Q. You are a two - time winner here .
What are your feelings about this circuit ?
MS : Making it three .
Q. Fernando is a two - time winner as well , are n't you ?
FA : Yes , three also .
Q. But Fernando , again new team , new challenges .
What are the major challenges ?
What are the major changes ?
FA : As Jenson said I think every time you change team you need to adapt yourself a little bit to the new people , the new philosophy of working , of preparing the season .
It has been a great time so far .
I have been very comfortable with the team from day one to now , so I think we arrive at the first race with a good preparation and ready for the fight .
Q. Ferrari have been said to be one of the two top teams .
Is that the way you see it ?
FA : Not really .
We are not comparing too much the times in winter or making many predictions for these first races .
We have just been concentrating on our programme to try to be as prepared a possible for the first race .
I think the four teams - Red Bull , Mercedes , McLaren and Ferrari - any of the four teams can be a favourite for this race and for the first part of the championship with , I am sure , some teams also like Sauber and Force India , they will have a very good race as well .
I think we will do our best .
We are well prepared for this start of the season but we want to be World Champions in November , not in March .
We will do our best but the goal is to win the championship and we know this is not easy at all and we need to work very hard for 10 months , so it is only the start .
QUESTIONS FROM THE FLOOR
Q. ( Thomas Richtr - TV Nova )
For all the drivers .
If it was up to you and not working groups or the FIA , would you choose this year 's regulation regarding the refuelling ban and heavy cars at the start or last year 's regulation when it was a sprint from pit stop to pit stop ?
FA : I am happy with any decision .
It is just a new challenge for all of us .
For the engineers , teams , drivers it is change in Formula One , so any change is normally welcome as it offers you the possibility of discovering some new area of our sport .
I am happy with the change but I was happy last year .
We will see .
We need to give some time to the new regulations to see how the races are .
If we see more overtaking , if not ?
Maybe the races are very spectacular or maybe the races are very boring .
We need to wait and see a few races to see if the new regulations are working or not .
MS : Last year ... yeah , for the simple fact it leaves more scope for strategy .
Naturally , as a race driver you want to drive the fastest car and if you have full tanks to half full tanks it naturally makes a big difference .
FM : I think the regulations have to be good for everybody : for the drivers , for the teams but also a lot for the guys who are watching the race .
It 's very difficult to say which ones ( regulations ) I prefer , the new ones or the ones from last year .
We have n't yet done a single race , it 's very early to say which one I prefer , but I think if it 's good to everybody - for the moment I do n't think anybody is against the regulations , so if it 's good for everybody , it should be no problem to change .
It 's also a new challenge for everybody , as Fernando says , so we just need to focus on every new point and try to do the best .
LH : I think it 's a new challenge in the sport for all of us and the key is that we 're moving forward , so I 'm excited to see how it works and I 'm sure we will do everything we can , collectively , to put on a good show .
JB : I think everything 's been said .
I think turn one 's going to be pretty interesting with that much fuel - going down to turn one .
I think we forget about qualifying as well .
Qualifying is different to last year : we will be running on low tanks all the way through , which is great .
I think we will have more of an understanding after qualifying than the last couple of seasons with the cars on low fuel .
But I think the differences from qualifying to the races will be bigger than we 've seen before .
Some cars will be very good on light fuel , maybe not so good on 150 / 160 kilos of fuel , so it 's going to be interesting to see .
Q. ( Jonathan Legard - BBC Sport )
Michael , do you remember how you felt coming into the sport for the first time , up against champions who you had watched , the likes of Senna and Prost and so on ?
With your record and reputation , you 're very much the man to beat ; is it going to be everyone else 's aim to attack you and challenge you on the track ?
MS : Yes .
Basically when I arrived , I was n't that full of confidence to be on the same playing field but being with them the first time , I noticed that I could be ( competitive ) and I do feel pretty much the same now .
There 's no reason why somebody should not feel in the position to fight me because all those guys who will be on the grid on Sunday have good reasons to be there because they 're highly talented .
I have the greatest respect for each of them ; for me , each one is a big competitor that I have to look at .
Q. ( Livio Oricchio - O Estado de Sao Paulo )
Michael , you always said you do n't like understeer in your cars , and this year , due to the weight of the car , the tyres , the nature of the cars , you have understeer .
Do you think that because of that we may not see the best of you ?
MS : I think it varies very much from car to car , it 's a characteristic which is given to a car .
Sometimes , you 're right , it may be given by the tyres , then it 's up to you and your team to get the balance that you want , because in the past , do n't forget a car suited me because I like oversteer , I like a neutral car , the fastest car , whatever that is !
Q. ( James Allen - Financial Times )
Fernando , you 've talked about settling in ; do you think you 're ready to win ?
And what do you think of Michael coming back ?
FA : Yes , I think I 'm ready to win .
Every time you arrive at the first race of the championship you 've been preparing yourself all winter for this moment , so I 've been waiting very long to be here at Ferrari as well , many years of preparation for this moment , so now I feel ready to fight and hopefully we 're in a position to do that .
To have Michael here , OK - it was a surprise for sure when he came back but as I said many times , it 's a very good thing for all of us , for all the drivers , for our sport and that can only help Formula One and because we are part of Formula One , all the drivers , it also helps us , so I am very happy that he 's here and hopefully we can have good fights .
Q. ( Ian Parkes - The Press Association ) Question to Jenson and Lewis : just been watching the dynamic between you two guys while the other three have been answering questions at the front .
You 've been having a good laugh and a joke , sharing comments etc .
Is that a good indicator of the friendship / relationship you two have already developed over the past few weeks together ?
JB : It 's all for show !
Exactly what we were told to do by Steve ( press officer Steve Cooper ) .
LH : I agree .
We 're focusing on a potential move to acting in the future !
JB : And no one 's asking us any questions , so ...
Q. ( Sarah Holt - BBC Sport ) I have a question for you , Jenson .
How do you feel about defending your title this season against Fernando in the Ferrari , Michael back at Mercedes , Lewis in the same equipment as you will have ?
Do you feel you will need a dominant start again this weekend ?
JB : Yes , I think every championship , for any champion , I think it 's important to be quick out of the blocks .
If you look back , normally the guy that really fights for the championship and gets the championship is strong from the word ' go ' , so yes , I think it is important for all of us to be up there at the front here in Bahrain .
The competition is very fierce , I must say , but that 's why it is exciting .
For a fan of Formula One , this season should be electric , it really should be .
If it 's not , we 're doing something seriously wrong .
It 's obviously great to have Felipe back after his horrific accident last year .
Great to have Michael back because it makes me feel young again !
Looking at this race , I do n't think there have been so many competitive drivers in competitive cars for a long time , so it 's great to see .
Q. ( Jacques Deschenaux - GP Guide )
To all of you , will the new distribution of points with 25 for the first , 18 to the second , change your approach and maybe your strategy for the race ?
MS : You still want to score the 25 , so that 's the main strategy .
It 's certainly a little bit fairer , I think , in a way that if you have somebody who wins most of the races , naturally you will most likely say that he is going to be the champion by the end of the year , rather than somebody there just sitting , waiting and taking second and third places and suddenly being World Champion .
I do n't think that makes much sense , as it has been in past years .
Actually I think I was the reason why it was implemented , the small gaps , because I was winning so much and nobody could find a way to stop that .
I think it 's absolutely correct , the way it is now .
FM : I think it 's correct as well .
I think the winner , the victory is always more important than anything , so if you win , maybe to have a little bit more points is always better .
So I 'm with Michael .
LH : Well , what they said was right .
It 's another challenge , it 's a small change to the results .
As Felipe said , when you win the race it should be rewarded perhaps a little bit more than the guys who come in second and third .
I think it will be interesting to see how it pans out .
I 've not really thought about it too much to be honest .
JB : I think we need to see how it goes .
It 's the same as before .
You still want to go out and win as many races as you can .
Obviously when you 're fighting for a championship - I know how that feels now - it 's about being consistent as well .
When you 're fighting for a win , it 's very difficult to hold back and think ' I 'll come in second and pick up the points . '
We all want to win races and that 's what we 're here to do .
FA : I agree .
Q. ( Carlos Miquel - Diario AS ) Fernando , in the past you have said Michael is the best driver in history .
Now , Michael is back , do you believe the same ?
And a question for Michael : who could be your biggest rival this year ?
FA : Yes , if I said that , it 's because I really think that .
If you see the World Championships that Michael has it's something that is impossible to repeat and part of the history in our sport , as I said .
Looking at the numbers , Grand Prix wins , pole positions , championships etc , I think we all agree that Michael is the best ever , so I 'm happy that he's here and as I said , hopefully winning a championship or winning a Grand Prix with Michael on the track has more value , so we will try .
MS : At my age , I keep forgetting things if they are too long away , so what was the question ?
Basically , I think there are the four main teams that you 're looking at and in all those cars - so you 're talking about a potential eight drivers , seven around me that I have to look out for .
Four of them are sitting here right now and there are three more that are n't here right now .
It 's very tough to mention which is the one , but it does n't matter who it is , because you 're focused on the one that it is .
Q. ( Joris Fioriti - AFP )
To all of you apart from Michael Schumacher : you were saying , Fernando , that winning a race ahead of Michael Schumacher would bring more importance .
Do n't you think that if Michael starts to win too much , it 's going to be very bad for all of you in the end and for the sport too ?
FM : Well , for sure we need to work very hard not to let him win too much .
Every team wants to win but it's the best for the sport to have the best drivers on the track , the best teams fighting on the track and I think that 's always great for the sport .
Anyway , everybody wants to win , everybody wants to keep winning all the time .
But it 's a big competition , so I think it will be very difficult as we saw in the tests , to see a single car winning every race .
But anyway , you never know .
The race starts now and we need to wait and see .
LH : We have to wait and see , we have to wait and see .
JB : Yeah .
I think you 've answered it yourself .
FA : I agree !
Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone answers a question during a news conference in Santiago April 12 , 2010 .

SANTIAGO ( Reuters ) -
It is homosexuality , not celibacy , that is linked to pedophilia , the Vatican ’s Secretary of State Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone said on Monday , seeking to defuse the sex scandal that has battered the Roman Catholic Church .
On a visit to Chile , Bertone , dubbed the Deputy Pope , also said Pope Benedict would soon take more surprising initiatives regarding the sex abuse scandal but did not elaborate .
“ Many psychologists and psychiatrists have shown that there is no link between celibacy and pedophilia but many others have shown , I have recently been told , that there is a relationship between homosexuality and pedophilia , ” he told a news conference in Santiago .
“ This pathology is one that touches all categories of people , and priests to a lesser degree in percentage terms , ” he said .
“ The behavior of the priests in this case , the negative behavior , is very serious , is scandalous . ”
Bertone ’s visit to Chile comes as the Catholic Church has been buffeted by scandals concerning sexual abuse of children -- most of them boys -- by priests .
There also have been allegations of cover-ups and even that the Pope mishandled cases when he was a bishop in Germany and a Vatican official before his election in 2005 .
“ Transforming Power ” , How to ensure that women are at the heart of the Peace - Building by implementing a Feminist Peace and Security Agenda
Blog by Fionna Smyth
What if , just for one day , guns in wars zones across the world fell silent ?
That is the goal of Peace Day ; every year on 21st September , people come together all round the world to build a culture of peace and demand that all armed parties observe a 24 - hour ceasefire .
This year there is added urgency , 2020 has been a year like no other and we desperately need an end to conflict so that we can focus on our common enemy of the pandemic .
JACKSONVILLE , Fla . --
Duke relied on an old , trusted ally to reach the round of 16 in the NCAA tournament .
Again .
Defense has always been the foundation of Mike Krzyzewski's team , and the top - seeded Blue Devils sent their coach of three decades into a regional semifinal for the 19th time with a stellar performance in a 68 - 53 victory over California on Sunday .
After winning both the Atlantic Coast Conference regular - season and tournament titles , they are playing the type of suffocating defense that could put Krzyzewski back in the Final Four for an 11th time .
The Blue Devils last reached the national semifinals in 2004 , not that their coach feels as though they 've let him down lately .
" You know , I hate when somebody compares those teams of the last couple years with our national championship teams , and they say they underachieved , " Krzyzewski said .
" Are you kidding me ?
They won 30 , 29 games .
But they were limited teams , and they could n't play the defense that this team can play because we have big guys . "
Exploiting a huge advantage in size and depth in the frontcourt , the Blue Devils opened a double - digit lead in the first half and Cal never seriously threatened to get back into the game .
Brian Zoubek , Duke 's light - scoring , 7 - foot - 1 center , had 14 points and 13 rebounds while teaming with Lance Thomas and reserves Miles and Mason Plumlee to dominate a short - handed Cal frontline featuring 6 - foot - 8 Duke transfer Jamal Boykin -- and little else .
Nolan Smith led the Blue Devils ( 31 - 5 ) with 20 points and spearheaded Duke 's trademark man - to - man defense that made it difficult for Cal 's high - scoring trio of Jerome Randle , Patrick Christopher and Theo Robertson to get uncontested shots .
London , England ( CNN ) --
A scientist in the United States has questioned the impact meat and diary production has on climate change , and accused the United Nations of exaggerating the link .
In 2006 , a report published by the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) titled " Livestock 's Long Shadow , " claimed meat production was responsible for 18 percent of greenhouse gas emissions , which it added was greater than the impact of transport .
Livestock farming already occupies 30 percent of the world 's surface and its environmental impact will double by 2050 unless drastic action is taken , the U.N. warned .
Environmentalists and leading campaigners including Paul McCartney , used the findings to urge consumers to eat less meat and save the planet .
Last year the former Beatle 's much hyped - campaign featured the slogan : " Less meat = less heat . "
But Frank Mitloehner , an air quality specialist from the University of California at Davis ( UCD ) , said the U.N. reached its conclusions for the livestock sector by adding up emissions from farm to table , including the gases produced by growing animal feed ; animals ' digestive emissions ; and processing meat and milk into foods .
But its figures for transport did not add up emissions from well to wheel ; instead , it considered only emissions from fossil fuels burned while driving .
" This lopsided ' analysis ' is a classical apples - and - oranges analogy that truly confused the issue , " Mitloehner said on the university 's Web site .
Mitloehner also pointed to the fact that leading authorities agree raising animals for food accounts for about 3 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. , while transportation creates an estimated 26 percent .
Trek to gauge carbon 's impact
He said campaigners such as McCartney were " well - intentioned , " but " not well - schooled in the complex relationships among human activities , animal digestion , food production and atmospheric chemistry . "
He added " smarter animal farming not less farming will equal less heat . "
One of the report 's authors , Pierre Gerber , told CNN he accepted the comparison with transport data was inaccurate .
" This was not done deliberately , " he said .
" But the comparability of the data does not challenge the estimate of 18 percent .
" It has been endorsed by the scientific community , the IPCC ( Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ) made reference to it , so this is not in doubt .
Comparing carbon emissions
" We thought it would be useful to compare the figures to another sector -- transport -- and I accept this comparison is now a little doubtful . "
He added that the FAO plans to publish a revised report on the impact of the livestock industry .
Meanwhile , Liz O'Neill of British Vegetarian Society -- an educational charity which counts Paul and Stella McCartney among its patrons , told CNN the meat industry remains a hugely significant contributor to climate change despite .
" It 's obviously convenient to have comparisons but 18 percent is still a really massive contribution , " she said .
Special : Environment
" But it 's not only about reducing emissions in this area .
We have to do it all .
The Vegetarian Society has always been careful never to say ' go vegetarian and then you can go on long - haul flights on your holiday . '
We say this is just one of things you can do to make a contribution . "
Duncan Pullar of the English Beef and Lamb Executive ( EBLEX ) , which promotes the beef and lamb industry in Britain , said the " credibility gaps " on both sides of the argument are making it difficult for consumers to understand the impact of food production .
" Talking about livestock production versus transport in a world context is meaningless , " he said .
I do n't understand what it offers us , " he told CNN .
" There are claims and counter - claims that do n't help to create a balanced view of how we should individually and collectively respond .
But he added there has been no drop - off in sales of meat across the industry , despite the vigorous media debate about sustainability in the food industry .
Last year , climate change skeptics claimed emails leaked from a leading UK research unit showed an attempt to falsify data to exaggerate the threat of global warming .
' Climategate ' explained
One e-mail allegedly sent by the head of the University of East Anglia 's Climatic Research Unit ( CRU ) , Professor Phil Jones , refers to using " Mike 's Nature trick of adding in the real temps to each series for the last 20 years ... to hide the decline . "
As one of the world 's leading research bodies on climate change , the CRU 's research was used in the IPCC 's Fourth Assessment Report released in 2007 , which is considered to be the most authoritative report on climate change to date .
History
In 1931 , Nebraska Lieutenant Governor Theodore W. Metcalf found himself to be Acting Governor for several weeks .
To please some of his friends , he appointed 20 to 25 " prominent Nebraskans " as Admirals ; hence , the Great Navy of the State of Nebraska was born .
While the practice of awarding commissions to the more or less " prominent " has persisted , a requirement for some meaningful act or service to the state or community has become more and more necessary to obtain an Admiral certificate .
A curious mystery is related to the Admirals , that of appointment of women as " Yeomanettes " in 1934 .
No information is known concerning them except that a few of the " appointments " have surfaced .
Perhaps they were the results of attempts to recognize the Admirals ' spouses , or women themselves for their own significant contributions .
It is believed that several hundred thousand Admirals have been appointed .
Many Nebraskans and visitors to our state have not heard of our navy ; they have not heard of the waves of prairie schooners that at one time plied our plains under which lies our real wealth --- Nebraska 's under - ground sea .

How can your company benefit by having a custom publication for employees ?
Imagine a world where you can exchange ideas with employees and peers without saying a word .
Imagine creating a new world within your office walls , a world with windows of opportunity and progress with every turn .
Welcome to the world of Custom Media and Inhouse Magazines .
Custom Media is n’t the same as conventional media .
I ’m sure several posts of mine can validate that .
Custom Media holds within itself the secret window of limitless opportunities , and in this post , I will help you unlock the world of potentials in your workspace , through the world of inhouse magazines and employees .
You may wonder if custom publishing is really one of the best solutions to keep employees happy , while increasing the utilisation rate and reducing the attrition rate .
And you may want to know what exactly a company inhouse magazine is all about , and why it should interest your organisation .
The truth is , it really can change the working environment in your office within a short period of time .
Inhouse magazines can help your organisation in many ways .
It can be a great marketing medium , a brand builder , or even a campaign tool to promote your company ’s ideas .
Using inhouse magazines , an organisation can enrich and strengthen bonds between employees , consumers and clients by a large extent .
Connections too , can be sustained and strengthened by a great deal .
There are several mediums of Custom Media to connect with employees .
But the most preferred and beneficial options are Print Magazines and Online Publications .
Most companies already provide company information to employees in the form of newsletters and official reports .
So how can a good looking inhouse magazine be any different ?
But that ’s where we hit the nail .
That very difference is the key to opening new avenues of Employee Relations .
While newsletters and reports provide details in a dry and factual manner , inhouse magazines weave a story around it .
And we know stories are always happier and more interesting than fact sheets and reports .
Ask yourself a question , what would interest a typical employee or consumer more ?
Sheets of reports or a magazine brimming with interesting ideas and colourful visuals weaved together in a neat corporate magazine ?
To help someone understand more about your company , you need to make an understandable connection between your company and the reader .
A company magazine does n’t really need to focus only on the figures of business , especially if it wants to reach out , connect and build a relationship with the employee .
It needs to be employee focussed , catering to the interests of the employee , while talking about the company goals , achievements and ideals at the same time .
It ’s like the days when we were little kids at school .
We ’d always hate the mean and haughty teacher , but adore the understanding one .
And with that adoration , came respect and fierce loyalty .
All of us need a friend who can help us understand the world around us .
At your workplace , you can create a mutual friend who can communicate your ideas and goals to the employees , while at the same time ensuring that you get to hear their issues at work too .
This friend is an inhouse magazine , in the print form , or as a web portal .
A good looking , professionally created publication that creates an unforgettable experience for your employees is definitely going to make a greater difference in the lives of employees than a few sheets with figures and colourless pages .
When you create a bond with your employees , you can create the same feeling of happiness and bonding that they would have with their own friends outside their workplace .
And by putting the message across in a clear and friendly approach , in a manner that connects with them , you can definitely bring about a positive change in your office environment .
As long as we can make an understandable connection between your organisation and your employees , you can use it to make them love what they do or completely hate it .
One factor that can build or shatter employee relationships , as we all know , is appreciation .
Every employee wants to see their share of the pie .
The designation does n’t matter here , it ’s how one is appreciated that matters .
At the end of the day , every single one of us want to know that we have made a difference , a difference that is noticed and appreciated by others .
And more than that , everyone who ’s put in a lot of effort into their work would want to know that they did a good job .
There is nothing that can bring more intense happiness and joy than being appreciated .
Everyone loves to get their 15 minutes of fame .
Every hard working employee wants to be credited and be a part of the limelight , even the shy ones that do n’t really want to stand under the spotlight without a little push onto centre stage !
All of us love the glory of appreciation .
Have you ever thought about how happy your employees would feel if they could be appreciated through a company magazine , with their pictures in it ?
Have you considered how special and motivated a particular team would feel if their achievements were featured in a glossy magazine ?
Imagine the little things that you could do for them with an inhouse magazine that would improve their work experience by a large extent .
Is there enough appreciation and happiness in your office ?
Striking a balance of friendship and office rules can be difficult , but with a custom publication , not only can you create a happier team that would enjoy their work , but you would also be able to improve the attrition rate and the employee utilisation rate of the company .
All you would need is a few months to see a difference in the employee behaviour , and less than a year to see the growth curve of loyalty and work happiness shoot the charts .
With custom publishing and inhouse magazines , you can involve the employees on a personal level , and make them feel like they ’re a part of something that ’s bigger than themselves , their cubicles or even their team .
With a custom magazine , you can make them come together and connect with everyone in the entire organisation .
You can make them love what they do every single day .
And most of all , with a custom magazine , you can make them feel appreciated all through the year !
One comparison you should always remember is that a company magazine is like driving a car .
You can drive around town in an old Maruti 800 or a classy new Audi A8 .
You ’re driving around town , alright , but tell me this , which car would make you swell with pride ?
Company magazines have the same effect on employees .
If your magazine is a good one , your employees would love talking about it , and would be ecstatic if they ’re featured in it .
But if it ’s just another magazine that ’s bordering on average or ( gasp ) mediocre , then your employees can’t help but cringe when they hold the magazine in their hands , and your company is bound to face the inevitable “ employee dissatisfaction ” moment .
If you want good results in the productivity curve , you should be considering and visualising an excellent in - house magazine or a website with exceptional editorial quality and photography to match the likes of internationally backed media houses .
Internal teams with little or no experience in the publishing industry wo n’t do you a bit of good .
And remember , when you have an internal team , you ’re going to make a few people who are the unqualified “ editorial board ” shuffle tasks with their existing job profiles .
At some point of time , the multitasking may overburden the editorial team , and then , boom !
Magazines , just like company turnovers , are only as good as the present one .
If your new magazine issue is a bad one , that ’s going to create a lot of negativity and bad gossip in the campus .
On the other hand , a great magazine will show a marked increase in the improvement of employee satisfaction , utilisation rate , work happiness and a lot , lot more .
So if you were to ask me if your company should have its own inhouse magazine , I ’d definitely recommend it hands down .
Starting a magazine is not an easy option though .
I ’m certain you ’re wondering if this is even worth a thought , or whether it ’s an affordable option .
You may even wonder if spending on employees issue after issue is a feasible option .
But with the returns that you would be able to see in just a matter of months , you ’d be wondering why you did n’t start an inhouse magazine years earlier !
Confetti Media has been working on several inhouse magazines over the years , and has even provided several additional benefits for its clients and their employees .
And that ’s not all , using strategic marketing associations with different partners , Confetti Media has also been able to create monetarily profitable magazines for their clients , wherein the companies do n’t have to pay for their inhouse magazines after a certain period of time , and Confetti Media would create a self - sustaining environment to let the magazine generate revenues and profits for the company by itself !
All these pointers barely even scrape the surface when it comes to planning and creating strategies for the production of an in - house magazine .
I ’ve got a huge bag of tricks that I can share with your company if you ’re interested in launching a company magazine .
But for starters , all you need to do is get in touch with me !
I ’m the kinda guy who loves partnering with companies , no matter where you are on the map .
So you want a magazine ?
Get in touch with me .
( CNN ) -- A Mississippi high school faces a lawsuit over its decision to cancel its prom rather than allow a lesbian high school student to attend with her girlfriend .
The lawsuit , filed by the American Civil Liberties Union , alleges that officials at Itawamba Agricultural High School in Fulton , Mississippi , are violating the student 's First Amendment right to freedom of expression .
The ACLU asked the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi to reinstate the prom .
" All I wanted was the same chance to enjoy my prom night like any other student .
But my school would rather hurt all the students than treat everyone fairly , " said the student , 18 - year - old Constance McMillen , in an ACLU news release .
" This is n't just about me and my rights anymore -- now I 'm fighting for the right of all the students at my school to have our prom . "
At the center of the lawsuit is a memorandum from the school to students , dated February 5 , which states that prom dates must be of the opposite sex .
Also , when McMillen expressed a desire to wear a tuxedo to the prom , the superintendent told her only male students were allowed to wear tuxes , according to court documents .
Superintendent Teresa McNeece also told McMillen that she and her girlfriend could be ejected from the prom if any of the other students complained about their presence there , according to the documents .
The prom was canceled after McMillen and the ACLU tried informally to get the school to change its stance .
Officials at the Itawamba County School District were not immediately available for comment Thursday .
In a statement released Wednesday , the county 's board of education said that , " Due to the distractions to the educational process caused by recent events , the Itawamba County School District has decided to not host a prom at Itawamba Agricultural High School this year . "
The school hoped that private citizens in the community would organize an event to replace the prom , the statement said .
The decision was made , the board of education said , " taking into consideration the education , safety and well - being of our students . "
" Itawamba school officials are trying to turn [ McMillen ] into the villain who called the whole thing off , and that just is n't what happened , " said Kristy Bennett , Legal Director of the ACLU of Mississippi .
She 's fighting for everyone to be able to enjoy the prom .
" The government , and that includes public schools , can't censor someone 's free expression just because some other person might not like it . "
Opposition groups in Iran used social networking sites to organise protests
The US treasury department has eased sanctions on Iran , Cuba and Sudan to help further the use of web services and support opposition groups .
US technology firms will now be allowed to export online services such as instant messaging and social networks .
Companies had not offered such services for fear of violating sanctions .
Opposition supporters in Iran used social networking sites and services to organise protests after the country 's disputed presidential poll last year .
The US Treasury said exports would be allowed of services related to web browsing , blogging , e-mail , instant messaging , chat , social networking and photo - and movie - sharing .
Low impact ?
The move was intended to " ensure that individuals in these countries can exercise their universal right to free speech and information to the greatest extent possible " , it said .
ANALYSIS Kim Ghattas
BBC News , Washington
Internet freedom is fast becoming a principle of US foreign policy .
In February , Hillary Clinton said that countries restricting this freedom were violating the Universal Declaration of Human Rights .
The Treasury Department said the move would make it easier for people in Iran , Sudan and Cuba to use the internet and exercise their most basic rights .
The technology will likely be bought by small technology businesses - if they are able to access it - and some of it could help circumvent government restrictions on the use of programmes like Twitter and even internet - based e-mail accounts .
Iran clamped down on the use of Gmail ahead of planned protests in Iran last month .
But while it tries to open up the flow of information for citizens in countries it deems repressive , the US is also pushing to tighten sanctions on Iran 's government because of its controversial nuclear programme .
Is internet access a human right ?
" As recent events in Iran have shown , personal internet - based communications like e-mail , instant messaging and social networking are powerful tools , " Deputy Treasury Secretary Neal Wolin said .
The department has allowed the export of services to all three countries , and the export of communications software only to Iran and Sudan , as the export of software to Cuba is governed by the commerce department .
Last year , software giant Microsoft barred users in five countries , including Iran , Cuba and Sudan , from using instant messaging services .
People trying to use the service received an error message .
It is not clear whether the governments affected will be able impose their own restrictions on these services .
In Cuba , the numbers of internet users is still very low , so lifting sanctions may not have a major impact , observers say .
Earlier this year , US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the US would be supporting the development of new tools to enable citizens to circumvent politically - motivated censorship .
Any country which restricted free access to information risked " walling themselves off from the progress of the next century " , she added .

Moscow , Russia ( CNN ) --
Russian investigators combing two subway stations attacked by female suicide bombers think Chechen rebels may have been behind the rush - hour strike that killed dozens of people .
" Our preliminary assessment is that this act of terror was committed by a terrorist group from the North Caucasus region , " Alexander Bortnikov of the Federal Security Service said of the investigation at one of the blast sites .
" We consider this the most likely scenario , based on investigations conducted at the site of the blast , " Bortnikov said .
" Fragments of the suicide bombers ' body found at the blast , according to preliminary findings , indicate that the bombers were from the North Caucasus region . "
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said the " terrorists " responsible for the Moscow subway attacks Monday " will be destroyed . "
" We are providing Moscow metro with additional CCTV cameras .
Today 's events show we should not only continue this work but to make it more effective .
Changes in legislation may be necessary . "
The two explosions that rocked the subway stations in central Moscow during rush hour killed at least 38 people and wounded more than 60 others , spawning widespread public outrage .
" It 's disgusting , " one witness said .
" I do n't know who did it and what they wanted .
Life is so short .
How could people commit such terrible acts ? "
Although they have yet to claim responsibility , Bortnikov 's statement is a strong implication that Chechen rebels fighting for independence were behind the strike .
How Chechen rebels threaten Russian stability
Thousands have been killed and 500,000 Chechens displaced in the Chechen rebels ' almost 20 - year conflict with Moscow .
The area is in the North Caucasus region of Russian between the Black and Caspian seas .
A timeline of Chechnya violence
The first blast occurred at 7:56 a.m. at Lubyanka subway station , the Ministry of Emergency Situations reported on its Web site .
The Lubyanka station is near the Kremlin and Federal Security Service headquarters .
The Federal Security Service is Russia 's intelligence agency .
Another blast happened about 40 minutes later at Park Kultury station , on the same train line .
Three Moscow hospitals were treating the wounded , the ministry said .
Are you there ?

Yulia Shapovalova of Russia Today TV was at the second station at the time of the blast .
" The staff members started urgently evacuating people , so that meant they probably knew about the first blast at the Lubyanka station , " she said .
" All the people -- a huge crowd of people -- slowly started to move .
...
As soon as I got upstairs , I heard the blast . "
i Reporter takes images of the scene
" It was a terrorist act carried out by the female suicide bombers , " Moscow Mayor Yury Luzhkov said of the first and most lethal explosion , citing the Federal Security Service .
" They were specifically timed -- for ... the train was nearing the station -- to make the most damage . "
Both stations reopened about 5 p.m. Moscow time , according to Veronica Molskaya from the Press Service of the Russian Emergencies Ministry .
In St. Petersburg , three metro stations were shut as the result of a bomb scare .
Millions of commuters use the Moscow metro system every day .
An estimated 500,000 people were riding trains throughout the capital at the time of the attacks .
It was unclear when the system would return to normal service , and the incident generated fear among commuters .
" I feel scared , " one woman said on TV .
" I have to walk to get to work , because there is no way I 'm going by Metro . "
The attacks reverberated around the globe .
U.S. President Obama condemned the " outrageous acts " and passed along his condolences .
" The American people stand united with the people of Russia in opposition to violent extremism and heinous terrorist attacks that demonstrate such disregard for human life , " Obama said .
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said she will offer her condolences to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Monday in Ottawa , Canada , where the Group of Eight foreign ministers are meeting to plan for the June G8 meeting in Canada .
" This brutal assault on innocent civilians is another reminder that terrorism is a threat to peace - loving people everywhere and must be met with unwavering resolve , " she said .
" Together with our G8 partners , we will discuss how to further strengthen international counter - terrorism coordination and cooperation . "
State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said Monday that there have been no reports of U.S. citizens killed in the Moscow attacks .
The federal Transportation Security Administration said there is " no specific or credible information indicating an imminent or current threat to U.S. transportation systems , " even though some local authorities have decided to beef up security measures in some cities .
New York Police Department Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne said police are stepping up security in the New York City subway system .
In Washington , Metro , the operator of the city 's transit system , said it is expanding security in light of the Moscow attacks .
Coincidentally , it had a terror drill this past weekend and is holding another one Monday .
Why no subway is safe from terror
Amtrak , the national passenger rail network , said there is " no specific threat " to its system , but its police assigned to the FBI 's National and Regional Joint Terrorism Task Force " remain informed regarding any potential threats and other security issues . "
In Atlanta , Georgia , MARTA 's police department has heightened security measures throughout the transit system .
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said he was " appalled " by the incident and sent condolences to Russian President Dmitry Medvedev , according to Britain 's Press Association .
U.N. Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon condemned the attack and said he " is confident that the Russian authorities will bring to justice the perpetrators of this heinous terrorist attack . "
Interpol , the international police agency , condemned the attacks and offered help to Russian authorities in the investigation .
Interpol 's executive director of police services , Jean - Michel Louboutin , called the actions " despicable and senseless attacks targeting the public . "
CNN 's Matthew Chance , Paul Courson and Eddie Demarche contributed to this report .

McLAREN'S INFLUENCE
Lizo Mzimba , Entertainment correspondent , BBC News Malcolm McLaren will be remembered as a figure who had a tremendous influence on British culture .
In terms of music , punk was one of the most important developments of modern times .
And without Malcolm McLaren , punk may never have exploded in the way that it did .
He was instrumental in selling the idea and image of punk to the public , especially through the Sex Pistols .
He helped to create the band 's unique look as well as their publicity - attracting attitude .
McLaren famously organised a boat trip down London 's River Thames so the Sex Pistols could perform their single God Save The Queen outside the Houses of Parliament , during the week that the Queen was celebrating her Silver Jubilee .
The boat was raided by the police , and McLaren was arrested .
The headlines that inevitably followed helped to fortify his and the band 's controversial reputation .
For many artists he embodied the idea they could successfully challenge the musical establishment .
It is an idea that inspired a generation of musicians , and still endures today .
" When we were young and I fell in love with Malcolm , I thought he was beautiful and I still do .
" I thought he is a very charismatic , special and talented person .
The thought of him dead is really something very sad . "
Former Sex Pistol John Lydon issued a tribute signed Johnny Rotten - the name he used in the band - which said : " Above all else [ Malcolm ] was an entertainer and I will miss him , and so should you . "
McLaren also managed a number of other bands , including the New York Dolls and Bow Wow Wow before producing his own records including the much - sampled track Double Dutch from the 1983 album Duck Rock .
McLaren emerged from art school in the 1960s and , with Westwood , set up Let It Rock - a fashion store specialising in rubber and leather fetish gear .
It was later , infamously , renamed " Sex " and he and Westwood defined punk fashion .
McLaren was involved in putting the Sex Pistols together in 1975 and under his management the band courted controversy .
After their debut single Anarchy in the UK was released in December 1976 , the band became a household name when they swore on Bill Grundy 's TV show .
Their concerts faced difficulties with promoters and authorities and they were fired by both EMI and A&M records .
In 1977 , their single God Save the Queen was banned by the BBC .
The band broke up at the end of a US tour in January 1978 and McLaren then created his disputed film version of the Sex Pistols ' story , the Great Rock ' n ' Roll Swindle .
But there was a falling out with the band members and he later lost a court case over royalties .
After retreating from the music scene , McLaren dabbled in politics and at one point toyed with the idea of entering the race to be mayor of London .
In 2007 , he pulled out of an appearance on the reality show I'm A Celebrity ...
Get Me Out of Here , after changing his mind about the show .
Between December last year and this January , the Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art in Gateshead hosted an exhibition by McLaren of " musical paintings " on the issue of sex .
Music journalist Jon Savage said : " Without Malcolm McLaren there would not have been any British punk .
What he did with fashion and music was extraordinary .
He was a revolutionary
Jon Savage
" He 's one of the rare individuals who had a huge impact on the cultural and social life of this nation . "
Mr Savage , who wrote a definitive history of the Sex Pistols and punk , England 's Dreaming , said McLaren was a " complex " and " contradictory " character who had influenced British culture in many ways .
" He could be very charming , he could be very cruel , but he mattered and he put something together that was extraordinary .
" What he did with fashion and music was extraordinary .
He was a revolutionary . "
Creation Records founder Alan McGee described his late friend as a " visionary " .
The BBC 's creative director Alan Yentob said he was saddened by the news but McLaren was " clearly suffering " during his last months .
They became friends after meeting in the 1980s .
He said McLaren was a " significant figure " in British music : " Without Malcolm , despite what people say , the punk era would never have been the kind of focus that it did become .
" Malcolm loved the idea of it and it was he , who , in a way , sold the idea to the public and understood what it meant . "
He said : " Malcolm was a man of ideas really - he was fascinated by ideas .
He was always thinking about the next one .
He was always ready to say something provocative .
" I think he famously said that his grandmother told him you needed to be a bad boy to survive - it was good to be bad .
He wanted to shock and surprise you . "
Sylvain Sylvain , founder member of New York Dolls , said McLaren " really was a piece of sugar " who would be remembered as a " cool guy " .

The 24 Hours of Adrenalin Solo World Championship is often a grueling showcase for the world ’s toughest bikes and riders , but the July event in Canmore , Canada , was something special .
Greg Martin , a 37 - year - old firefighter from Ketchum , Idaho , won the single - speed division ( and came in fifth overall ) on a bike that did n’t have a chain .
It used a smooth , silent , carbon - polyurethane belt — similar to that of auto transmission and timing belts — to prove that belt - drive , a new technology unknown to most bikers , is ready for prime time .
With dedicated chain rings required to match the studded belt , this Carbon Drive system from Gates , a leading motor - vehicle belt supplier , is n’t cheap — and it ca n’t be used with derailleurs .
But the system offers a number of benefits over the 150 - year - old chain .
It ’s lighter ; does n’t use grease ; requires no maintenance ; wo n’t break , stretch , rust or fall off ; and , best of all , it offers a pronounced improvement in “ engagement ” — the millisecond it takes for the bike to react to your pedaling forces .
Each of the four review bikes below ( reflecting categories that are best suited to belt - drive ) delivered an instant reaction that my cycling buddies and I found rather exhilarating .

Single - speed champ
Spot SS 29er : Steel - frame , front - suspension , single - speed , Carbon Drive replica of Greg Martin ’s world championship bike .
Features oversized 29er wheels , disc brakes and a Maverick SC32 inverted fork with 4.75 inches of travel .
Likes : I felt supercharged .
With its large wheels , the SS is spectacularly fast compared with a normal 26 - inch - wheel mountain bike .
And being a single speed , it ’s a time machine , taking you back to childhood , to a simpler , purer , more fun form of riding .
With no gears to shift , you climb by standing out of the saddle , rocking the bike side to side , pushing the pedals with arms , back , glutes — not just your quads .
With my whole body sharing the work , I finished a solid 2 1/2 - hour climb in the Santa Anas uncharacteristically fresh and ready to do it again .
The technology plays a big role here ; with the belt ’s lack of a time lag and the fork ’s unique vertical engagement with the massive , proprietary 7/8 - inch diameter front hub , the bike jumps when you say so .
The exotic inverted fork also stays naturally lubed and dirt - free better than conventional forks .
The steel frame is light , durable and will hold its lively ride feel for decades .
Finally , Spot ’s unique “ slider ” rear dropout makes wheel removal and proper belt positioning easy and simple .
Weighs 22 pounds .

Dislikes : None — except the price .

Caffeinated commuter
Trek Soho :
The first Carbon Drive bike , introduced in 2009 , is a stylish , aluminum - framed commuter - coffee road bike with Shimano ’s eight - speed internal - geared hub , puncture - resistant tires , fenders and a fancy insulated aluminum latte thermos .
Advertisement
Likes : A blast .
Fast , aggressive , nimble handling and great out - of - the - saddle hill - climbing for fitness and commuting .
That ’s due to the lean - forward , mountain - bike positioning , 700C road wheels , and an eight - speed drivetrain with a potent 55 - tooth sprocket .
Cool styling , including a muscular top tube festooned with racy rubber panels .
32 pounds .
Dislikes :
No commuter rack included ( although it has front and rear rack eyelets ) .
Mushy drum brakes ( instead of better disks ) do n’t cut it for potential high speeds and hills .
No kickstand , so you might unintentionally dent your fender while pit-stopping at Starbucks .
A lack of quick - release hubs hinders easy transport and quick flat - fixing .
Price : $ 1,149 . ( 800 ) 313-8735 ; https://www.trekbikes.com.
Touring dream machine
Advertisement
Co-Motion Americano Rohloff : Deluxe , steel - framed long - distance touring bike with disc brakes and the acclaimed German - made Rohloff Speedhub 14 - speed internally geared hub .
Likes : A bike tourist ’s dream .
Possibly the world ’s most durable , trouble - free tour bike , an invaluable asset on mega - mile round - the - world journeys through off - the - beaten - paths hot spots such as Botswana , Kazakhstan and northern Nevada .
The belt drive and Rohloff rear hub eliminate the need for finicky derailleurs and provide an acceptable range for flatland flying and steep hill climbing .
Classic looks with a matching Brooks leather seat and handlebar .
The durability is worth the tradeoff of the extra - heavy hub , and it is n’t that big a deal on loaded touring , anyway .
27.4 pounds .
Dislikes : Cumbersome shifting .
The Rohloff ’s twist shifter requires excessive torque , lacks visible gear numbers ( so you ca n’t tell what gear you ’re in ) and is located inconveniently , making you move your right hand 6 inches from the brake hoods or the top of the bars to the end of the drop .
Bottom line :
You momentarily control the bar with only one hand and ca n’t make shifts while standing .
I did get used to it after a couple of hours , and as an old world tourer love the bike nonetheless , but Rohloff should make a more road - bike friendly version .
For now , putting this shifter on flat bars would be safer and more natural .
Price : $ 5,446 ( $ 5,146 with standard chain ) .

Specialized Globe Live 03 : Deluxe eight - speed , aluminum - frame “ shopping bike ” with a large front rack , wraparound handlebars , disc brakes , bell , kickstand and fenders from Specialized ’s new Globe division .
A step - through frame is also available .
Likes : Rides great , with a super - comfortable , upright - back riding position — perfect for casual riders out for neighborhood errands and fun , functional fitness with friends .
Solid , dual - legged kickstand perfect for parking at Starbucks and loading up to two bags of groceries in the wide , wood - bottomed rack .
A limiter spring helps keep your handlebars under control while steering .

Dislikes :
No hard - core hammering ; the 46 - tooth sprocket makes it a good hill climber ( and good at carrying heavy loads ) but limits top - end speed .
Quite expensive for a casual bike .
Also , the large open gaps and shallowness of the rack diminish its functionality ; small items can easily fall out , and tall items can tip over ; serious bungee - cording is required for all cargo big and small .

A group of senior public figures have called on the government to abandon its plan to push through controversial digital economy bill before the election , amid claims that the move could " sidestep " the democratic process .
Earlier this week the government revealed that it wants to force the digital economy bill - which includes the controversial " three strikes " rule to cut off the internet connections of those accused of illegal file sharing - into the statute books in the next few weeks .
While it usually takes far longer to create an act of parliament , thanks to the public debates held by MPs , the secretary of state for business , Lord Mandelson , plans speed up the process by making use of a controversial parliamentary technique known as the " wash - up " .
Under those rules , party whips bypass the usual debating process and make a series of horse trades in order to get proposals into law before parliament dissolves ahead of a general election .
That proposal has already caused concern , but today a coalition including a cross-party group of MPs and peers - as well as figures from the business world and entertainment industry - said that short circuiting the democratic process could have disastrous side effects .
In an open letter the group suggests that the controversial nature of the legislation - which it says " threatens to severely infringe fundamental human rights " and could introduce " website blocking " measure that impede free speech - must face the full scrutiny of parliament before it becomes law .
Among the signatories are musician Billy Bragg , human rights activist Peter Tatchell and writer Graham Linehan , who helped create comedy series including Father Ted and The IT Crowd .
They are joined by a number of activists and campaigners , as well as politicians drawn from Labour , the Liberal Democrats and the Green Party .
" Our worry today is that none of this will be properly debated by parliament , " says the letter .
" Last week Harriet Harman failed to give the Commons any reassurances that this important , complex and controversial bill will be properly scrutinised by our elected MPs . "
" Democracy and accountability will be sidestepped if this bill is rushed through and amended without debate during the so - called ' wash - up ' process .
The thousands of people we know to be contacting their MPs with concerns will find their faith in politicians even further undermined . "
The plans , which first became public last autumn , have caused controversy at almost every turn .
As well as the three strikes rule and measures to take down websites accused of infringing copyright - which could potentially result in the closure of major web destinations such as YouTube - Lord Mandelson has also sought the power to alter copyright law without the assent of parliament .
In addition , it has also been suggested that the bill 's measures to prosecute the owners of internet connections used for illegal file sharing could hit anybody who provides web access - such as universities , libraries and cafes , as well as those individuals who leave their home Wi -Fi connections open .
While the made it through three readings in the House of Lords , it was not without serious objections .
Lord Puttnam , the film producer , said he had faced " an extraordinary degree of lobbying " over the proposals , while others questioned the revelation that an amendment used language British music industry body the BPI .
Earlier this week BPI chief Geoff Taylor said that it was imperative that the legislation is passed before the election .
" It is vital for the future of the UK 's creative sector that the digital economy bill becomes law before the dissolution of parliament , " he said .
However , the open letter suggests that the bill 's most controversial elements must receive proper debate or be removed from the bill entirely and left until after the forthcoming election .
" The particular problem with this type of footwear is it is unsupported .
It 's a slipper .
You would n't normally expect to be doing outdoor activities from something that 's indoor .
If it 's raining outside you do n't wear your pyjamas .
If you decide to wear your pyjamas outside all the time , someone will come up and say it 's not a good idea . "
Mobile that allows bosses to snoop on staff developed
By Michael Fitzpatrick , Tokyo
KDDI is one of Japan 's largest phone companies Researchers have produced a mobile phone that could be a boon for prying bosses wanting to keep tabs on the movements of their staff .
Japanese phone giant KDDI Corporation has developed technology that tracks even the tiniest movement of the user and beams the information back to HQ .
It works by analysing the movement of accelerometers , found in many handsets .
Activities such as walking , climbing stairs or even cleaning can be identified , the researchers say .
The company plans to sell the service to clients such as managers , foremen and employment agencies .
" Technically , I think this is an incredibly important innovation , " says Philip Sugai , director of the mobile consumer lab at the International University of Japan .
" For example , when applied to the issue of telemedicine , or other situations in which remotely monitoring or accessing an individual 's personal movements is vital to that service .
" But there will surely be negative consequences when applied to employee tracking or salesforce optimisation . "
Complex behaviour Until now , mobile phone motion sensors were capable of detecting only repetitive movements such as walking or running .
It beggars belief that a prominent company such as KDDI could come up with such a surveillance system .
It 's totally irresponsible
Kazuo Hizumi
Human rights lawyer
The KDDI system , is able to detect more complex behaviour by using analytical software - held on a server back at base - to match patterns of common movements .
For example , the KDDI mobile phone strapped to a cleaning worker 's waist can tell the difference between actions performed such as scrubbing , sweeping , walking an even emptying a rubbish bin .
The aim of the new system , according to KDDI , is to enable employees to work more efficiently and managers to easily evaluate their employees ' performance while away from the office .
" It 's part of our research into a total ubiquitous technology society , and activity recognition is an important part of that , " said Hiroyuki Yokoyama , head of web data research at KKDI 's research labs in Tokyo .
" Because this technology will make central monitoring possible with workers at several different locations , businesses especially are very interested in using such technology to improve the efficiency of their workers .
" We are now at a stage where we can offer managers a chance to analyse more closely the behaviour of staff . "
KDDI says it is in talks with a Japanese employment agency that specialises in contract cleaners and security and is interested in deploying the new technology .
' Mothering system '
" Of course there are privacy issues and any employers should really enter into an agreement with employees before using such a system , " Mr Yokoyama told BBC News .
The system can differentiate between many different activities " But this is not about curtailing employees ' rights to privacy .
We 'd rather like to think our creation more of a caring , mothering system rather than a Big Brother approach to watching over citizens . "
It is not the first time remote spying technology has been enlisted by employers to keep an eye on their workforce in Japan or elsewhere .
Lorry drivers are regularly monitored through mobile phones in Japan , while salespeople have been regularly tracked by their employers using GPS since it was introduced to Japanese mobiles in 2002 .
Critics of such systems accuse the makers of pandering to an over - controlling , Big Brother - type managerial class and say that with this new technology there comes the increased opportunity for abuse .
' Poor record ' " This is treating people like machines , like so many cattle to be monitored and watched over , " Kazuo Hizumi , a leading human rights lawyer , told BBC News .
" New technology should be used to improve our lives not to spy on us .
" It beggars belief that a prominent company such as KDDI could come up with such a surveillance system .
It 's totally irresponsible . "
Japan had a very poor record on human rights , privacy issues and consumer rights , said Mr Hizumi .
For this reason , he said , invasive technologies were readily accepted as there was little debate on their possible impact to be found in the media in Japan or among its people .
" I 'm afraid ordinary citizens do n't care about this lack of rights .
Consequently because of technology like this , Japan is heading for the Dark Ages , " said Mr Hizumi .

In his Sunday New York Times column , Frank Rich tries to belittle and defames Congressman Ron Paul , because Dr. Paul wants to shrink the size and scope of the federal government .
By lumping the former 2008 GOP presidential candidate with the pro-war 2008 GOP vice presidential nominee , Sarah Palin , and militaristic talking head Glenn Beck , who delivered a sharp rebuke of the GOP in his CPAC speech more than a week ago , Rich reveals his true colors : an unapologetic supporter of the welfare - warfare state .
Ron Paul should not be linked to either of these big government conservatives , nor to extremists like Joe Stack , who recently flew a plane into an office building housing the I.R.S. in Austin , Texas , or Timothy McVeigh who bombed a government office building in Oklahoma City in 1995 .
Frank Rich tires to paint Ron Paul and his supporters as violent , “ obsessed and deranged , ” and therefore a lunatic fringe that should be ignored as critics of the federal government ’s policies , which Rich apparently supports , mass killing overseas , and legal plunder and currency debasement at home .
Instead , Frank Rich implies that any criticism of the welfare - warfare state is due to a psychological disorder and therefore “ these ’ people are really “ enemies of the state ” and should be monitored very carefully .
Ron Paul has been one of America ’s articulate advocates of a constitutional republic in the United State Congress .
Dr. Paul supports abolishing the Federal Reserve and ending the income tax .
He also favors replacing the entitlement programs with and charities , and creating real , sustainable prosperity built on a foundation of savings and investments .
Dr. Paul also opposes premptive war and military adventurism overseas , a policy that fans the flames of hatred for America .
In short , Dr. Paul is America ’s most outspoken critic of the Empire that is responsible for tens of thousands of innocent deaths overseas and the financial bleeding of our economy .
Frank Rich approvingly cites the dismissive attitude of neoconservatives William Kristol and William Bennett toward Ron Paul and his presidential straw poll win at the CPAC conference .
If Mitt Romney had won , their tune would have been a lot different : Romney is the 2012 GOP presidential front runner .
Frank Rich ’s “ intellectual ” soul mates , Kristol and Bennett , join him in battling Ron Paul and the liberty movement for the soul of America .
The clock is is ticking on the welfare - warfare state , frightening the likes of Frank Rich and other apologists in the media .
So instead of debating the merits of the welfare - warfare state , Rich and his ilk engage in unrelenting character assassination of a decent and patriotic American , congressman Ron Paul of Texas .
There is apparently no insult that Frank Rich and the neoconservatives pals will not use to undermine the reestablishment of a limited government republic in America .
They would prefer to genuflect before the altar of power and gain fame and fortune from the welfare - warfare state apparatus than have the American people live in a free society .
The private lending companies that earn billions of dollars in undeserved profits from the federal student loan program are working overtime to kill a bill that would stop their gravy train once and for all  and should have been enacted long ago .
The House stood up to the powerful lending lobby last fall and passed a student loan reform bill .
The White House has been pushing the Senate , but it is having trouble finding its spine and has yet to introduce a bill .
The House version phases out the wasteful part of the federal college lending program that pays private lenders a rich subsidy to make risk - free loans that are guaranteed by the government .
The bill also expands another , more reliable and less expensive federal loan program that permits students to borrow directly from the government through their colleges .
The arguments for moving in this direction are irrefutable .
The subsidized program , for example , was supposed to keep loans flowing during recessions .
But the loans dried up in the last credit crunch , forcing the government to rescue the program .
The direct program , by contrast , suffered no such disruption .
In addition to being more reliable , the direct program costs less .
The Congressional Budget Office estimated last year that the country could save about $ 80 billion over the next decade by ending the private system and moving to the direct one .
Outmaneuvered on the merits , the lending industry has resorted to scare tactics and distortions .
The claim that the direct system would amount to a government takeover of the system is absurd .
The direct loans would not be handled by the government , but through colleges and universities , just as Pell grants are now .
The loans would be collected and administered by private companies , which are actively competing for the business .

If you think a non-regression fix should go into the branch , please ask Stefan or myself , or discuss on emacs - devel .
Some of the changes in NEWS have yet to be documentated ; if you have some time , help in this area would be much appreciated .
As for the trunk , new features intended for Emacs 24 ( and bugfixes not safe for Emacs 23.2 ) can now be checked in .
However , if the change is major ( or if you have commit access but are not a regular contributor ) please inform emacs - devel first .

This is also a good point for people to chime in on their plans for Emacs 24 .
Stefan and I have had some discussions about this ; here is our current list of major changes that we'd like to see included : * The package manager ( Tromey et al. ) .
* Bidi support ( Eli ) .
* Better VC interaction DVCSs ( Dan , etc ? ) .
As an exception , we plan to backport VC improvements to Emacs 23.3 .
* Color - theme , or something like it .
( Maybe using Custom Themes ? ) .
* Concurrency ?
( Scrivano et al. )
( Even if we can't get this ready in time , it would be good to make this an " experimental " compile - time option . )
* Lexbind ? ( Miles ) .
( Miles , how realistic is it to include this ? )
* TTZ 's experiment with SVG progress bar , abstracted into a general Emacs library for embedded graphics .
If we can do this , I would also like to seriously consider switching to SVG as the default image library , replacing our use of xpm ( e.g. , the inline xpm images that we use for certain buffer widgets should be turned into SVG ) .
* GTK widget embedding code ?
( Joakim ) .
( Joakim , how realistic is it to include this ? )
The preceding SVG widget feature might make this less necessary ; I 'm not sure .
Other stuff we'd like to see happen , if possible , are : * Increased usage of the Semantic library by other parts of Emacs .
* Improving the Customize user interface ( I have some working in this area that I 'm going to commit soon ) .
Peaceful protests by one or two people take place over the past week , ending in the protesters ’ arrest .
Most of them are monks but some are lay people .
They all want Tibet ’s independence and the return of the Dalai Lama .
Police set up roadblocks on roads connecting monasteries and villages .
Lhasa ( AsiaNews ) – Chinese police arrested at least eight Tibetan Buddhist monks over the past week , including six teenagers for taking part in protests in a number of places where they called for the return of the Dalai Lama , Tibet ’s independence and complete religious freedom , the Tibetan Centre for Human rights and Democracy ( TCHRD ) reported .
On 30 March , two students from the famous Larung Gar Monastery , in Sêrtar County ( also spelled Sertha , Seda in Chinese ) , were arrested for raising the Tibetan flag in the market square of the county seat .
The flag itself has been banned since Maoist forces took over the region in 1949 .
The two boys , 16 - year - old Tenzin Gyamtso and 15 - year - old Wangchen Topgyal , shouted “ Independence for Tibet ” and “ Human Rights for Tibet ” .
Arrested by police , their fate and whereabouts remain unknown .
The TCHRD reported that the next day , two other monks from the same county and residents of the same monastery were arrested for a similar protest .
Their fate , whereabouts but also their identities remain unknown .
On 2 April , Ugyen Namgyal , 20 , from Choktsang village , demonstrated alone in the market square of Sêrtar seat .
Before taking him away , police beat him up .
The following day , an unidentified man from Ugyen village was also arrested but he was not a monk .
A 19 - year - old reincarnated lama , Tulku Namgyal of Taglung Monastery in Choktsang village , was arrested on 4 April in the same place for handing out handwritten flyers calling for Tibetan independence and the return of the Dalai Lama .
On 5 April , 20 - year - old Thakchoe was arrested for raising the banned Tibetan flag .
Local sources said that similar protests have taken place over the past two days , but almost nothing has filtered through , sign of Beijing ’s enhanced censorship .
What is known is that more restrictions have been placed on local Tibetan monks and nuns .
In addition , Chinese security forces have set up roadblocks , manned by plain - clothes police officers , along the 22 - kilometre road that separates the Larung Gar Monastery from the Sêrtar County seat .
The TCHRD has called on the Chinese government to release immediately those who were recently arrested , whose only crime is to have demonstrated peacefully for their human rights .
SPECIAL CONNECTION : Nicole Whaititi , 10 , who is part - Moriori , looks at fading Moriori dendroglyphs carved on a tree in the Chatham Islands .
Erosion is wiping away ancient tree carvings on the Chatham Islands , but 3D laser technology is being used to record the spiritual images .
The technique , being used for the first time in New Zealand , is digitally reproducing the images with more detail than can be seen with the naked eye .
Conservation Department technical support officer Richard Nester said the carvings – of people and their environment – could be as old as 300 years , but were on trees unlikely to survive much longer because of disease and wind erosion .
The carvings were done by the Chatham Islands Moriori people , who lived on the islands before the arrival of Maori , and Europeans in 1835 .
They are on karaka trees , known as kopi by the Moriori , and most of the carvings are on trees contained within the DOC national historic reserve , Hapupu .
Years of farming had cleared the land around the kopi forest , and Mr Nester said the strong winds that buffeted the Chathams meant the trees had little protection from the elements .
The 33 - hectare reserve was fenced in 1980 to protect the forest from grazing cattle , but the trees were still exposed to the elements and also at risk from a native beetle which fed on the trees .

Trust is working to revive the Moriori culture , and chairwoman Shirley King said learning that the images had been captured forever was an emotional moment .
On the island , the trust is working to pass down the ancient art of carving , but few people have had the skills passed down to them from their ancestors .
Comparing the carvings with their digital counterparts was like comparing two different images , Ms King said , because the laser scanner used in the project was able to pick up greater detail than it was possible to see on the eroding trees .
As the trees would not survive for much longer , the project had come at a crucial time .
" These are living entities and they are dying , " she said .
Trust member Mana Cracknell said the trees were like " corpses " , but the carvings were spiritually important to a culture which needed to be preserved .
Mr Nester said a team of seven surveyors and archaeologists from Otago University joined DOC for a month on the islands for the project , Ninety - eight carvings from 93 trees were scanned .
Using a hand - held laser scanner , they were able to capture the images at a resolution of 0.5 mm .
Using a laser scanner meant the carvings could be recorded by a non-invasive method which did not put them at further risk .
It is estimated that kopi trees are being lost from the forest at a rate of 20 a year , and at that rate they will all be gone by 2015 .
Chatham Islander and part - Moriori Nicole Whaititi , 10 , said the carvings were called dendroglyphs , and a special aspect of the Moriori culture she identified with .

Washington ( CNN ) --
Health care reform advocates inched closer to victory Wednesday as a high - profile liberal Democrat switched his position and announced his intention to vote for a sweeping $ 875 billion plan under consideration in the House of Representatives .
Rep. Dennis Kucinich , D - Ohio , said he believes " health care is a civil right . "
He had previously characterized the bill , which cleared the Senate in December , as little more than a boondoggle for private insurers .
Kucinich was publicly lobbied for his vote by President Barack Obama during the president 's visit this week to Kucinich 's congressional district in Ohio .
He told reporters he 's had four meetings with Obama to discuss the bill .
" The president 's visit to my district ... underscored the urgency of this vote , " Kucinich said .
" I have doubts about the bill ... [ but ]
I 've decided to cast a vote in favor of the legislation . "
He said he ultimately had " to make a decision on the bill as it is , not on the bill as I 'd like to see it . "
Kucinich is a backer of a single - payer health care system under which the government would fund all costs billed by doctors and hospitals .
Kucinich 's decision to change his vote is " a good sign , " Obama told reporters in the Oval Office .
" I told him thank you . "
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D - California , said she thought Kucinich 's switch would make a difference with a large number of liberal activists .
" He 's been a supporter of health care for all Americans for a long time , " she said .
" He has a constituency , and many of those people still do n't understand why there is n't a public [ option ] . "
Pelosi has repeatedly expressed confidence that she will have enough support to pass the bill when it comes to the floor for a final vote .
Read more about how votes are lining up
Maryland Rep. Steny Hoyer , the No. 2 House Democrat , indicated Wednesday the vote could come at some point this weekend .
He said the leadership is still waiting for final cost estimates from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office on a package of changes to the measure .
Asked if the release of the CBO numbers was imminent , Pelosi said , " I would have said ... half an hour ago , hopefully any minute .
I think it 's going to take a little more time . "
She said she had no explanation for the delay .
" I do n't know the calculation , " she said .
" I do n't know how they do it .
Whatever it is , they 're the gospel and we have to live by it . "
Later , Pelosi spokesman Nadeam Elshami said that the CBO estimates would not be released Wednesday night .
Since the Democrats have said the bill will be available for reading for 72 hours before a vote , the vote can take place no sooner than Sunday , provided the CBO numbers are posted Thursday .
Pelosi needs 216 votes from her 253 - member caucus to pass the Senate bill .
No Republicans are expected to back it .
A number of House Democrats have refused to state their voting intentions publicly .
Twenty - seven House Democrats , however , have indicated they will join Republicans in opposing the Senate plan .
That puts opponents of reform 11 votes shy of the 216 needed to prevent Obama from scoring a major victory on his top domestic priority .
Meanwhile , GOP leaders continued to pound away at the legislation on Wednesday , slamming House Democratic leaders for considering the use of a controversial legislative maneuver to pass the Senate bill .
Pelosi may try to help House Democrats unhappy with the Senate bill by allowing them to avoid a direct vote on the measure .
She is considering pushing for a vote on a rule that would simply " deem " the Senate bill to be passed .
The House then would proceed to a separate vote on the more popular package of changes to the Senate plan .
" I 've never seen anything like the plan that House Democrats hatched this week to jam their health care bill through Congress , " Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , R- Kentucky , said Wednesday .
" Historians will remember this as a new low in this debate , the week that America was introduced to the ' scheme and deem ' approach to legislating .
They 'll remember this as the week that Congress tried to pull the wool over the eyes of the public in order to get around their will . "
House Minority Leader John Boehner , R - Ohio , said Tuesday that Republicans will try to block the procedure .
They will try to force a vote on a resolution requiring the Senate health care bill to be brought to an up - or - down vote .
Boehner has called the maneuver -- also known as a " self - executing rule " -- the " ultimate in Washington power grabs . "
House Republicans sent a letter to the Democratic head of the House Rules Committee on Wednesday asking her to move an upcoming hearing on the health care bill to a larger room to account for overwhelming public interest in the issue .
The committee is responsible for deciding whether the full House will have a chance to pass the Senate bill using the self - executing rule .
" While C - SPAN may decide to cover the hearing , that does not satisfy the need for the maximum amount of transparency and openness needed to give the American people faith in this process , " the letter said .
" By moving the hearing to a larger room , we can ensure more Americans will have the opportunity to participate in our proceedings and not be turned away at the door . "
Where does health care reform stand ?
If enacted , the Democratic reform proposal would constitute the biggest expansion of federal health care guarantees since the enactment of Medicare and Medicaid more than four decades ago .
The plan is expected to extend insurance coverage to more than 30 million Americans .
The Senate bill also would reduce federal deficits by about $ 118 billion over 10 years , according to CBO estimates .
Top Republicans contend the plan amounts to an ill - conceived government takeover of the country 's health care system .
They have said it would do little to slow spiraling medical costs .
They also argue it would lead to higher premiums and taxes for middle - class families while resulting in deep Medicare cuts .
Public opinion polls indicate a majority of Americans have turned against the administration 's health care reform plan , though individual elements of the proposal remain widely popular .
CNN's Dan Lothian , Charles Riley , Alan Silverleib , Jeff Simon , Deirdre Walsh and Robert Yoon contributed to this report .
Rod Liddle 's Spectator blog first to be censured by PCC
The PCC said the Spectator had not been able to back up Mr Liddle 's claim Spectator columnist Rod Liddle has become the first blogger to be censured by the Press Complaints Commission .
On the Spectator 's website , Mr Liddle wrote that the " overwhelming majority " of London 's violent crime was carried out by young , African - Caribbean men .
But the PCC ruled the former BBC Radio 4 Today editor 's words breached Clause 1 ( Accuracy ) of its code .
It said the " significant ruling " showed publications ' websites would be held to the same standards as print editions .
A reader had complained after the article was published in December 2009 .
Mr Liddle had written that " the overwhelming majority of street crime , knife crime , gun crime , robbery and crimes of sexual violence in London is carried out by young men from the African - Caribbean community " .
There is plenty of room for robust opinions , views and commentary , but statements of fact must still be substantiated
Stephen Abell
Director , Press Complaints Commission
Send us your comments PCC director Stephen Abell said the Spectator had provided some evidence to back up Mr Liddle 's assertion .
But he added " it had not been able to demonstrate that the ' overwhelming majority ' of crime in all the stated categories had been carried out by members of the African - Caribbean community " .
Mr Abell said the ruling was significant because it demonstrated that " the PCC expects the same standards in newspaper and magazine blogs that it would expect in comment pieces that appear in print editions " .
" There is plenty of room for robust opinions , views and commentary , but statements of fact must still be substantiated if and when they are disputed , " he said .
" And if substantiation is n't possible , there should be proper correction by the newspaper or magazine in question . "
Mr Abell said that although several readers had taken issue with Mr Liddle 's claim in the comments section of the blog , the PCC did not agree that " the magazine could rely on publishing critical reaction as a way of abrogating its responsibilities under the code " .
Following the ruling , Mr Liddle said the PCC had " got it wrong " .
He said : " It seems to suggest that had I not used the word overwhelming , they would n't have come down against me .
" I 'll confess and maybe I should n't have used the word ' overwhelming ' in all the cases I quoted .
" But a blog is different because it has to be a conversation , otherwise there 's no point in having a blog . "

Review the LCS Annual Members ’ Meeting 2019
The LCS Annual Members ’ Meeting was held on Saturday , 19 October 2019 .
If you are a member of the LCS , you can read through the meeting comments and discussions on the LCS Slack channel .
Mahasen Saber spent more than three years in the Egyptian court system trying to divorce her husband .
In the lonely and often confusing process , she met many women in similar circumstances who relied on each other for moral support .
But their battles did n’t end in court – what followed were stares and whispers .
Four months ago , Ms. Saber started “ Divorce Radio , ” an Internet - based station that seeks to reverse popular conceptions of divorced women and create a supportive community .
Her initiative is part of a broader push in Egypt ’s conservative Muslim society to challenge social stigma attached to divorced women .
“ Here in Egyptian society , the woman is looked upon at as if she is the one who made a big mistake getting a divorce from her husband .
She ’s always at fault , ” says
Saber , whose station is an extension of her popular blog , which has made her something of an icon in Egyptian media .
“ I want Arab society to respect women who are divorced . ”
Variety of programs , including one by a man
The station runs a variety of programming , including “ You Understand Us Wrong , ” about the value of divorced women in society , and “ Your Son : How You Raise Him , ” in which a doctor discusses rearing children of divorced parents .
There is also a show led by a divorced man about his experiences .
But not all programs focus on life after divorce ; “ Before You Say ‘ I Want a Divorce ’ ” discourages divorce as a solution to marital problems .
“ I want to say to [ listeners ] , not every problem with your husband should lead to divorce … .
There are problems we can deal with and there are problems we cannot deal with , ” says Saber .
In Islam , divorce , although permitted , is frowned upon .
But divorce statistics in Egypt are the highest in the Arab world : 40 percent of marriages end in divorce .
“ The divorce issue is now in every house in our society , every family has a divorced woman – a daughter , a mother , a sister , ” says Saber .
Flower vendor : Breaking up families is a ' big problem '
A relatively new law that has made it easier for women to divorce has contributed to surging divorce rates .
Under the law , passed in 2000 , women can ask for a divorce without explicitly stating the reason .
This option , known as khula , offers women previously unavailable privacy , but in exchange , they give up any legal rights to property and their dowry .
Men are n’t happy about it .
“ It ’s an issue of masculinity , ” says Mehab Abolkonfan , chairwoman of the Egyptian Center for Women ’s Rights .
“ In Eastern society , men should be [ in demand ] , not rejected ... [ In khula , a woman ] does n’t have to say ‘ he beats me ’ or does any bad things , but instead says , ‘ I reject this man and I will forgo any kind of financial commitment to leave this man . ”
Yasser Shehad , a married flower vendor in downtown Cairo , is saddened by the law ’s impact on Egyptian society .
“ This [ law ] increases the rates of divorce and allows women to do whatever they want , ” says Mr. Shehad .
“ Marriage is love and happiness and a family unit .
Breaking up the families – that ’s a big problem .
What else is bigger than breaking up the family ? ”
A video of Thom Yorke at the Copenhagen climate talks is making its way ' round the web .
We already pointed you to Eugene Mirman 's silly coverage ; have a go with Mr. Radiohead for a more concerned look .
There is an ancient Greek Myth that recounts the existence of two terrible sea monsters .
The ancient stories tell a tale which describes the narrow straight in which these two monsters dwelt .
One was possessed of a great maw through which it would take great gulps of water , sucking in anything and everything nearby three times a day .
The other monster , who lived just across the straight and was also anchored in place possessed great heads that would quickly snatch at and kill any sailor who wandered within range .
Sound familiar ?
They should !
Scylla and Charybdis have become two of the great myths of Greco - Roman Mythology .
They were made famous by Homer in the Odyssey , mentioned in Jason and the Argonauts and vividly described in Ovid ’s Metamorphosis .
For those who enjoy mythology , there ’s typically a second – equally fascinating – element that being the often factual inspiration for the myth .
Though originally assumed to be uninspired fairy - tales pulled straight from the author ’s mind – history has shown us that many of the great events outlined in ancient myths may actually have a factual origin .
A prime example is the re-discovery of Troy .
Once thought to be nothing more than myth , archeologists were able to use Homer ’s descriptions to not only prove Troy ’s existence but re-discover it .
Another example is one of my personal favorites .
Though still fairly contested the “ Black Sea Deluge Theory ” suggests that the Great Flood which appears in a number of religious creation myths may very well have been caused by the relatively sudden collapse of a land dam .
The flooding that ensued would have drastically altered the landscape , and may have claimed entire cities which in turn would have generated the myth that the entire world had been flooded as part of God ’s wrath .
The common opinion surrounding Scylla and Charybdis focuses mostly on the straight that these two sea monsters dwelt in , and does little to take into account what inspired the monsters themselves .
To this end , most believe that the straight mentioned in the myth is the Strait of Messina between Sicily and Calabria , in Italy .
Frankly , I have n’t thought too much about the myth or its origins since I visited Greece in 2007 .
Until , that is , earlier today when I stumbled onto a video clip of the Kavachi Volcano in the Solomon Islands .
Kavachi is one of the most active submarine volcanoes in the world and has been toying with the idea of breaking the surface and becoming a full fledged island for nearly 100 years .
As I watched the footage of eruption as it broke the surface in what appeared to be the middle of the ocean it hit me from somewhere deep in my subconscious .
If I was floating along in a boat thousands of years ago , did n’t know better , and suddenly found myself face to face with hissing , steaming , smelly water boiling up towards the surface with tons of dirt and mud in tow I ’d have been more than willing to believe I was coming face to face with a sea monster .
Especially if the undersea eruption damaged the boat , or broke the surface long enough to launch molten lava bombs towards the ship .
I was quite possibly looking at a very probable inspiration for Scylla and Charybdis .
As I toyed with the idea I quickly started to put two and two together .
Was there volcanic activity in the area and during the period of time leading up to the writing of the Odyssey ?
You better believe it .
One need only look to what ’s left of the Island of Santorini for confirmation that Greece had a volcanic history .
A volcanic history that had been fairly active in the period leading up to Homer ’s writing .
Though less likely , there ’s also a similar history of volcanism in the area around Napals and Sicily adding to the possibility of some sort of underwater eruption several thousand years ago .
No doubt most are familiar with the land based eruption of the volcano near Pompeii , and others may be familiar with the current eruptions of the Sicilian volcano Mt. Etna .
What ’s your take ?

As the climate continues to change , some studies suggest that warmer temperatures may help plants bloom earlier and longer .
However , that may not be the whole story .
An article published in Science details how different plants respond to different indicators of changing seasons , and why that might ultimately shift the balance of some ecosystems .
Phenology , the study of how nature responds to cyclical changes , indicates that non-tropical plants need their environment to fulfill three criteria before they 'll start blooming : the degree of winter chilling , photoperiod ( the length of the day relative to the night ) , and temperature .
Plant typically handles these cues hierarchically , first registering that the winter chilling period has ended , then taking into account the photoperiod , and then the ambient temperature .
While most plants and trees , including those that typically dominate mature forests , use all three variables , others do not take the photoperiod into account .
The other two blooming criteria , chilling and temperature , can happen earlier in the year as the climate warms up .
This would allow photoperiod - insensitive plants to bloom sooner , possibly getting the drop on the other flora that have to wait around for days to get sufficiently long before they can start their reproductive cycles and restart their growth cycles .
The two classes of plants may end up with different access to resources , including pollinators .
While this may shift the dynamics of photoperiod sensitive and insensitive trees , there are a number of other factors that contribute to plant prosperity that climate does n't affect , such as mineralization of the soil .
Still , it 's important to note that , when it comes to plants , there wo n't be a single , consistent response to climate change .

Sorry Republicans .
Your cost - control ideas belong to Democrats now .
On the day of the historic House vote on the Senate bill and reconciliation package , conservative pundit David Frum wrote a piece titled " Waterloo , " in which he stated that “ conservatives and Republicans today suffered their most crushing legislative defeat since the 1960s . ”
Frum argued that , by opposing the entire legislative effort as a means to cripple the Obama presidency and refusing to negotiate in good faith , the Republicans ensured they would have no part in shaping the most significant domestic policy of the last 40 years .
“ Barack Obama badly wanted Republican votes for his plan , " Frum explained .
" Could we have leveraged his desire to align the plan more closely with conservative views ? ”
The answer is clearly yes .
And the consequences will be large .
By unilaterally ceding control over the contents of the health bill , Republicans have also ceded any claim to the policy innovations therein .
Ideas that were once championed by conservatives have now been adopted by Democrats , who have become their primary champion .
Going forward , if they are successful , these ideas will be permanently considered Democratic achievements .
One of the best examples of such a conservative issue is cost control .
For decades , cost - conscious Republicans criticized the way health care is delivered in our country .
They argued that generous insurance plans , combined with the fee - for - service system in which doctors , hospitals , and other providers are reimbursed for each point of service they deliver , creates incentives for overuse .
Incentives work in health care like they do in other markets :
If you pay someone to do something , they will do it a lot .
Because we must pay for each check - up , each consultation , each test , the system encourages providers to approve unnecessary care for higher payment .
So the fee - for - service system rewards volume over quality of care .
By realigning the system to provide better market incentives , moderate conservatives argued , we could wring billions of wasted dollars out of the system .
( Many also contended that we should control costs from the opposite direction , making consumers responsible for more of the cost for each service , and therefore reducing their incentive to " overconsume " health care . )
Liberals , in turn , defended this fee - for - service system from its critics , arguing that any alternative would limit access to needed care .
They wanted to ensure that doctors and consumers had the primary say over health care , and fee - for - service , they argued , was the best way to guarantee that .
They did n't talk about " death panels , " of course , but they did imply that a system which encouraged doctors to control costs might ultimately mean patients would suffer .
Yet a funny thing happened on the way to health care reform .
A moderate consensus developed , which agreed that fee - for - service is too inefficient and does create too many incentives to boost the volume of care without improving quality .
As Congress developed its proposals , changes to the health care delivery system were championed in the Senate Finance Committee by Senator Baucus and others .
The President pushed for them in negotiations with the Hill .
And , internally , he discussed the New Yorker article by Atul Gawande , which focused on the way that geographic variation in health care is in part caused by the fee - for - service system ’s incentives toward volume .

Webapps on App Engine , part 6 : Lazy loading
Posted by Nick Johnson | Filed under python , coding , app - engine , tech , framework
This is part of a series on writing a webapp framework for App Engine Python .
For details , see the introductory post here .
A major concern for many people developing for App Engine , particularly those building low - to - medium traffic sites , is instance load time .
When App Engine serves the first request to a new instance of your app , it must import the request handler module you specified , which in turn imports all the other modules required to serve the request .
In large apps , this can add up to quite a lot of additional overhead for loading requests , and substantially impact the experience for end users .
There are a number of things you can do to reduce loading times , including using lighter weight frameworks instead of all inclusive ones , and breaking seldom used components up into separate handlers - an approach taken by bloggart for the admin interface .
One source of inefficiency stands out as a prime candidate for optimisation , though : unnecessary imports .
Many frameworks , including the built in webapp framework , require you to provide a list of handler classes that should be instantiated to serve requests , in a ' url map ' .
When a request comes in , the framework simply instantiates the relevant class and calls it to handle the request .
However , doing this requires you to import all your handler classes so you can construct the url map , and this likely results in transitively importing your entire webapp , even though only a small proportion of it may be required to handle the request at hand .
You may have noticed that our framework , so far , does n't appear to do any better on this front - and you'd be right .
That 's about to change , however .
One thing we 've kept a constant throughout writing the framework is making as many components as possible independent , often by making them WSGI applications in their own right .
The router is a WSGI application , and so are handler classes , and so is the WebOb response object .
Today , we 'll make use of that feature to add support for lazy loading in a manner that 's completely independent of our framework - and would work on any other WSGI - based framework , too .
The interface to our lazy loader will be straightforward : Instantiate a class with the fully qualified name of a module containing a WSGI application ( such as a handler for our framework ) , and it will act as a WSGI application that imports the handler module on first access , and calls it in turn .
To do this , we need to be able to import a module whose name is defined at runtime - and for that we use the Python builtin __import__ .
__import__ 's operation is fairly straightforward : Simply call it with the name of the module to be imported as the first argument , and it imports the relevant module into the Python runtime .
Somewhat confusingly , though , it returns the top - level module rather than the one we asked for - so __import__ (' foo.bar.baz ' ) returns ' foo ' .
As additional information , we pass __import__ it our local and global variables using two more arguments , to allow it to resolve relative imports .
In short , this :
from mypackage import mymodule
Is equivalent to this :
__import__('mypackage.mymodule ' , globals ( ) , locals ( ) ) mymodule = sys.modules ['mypackage.mymodule ' ]
We also need to know how to retrieve a name from a module dynamically .
This is even simpler : Every object in python ( more or less ) is backed by a dict , which can be accessed with its ' __dict__ ' attribute .
Retrieving a name from a module is thus achieved like so :
myclass = mymodule.__dict__[' myclass ']
With that in mind , writing our lazy importer is simple :
class WSGILazyLoader ( object ) : def __init__( self , fullname ) : self.modulename , self.objname = fullname.rpartition ('.') self.obj = None def __call__( self , environ , start_response ) : if not self.obj : __import__(self.modulename , globals ( ) , locals ( ) ) module = sys.modules[self.modulename ] self.obj = module.__dict__[self.objname ] return self.obj( environ , start_response )
To use it , we simply define our handler ( and create an instance of it ) in one module :
import framework class HomeHandler ( framework.RequestHandler ) : def get ( self ) : self.response.body = " Hello , world ! " home_handler = HomeHandler ( )
And reference it using the lazy loader in another :
import framework from google.appengine.ext.webapp.util import run_wsgi_app application = framework .
WSGIRouter ( ) application.connect ('/' , framework .
WSGILazyLoader('home.home_handler ' ) ) def main ( ) : run_wsgi_app( application ) if __name__ == " __main__ " : main ( )
You can enhance the lazy loader , of course .
Possibilities include having it take the name of a class instead of an instance , and have it automatically instantiate the handler class for each new request , thus duplicating the instance - per- request mechanism of webapp and other frameworks .

A Mississippi federal court ruled Tuesday that officials at Itawamba Agricultural High School violated a lesbian student ’s First Amendment rights when it canceled the school prom rather than let the student attend with her girlfriend .
Constance McMillen , an 18 - year - old senior , made national headlines when she sued the school district for the right to bring her girlfriend to the prom .
School officials had told her she could not wear a tuxedo and had to bring a male date instead .
“ It feels really good that the court realized that the school was violating my rights and discriminating against me by canceling the prom , ” McMillen said in a statement .
“ All I ever wanted was for my school to treat me and my girlfriend like any other couple that wants to go to a prom . ”
In the ruling the court wrote , “ The record shows Constance has been openly gay since eighth grade and she intended to communicate a message by wearing a tuxedo and to express her identity through attending prom with a same - sex date .
The Court finds this expression and communication of her viewpoint is the type of speech that falls squarely within the purview of the First Amendment . ”
The federal court said the school board does not have to reschedule the dance because parents have already organized an alternative private prom that will be open to all students on April 2 .
McMillen said she plans to attend the private prom as well as the Mississippi Safe Schools Coalition ’s Second Chance Prom , a dance open to all LGBT students in the state as well as straight students who are LGBT - supportive .
“ Now we can all get back to things like picking out our prom night outfits and thinking about corsages , ” said McMillen .
The American Civil Liberties Union , which represented McMillien in the case , hailed the ruling as “ a win for all lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender students who just want to be able to be themselves at school without being treated unfairly . ”
“ Public schools ca n’t just stomp on students ’ free expression rights just because they do n’t want to deal with these students , and if schools do try to do that they ’ll be dealing with us , ” said Kristy Bennett , legal director for the Mississippi ACLU .
Christine P. Sun , senior counsel at the ACLU ’s national LGBT Project who also represented McMillen , said , “ These school officials should be ashamed of themselves for trying to scapegoat a young girl and then trying to lay the blame for their bad behavior at her feet . ”
McMillen first approached school officials about bringing her girlfriend to the prom in December , and again in February .
They said no .
The prom was canceled after the ACLU and supporters demanded the school board reverse its decision to prohibit McMillen from bringing her girlfriend .
School officials told McMillen she could not arrive at the prom with her girlfriend and said they would be thrown out if other students complained about their presence .
Both the ACLU and the the Mississippi Safe Schools Coalition say they deal with complaints every year from LGBT students all over Mississippi who face resistance from their schools about bringing same - sex dates to proms .
Some students do n’t feel safe going to their own proms , they note .
LGBT activists hope McMillen ’s story sheds light on the problem and encourages school districts everywhere to accept students for who they are regardless of their sexual orientation .
About 715 students attend McMillen ’s high school in the town of 4,000 in rural northern Mississippi .
Since McMillen ’s case was filed , a Facebook page set up for her case has attracted over 400,000 supporters .
McMillen was also a recent guest on the Ellen DeGeneres talk show and received a $ 30,000 university scholarship .

Several years ago , as a member of a discussion listserv , I was surprised to learn that even prominent scientists do not necessarily hold with certain central tenets of what has traditionally been understood to be scientific method .
A world - class scientist on the listserv claimed in the course of an unrelated debate that gravity was a fact , not a theory .
This struck me as fundamentally wrongheaded , and it still does .
It is , of course , a " fact " that unsupported objects fall .
What explains this observable fact is the theory of gravity .
Gravity is the theory ; the falling object is the fact .
The theory explains the fact , but the theory never becomes a fact .
This scientist was quite adamant on the point , going so far as to assert that we inquisitive laymen on this listserv should just take his word for it , since he is an expert and we are n't .
I wondered at the time how such a universally acclaimed scholar in the sciences could make an error so elementary that even my freshmen logic students could see it , while also so blithely refusing to engage in constructive discussion .
The recent Climategate scandal is instructive in this regard .
One sees the same lack of openness and intellectual rigor in the arrogance , stonewalling , name - calling , and apparently deliberate obfuscation that have characterized the response of some global warming / climate change supporters to the legitimate questions that have been raised by scientists and laymen alike .
Even those sympathetic to the claims of climate change scientists are ridiculed for asking honest questions .
Such " Climate Deniers " are implicitly compared to the unbalanced and ignorant few who claim that the Holocaust never happened -- i.e. " Holocaust Deniers . "
Wikipedia even has an entry on " Denialism " ( which has my vote for the silliest - sounding ad hominem attack ever ) .
This linguistic three - card Monte is made possible only via the same conflation of facts and theories in which my former colleague engaged .
The climate is constantly changing .
That is a fact .
The notion that climate change is caused by human activities is a theory that seeks to explain the fact .
By calling the theory a " fact , " climate change scientists have effectively foreclosed the possibility of further discussion .
After all , only a fool argues about facts , right ?
This seemingly obvious ruse has been surprisingly effective , and the whole business hinges on the words used .
" Theories " are fair game for discussion and debate because these are simply frameworks within which facts are to be understood .
" Facts , " conversely , just are what they are .
Every reasonable person agrees that while we are all entitled to our opinions , we are not entitled to our own facts .
Thus , in order to shut down the opposition without the bother of having to argue with them , the faux scientist need only redefine what a " fact " is .
When that has n't worked , " Denialism " is invoked to shame those persistent enough to continue to ask questions .
Diehard " Cheers " fans may recall that when the ever - amorous Sam Malone finally persuaded perennial gold - digger Rebecca Howe to give up waiting for " Mr. Right , " she consoled herself by saying , " After all , it 's not like Donald Trump or Robin Colcord is going to walk through the door and sweep me off my feet . "
" Robin Colcord , " of course , does not exist .
The " Cheers " writing staff used a neat little trick to introduce a new character .
They had Ms. Howe refer to the fictional " Robin Colcord " as a peer of the well - known Donald Trump , and -- voila ! -- a mogul is born !
" Denialism " slouched into existence as a result of similar sort of legerdemain .
In just the way in which the talented " Cheers " writing staff created a billionaire out of whole cloth by doing nothing more complicated than putting his name next to Donald Trump's , so too did the no-less - imaginative Climategate fabulists associate those who question the AGW thesis with Holocaust Deniers .
After all , questioning a scientific theory and turning a blind eye to genocide are pretty much the same thing , right ?
But wait , there 's more .
The Wikipedia entry on " Denialism " portrays " Deniers " as engaging in the following : Conspiracy Theories , Cherry - Picking , the use of False Experts , Moving the Goalpost , and Logical Fallacies .
The very people who came up with this silly " ism " are guilty of every one of these .
First , they attribute every challenge to the AGW theory to dark ulterior motives and often point to an underlying conspiracy .
To hear them tell it , you would think that a wicked cabal made up of George W. Bush , Halliburton , Dick Cheney , Talk Radio , Big Oil , Big Pharma , Big Bird , The Dallas Cowboys Defensive Line , and Karl Rove 's tailor is trying to discredit these hard - working warriors for truth .
Cherry - Picking :
The tree -ring evidence used to support the temperature change assertions required for the AGW thesis were taken from a very small number of anomalous samples .
Cherry - picking extraordinaire !
As for false experts , has anyone heard of a fellow named " Al Gore " ?
The former U.S. vice president and divinity school flunk - out has no scientific background , yet this eco-guru has earned a Nobel Prize for his error - riddled slide show , as well as hundreds of millions of dollars in climate - related business ventures .
Moving the Goalpost : Depending on the weather during a given year , we are either told that high temperatures are evidence of global warming or that low temperatures are evidence of global warming .
( In logic , they call that a " tautology . "
In real life , they call that " having your cake and eating it , too . " )
Those goalposts are not just moving ; they 're sprinting !
Finally , the logical fallacies committed during the Climategate imbroglio are too numerous to count , but their abusive use of just one fallacy -- the argumentum ad hominem ( personal attack ) -- is so noteworthy that even Triumph the Insult Comic Dog is reportedly telling them to ease up .
Gee , this makes the AGW cohort sound a lot like " Deniers , " does n't it ?
Hmm .
The psychological term for attributing one 's own trickery and failings onto others is " Projection . "
This describes " Denialism " perfectly : projection of the dishonest , illiberal , and anti-intellectual tactics of the Enviro - Inquisition onto those " eco-heretics " who dare to question , however politely and intelligently , these dedicated adherents of the One True Faith .
This corruption of science is an object lesson to the rest of us never to hesitate to look with a gimlet eye at those who are more skilled in the use of invective than rational argument .
The truth need not express itself with a sneer .

On the heels of the leak of various country positions on ACTA transparency , today an even bigger leak has hit the Internet .
A new European Union document prepared several weeks ago canvasses the Internet and Civil Enforcement chapters , disclosing in complete detail the proposals from the U.S. , the counter - proposals from the EU , Japan , and other ACTA participants .
The 44 - page document also highlights specific concerns of individual countries on a wide range of issues including ISP liability , anti-circumvention rules , and the scope of the treaty .
This is probably the most significant leak to - date since it goes even beyond the transparency debate by including specific country positions and proposals .
The document highlights significant disagreement on a range of issues .
For example , on the issue of anti-circumvention legislation and access controls , the U.S. wants it included per the DCMA , but many other countries , including the EU , Japan , and New Zealand do not , noting that the WIPO Internet treaties do not require it .
A brief summary of the key findings are posted below , but much more study is needed .
Internet Enforcement Chapter
Canada has expressed concern with the title of the chapter ( " Special Measures Related to Technological Enforcement Means and the Internet " ) and the substance of the chapter
On the ISP safe harbour chapter , the leak identifies three proposals ( consistent with an earlier NZ comment ) .
In addition to the U.S. proposal that was leaked earlier , there is a Japanese proposal and one from the EU .
Moreover , many countries have raised specific issues about the U.S. language .
For example , New Zealand notes that the safe harbour appears to cover Information Location Tool providers ( ie. search engines ) , but that it wonders why there is a concern of liability to begin with .
Japan 's alternative proposal calls for ISP liability based on knowledge of infringement .
It states that there may be liability if it is technically possible to prevent the infringement and the provider " knows or there is reasonable ground to know " that infringement is occurring .
There are additional provisions on the inclusion of a notice system and industry cooperation .
With respect to the requirement of an ISP policy that could include three strikes as a pre-requisite for qualifying for the safe harbour , New Zealand is opposed to the condition altogether .
Meanwhile , Japan notes that its law does not contain a policy requirement and it would have to consider whether it can agree to that requirement .
On the implementation of notice - and - takedown , Canada has noted that the relationship between third party liability and ISP limitation of liability is unclear .
On the anti-circumvention rules , which involves a U.S. attempt to implement a global DMCA , the EU would like to exclude access controls from the ambit of the provision .
They are not alone – New Zealand opposes their inclusion and Japan also takes the position that access controls are not required by the WIPO Internet treaties and is apparently concerned about the implications for its domestic law .
There is no reference to a Canadian position , despite the fact that this goes beyond current Canadian law .
Civil Enforcement Chapter
the U.S. , Japan , and the European Union want the civil enforcement powers to extend to any intellectual property right .
Canada , Singapore , and New Zealand seek a more limited treaty that covers only copyright and trademarks .
the EU is seeking injunctive relief powers against intermediaries whose services are used by a third party to infringe an IP right .
The EU is alone in focusing on intermediary injunctions .
on statutory damages , the EU seeks to limit damages to actual damages , while the U.S. is proposing statutory damages .
There is also dispute on the scope of the IP rights ( all vs. just copyright and trademark ) .
Canada and NZ also want to limit or exclude damages in certain special cass .
on the disclosure of information related to investigations , the U.S. is pushing for very broad language , while the E.U. wants to limit with specific kinds of information ( and Canada has proposed further limiting language ) .
Two suspected bank robbers , one of them wearing a St Patrick 's Day costume , have been killed in a shootout with police in Tennessee .
First State Bank in the Nashville suburb of Gallatin was held up on Wednesday by a man dressed as a leprechaun , police said .
The man left the bank with an undisclosed amount of money .
Both suspects were shot dead when they ditched their vehicle and ran into a field , pursued by police officers .
The costumed suspect had initially walked into a Fifth Third Bank nearby at lunchtime but left again because it was too crowded , witness Bradley Webb told Tennessee 's News Channel 5 .
' Large - calibre gun '
Sharon Riehemann , manager of the Fifth Third Bank , said the costumed man had been wearing a green top hat , vest and shorts and a fake brown beard and wig .
" He started to come in , then looked at his watch , then turned around and left , " she was quoted as saying by the Associated Press news agency .
After holding up First State Bank with a large - calibre gun , police said , the " leprechaun " man joined another suspect waiting in a car outside .
Police spotted the car with the two suspects fleeing the scene and a car chase ensued .
One police car was hit by several bullets and the car broke down as a result , Sgt Bill Storment of the Gallatin Police Department was quoted as saying by Channel 5 .
The suspects left their car in a field and fled on foot .
They were killed while exchanging fire with officers , police said .
No officers were injured and money was recovered from the suspects ' vehicle .
Both suspects were pronounced dead on the scene .
The leprechaun , a solitary elf in Irish fairytales , figures in celebrations to mark St Patrick 's Day .
AP notes that the case is reminiscent of a 22 December robbery in Nashville when a man dressed in a Santa suit - including hat , beard and moustache - held up a SunTrust Bank , demanding money from the teller at gunpoint .
No arrests were made in that case .
Leonard Pitts ’ column ( “ Race is just the last straw , ” March 1 ) perfectly exemplifies the panicking left .
There surely is a last straw evidenced by Mr. Pitts ’ words , but that straw is the charge of racism itself rather than the race of Barack Obama .
When debate against a valid , opposing viewpoint fails , the left unfailingly retreats to charges of racism .
It is their hole card .
In spite of the lack of convincing evidence , the existence of evidence to the contrary , the utter lack of cogent , believable explanation or a refutation of their dissent , Mr. Pitts declares it fact :
The tea party is racist .
The cohort he cites to shore his argument , Mr. Olbermann , is just as , if not more , unconvincing or credible .
In fact , in hitching his wagon to Keith Olbermann , Mr. Pitts is hitching his reputation to a horse charging headlong into a burning barn , a la Air America .
I am not a tea partier , but I respect their right to dissent absent the Fourth Estate ’s disgustingly false charges of racism .

An association representing 300 large corporations urged President Obama and Congress on Monday to repeal a provision of the health care overhaul that prompted AT&T , Caterpillar and other companies to announce substantial charges for the current quarter .
The association , the American Benefits Council , said the provision — which reduces the tax deductions for companies with drug coverage for their retired employees — would deal a significant blow to corporate profits and would discourage companies from hiring more workers .
AT&T announced last week that it was taking a $ 1 billion charge because of the provision .
Deere & Company announced a $ 150 million charge , Caterpillar a $ 100 million charge , and 3 M a $ 90 million charge .
Many companies said they were taking these charges now , before the current quarter ended , to comply with accounting rules .
But some corporate critics asserted that the companies ’ rapid response to the health legislation was aimed at pressing the administration to repeal the provision .
The man they call " the conscience of Alabama " is at a moral crossroads .
Wayne Flynt , the Alabama historian and author , knows his home state as well as any doctor knows a patient .
And yet he is as perplexed as anyone by the fury over bingo - a raging debate in Alabama that has dominated the political landscape and gripped the state at its highest levels of government .
" The ferocity of it is amusing , given our history , " he said .
" Gambling has always been popular - perhaps even universal - in Alabama , just as it is in other parts of the South . "
Flynt , a retired Auburn University history professor , said riverboat gambling was prevalent in Alabama in the antebellum era .
Gambling proceeds , he said , provided early funding for state schools , including Mobile 's Barton Academy , the first public school in Alabama .
When construction of the Government Street landmark stalled for lack of money in 1836 , the state Legislature approved a lottery that helped pay for its completion .
But like so many issues in Alabama , the roots of the current debate trace back to the Civil War , according to Flynt .
Southerners , he said , agonized to understand why the Confederacy was defeated .
" They truly believed that God was on their side .
And so when they lost , they asked ' Why , God ?
What did we do to anger You ? ' "
Flynt said .
" They came up with vices - gambling , alcohol , prostitution .
And they developed a religion based on all these things we should n't be doing . "
That fundamentalist seed , he said , sprouted into the modern Alabama Baptist church that today claims one in four Alabamians and nearly two out of every three church members .
" Baptists dominate Alabama as few religious groups do in any state , " Flynt wrote in Alabama Baptists , his 1998 history of the denomination .
While Gov. Bob Riley and Attorney General Troy King - a pair of devout Baptists - debate the legality of the electronic bingo machines that have proliferated across the state , it is religion - not the law - that is at the heart of the crisis , Flynt said .
Flynt himself is a longtime member of Auburn First Baptist Church .
He said he 's discussed the gambling issue in his Sunday school class and that he recently reached a conclusion that put him at odds with most of the church 's congregation .
Flynt said he agrees with religious leaders who say casinos prey on the poor , contribute to political corruption and discourage the values of hard work and thrift .
" For all those reasons and many more , I oppose gambling , " he said .
" But I grieve over the inequities of poverty and poor schools that have plagued our state for generations .
I believe we have a moral obligation to do something about it .
But we are such an anti-tax state , I do n't know where you get the money to fix anything . "
That puts
Flynt in a quandary over bingo .
" If you approach it from a moral standpoint , it 's just not as simple as it might seem , " he said .
" There are times in life when you accept something as a necessary evil - war would be a good example , or capital punishment - and there are times when you 're forced to choose the least bad of several alternatives . "
" If I sound ambivalent , it 's because I am .
But I suppose if gambling can be part of the solution , then I 'm willing to consider it . "

“ What is worrying is to see the way in which assessment is driving the curriculum , ” he said .
“ Learning and the curriculum should come first ; assessment should follow .
In the days following the senseless murder of Dr. Tiller , we were all stunned , heartbroken , and angry .
In speaking with providers in the days and weeks following , we expressed our gratitude for their work , especially for persevering during such a difficult time .
As one of the providers I spoke with said in response , " we are just trying to do what Dr. Tiller would want us to do : help women . "
That sums it all up .
My dad does n't believe in Father 's Day or Mother 's Day because he believes that every day should be Father 's Day and Mother 's Day .
The same is true for today : every day should be National Day of Appreciation of Abortion Providers .
Because every day , abortion providers around the country perform services that many will not ; they do so in the face of adversity and violence ( or potential violence ) ; and they do so with compassion .
Without their courage , commitment , and skill , the legal right to abortion in this country would be meaningless .
So in addition to thanking abortion providers today , we should thank them every day .
Below are a series of reflections from my colleagues in honor of the men and women throughout the country who are the true torchbearers of liberty .
In a Family Way
By Lorraine Kenny , Public Education Director , ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project
I never thanked the doctor who performed my abortion more than 16 years ago .
I did n't even know his name .
I was too overwhelmed by the fact that I was pregnant and not ready to have a child .
This was not a planned pregnancy .
I was a graduate student with years of work ahead of me , including field research that would leave me without a real home for a time ; I was unemployed and in a relationship that was far from mature enough to handle parenting .
But leaving all that aside , I now know that even if I had thanked my provider at the time , I would not have really known what I was thanking him for .
Now I do .
I would have thanked him for giving me the chance to have my family .
I am now the mother of two beautiful girls , 7 and 12 .
They are healthy , happy , thriving children who are truly loved by me , their father , and a whole slew of aunts , uncles , cousins , a grandmother , an Abulita , and close friends .
I know what my abortion provider gave me 16 years ago when I watch my husband help our daughters do their homework , practice violin , or make all of us a heart - shaped pink biscuit on Valentine 's Day morning ; when I watch my 85 - year - old mother 's face light up when one of my daughters plays in a concert or writes a story about visiting grandma or remembering grandpa ; when I watch my daughters learn to swim , make each other giggle , or even when I watch them drive each other crazy or come home utterly defeated when one of them did n't get into the school talent show or messed up in a concert despite hours of practicing .
I am grateful that today I have the opportunity to thank my abortion provider for my children and my family .
I do not take these blessings for granted , nor do I take for granted the role he played in giving my family life .
My Name is Hayley Smith and I Work for Reproductive Freedom
By Hayley Smith , Assistant , ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project
I do n't always come right out and say what I do for a living .
Sometimes , I do n't want to invite public scrutiny , anger , or judgment .
Sometimes , I see abortion as a personal rather than a political decision .
And sometimes , I have to admit that I just do n't want to get into the debate .
So when asked what I do , I often say , " I work for the ACLU , " or more generically , " I work on women 's rights . "
Today , though , I think it 's important that we all go public .
For the providers who endure the public scrutiny so that their patients do n't have to ; who bear the brunt of others ' anger and judgment ; who testify in courtrooms and legislatures to protect their patients ' rights and privacy .
And for those who open their clinic doors every day to ensure that their patients can lead the lives they choose .
The best way that I know how to thank you , providers , is to share in some of that responsibility .
Mom
By Dahlia Ward , State Strategist , ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project
I do n't remember when my mother first told me that she had had an abortion before my sister and I were born .
It 's just something that I 've always known .
I do remember talking to my parents about going on birth control when I was just 16 .
I remember the look of worry that flashed across my mother 's face before she said " of course , I 'll make the doctor 's appointment for you . "
And I remember my father telling me that if I ever got " in trouble , " that they would take me to the very best doctor so that I could " get it taken care of safely . "
I grew up in a world of possibilities .
Where the only question was what I wanted for my life and what path I would take .
That I could decide to have an abortion , if I needed one , was never a question .
And therefore , something I could take for granted .
So when asked to articulate what I would say to the men and women who work day in and out to make sure that I and so many other women have the ability to determine our own life courses , I turned to my mother ( who else ? ) and asked her what she would say to the doctor who performed her abortion .
She did n't hesitate , " I would thank him .
He gave me the ability to go on living the life I wanted .
I did n't have to take a detour that I was n't prepared for .
It gave me and your father the time we needed to decide to have a family when we were ready .
I can't imagine my life any other way . "
Neither can I .
So thank you for being there for my mother when she needed you .
And thank you for continuing to be there for me , in case I need you .
And thank you for being there for women like me and my mom so that we can lead the lives we envision for ourselves and our families .
No , Thank You .
By Diana Kasdan , Staff Attorney , ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project
Often when I talk to abortion providers , or clinic managers or counselors , I 'm calling them at home , or on their private cell , or in between appointments to ask if they could please , please , spare some of their free time ( that they really do n't have ) .
I 'm usually asking them to help out in a case that we are litigating , often to serve — very publicly — as an expert witness .
And while any other type of health care provider might not return these calls , or politely say , " I 'm very , very busy ; I can't help with this , " or " My hourly rate as an expert is $ 500 , " the folks I call say , " I 'm happy to help , " and then , often , embarrassingly , they thank me .
They thank me for " fighting " to protect women 's access to abortion .
And that 's when I feel silly .
At that moment , usually all I can muster up to say is " No , thank you . "
Today , stopping to reflect , and hoping to say it better , I 'm no less stumped in finding words that fully express my constant amazement and gratitude -- for your work , your generosity , your spirit , and most of all for your absolute dedication — often against unbelievable odds — to providing women the care they need .
So , as I 've been privileged to personally say to a few of you , but certainly not all of you , or enough of you —
Thank you ; no really , thank you .
A Sense of Safety
By Anastasia Taketomo , Assistant , ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project
At 25 , I am relatively young in the spectrum of individuals who make up this movement .
When I began my work in the Reproductive Freedom Project , it shocked me how often I was asked if I did this work because I had had an abortion .
As my answer is no , the follow up question is always the same : then why do you ?
Early on , my answer was vague and uninformed .
I would speak of friends of mine , or women I had met , or heard of second hand , who had benefited from abortion services .
I would speak of feminism and equality in the abstract .
The truth of the matter was that I did not have a true answer , although I was sure the work was crucial .
Perhaps I have the providers to thank for the innocence that caused my inability to answer such a seemingly simple question .
Their endless work , extraordinary dedication , and unfaltering bravery have given women of my generation a sense of safety and a true understanding of choice .
Because these individuals have been willing to come to work every day , despite the endless obstacles they face both professionally and personally , I have not lived a day in my 25 years without the security of knowing that I have the freedom to choose the best decisions for my body and for my life .
Working in this movement for the past 19 months has opened my eyes to the enormous challenges providers face : laws that derail and demonize the very core of their essential work , propaganda that threatens to sway public support , and the real threats and acts of violence they face .
I can say now , with certainty , why I do this work .
I do it because I am grateful that I have never faced the challenges I now know women and families face every day ; I do this work because I want to ensure that future women and families have as much security and as many choices as possible ; and , most of all , I do this work as a means to say " thank you " to the providers who put their own lives on the line to ensure that women like me stay safe and free .
It Matters
By Louise Melling , Director , ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project
I keep by my desk a picture of one of my first clients as a lawyer .
Every day , she reminds me how important abortion providers are for women and their families .
When I first met Linda* , she was 18 , newly married , and pregnant .
She and her husband were excited about starting a family .
And then they got difficult news .
Their baby had open spina bifida .
If they continued the pregnancy , their baby would need immediate surgery , would likely be paralyzed from the waist down ( including organs ) , and would likely face infections and surgeries .
Linda and her husband talked to the doctor .
They talked to people with children with disabilities .
They talked to one another .
They took the time they needed .
Linda then called to tell me they did n't want to go through with the pregnancy .
As she said , they were too young , their marriage too new .
Linda needed help paying for the procedure ; when legal avenues failed , to help we raised the funds to make her abortion possible .
Linda got the abortion she needed .
She had love and support from her family .
And she had a funeral service for her son , whose place in her life she marks every year .
More than 16 years have passed .
No year has gone by without my talking to Linda .
She sends me pictures of the children she went on to have .
I 've met her family .
We celebrated her 30 birthday together , joined by one of the nurses from her abortion .
We have this connection because it mattered , deeply , to Linda and her husband that they were able to make that decision .
And it mattered that there was a doctor and a staff and a hospital willing to provide her care and compassion .
And it mattered that she was supported , not judged .
It mattered for reasons of love — of wanting , desperately , to be able to provide the home and support and love she wanted to give her child .
Thank you , to providers everywhere , for making this possible , and giving Linda , and all of us , a chance at life .

Here Let Me Help
You with That
By Jennifer Dalven , Deputy Director , ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project
I 'll never forget the one time I was privileged enough to meet Dr. Tiller .
It was an unlikely meeting place for an abortion provider and an abortion rights advocate — an airport gate , waiting for a severely delayed plane .
I had , of course , heard about him for years .
He was one of the luminaries of our field .
Everyone knew he was courageous – besieged and attacked — he refused to stop caring for women .
And I had heard tell of his compassion .
I remember being on a panel and afterward a woman approached me and did , in this day and age , a most unusual thing .
This woman , a stranger , introduced herself and told me about her abortion .
She told me that at the end of her second trimester of a wanted pregnancy her fetus was diagnosed with a severe anomaly .
She told me that even though she lived in a major city and was well connected to medical circles , she could not find anyone who was willing to perform an abortion for her .
She told me about how desperate she was .
She told me how she flew to Witchita .
She told me about the individualized and compassionate treatment she received from Dr. Tiller and his staff .
And she told me how grateful she was not only to have received the care , but for the support and the kindness with which it was provided .
So when I saw Dr. Tiller at the airport I gathered up my nerve to introduce myself .
At the time , he had already been shot once .
He was being persecuted and prosecuted by an anti-choice district attorney .
I wanted to tell him how much I respected him and how grateful I was for what he did .
I wanted to tell him about the conversation I had had with the stranger .
But , we did n't talk much about abortion that day .
To my chagrin , my infant son decided to show how displeased he was about having to wait for a delayed plane by repeatedly ( and I mean repeatedly ) throwing his pacifier on the waiting area floor .
We did n't talk about abortion that day , because Dr. Tiller , this hero of our field , was too busy running back and forth to the bathroom to wash off my son's pacifier .
Securing the Future of Abortion Care
By Sondra Goldschein , Director of State Advocacy , ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project
Medical students are a very busy bunch .
( I should know ; I married one . )
And that is why the members of Medical Students for Choice are so inspiring .
Each year at their national meeting , I provide the political lay of the land — explaining where we 've fought legislation that bans abortion care ; bills specifically designed to make it too expensive to open a clinic ; and acts requiring health care professionals to make statements that they do n't believe or have no basis in medical fact .
It 's a scary laundry list of different ways the state legislatures across this country try to interfere with a woman 's most personal , private medical decisions and her trusted relationship with her doctor .
But without fail , every year , medical students raise their hands and ask , " What can we do to help ? " or " I 'm going into anesthesiology , can I still fight back ? "
Despite their busy schedules , medical students have volunteered in South Dakota , where we successfully defeated a ballot initiative that would have banned nearly all abortion care .
They 've participated in lobby days at their state legislatures and in Congress .
They are the future abortion providers and the medical community in which those providers will practice .
I want to sincerely thank them for including political activism in their education .
I have no idea how they find the time .
Thank You for Safeguarding Women 's Dreams
By Talcott Camp , Deputy Director , ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project
I thank abortion providers for saving women 's lives , and safeguarding women 's dreams .
Many of us — not all of us , but many of us — cannot live out our dreams without the ability to determine whether and when to have a baby .
Those dreams may include focusing on school for a certain number of years ; waiting until we are with a life partner before starting a family ; caring for our existing children in a way we can manage given our individual family ; holding down a job because it is fulfilling and / or because we need to support our families ; and caring for our aging parents .
If we did n't have contraception and abortion as a back - stop to end an unwanted pregnancy , our dreams would remain notions , and our lives would not be of our own making .
It 's that simple : we may be able to live someone else 's dream , but we cannot live ours without the heroes who provide abortion care .
Even if we never need an abortion , we construct our lives knowing that these doctors are there if ever we do .
Our lives are not possible without them , and we could not possibly thank them enough .
Legislative Front Lines
By Autumn Katz , State Strategies Attorney Fellow , ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project
Dr. Tiller 's murder was a sober reminder of the constant intimidation and harassment that abortion providers endure .
In addition to threats of violence from individuals like Scott Roeder , abortion providers , their staff , and their patients are harassed by picketers and protestors on a daily basis .
In my work as a legislative fellow with the Reproductive Freedom Project , I 've seen that abortion providers also face discrimination at the hands of politicians , who pass laws and regulations to limit a woman 's access to reproductive health care and to deter doctors from providing such care .
These laws do nothing to protect the health and safety of women .
Instead , they make it more difficult for women to obtain the care they need and for doctors to provide such care .
Indeed , 86 percent of the counties in the U.S. currently have no abortion providers .
The doctors who do provide abortion care in spite of all these obstacles deserve our utmost respect ; they put their own lives on the line every day by providing women the health care they need .
I hope that my work at the ACLU to defeat laws and policies that jeopardize women's health and limit access to comprehensive reproductive health care in some small way honors the courage and dedication of abortion providers .
