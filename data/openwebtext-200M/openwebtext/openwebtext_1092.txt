It looks like Duke University has another rape case on its hands .
This one may hurt the university nearly as much as the one that rocked its campus back in 2006 .
Unlike the previous case , this one appears to involve a credible confession of sexual abuse .
Like the previous case , crucial facts are already being filtered through the prism of identity politics .
Frank Lombard is the associate director of Duke ’s Center for Health Policy .
The university administrator was recently arrested by the FBI and charged with offering up his adopted 5 - year - old son for sex .
I tried to contact Frank Lombard over the weekend to probe his expertise regarding the health benefits of raping small children .
So far , he ’s declined to comment .
University administrator Lombard is accused of logging on to a chat room online and describing himself as a “ perv dad for fun . ”
The detective who wisely looked into the suspicious screen name says that Lombard admitted to molesting his own adopted son .
All this was before allegedly inviting a stranger to travel to North Carolina from another state to statutorily rape his already - molested adopted son .
If Lombard is convicted , he faces a maximum of 20 years in prison .
His arrest comes about a year after the Court decided that child rapists cannot be executed because “ society ” has “ evolved ” to the point where such executions would be “ indecent . ”
If this case goes to trial , it could be an interesting one to watch .
But it will be just as interesting to watch the Duke faculty respond to these allegations .
It did n’t take them long to respond when several white Duke Lacrosse players were accused of raping a black stripper .
A whopping 88 professors signed a statement accusing the players of both racism and rape .
Such was their regard for the presumption of innocence .
Perhaps even more stunning was the response of some professors after it became apparent that the white lacrosse players were innocent .
After that became so obvious the school had to readmit the students , Professor Kate Holloway resigned her committee assignments in protest .
By the way , the most common form of faculty protest these days is to refuse to work .
Most people think this kind of protest is caused by arrogance .
But the actual cause is a thing called “ tenure . ”
So it will be interesting to see how Duke faculty members respond to Frank Lombard .
Because he is white , Lombard is fair game at Duke , is n’t he ?
But Lombard is also gay , so will that complicate things ?
Unfortunately for Frank Lombard , the affidavit in support of his arrest warrant shows that this second Duke rape case will also have a strong racial component .
According to a confidential source ( CS ) a man using the user name “ cooper2 ” or “ cooperse ” logged onto an internet - based video chat room .
CS saw him perform oral sex on an African - American child under the age of ten .
He also performed other acts on the child , which are too obscene to be described in this column .
The user name “ cooper2 ” has now been linked to Frank Lombard , the associate director Duke University ’s Center for Health Policy .
A second source has now alleged that “ cooper2 ” has confessed to being “ into incest ” and that he has adopted two African American children .
The only good news coming out of this story is about Frank Lombard ’s live - in homosexual partner .
The affidavit in support of Lombard ’s arrest warrant shows that he made special arrangements when molesting the child – sometimes even by drugging the child – to make sure his partner did not find out .
Records also indicate that Frank Lombard made a contribution to the Genesis Home in 2003 .
The Genesis Home is an organization that assists needy families in making a transition out of homelessness , in part by maintaining a child care center .
The organization ’s website features numerous photographs of African - American children under the age of ten .
The Associate Press ( AP ) did not mention the fact that the five - year old offered up for molestation was black .
Bringing that fact to light might be damaging to the political coalition that exists between blacks and gays .
Nor did the AP mention that the adopted child is being raised by a homosexual couple .
Bringing that fact to light might harm the gay adoption movement .
I wrote this column because I believe that certain coalitions must be broken .
And certain movements must be harmed .
Let the political fallout begin .
With the New World Order dragging its jackboots on implementing health care reform , setting up its neighborhood death panels , and delivering on the long - awaited promise of mandatory circumcisions that will finally turn us into both a Zionist nation and a new Nazi regime ( Because that ’s how they get you !
With diversionary tactics ! ) , it ’s suddenly fallen to the public sector to make us hurry up and get fascist -y with it .
Of course , those just - ahead glory days when all hospitals are replaced by huge ovens , the IRS taxes your organs , and the government dispatches middle management bureaucrats to come smother your grandma in her sleep still face stiff opposition from those fighting to keep health care broken and free .
And true , these heroic protestors have thus far been victorious thanks to secret weapons like yelling a lot and sticking Hitler mustaches on everything .
But there ’s a new front forming , a far more powerful group whose foray into battle promises to make the passing of healthcare reform more than just an idle fancy dreamed up at Bilderberg meetings , in between discussions of FEMA camps and ways to fuck with Alex Jones .
We speak , of course , of the fast - food industry , whose efforts to turn the population soft , compliant , and more than a little sleepy has slowly been setting the stage for a triumphant takeover by our corporate overlords , and who struggle even now to make Americans so irreversibly unhealthy that they ’ll have no choice but to submit to whatever socialist order will get them that much - needed angioplasty .
Early advances on reshaping the national consciousness have already been made — using Oprah to incite chicken - related riots ; pitching the Enormous Omelet Sandwich as a “ hearty breakfast ” with a straight face — but really , these were mere propaganda tactics , suitable perhaps for a less crucial peacetime but hardly the embers with which to spark a war .
But fear not , fellow autocrats who long for a day when the populace is too worn down and dehydrated from massive sodium intake to resist the totalitarian reckoning .
The era for dallying is past ; the gears have already been set in motion with the introduction of the four - alarm Reichstag fire known as the KFC Double Down .
As the stand - ins for you , Joe Consumer , point out in the above commercial — currently screening only in select test markets like Omaha and Providence — the worst part about eating a chicken sandwich has always been the “ sandwich , ” that otherwise delicious combination of sucrose , starch , and bleach that surrounds the chicken and keeps your mayo in place , yet nevertheless contains trace amounts of disgusting wheat germ , a useless “ grain ” that ’s been known to impede chicken fat ’s natural tendency to take up residence in your lower intestine , keeping you feeling snuggly and warm .
It ’s just so much filler , stealing precious space from a fried chicken patty that could be occupied by another fried chicken patty .

But this is America , which means no one should have to bow to the demands of “ the dictionary ” ( a book originated by untrustworthy Asians , anyway ) and make their sandwiches using only bread , just because that ’s the definition of a “ sandwich . ”
In fact , if there is but one regret that we should hold collectively as a people , it ’s that it took us this many years of evolution to figure this out :
The creation features a dollop of the Colonel 's secret sauce wrapped in a slice of both Pepperjack Cheese and Swiss Cheese , between two slices of bacon and two filets of KFC original recipe chicken that serve as the ' bread ' of the burger .
That 's right - instead of bread , you get breaded chicken .
Multiplied by two .

See ?
You ’re looking at the pinnacle of food technology there , ye doubting rabble .
NASA scientists could work around the clock in shifts and still they could never improve on that design — at least not until someone discovers a way to put more cheese and bacon in between the breading and chicken , like a Russian nesting doll that makes your chest hurt .
Perhaps someday , genetic engineering will have advanced to the point where chickens can be made to squirt “ secret sauce ” out of their pores when you bite down on them , or food processing will become so fine - tuned that we can take fried chicken , bacon , and cheese and cram them into a french fry - sized sliver , and then serve that alongside the Double Down in a " Quadruple Up , Motherfucker " combo meal , but for right now , this is as good as it gets .
And for those lucky enough to live in Nebraska or Rhode Island , the getting is damn good :
The Double Down is generally considered to be a big success thus far in the areas it has been tested , with management at a KFC outlet in Omaha , Nebraska telling Australian reporters that the ' sandwich ' had exceeded expectations .

Well naturally it ’s exceeded expectations :
Not only is its design a blow against " the tyranny of the bun , ” it ’s also the ultimate challenge to the rest of the fast - food industry to step up its game .
KFC has seen your impotent Triple Whoppers and raised you bacon and cheese wrapped in two slices of fried chicken ; put up or fold .
And such escalation is a critical step toward engendering a citizenry so docile and addled with saturated fats that it has no choice but to accept whatever health care plan will cover their rapidly corroding insides .
So , like history ’s best indoctrination campaigns , it ’s both patriotic and subtly fascistic , and you wo n’t even see it coming because it ’s all so fucking tasty .
It ’s a double - decker ideology burger shoved right down your guileless gullet - hole ; we ’ll have this country clutching their stomachs and begging for socialized medicine in no time .
Officials said the blast was caused by an air pump
A German man has blown up his flat while trying to mend an inflatable mattress , local fire officials say .
The man from the western city of Dusseldorf used car tyre solvent to repair a hole and left it overnight .
But when he tried to inflate the mattress the next day , it was ignited by a spark from an electric air pump .
The explosion blasted the sitting room wall into a stairwell and blew out windows .
Both the man , 45 , and his daughter , three , suffered burns .
The fire brigade evacuated two buildings and sealed off a street while they checked for structural damage .
" The apartment looked devastated , " Spiegel Online quoted a fire brigade spokesman as saying .
The paper said the cost of the damage was estimated at 20,000 euros ( £ 17,200 ) , and that the man would be put under investigation for causing an explosion through negligence .

Peter Hitchens has -- finally ! -- responded to my challenge to rebut or even refute my piece on BBC bias in this week 's magazine .
Hitchens ( dare I drop the " Mr " , or will that be construed as the ultimate manifestation of anti-conservative , bleedin ' liberal behaviour by the Mail on Sunday 's star columnist ? ) begins his denunciation of me in an " unusual " manner :
Today 's posting is slightly unusual in that it is a response to a challenge on another weblog .
We do not provide links here , for legal reasons , but I can tell you that this challenge , entitled " Is the BBC biased ? " , can easily be found by googling " Mehdi Hasan " , " New Statesman " and " Peter Hitchens " .
You do n't provide links ?
Come on !
At least have the courtesy of linking to my work before you try to trash it .
What kind of blog has no links ?
Then again , what kind of blog , aside from perhaps President Ahmadinejad's , is more than 2,000 words long ?
It stems from articles by me and by Mr Hasan which appear in the current issue of the New Statesman .
I argue that the BBC is hopelessly morally , socially and culturally biased against conservative ideas , so much so that it does n't even understand that it is biased , or how it is biased .
Mr Hasan argues , hilariously , that the BBC is biased to " the right " .
Links to these articles are provided in Mr Hasan 's posting .
After an unsatisfactory private correspondence about our disagreements , which will stay private , we agreed instead to debate the matter in public .
Here beginneth my first riposte .
Is it really " hilarious " to simply point out , as I did , that leading figures at the BBC have links to the Tory party and that a supposedly " left - wing " organisation covers the British monarchy with deference , and to excess ?
Hitchens refers to the BBC as being " morally , socially and culturally biased against conservative ideas " .
Interestingly , he omits the crucial adjectives " economically " and " politically " .
He may not believe that the BBC is biased in a party - political sense , but the fact is that countless Conservative Party politicians , as well as innumerable Tory - supporting journalists and bloggers , do .
I was addressing my piece to them , too -- not simply him .
But I am glad Hitchens agrees with me that the BBC is not biased in favour of Labour or against the Tories .
On economics , and the BBC 's appointment of the Torygraph free - marketeer Jeff Randall to the prestigious post of business editor , Hitchens has little or nothing to say .
Then again , the Hitchens brothers have always tended to avoid economics .
Why is Mehdi Hasan so confident that his assertion that the BBC is in fact " a right - wing and conservative institution " cannot be effectively rebutted ?
I 'm a confident chap .
I can't help it .
Then again , you 're not exactly a shrinking violet , are you , Peter ?
Before I begin I should state that ( as he knows ) my main complaint against his original article is its ludicrous claim that I believe I am " ignored " by the BBC .
I do not think this , which is why I have n't said it .
The article which I wrote ( at his request ) and which he presumably read before publishing it ( and before publishing his own contribution ) , makes it clear that I have no such belief .
Much of it , in fact , dwells on the way in which the BBC approaches me when it asks me to appear on TV and radio programmes , something the BBC could n't do if it were ignoring me .
I would be grateful if Mr Hasan would have the grace to admit that he was mistaken , and to withdraw the claim .
It makes his argument look silly , and gets in the way of proper debate .
Here is what I said : " Then there is the claim from small - c conservatives such as Peter Hitchens and Melanie Phillips that they are ignored by the BBC .
Is this the same Hitchens who is a frequent guest on BBC1's Question Time ( according to the screen and cinema database IMDB , he has appeared on the show every year since 2000 , and twice in 2007 ) ?
And the same Phillips who is a regular panellist on BBC Radio 4's Moral Maze ? "
If Hitchens thinks he is not " ignored " by the BBC , then I am happy to withdraw the offending remark .
I am told , however , by an impeccable source , that Hitchens has often complained in private that he is not invited on the BBC as regularly as he would like .
In his own NS piece , he refers to the BBC's " near - horror of the conservative person " , its failure " to pay any attention to what they say " and how , during the Iraq war , " invitations to take part in radio and TV discussions shrivelled to nothing " .
Sounds to me like he thinks he -- and conservatives in general -- are " ignored " , but if he says that is not his view , then who am I to disagree ?
( On a side note , Melanie Phillips , whom I also refer to in the aforementioned paragraph , has claimed that her own regular appearances amount to " little more than tokenism " ) .
I suspect that his assurance stems mainly from his almost complete misunderstanding of conservatism .
He shares this problem -- of blank , clueless incomprehension of his opponent -- with the BBC itself .
The Corporation has not felt the need to take conservatism seriously for many years , for reasons I 'll set out shortly .
The same is true of many of the other institutions of modern Britain , where the Left 's long march , begun in the 1960s , is now complete .
The result of this is that people whose assumptions are " progressive " ( their own terminology ) occupy all positions of decisive authority , and never meet or need to justify themselves to anyone who disagrees with them , whom they do not also despise .
In fact , they generally despise anyone who disagrees with them , believing for example that a person who supports capital punishment for murderers is beyond the pale of civilisation .
I had never realized how conspiratorial Hitchens is .
" The Left 's long march . . . is now complete " ?
Progressives " occupy all positions of decisive authority " ?
Where ?
In the City of London perhaps , Peter ?
How about the head of state ?
Is she a lefty ?
And , during that " long march " , why did the left 's vehicles for elected representation take such repeated drubbings at the polls ?
As usual , Hitchens offers no evidence at all for his sweeping statements , referring in passing only to the liberal distaste for capital punishment .
At the same time many millions of BBC licence fee payers do not share these new opinions , and hold largely to the old , dethroned ones .
Is the purpose of the BBC to serve them , and to reflect their views , or , by exclusion , derision , obscenity , foul language and triumphalist propaganda , bring them round to its own opinion ?
If the second , surely that is bias ?
Millions of BBC licence fee payers are on the left ; millions are on the right .
To be fair to the Beeb , the corporation will never satisfy them all .
I 'm not sure what his point here actually is .
There are large arguments to be had about how and why this came about .
I 've tried to address them in my book The Abolition of Britain and more recently in another book , The Broken Compass , so wo n't dwell on them here .
But I think it would be very hard for anyone to argue that it had n't happened .
The occupiers of significant positions , whether they be cabinet ministers , MPs , bishops , Anglican vicars , Catholic priests , permanent secretaries , professors , head teachers , ordinary teachers , judges , editors , producers of TV and radio programmes , heads of broadcasting and media organisations , newspaper and TV reporters , businessmen , publishers , historians , novelists , artists , actors or police officers , now hold social , moral , cultural views wholly different from , and often opposite to , those their forerunners of 40 or 50 years ago would have held .
There are exceptions , but they are rare and much remarked upon .
I am not arguing here about whether this is good or bad ( not that my view is any secret ) , just stating it as an indisputable fact .
Here once again we have the conspiratorial mindset ( " occupiers of significant positions " ) and once again the narrow focus on " social , moral and cultural views " without any reference to political or economic views .
At no stage , for example , does Hitchens address the point that BBC journalists have little or no sympathy for socialist economic policies such as nationalisation or higher taxation .
The view which has been dethroned in this process is conservatism .
This can be summed up as a pessimistic view of humanity and society based on a Christian belief in the imperfectibility of man , demanding the exercise of individual conscience , strong self - restraint , deference to established authority , sexual continence and constancy , patience , respect for age , for hierarchy and for institutions , patriotism and monarchy -- generally combined with a strong predisposition in favour of hard work and thrift and a horror of idleness and debt .
These views were once held widely by voters on both sides of the political divide .
The modern person may recognise all these things under the other names which progressives give to them : " repression , religious bigotry , snobbery , sexism , chauvinism , xenophobia , suburban and / or ' Victorian ' values " etc .
Call them what you like , but do n't imagine that your choice of name does n't betoken an opinion on an important issue .
They once were dominant and are now despised and rejected .
And the BBC is entirely on one side in this conflict , and cannot conceive that any good person could take the other view .
Here is one point on which I agree with Hitchens .
Conservatism , in its traditional , social and moral sense , based on pessimism and imperfection , has been " dethroned " .
But , and here is where we disagree , not by the BBC or by the Guardian or by liberals or progressives or Tony Blair but by other conservatives .
Hitchens seems to think that his view of conservatism is the only view of conservatism , and therefore any critique of the BBC 's conservative bias which does not revolve around his narrow , dated definition of conservatism is , by definition , invalid .
Mr Hasan seems to think that I have personally invented the conservatism I espouse , and it is a quirky , random collection of views which appear contradictory to him .
Let me assure him that I am simply the inheritor and continuer of a tradition much older than I , which is only proper for a conservative .
Mr Hasan also , for some reason inaccessible to me , thinks the Conservative Party embodies conservatism , thinks that conservatism consists of support for free markets , or for the Iraq war , or a general liking for the United States .
In fact some of these positions are those of classical liberalism , while others are those of " Neo-Conservatism " , a tendency more attractive to disappointed Marxists , in search of a new Utopia , and to ultra-liberal globalists , than to conservatives .
Many , if not all , neoconservatives are cultural and moral and social radicals , and economic ultra-liberals .
Some of these positions are common to both these views .
None of them is conservative .
No , Peter , you have not " personally invented " it ; but you are a lonely adherent of it .
Other conservatives do , by and large , define their conservatism in free - market terms , or even in neoconservative terms .
I do not agree with the neocons and , like you , I think they have hijacked the conservative movement but , unlike you , I do n't automatically place them morally or intellectually outside of it .
To claim , for example , that George W Bush is not a conservative is " ludicrous " , if not " hilarious " ( to use your words ) .
He is also , I think , confused by the fact that the BBC , which was generally sympathetic to the Blair government because of its cultural leftism , could never really cope with that government 's globalist decision to go to war in Iraq .
Sentimental Leftists , whose politics are really a series of displaced religious opinions , often misunderstand , and lag behind , the vanguard of their cause .
Only the sharper and smarter ones , the " hard liberals " , recognise that their aims may be served by bombing a few cities .
The Tory party had a parallel problem .
Having sold Britain to the EU and being secretly ashamed of it , it now strives to look ultra-patriotic on every possible occasion by banging the drum for war and supporting " our boys " , though it overcame this when we surrendered to the IRA in Northern Ireland , the last actual national conflict in which our armed forces were deployed in British , rather than globalist interests .
The neoconservative liberals , whose reasons for backing these wars are entirely different , thus have an easier time with their backbenchers than do Labour .
Sentimental Tory MPs back wars they should oppose .
Sentimental Labour MPs oppose wars they ought to support .
Again , he acts as if my original piece was for his eyes only .
It was n't .
I was addressing the arguments of people like Melanie Phillips and Michael Gove , who claim the BBC was anti-war over Iraq .
It was n't .
And , unlike Hitchens , my arguments are based on facts and figures : " The non-partisan , Bonn - based research institute Media Tenor found that the BBC gave just 2 per cent of its Iraq coverage to anti-war voices .
Another study by Cardiff University concluded that the BBC had ' displayed the most pro-war agenda of any [ British ] broadcaster ' . "
As for the Tory party , the BBC is biased against it only when it shows signs of being conservative .
Such moments are increasingly rare .
I am not now arguing , and never have sought to argue , that the BBC is biased against the Conservative Party .
On the contrary , I state in my article for the NS that the BBC has now completely converted the Conservative Party to its own world - view , and has rewarded it with sympathetic and generous coverage .
This is one of the most important political developments of our time , which is why most political journalists , incurious , sheep - like and conformist , have not even noticed it .
The BBC has " completely converted the Conservative Party to its own world - view " ?
How ?
Did Jeremy Paxman cast a spell on David Cameron ?
Once again , Hitchens displays his absurdly simplistic and conspiratorial mindset .
The BBC is not a deliberately or consciously wicked body .
It does what it does because it believes fervently ( like so many harmful people and organisations ) that it is doing good .
Many of its decision - makers feel a genuine urge to be fair .
But they do not know how to do it .
Thanks to the successful Gramscian " war of position " , described above , they are almost physically repulsed by the opinions and attitudes of people such as me , and also of the Thatcherite liberals described above .
They would never have such people in their own homes , around their own tables .
Yet they feel they must have us in their studios .
Hold on !
Here he says the BBC is " physically repulsed " not simply by him and his authentically conservative views , but by " Thatcherite liberals " , too , thereby contradicting his own earlier and narrower argument that Thatcherite liberals ( for example , Andrew Neil and Michael Portillo ) were welcome on the Beeb because they were n't true conservatives .
Hitchens seems confused .
In fact , in a cover story about the BBC for the Spectator in 2003 , he wrote : " Like the Church of England and the civil service , it is a conservative organisation largely staffed by liberal people . "
Yes , Peter , it is a " conservative organisation " .
I 'm glad we at least agree on that .
This is to their credit .
It is hard .
I sympathise .
They are too busy shuddering to distinguish between us , hence the blunders described in my New Statesman article .
Yet they swallow hard , adopt fixed smiles and try to invite us on , if only to prove to themselves that they are just .
Of course there are many different degrees of being " invited on " .
There are the " balanced " debate programmes where the occasional conservative can be fitted in , permitted to speak but obviously not in any way endorsed by the Corporation .
There are also brief discussions on Radio 4 current affairs programmes .
But these are concessions , not the real thing .
This is paranoia , pure and simple .
" Fixed smiles " ?
" Swallow hard " ?
" Not the real thing " ?
How , I wonder , does Hitchens distinguish between his own experiences and those of his doctrinaire left - wing counterparts , such as Tariq Ali and John Pilger ?
Are they feted or " endorsed " by the BBC ?
Do they even appear as regularly as he does ?
I think not .
The real things are the major behind - the - scenes executive positions which give direction to editorial policy and to the appointment of key presenters ' chairs , decisive jobs such as that of political editor , influential slots such as Newsnight anchor .
Newsnight anchor ?
You mean like Gavin Esler , who may not be a social conservative but certainly is n't a left - wing Marxist entryist either . . .
In a few cases , notable mainly for their rarity , presenters ' chairs or regular panel slots go to people who are not full members of the new post - 1968 consensus .
Andrew Neil is a highly skilled and competent broadcaster and a journalist of great experience .
He is , it is true , allowed to present a few programmes .
These may be much watched by enthusiasts , but I do not think we could really call them " prime - time " or even " mainstream " .
Ask yourselves this .
Can you conceive of Andrew Neil being appointed as a main presenter of Newsnight , or of the Today programme ?
If not , why not ?
( I should point out here that I doubt if Mr Neil agrees with me on many major subjects , and I do not regard him as a conservative ) .
I think it rather touching that Mr Hasan believes Mr Portillo is a conservative .
It was in 1999 , I think , that I put myself forward for the Tory nomination in Kensington and Chelsea , purely so as to make the point that Mr Portillo is not a conservative .
Is he really Diane Abbott 's opponent when they sit together on that sofa ?
Neil was , of course , considered for the Newsnight vacancy .
Portillo spent much of his column in this weekend 's Sunday Times railing against " idle " benefit claimants and citing approvingly the work of Professor Charles Murray of Bell Curve infamy .
If he is not on the right , I am not sure who is .
Then there 's the Nick Robinson argument .
Mr Robinson must speak for himself , but I would make one point about comparisons between him and Andrew Marr.
Mehdi dwells on Mr Robinson 's student Toryism , a documented fact .
But Mr Robinson had , for many years before he became BBC political editor , pursued a BBC career during which he was not able to express a political opinion , even had he wished to .
We do not actually know what his current or recent political opinions are .
So we can not really claim to have any recent information on this .
Good point .
But my argument about Robinson was not that he is a secret Tory partisan using his nightly broadcasts to help bring down the Labour government .
It was simply that he had been the chair of the Young Conservatives during the Thatcher era and yet nobody really made a fuss when he was appointed BBC political editor .
Could you , I asked , imagine the reaction from the Mail , Telegraph et al were the BBC to appoint a political editor who had been chair of Labour Students during its militant days ?
Andrew Marr , a short time before his appointment , was an opinionated writer for the Daily Express ( in its Rosie Boycott manifestation ) and in other places .
I think it fair to say that the opinions he stated were not generally conservative ones .
I do n't think this is a parallel with Mr Robinson 's appointment .
Again , a question .
Could a conservative columnist on a national daily , whose current views were well - known , with the equivalent experience of Andrew Marr , have been appointed to the job ?
If not , why not ?
Short answer : yes .
The issue is confused by the fact that the political opinions of the leaderships of the two main parties are now so similar ( see the recent statements by Michael Gove ) that a declared Tory ( not conservative ) and a declared New Labour supporter would find little to criticise about the policies of the party he supposedly opposes .
In fact , much of the left - wing media Establishment are now entirely reconciled to the arrival of a Cameron government , because they rightly believe the Blairite project is safe in Mr Cameron 's hands .
Good point , but irrelevant to my overall argument regarding the BBC .
My own view has long been that BBC presenters and commentators should declare their political sympathies , instead of pretending absurdly that they have none , that the BBC could achieve a true balance by ensuring that it recruited from among conservative as well as among left - liberal journalists , and that programmes should be presented in an adversarial fashion , ensuring ( for example ) that no politician should be interviewed by a supporter of his party .
This is a rather silly idea which would : a ) result in a horrifically partisan and superficial Hannity - and - Colmes - style approach to news and politics , as pioneered by Rupert Murdoch 's Fox News across the pond , and b ) would do nothing to correct the behind - the - scenes bias which Hitchens himself highlights earlier in his blog : " The real things are the major behind - the - scenes executive positions which give direction to editorial policy . . . "
If this does n't happen , then I think the BBC will eventually lose the necessary consensus of support , politically required for the continuation of the licence fee .
I should regret that .
I am a friend of the BBC as an institution .
I do not think its disappearance would be a good thing .
Here , I wholeheartedly agree with him .
The BBC is a national treasure -- despite being the " conservative organisation " that Hitchens himself once conceded it is .
Does Religion Ever Retard Moral Growth ?
Lately , Iâ€™ve been wondering whether some religions â€ ” some forms of Christianity in particular â€ ” retard peopleâ€™s moral growth .
Of course , it would be ironic if it turned out Christianity retarded peopleâ€™s moral growth since many Christians seem to believe they have a monopoly on morals .
But nonsense like that one aside , Iâ€™ve been wondering if some religions donâ€™t for the most part do exactly the opposite of what they boast of doing .
That is , instead of promoting our moral growth , they actually discourage it .
I have a little story that might illustrate the point .
Some long time ago when I was attending university , I had a three or four male friends from the Middle East .
Nothing in their own countries had prepared them for the sight of â€œhalf - nakedâ€  American women .
My friends would ask me how I and other American males managed to contain ourselves with so many of our American women walking around â€œhalf - nakedâ€ .
I was sympathetic to their problem .
It seemed to me the ordeal they were describing was something I myself had gone through .
But not , like them , at 19 and 20 .
Instead , I had gone through much the same thing at puberty â€ ” that time in the life of males when everything female turns electric .
Yet , there was a difference between myself and my friends .
I had gone through puberty in a culture that told me girls have a right to go around â€œhalf - nakedâ€ , and that , if there was a problem with it , it was my problem .
My culture forced me to psychologically adapt to the sight of female thighs and cleavage .
And , before I was 19 , I was reasonably well adapted .
My friends , though , had lived until the ripe old ages of 19 and 20 in a culture that said the female was to fault for the maleâ€™s arousal .
They â€œknewâ€ they felt flustered because a beautiful girl was showing her legs â€ ” not because they couldnâ€™t psychologically handle seeing a beautiful girlâ€™s legs .
As a consequence , my friends tended to think American women were callous and uncaring , even heartless , towards American men .
It seemed to me back then the Middle Eastern culture of my friends was less demanding than my own American culture .
While I had to learn to deal with the sight of female thighs and cleavage at puberty , they were never required to deal with the sight .
They could â€ ” at least in theory â€ ” go their entire lives dumping the burden of their feelings on their womenfolk , rather than handling their feelings themselves .
I thought their culture gave them an out , an escape from personal responsibility and moral growth .
Today , I wonder whether some religions â€ ” especially some forms of Christianity â€ ” donâ€™t do much the same thing .
Arenâ€™t there ways in which Evangelical Christianity in particular gives its adherents an out , an escape from personal responsibility and moral growth ?
For one thing , it seems Evangelical Christianity has a tendency to dump the responsibility for male sexual feelings on females in much the same manner my Middle Eastern friends had been taught to dump the responsibility for their sexual feelings on females .
A couple years ago , I wrote about a Christian youth site that conducted an informal survey , the premise of which was , â€ œShould women and girls dress modestly to help their brothers in Christ avoid lusting for them ?â€ 
So far as I can see , the very notion that women and girls should dress modestly to help men and boys avoid lusting for them is a recipe for retarding the moral growth of men and boys .
Not all religions , however , pander to the lusts of men and boys as sometimes does the Evangelical religion :
This recalls to me the story of two Zen monks who were travelling when they came to a swollen stream .
Standing in the road beside the stream , wondering how she might cross , was a beautiful young woman .
Without hesitation , the older monk picked up the woman and carried her across the stream .
She thanked him and went on her separate way .
The two monks then travelled on together for several hours , until the younger monk , deeply troubled , could no longer remain silent .
â€ œBrother , arenâ€™t we forbidden to have any physical contact with women ? â€ , he asked .
Replied the older monk , â€ œI put her down several hours ago , but you are still carrying her.â€ 
Learning to deal with your sexual feelings so they neither burden you nor those around you is one of the most moral things you can do .
Surely any religion that makes a claim to lead in moral issues must do more than assign the burden of your sexual feelings to someone else .
There seem to be other ways in which some religions might retard the moral growth of their adherents .
But at this point , Iâ€™ve written nearly a thousand words on the subject and most of you are probably asleep .
So , I will save a few ideas for a later post .
The terrible magic of setuptools
Date : 15 July 2009 Tags : computing , python
I am providing a bit of assistance to the wonderful Natural Language Toolkit Project , who have implemented a wide array of language processing algorithms in Python atop a common set of very sleek — and cleanly Pythonic — data structures for representing natural language .
If you are at all interested , check out their recent book , Natural Language Processing with Python , which does a great job of showing how the NLTK works at the same time as it explains the computer science concepts of language processing .
The NTLK project wants to support installing their package as a Python egg , so they asked me to tidy up their setup.py file and prepare everything for distribution via the Python Package Index .
As usual , my desire for simple and reproducible behavior when distributing Python packages has run aground on the tangled magic for which setuptools is so justly famous .
The NLTK package 's original setup.py , powered by the standard distutils , produced a tidy source tar.gz of around 850 KB .
My fancy egg - capable version , on the other hand , wound up disgorging a source archive of no less than 24.7 MB in size .
The NLTK people added a note to our open issue that politely asked me why their source distribution was now thirty times its original size without the package 's MANIFEST .
in file having been changed in the least .
I recognized the problem immediately , of course , as will many of you who have transitioned a project from the distutils to setuptools before .
In order to make our lives so vastly grand and convenient , setuptools includes in a source distribution not only all of the files described in the package 's manifest , but also every file in the area that is currently checked into Subversion !
This introduces a thicket of potential problems : a project started without version control will suddenly behave differently when checked into Subversion ; files disappear from the source distribution if you upgrade from Subversion to a version control system of which setuptools is ignorant ; and , of course , any attempt to build your project from a clean svn export can result in a source archive with hundreds of files missing .
Since the NLTK has been distributed successfully for years using only distutils and a well - written project manifest , I simply wanted to turn off the magic .
It would be possible , I suppose , to instruct packagers to run svn export before running the sdist command , but it offends good sense that you should have to check out a project in some special way just to get predictable behavior .
The whole point of version control is that it 's supposed to be meta - data that keeps up with history while having no effect on how an application builds and runs .
Having been bitten by this setuptools feature several times in the past , I decided that , this time , I would actually learn how to disable the behavior instead of trying to work around it yet again .
“ Where , ” I thought , “ is the switch ?
Where is the option ? ”
After an exhausting search of the setuptools documentation and then , finally , its source code , I am perplexed to report that the only recourse left to us seems to be violence !
You must actually damage setuptools before running the setup ( ) function if you want to prevent it from trying to muck about with Subversion .
The cleanest attack on the problem — or should we say the “ cleanest surgery ? ” — seems to be :
# Add this to setup.py before you call setup ( ) from setuptools .
command import sdist del sdist .
finders [ :]
With this change , setuptools peacefully ignores whether the project happens to have been checked out of version control or not , and with a bit of tweaking the same source distribution can be produced as would have been generated by the distutils .
Now , at this point , you probably think that this blog post is shaping up to be a complaint against how setuptools pays attention to Subversion while providing no way to turn this intrusive feature off .
But , in fact , that is all really just a side issue : it was a minor adventure that I wanted to share on the way toward my main point .
I am not even sure whether the remedy suggested above is a good idea ; I have asked the question on Stack Overflow , so we can see if someone else figures out a better approach .
The actual complaint of this blog post is that setuptools displays a troublesome , undocumented , and downright obfuscatory hysteresis with respect to the list of files that gets included in a source package .
The fact is , after I discovered the sdist .
finders trick quoted above , I actually thought it did n't work because the next source archive I created was exactly the same size as before .
The problem ?
It turns out that setuptools will choose to keep including a given file in your source archive , even if you have removed it from your manifest , until you force setuptools to rebuild the package 's file list by destroying its SOURCES .
txt file :
$ python setup .
py sdist $ wc - c dist / nltk - 2.0 b4 . tar .
gz 25648109 $ rm nltk .
egg - info / SOURCES . txt $ python setup .
py sdist $ wc - c dist / nltk - 2.0 b4 . tar .
gz 868517
Only with this removal will files that are no longer listed in the manifest , or governed by version control , quietly and finally drop out of the source archives you are creating .
That is my complaint : that setuptools refuses to remove files from your source distribution unless you know to go remove a magic file from under its nose .
As I now go to close out that NLTK ticket , should I explain that packagers always need to manually remove SOURCES .
txt before preparing an official source distribution for upload to the Python Package Index ?
Or should I be brave and add an os.remove ( ) call to setup.py myself that always destroys the file before the setup ( ) call gets underway ?
Is there any danger to that approach ?

Although many space strategy gamers are already familiarized with the term “ 4 x ” I decided to create an article in order to help introduce the concept for the so many that do n’t know yet what it stands for and also to clarify a bit the concept for the so many also that think they know what it stands for but are not completely sure about it ( before I wrote the article I was included in this last bunch :) ) – but it gets confusing sometimes , well , keep reading ) .
In the gaming world “ 4X ” stands for : “ eXplore , eXpand , eXploit and eXterminate ” .
The ‘ 4X ’ concept is well covered in the wikipedia here .
Essentially the games that are catalogued as ‘ 4X ’ must , at least , possess the following characteristics ( or provide the following phases ) :
“ eXplore ” : means is the early phase of the game where the players scout across a map to reveal the surrounding territories .
“ eXpand ” : stands for the phase where the player already knows the surrounding territory enough and is ready to start claiming that new territory by creating settlements , outposts or simply by increasing its influence over that territory like for example by increasing its population , by increasing trade range or map reach .
“ eXploit ” :
In this phase the player is ready to start gathering resources from the areas under his control .
The idea is to be as quick and efficient as possible to control these resources since they normally are limited and as more you have less your enemies will have left .
“ eXterminate ” :
When the territory is almost but claimed and the available resources controlled , the only way to expand is … to get more terrain and more resources and normally this means the need to make war with an opponent in order to subdue him ( by turning it into a protectorate or vassal ) or to destroy him completely .
Sounds familiar ?
Other fundamental characteristics of a ‘ 4X ’ game
Catherine the Great
The player usually plays the role of a Ruler of some sort normally with absolute power , like a King , Emperor or a Bureaucrat .
This ruler stands by a race , country , species , civilization or some nation and his objective is to grow and develop it .
The society normally has a humble beginning and part of the excitement of ‘ 4X ’ games is to be able to transform this humble beginning in an ultimate power , where the level of knowledge , technology and expansion becomes so great that the player finally achieves victory .
Victory may come through many ways :
By complete annihilation of all opponents ; by diplomatic achievement via peaceful agreements with all opponents ( through alliances with all other players subdued to a single alliance ) ; by some degree of domination ( like 2/ 3 of a galaxy , map , and planet , whatever the scope , is conquered ) .
Other means to victory may include special achievements like “ building the spaceship ” in Civilization , or to unlock ultimate technologies ( in Galactic Civilizations II ) or being elected supreme leader by the majority of the other players due to a very powerful influence .
Tech Research in GalCivII
Research and technology are key concepts in 4X games .
Deeply intertwined with the player ’s hope to succeed is its unavoidable need to evolve , and normally this means the need to acquire more knowledge and more technology .
By allocating resources to research the player can unlock new technologies which will translate in more comfort for its citizens , more resource management efficiency , more speed , more shields , more weapons , units , etc .
Diplomacy is another key aspect of ‘ 4X ’ games .
By the time the player is well advanced in its ‘ eXpansion ’ it will unavoidably bump into a neighbor and after a while into some more neighbors .
The ability to make diplomacy with adjacent factions may determine the player ’s race future .
By “ playing the cards right ” the player may gain access to more resources by peaceful means which normally is much less expensive .
Diplomatic relations like non-aggression pacts , trade , economic or research pacts can normally be established to achieve this .
Alternatively the player may decide it ’s more profitable to forge alliances with other players and go to war with others to exploit and exterminate them in order to secure their resources and their territory .
Sins of a Solar Empire Battle
Combat is also an important aspect of ‘ 4X ’ games for where it is in combat that normally all is decided .
The ability for the player to win battles may decide wars and the survival of the society all together .
To be able to wage well in war the player must do well in many areas .
Must have a strong economy to support its units , must keep up in technologies not to become obsolete and it needs not only to be an effective attacker but it also needs to be able to defend its settlements well from other aggressive players .
Battles can be decided automatically ( like in Galactic Civilizations ) or be highly tactical that require more strategic decision from the player ( like in Master of Orion that puts the player in full command of all units ) .
What is ‘ 4X ’ and what ’s not
Although almost ‘ 4X ’ games are of the space strategy kind ( like Master of Orion , Space Empires , Imperium Galactica , Galactic Civilizations , and so many others ) , there are other non-space strategy games that , debatably , are considered ‘ 4X ’ .
Some of these games are Sid Meier ’s Civilization series – undeniably ‘ 4X ’ , the Colonization series , Age of Empires , Starcraft , Command & Conquer or the TotalWar Series ( among others ) .
These last four are examples of games that are debatably ‘ 4X ’ .
Some players think they should be considered ‘ 4X ’ because they provide the 4 stages , others tend to criticize that they miss other key aspects ( like the ones I introduced before ) which leads them to “ weak ” ‘ 4X ’ or definitely ‘ non - 4X ’ .
You will find in many places some of these games catalogued as ‘ 4X ’ and in another places as non -‘ 4X ’ .
You will ultimately need to judge for yourself where to draw the line ( now you know why I said previously that it could get confusing :) )
‘ 4X ’ Games Lists
You can find good lists of ‘ 4X ’ games in moby games here and in a freeorion forum thread here .
One thing seems undeniable for ‘ 4X ’ ; being them real time or turn based in terms of gameplay , ‘ 4X ’ games are all of the strategy type .
And above all else almost all of them are space strategy games .

Yesterday , on his 48th birthday , Pres. Barack Obama announced the Green the Block campaign “ to ensure that low - income communities and communities of color have the resources and platforms needed to access the benefits and opportunities of the growing clean - energy economy . ”
Launched in partnership with Green For All and the Hip Hop Caucus , the nationwide campaign will rely on a coalition of organizations to educate and mobilize young people about how to take action on things like installing energy - efficient light bulbs in neighborhood homes , planting a community garden , and writing letters to local officials asking them to promote the use of more fuel efficient vehicles .
Green the Block is just one example of how youth culture — and in particular , hip hop culture — is transforming the way we advocate for sustainable cities and transportation .
And it ’s not just in the United States .
Take , for example , the events planned for the World Urban Forum in 2006 , where artists like Curtis Clearsky and other UN - HABITAT Messengers of Truth performed at the Global Hip - Hip Mainstage to inspire young people to change their cities for the better .
The United Nations recognized that “ Hip - Hop is more than a genre of music or dance .
It is a social movement . ”
It ’s about mainstreaming the idea of safer , cleaner and more accessible urban communities , and you can see it happening through what ’s commonly referred to as “ the five elements : ” emceeing , breakdancing , deejaying , beat boxing , and the art of graffiti .
Here ’s a few examples from around the world :
MASTER OF CEREMONIES
Obama , himself , is the quintessential emcee for America ’s youth , supporting the power of hip hop as a vehicle for change :
“ I love the art of hip hop ; I do n’t always love the message of hip hop .
The thing about hip hop today is that it ’s smart , it ’s insightful , the way that [ rappers ] can communicate a complex message in a very short space is remarkable .
A lot of these kids are not going to be reading The New York Times .
The question , then , is , what ’s the content ?
What ’s the message ?
Art ca n’t just be a rear view mirror ; it should also have a headlight out there pointing to where we need to go . ”
Barack “ B - Rock ” Obama meets with Ludacris .

His decision about “ where to go ” was made clear through the establishment of the White House Office of Urban Affairs , which proves his commitment to “ promote strong cities as the backbone of regional growth . ”
This summer , the Office kicked off a National Conversation on the Future of America ’s Cities and Metropolitan Areas , essentially convening a whole community of urban policy “ emcees ” who will be talking about “ ways in which Washington can be a partner and catalyst for community - based solutions , instead of a bureaucratic obstacle . ”
Another public figure who comes to mind as a hip - hop - inspired voice for a new generation of sustainable city advocates is Majora Carter , who wrote a $ 1.25 million federal transportation planning grant to conduct a feasibility study for the South Bronx Greenway .
As an African - American woman who grew up in the South Bronx , Carter understands that some people think cleaning and greening a city will “ kill ” hip hop because it takes away from the suffering , which often fuels the art form .
But , she said in an interview , “ if we have industry that employs people and communities — that are beautiful — then hip - hop can just flourish .
It will just be something new .
It will be happy hip - hop ! ”
Hence her motto : “ Green the Ghetto ! ” , which is also the title of her organization ’s blog , which recently posted this pic :

BUST A MOVE
In Johannesburg , South Africa , a group of young people hosted breakdancing performances in a local movement known as Underground Soccer ( UGS ) to spread an anti-litter awareness campaign to cleani up the city ’s central business district .
In the realm of active transportation ( i.e bicycling and walking ) , breakdancing is also visible in a new trend : back riding , skids , back circles , lift ups and wheelies … all sorts of insane tricks you can do on “ fixies , ” or fixed gear bicycles .
In San Francisco , “ scraper bikes ” — bicycles that are tricked - out with big wheels and outlandish colors — have developed a cult following of inner city kids .
Imagine if everyone thought bikes were that cool — sustainable transport would n’t just be for hipsters , skaters and bikers anymore .
Now if only rappers would get rid of their huge gas - guzzling cars , like Redman , who rode a 45 mpg smart fortwo in his “ Run My Block ” video .
YOPS , a Japanese skater / biker crew , created an instructional DVD about how to do tricks on a fixed gear bike .

THAT’S A RAP
People like J - Mull and C - Diddy , the duo behind Greenrapper.com , highlight positive solutions , like electric vehicles and biodiesel , through the power of busting rhymes .
John Romankiewicz and Shane Zhao of China ’s Green Beat make public transportation fun(ny ) with their entertaining and informative videos like “ Sun Zhe ’s Transport Adventures . ”
Even Jaime Lerner , who transformed the city of Curitiba , Brazil into a model of sustainable urbanism , lauds the value of creativity .
Check out his rap - inspired “ sustainable song ” at 14:13 in the TED video below … ” it ’s possible , it ’s possible , you can do it , you can do it , use less your car , make this transition , avoid carbon emission . ”
WRITING ON THE WALL
Whereas grafitti is usually seen as ugly vandalism , some places have learned to embrace it .
Inhabitat reports on “ reverse graffiti ” in the UK and Brazil , where street artists scrub out grime and soot from city walls to display positive messages like “ wash me ” or “ go gently . ”
And check out these eco-friendly “ moss graffiti ” murals that help to beautify a neighborhood .

Other artists take to old - fashioned pen and ink .
Los Angeles - based cartoonist and rapper Keith Knight portrays the perils and frustrations of his hometown ’s car culture and lack of adequate public transportation in his edgy “ underground comix ” style , showing that urban mobility is not just a topic for unimaginative transport planners to discuss in boring town hall meetings or technical reports .

Bing 's initial popularity among Internet searchers seems to be sticking past launch — at least it has so far .
Microsoft 's recently relaunched search engine has actually gained another percentage point in the market share wars this July , according to Web metrics firm StatCounter .
The firm noted that Bing was making " slow but steady " progress , and that Microsoft 's deal with Yahoo would likely only result in good things for Bing 's share of the search market .
StatCounter says that Bing climbed to 9.41 percent of the search market last month , compared to 8.23 percent in June .
Combined with Yahoo's current share of the market ( 10.95 percent ) , the two come out with 20.36 percent — still a distant second to Google 's 77.54 percent , but a relatively large slice of the pie nonetheless .
We are combining Yahoo's and Microsoft 's share , of course , because the two announced a deal last week that would make Bing the search engine for all of Yahoo 's sites .
In exchange for such prominent placement , Microsoft also gained a 10 - year license to Yahoo's core search technologies so that it can integrate whatever 's left of Yahoo 's search mojo into Bing .
( As pointed out by All Things Digital , Yahoo had 20 percent share all by itself a year ago , but has deflated to half of its former glory since then . )
Bing 's growth since its makeover from Live Search is nothing to scoff at , though .
Though the search engine 's share peaked at 9.21 percent during its first week , it settled down into the high 7s for a while before going back up to 8.45 percent during the last week of June .
The mere fact that the number has grown a full percentage point since then shows that users are really giving Bing a chance — much more than they did for Live Search , anyway — and the underlying trend is positive .
Google remains the king of search for the time being , but according to StatCounter 's numbers , its numbers are being slowly chipped away .
Google dropped from 78.48 percent in June to 77.54 percent in July , but it still owns more than three - quarters of the market ; a commanding lead to be sure .
Chipping away will be slow going , but Google can no longer take its search superiority for granted .

The Conficker worm is still infecting systems at a brisk rate and continues to snag computers in Fortune 1000 companies , according to security researchers .
The worm is infecting about 50,000 new PCs each day , according to researchers at Symantec , who reported Wednesday that the U.S. , Brazil and India have been hit the hardest ..
" Much of the media hype seems to have died down around Conficker / Downadup , but it is still out there spreading far and wide , " Symantec said in a blog post .
Conficker began spreading late last year , taking advantage of a recently patched flaw in Microsoft 's Windows operating system to infect entire networks and also using removable storage devices to hop from PC to PC .
Security experts say it has now infected millions of computers worldwide , which now comprise the world 's biggest botnet network .
" We can see that companies that spend literally millions of dollars on equipment and gear to prevent infections … these Fortune companies have had this infection and it's stayed in their networks for a long period of time , " said Rick Wesson , CEO of Support Intelligence and a member of the Conficker Working Group .
" It 's really hard and really expensive , and if the Fortune companies can't stop it , how can you expect small businesses to do it ? "
The Working Group has set up so - called sinkhole servers that can communicate with infected machines .
It has spotted infections within many Fortune 1000 companies , Wesson said .
" Everybody got hit , " he said .
" Even Microsoft still has infections . "
The worm got a lot of media attention in late March , and while the news stories have tapered off , the worm is n't going anywhere .
Some worried that an April 1 change in the way Conficker received updates could mark the beginning of a new round of Internet attacks , but in reality the Conficker network has been only lightly used , security experts say .
" It 's still a significant botnet .
It has n't done anything of significance , but it has not gone away , " said Andre DiMino , cofounder of The Shadowserver Foundation and a member of the Working Group .
" The remediations need to ramp up . "
" This thing is not dead , " he added .
" Everyone has kind of passed it over , but it 's not dead . "
SAN DIEGO --
It was the kind of late - inning buzz that none of the players had experienced before .
The Houston Astros -- who once had the " Killer Bs " -- beat the San Diego Padres 7 - 2 on Thursday , but only after waiting out a 52 - minute delay in the top of the ninth inning caused when a swarm of bees took over left field at Petco Park .
It certainly gave a new meaning to getaway day .
" It 's how this year 's going .
Bizarre things .
You think you 've seen it all in baseball and you 're going to see something new , " said Houston 's Geoff Blum , who hit a three - run homer and finished with four RBIs .
The drama began with Houston leading 6 - 1 with two outs in the top of the ninth .
San Diego's Kyle Blanks started walking in from left field , trying to get shortstop Everth Cabrera to call time .
It ended when a beekeeper obliterated a ball of bees that followed a queen bee under a ballgirl 's jacket that was slung over the back of a chair down the left - field line .
" I kind of saw one or two floating around my head , " Blanks said .
" Then I turned around and there was a wall .
I started to walk in and tried to get Everth to call time . "
Blanks said he was allergic to bees .
" It 's not something I want to tempt , " he said .
He wondered what would happen if Miguel Tejada pulled a ball down the line .
" It was a pretty thick wall of bees and I really did n't want a piece of it , " he said .
" The umpires made the right call to stop the game , " Padres president Tom Garfinkel said .
" There 's a couple thousand bees there .
If they decide to swarm on a person , whether that 's a player , an employee or obviously a fan , we could have a real situation . "
The game was halted at 3:09 p.m .
Five minutes later , both teams were cleared from the field .
The beekeeper arrived at 3:56 p.m. , quickly did his job to applause from the fans that remained , and the game resumed 5 minutes later .
The swarm first appeared along the warning track .
Later , fans were cleared out of several sections down the left - field line as the bees swarmed around the chair .
Head groundskeeper Luke Yoder thinks they were regular honey bees .
Groundskeepers thought about putting a trash can over the chair , but did n't want to take the chance in case they were Africanized honey bees .
" It looked harmless , but let me tell you there was a big ball of bees under that jacket , " Yoder said .
" Every one of those bees you saw in the outfield , every single one of them went underneath that jacket . "
Yoder said he 's seen similar swarms at the downtown ballpark , some the size of a soccer ball , but just not during games .
The bees arrived more than 24 hours before Manny Ramirez makes his comeback from a 50 - game suspension for violating baseball 's drug policy , when the Los Angeles Dodgers open a three - game series against San Diego on Friday night .
" Definitely a first time for me , " Houston manager Cecil Cooper said .
" I did n't know what happened initially .
I just saw the guy walking in .
I did n't know exactly what he was doing .
Then I started to see kind of the swarm after a while .
You do n't want to get anybody hurt .
That 's the main thing . "
The Astros outscored the Padres 20 - 7 in taking three of four .
It 's the first time the Astros ( 38 - 39 ) have been one game under .500 since they were 1 - 2 on April 8 .
San Diego has lost eight of nine games against Houston dating to last season .
Wandy Rodriguez ( 7 - 6 ) beat the Padres for the second time in as many starts this year , holding them to one run and seven hits in seven innings .
He struck out five and walked two .
Blum , a former Padres player , gave the Astros a 6 - 0 lead when he homered to right on a 2 - 1 pitch with one out in the fifth , his second .
Tejada opened the inning with a single and Lance Berkman -- one of the " Killer Bs " along with the now - retired Jeff Bagwell and Craig Biggio -- followed with a walk .
" It was a good series for us , " Cooper said .
" Everybody contributed for us .
For the first day in a long time , we got a big , big hit to kind of break things open . "
Blum also hit an RBI single in the first .
Berkman scored three runs , had two doubles , two walks and an RBI .
The Padres loaded the bases on a single and consecutive walks with none out in the third and the heart of the order coming up , and failed to score .
Adrian Gonzalez forced Kevin Correia at the plate and Kevin Kouzmanoff hit into a double play .
Correia ( 5 - 6 ) allowed six runs and eight hits in five innings .
He struck out three and walked three .
With ace Jake Peavy and Chris Young both on the disabled list , Correia had been San Diego 's most consistent starter .
He was 4 - 1 in his previous five starts , with a 2.41 ERA and 29 strikeouts .
Game notes
Astros starters have posted a 2.13 ERA in the last 12 games , going 6 - 1 with five no -decisions .
Billo responded to Maureen 's Op-ed with his talking points memo titled " Evil White Men "

Maureen continues
President Obama wants Sotomayor , naturally , to bring a fresh perspective to the court .
It was a disgrace that W. appointed two white men to a court stocked with white men .
And Sotomayor made it clear that she provides some spicy seasoning to a bench when she said in a speech : " I simply do not know exactly what the difference will be in my judging , but I accept there will be some based on gender and my Latina heritage . "
My wife has been following the hearings and she told told be the talk in her walk place is the spectacle of watching old southern white republican men terrified of being relegated to the background by not only a hispanic but a strong career woman who holds her own .
The repubs concern about Sotomayor is that she brings experience and background due to her ethnicity , but the six white men on the supreme court are perfectly normal and therefore do not bring any kind of specific background or prejudice .
There is a blatant form of racism at play here , suggesting that the white male experience is the real American one against which all other experiences are measured .
Sessions ' and Kyl 's line of questioning towards Sotomayor , make it clear that that background and experience is only suspect , or relevant , when it is different from the " White male experience "
As a white man , i say shame on this insecure nutjobs .

It ’s possible to combine jQuery UI elements with each other .
For example , you can create tabs that contain accordions .
And then you can make those tabs sortable .
Of course , your html has to fit the expected pattern .
Accordion HTML
The accordion html is generally a < div > with pairs of child elements .
The first element of the pair is the header and the second is the content .
I usually use heading elements like < h3 > for the headers because otherwise the accordions wo n’t stack nicely .
If you ’re not sure what I ’m talking about , try making an accordion using just < a > tags for the headers .
< div > < h3 > < a href= '#'>
Section1</a></h3 > < div><p>section 1 content</p></div> < h3 >< a href= '#'>
Section2</a></h3 > < div><p>section 2 content</p></div> < h3 >< a href= '#'>
Section3</a></h3 > < div><p>section 3 content</p></div> </div>
Tabs HTML
The tabs html is generally a < div > with a < ul > containg a < li > for each tab header , followed by one content < div > for each tab .
Each tab < li > should contain an < a > whose href refers to a content < div > .
< div > < ul > < li >< a href= '# tab1 '> Tab
1</a></li> < li >< a href= '# tab2 '> Tab
2</a></li> < li >< a href= '# tab3 '> Tab
3</a></li> </ul > < div id='tab1'> tab1 content</div > < div id='tab2'>tab2 content</div > < div id='tab3'> tab3 content</div > </div >
Sortable HTML
The sortable html is generally a simple list of elements .
< ul > < li > < a href= '#'>
Item 1</a></li > < li >< a href= '#'>
Item 2</a></li > < li >< a href= '#'>
Item 3</a></li> </ul >
Combining with jQuery UI
As you can see , the tabs html looks very similar to the sortable html , while the accordion html is quite different .
The result is that it ’s a bit tricky to create sortable accordions , but fairly easy to create sortable tabs .
You can also combine tabs with accordions , and below I demonstrate how to put accordions within sortable tabs .
For a working demo , checkout Sortable Tabs with Accordions .
As for the question of why anyone would want to do this , I ’ll leave that as an exercise for the reader 🙂

SATURDAY
’S helicopter - plane collision over the Hudson stems in part from the politicization of decisions about air safety and air traffic control , both of them the province of the Federal Aviation Administration .
When a crash occurs , members of Congress from the area are quick to point fingers and call for tougher regulations .
But few people realize how much Congress and aviation interest groups can be obstacles to improved air safety .
Private planes like those involved here are referred to as “ general ” aviation ( as opposed to commercial aviation — mostly airlines ) .
The general aviation trade associations have large memberships in every congressional district , and are very active in both lobbying and campaign donations .
So when these groups take a position on aviation issues , members of Congress on aviation subcommittees feel considerable grassroots pressure to make decisions that are GA - friendly .
One example is defining the airspace under which planes need n’t file flight plans or be directed by air traffic control .
That ’s the category of airspace over the Hudson River below 1,100 feet , where the collision occurred .
Everyone recognizes that airspace above and around major airports must be controlled , but GA groups resist any expansion of controlled airspace , which restricts their members ’ freedom to fly .
In turn , because the GA crowd has a lot of clout with Congress , the FAA ( which gets its budget from Congress ) must take that into account in any redesign of airspace .
Another example is the use of next - generation technology to keep track of where planes are , even outside of controlled airspace .
Today , all planes must carry transponders which , when interrogated by FAA radars , transmit the plane ’s ID number and altitude , which appears on the air traffic controller ’s display .
But radar only scans once every 5 to 12 seconds , and is n’t very effective where there is lots of ground clutter .
The FAA is beginning to implement new technology called ADS - B , which dispenses with radar for this purpose .
Instead , each plane equipped with ADS - B reports its position ( based on GPS ) every one to two seconds , giving the controller much faster and more accurate information .
And the more advanced version will put a display in every cockpit , showing the pilot where other air traffic is , in real time .
But here ’s where the politics of GA comes in .
Even in large - scale mass production , the ADS - B box that includes the traffic display will likely cost several tens of thousands of dollars .
GA groups , out to protect their members from increased costs , have fought hard to put off the deadline date for installing even the basic ( no - display ) version of ADS - B until 2020 .
And the FAA knows that imposing a more aggressive schedule would lead to intense GA lobbying of Congress , so it has so far gone along .
Besides the political problem , the FAA has a built - in conflict , because it has two distinctly different missions .
One is to be the aviation - safety regulator — deciding the rules of the airways , licensing pilots and mechanics , certifying new planes as safe to be manufactured , overseeing airline maintenance , etc .
In carrying out that role , it is quite properly at arm ’s length from the parties that it regulates .
But its second mission is running the air - traffic - control system , which includes decisions about implementing new technologies like ADS -B .
The ATC system is a 24 - hour - a - day , high - tech service business , trapped inside a government bureaucracy .
When it tries to make modernization decisions ( like replacing radar surveillance with ADS - B ) , it ca n’t simply consult with its customers and work out an implementation plan .
Instead , it must make every decision with one eye on Congress , knowing that some interest group will complain to the politicians that the decision hurts its members .
And when regulating the safety of air traffic control , the FAA is “ regulating ” itself .
Nearly all Western nations ( including Australia , Canada , the UK and almost all EU members ) have separated air - safety regulation from the ATC business , usually divesting ATC as a stand - alone , customer - supported enterprise .
That puts safety regulation at arm ’s length from ATC operations , while depoliticizing business decisions such as ATC modernization .
The Clinton administration tried to make the same reform here , but got shot down by GA and other interest groups .
Depoliticizing air - traffic control would be very positive for air safety .
It would speed the introduction and use of better technology like ADS - B , while freeing the FAA to focus on tougher safety regulation .
It ’s too late for the victims of Saturday ’s crash , but such changes could prevent many future collisions .

I ’ve been focusing a lot recently on the last episode of Season 5 , but now I want to switch gears for a bit and look back at the beginning of the season , which has its own intriguing mysteries , especially when seen now , in light of what we learned later on .
In a scene near the beginning of the season premiere , 5×01 Because You Left , Dr. Chang is underground in the Orchid Station , talking to a construction foreman .
The year is 1977 :
Foreman :
There ’s an open chamber about 20 meters in , behind the rock .
( Pointing to a sonar image that shows part of the donkey wheel )
There ’s something in there .
The only way to get to it is to lay charges here ( pointing ) and here .
Blast through — Dr. Chang : Under no circumstances .
This station is being built here because of its proximity to what we believe to be an almost limitless energy .
And that energy , once we can harness it correctly — it ’s going to allow us to manipulate time .
Foreman : Hah .
( Sarcastically )
Okay , so , what , we ’re going to go back and kill Hitler ?
Dr. Chang :
Do n’t be absurd .
There are rules .
Rules that ca n’t be broken .
Foreman :
So what do you want me to do ?
Dr. Chang :
You ’re gonna do nothing .
If you drill even one centimeter further and risk releasing that energy — if that were to happen ( looks at injured worker and shakes his head ) —
God help us all .
This raises a lot of questions .
How did Dr. Chang know about the special “ energy ” ?
Did he come to the Island because he knew that energy was there ?
And if so , was the whole Dharma Initiative a ruse , a cover for his real purpose of finding and harnessing the energy ?
Or did Chang discover the energy and its properties only after he arrived at the Island ?
If so , how ?
When Dr. Chang talks about “ rules ” that ca n’t be broken , he sounds a lot like Faraday , when Faraday explained the “ rules ” of time travel to the Losties , before he changed his mind .
Where did Dr. Chang get his ideas about the rules ?
Dr. Chang ’s line , “ God help us all , ” is so dramatic .
Then in the next episode , 5×02 The Lie , that line echoes with an eerie resonance when it is repeated by Eloise Hawking :
Eloise :
What you need is irrelevant .
Seventy hours is what you ’ve got .
Ben : Look , I lost Reyes tonight .
( Pause )
So what happens if I ca n’t get them all to come back ?
Eloise : Then God help us all .
( Crescendo .
End of episode . )
What exactly is Eloise Hawking afraid of , and is it the same thing that Dr. Chang was afraid of when he uttered the same phrase ?
Mutsugoto has been in development for about two years A couple living apart in Edinburgh and London are to try out new bedroom technology designed for people in long - distance relationships .
Moray - based Distance Lab believes Mutsugoto to be more intimate than e-mail messaging , phone , or text .
Using cameras , artificial lights and computers , the device allows couples to " draw " on each other in beams of light .
Following this weekend 's trial , the device is to be tested in cities in continental Europe .
Mutsugoto has been in development for about two years by the Forres - based company , and involves artist Tomoko Hayashi .
Couples wear touch - activated rings visible to a camera .
Their movements are tracked and translated into beams of light projected onto the bed or body of their partner .
Rather than be ' anywhere anytime ' , Mutsugoto is based in the more private and quiet space of the bedroom
Dr Stefan Agamanolis
Chief executive
It is be demonstrated at InSpace , which is among the venues for the Edinburgh Art Festival .
Dr Stefan Agamanolis , chief executive and research director at Distance Lab , said : " Statistics show that long distance relationships are more and more common .
" This project is a reaction to mobile phones , e-mail , chat programs and other common modes of communication that couples will often have trouble with because they are very impersonal , generic , and steal away any sense of intimacy or closeness they might feel .
" Mutsugoto is an opposite experience . "
He added : " Rather than be ' anywhere anytime ' , Mutsugoto is based in the more private and quiet space of the bedroom . "
The trials are to be completed by next month .
Fighting game One of Distance Lab's key areas of work is telehealth , technologies designed for patients or to help people stay healthy .
Mr Agamanolis said the research laboratory has three major telehealth projects ongoing .
Also in development at the site is an interactive fighting game in which people can throw themselves at a life - sized image of an opponent who could be on the other side of the world .
In the prototype , people battle a silhouette projected on to a mattress .

CHAMBLEE , Georgia ( CNN ) -- Janet McBride had to send someone to fetch lunch for her Saturday .
The cheerful auto dealer receptionist did n't dare leave her switchboard during the waning hours of the federal government 's " Cash for Clunkers " program .
Car shoppers browse a Honda showroom Saturday morning in Marietta , Georgia .
" Our phones have been ringing off the hook , " said a giddy Pete Richards , general manager of Ed Voyles Honda in Marietta , Georgia . " ...
It 's been great .
Phenomenal . "
McBride was compiling a list of customers for swamped salespeople to call back .
" I try to keep it under control , " McBride said .
" I think we need one of those number things -- ' Now serving Number 5 . ' "
As of 11 a.m. Saturday , the Honda dealership just north of Atlanta said it had made 108 clunker deals since the Car Allowance Rebate System program began on July 1 , and Richards expected to do plenty more before closing down Sunday night .
Watch what car buyers need to know »
" If I do n't do 30 of these today , I 'll be amazed , " he said .
A normal Saturday would produce about 12 sales , he said .
The program has generated so much traffic and new - car buzz that even non-qualifying and used car sales have jumped , Richards said .
" We 're having a ball .
I have n't worked a Saturday in probably two years .
But I woke up at 3 o'clock this morning .
Could n't wait to get here , " he said .
" It 's like Christmas ! " McBride added before her phone rang again .
It 's more like the letdown of late Christmas afternoon across town at Jim Ellis Chevrolet in Chamblee , Georgia , where General Manager Mark Frost just wants to be done with the headaches the clunkers program has caused .
" If President Obama came and sat behind a computer and saw how his program is being administered , he 's crack some heads , " Frost said .
" My impression is that he 's about excellence and execution , and there 's some dumbass [ at the Department of Transportation ] sitting there looking at this computer and rejecting deals that are perfectly good . "
The 12 Atlanta - area dealerships under the Jim Ellis name had made 350 clunker deals worth almost $ 1.5 million in reimbursements and received payment for none , Frost said .
Among those making deals was Mark Gallo , an Atlanta antiques dealer who traded in his eight - cylinder 1998 Chevy van for six - cylinder 2009 model .
He received a $ 4,500 allowance for his clunker , which he guessed was $ 1,500 more than he would have gotten otherwise .
The gas mileage still is n't great , " but it 's better than it was , " Gallo said .
" And I needed a van . "
He 'd been thinking about trading up for a while , but the end of the program prompted him to pull the trigger .
" I thought it was going to last a lot longer than it actually did , ... but I saw that it was ending on Monday and I said , ' Oh , damn ! Scramble ! ' "
Also scrambling to make a deal Saturday was Rick Wright of Woodstock , Georgia .
The ironworker has been working in Orlando , Florida .
But when his wife , bus driver Cindy Wright , traded in their 1998 Chevy Tahoe for an '09 Traverse , he needed to be there in person to show his driver 's license and sign over the title .
" I 'm working out of town at the present time , so she calls me up and says , ' Hey , they 're going to cut this off at 1 o'clock .
Do you want the car ? '
And I said , ' Let 's go for it , ' " said Rick Wright , who made the seven - hour drive in time to sign the deal around 10 a.m. Saturday .
" That was the only way we could get it done . "
While the government says the program continues through the end of business Sunday , Frost decreed that the last deal at the Jim Ellis dealerships had to be made by noon Saturday and the paperwork submitted by 1 p.m. in anticipation of continued problems with the CARS submission process .
" It 's the paperwork that 's the biggest pain in the neck , " said Jim Ellis salesman Neil Krieger , who sold Gallo his van .
Salespeople have been working long hours and making big commissions at both dealerships .
" It 's been good for me .
Oh yeah , " the Wrights ' salesman , who goes by the single name Kya , said .
It 's a matter of delayed gratification for the dealers , who will have to wait for the government to sort through the mountainous heap of applications , approve the deals and issue $ 3 billion in reimbursement .
" This could be devastating for dealers if they do n't get this going and do this right , " Frost said .
" A month from now , if all of our deals get paid , then Obama 's my hero , " he said .
" If , in a month from now , if we still have ... $ 200,000 that we 're not getting paid , it 's a disaster . "
Frost worries too much , Honda dealer Richards said .
" We 're going to get our money , " he said .
" We 're making sure the deals are straight .
If everybody 's got their documentation right , they 've got the buy of lifetime . "
Despite his concerns , Frost tried to remain optimistic in the program 's final hours .
After all , his dealership 's sales are up 30 percent from last year , he said .
" People are coming in , " he said not long after opening Saturday .
" I smell clunker . "

First off , I am not saying that I agree with that he is saying here , but I can certainly understand why he thinks what he does .
The Video :
Here ’s the quote that has a few on the right climbing the walls :
SCHULTZ ( Tuesday 11 August 2009 – 01:42 ) :
It ’s almost as if every one of these town hall meetings is turning into “ The Jerry Springer Show ” .
And there are many Americans right now who are starting to fear for the safety of the president of the United States .
All over health reform .
Folks , these people are psycho , that ’s what they are .
SCHULTZ ( 04:53 ) : Sometimes I think they want Obama to get shot .
I do !
I really think that there are conservative broadcasters in this country who would love to see Obama taken out .
They * fear * socialism , they fear Marxism .
They fear that the United States of America wo n’t be the United States of America anymore .
Of course , fellow right wingers are now having a absolute fit about this and of course , they are doing the whole faux outrage thing .
I realize that this is not going to do much for my credentials as a Conservative Blogger , but I must write the truth , instead of going along with the stupidity of the crowd .
No , I do not agree with the loose cannon idiot on the thought that anyone on the right wants Obama dead .
I am not quite that stupid ; but I can see why Ed thinks the way that he does .
Why ?
Oh , well , because there was some idiot holding up sign saying “ Death to Obama and his kids ” and because some idiot today got into a stand off with the police out on L.A. after making threats toward the President .
Now the one hundred dollar question is this ; is right wing radio fueling this sort of stupidity ?
I personally do not know .
I do not make a habit of listening to right wing talk radio , if I can help it .
I can say this , there many people upset right now , at what the White House and Congress are trying to do .
Now , Do I believe Rupert and Co. are causing the masses to go all freak deakey ?
I believe that they are not exactly trying to calm the people down .
However , I believe Ed Schultz ’s accusation is a bit over the top and possibly a bit of a jumping the shark , for using such imagery .
But I can see why he feels the way that he does .
But using that sort of term , was n’t one of his smarter moments .
The call for the Islamic Khilafah is growing in momentum the world over as each day passes by .
From North Africa to Far East , Europe to Central Asia , Muslims are working tirelessly to restore the Khilafah .
This has been recognised even by the western colonial powers and their puppet slaves who illegitimately rule the Muslim world today .
In a major speech , delivered on 5th September 2006 to US military officers and US diplomats , George W Bush attempted to mislead the world about what the forthcoming Khilafah will look like in the 21st century .
Bush sought to bolster support from the western world for the infamous “ war on terror ” and his speech was thus unsurprisingly littered with venomous propaganda and lies .
Following the footsteps of his Crusader ancestors like Pope Urban II , Bush falsely declared that Muslims who want to regain their political destiny by restoring the Khilafah wish to ,
“ …establish a violent political utopia across the Middle East , which they call Khilafah , where all would be ruled according to their hateful ideology …
This Khilafah would be a totalitarian Islamic empire encompassing all current and former Muslim lands , stretching from Europe to North Africa , the Middle East and Southeast Asia ” . [ 1 ]
What Bush described as a “ totalitarian empire ” was in fact the leading civilisation that led the world in every known field .
This article seeks to illustrate some of the great achievements of the Khilafah in the early Abbasid period , commonly referred to as the Golden Age .
Due to its limited scope , this article adopts a thematic approach and therefore only examines the following aspects : life in the cities ; economy , trade and industry ; education , science and intellectual progression ; life of non-Muslims and da’wah ; and politics and governance .
Life in the cities of the Khilafah
The Abbasid period ushered in an era of city and infrastructure building , including markets , trade centres , roads and water systems , as large numbers of people settled in these thriving city centres .
By the 9th and 10th centuries , a traveller who had travelled widely could differentiate the Islamic world from other parts of the world .
This distinction was enabled by the magnificent architecture and buildings the Khilafah had constructed .
Whether in Islamic Spain or Iraq , the common architectural features appeared unmistakably distinctive to any observer .
Cities such as Alexandria , Jerusalem , Damascus , and Aleppo , in addition to many of the eastern cities like Samarkand were established prior to the rise of Islam .
However , the intellectual strength of Islam and its culture meant that the populations in these cities did not resist Islam and soon adopted its values and culture .
As Matthew Gordon writes , “ The Arab armies avoided these cities at first , but over time , the integration of Arab populations , and the adoption of Islam and Arab culture by long - established populations , transformed the older cities ” . [ 2 ]
The history of Baghdad is absolutely fascinating .
Built around 762 ( CE ) by the Abbasid Caliph al - Mansur ( 754 – 75 ) , it housed the Abbasid rulers and was known as Madinat al - Salam ( the City of Peace ) .
By the 10th century and beyond it became the “ premier commercial and cultural ” centre within the Islamic world .
[ 3 ]
Baghdad under the Abbasid Khilafah is comparable to present day cities like London and New York because of its global significance at the time .
The famous Muslim historian Muhammad al - Tabari narrated in his book , Tarikh that when Caliph al - Mansur had decided to build the capital of the Khilafah in Baghdad , he laid the first brick himself saying , “ In the name of Allah , and to praise Him .
The earth is Allah ’s ; he causes to inherit of it whom He wills among His servants , and the result thereof is to them that fear Him ” .
He then said to the workmen “ Build and [ may ] Allah bless you ” .
[ 4 ]
Contrast this Caliph ’s humbleness and gratitude to Allah despite his grandeur and power to the present day rulers ’ arrogance and ungodliness and one easily appreciates the qualities of these great Islamic personalities .
Major Islamic cities such as Cairo , Baghdad , Cordoba and Fez were well developed at a time when European cities were not even a comparison .
During the Abbasid era Baghdad had an estimated population of 840,000 , Cairo had 300,000 – 450,000 and other smaller Islamic cities had around 10,000 – 20,000 inhabitants .
In contrast , Paris had an estimated population of 210,000 , London had 40,000 and Venice had 180,000 .
[5 ]
Therefore , Baghdad ’s population was clearly larger than the population of several of the European cities combined together .
In addition to the Khilafah ’s advancement , the citizens of the Khilafah enjoyed a high living standard .
Bloom and Blair illustrate the high living standard of the citizens of the Khilafah , whether Muslims or non-Muslims , “ In the Islamic lands , not only Muslims but also Christians and Jews enjoyed a good life .
They dressed in fine clothing , had fine houses in splendid cities serviced by paved streets , running water and sewers , and dined on spiced delicacies served on Chinese porcelains ” . [ 6 ]
People ’s standard of living in Cairo is visualised by the following narrative written by a Persian spy in the 11th century .
The spy ’s narrative describes the spacious houses the people in Cairo enjoyed at the time and the wide number of shops that existed in Cairo alone , that he estimated to be around 20,000 .
“ In the midst of the houses in New Cairo are gardens and orchards watered by wells .
In the sultan ’s harem are the most beautiful gardens imaginable .
Waterwheels have been constructed to irrigate these gardens .
There are trees planted and pleasure parks built even on roofs …
These houses are so magnificent and fine that you would think that they were made of jewel … ” [ 7 ]
It is evident that people had comfortable living conditions under the Khilafah in cities that were not just larger than London or Paris but also far exceeded in terms of material progression .
When the Crusaders attacked the holy land the lifestyle , which the people in the holy land were enjoying , made the Crusaders rather unsurprisingly envious and resentful .
“ The rough - and - tumble Crusaders were knocked off their feet by the luxuries they found for sale in the Near Eastern bazaars ” . [ 8 ]
Economy , trade and industry
As Islam ’s intellectual , political , economic and military strength grew stronger , it triggered an inevitable demise of the nearby Sasanid and Byzantine empires and eventually they collapsed at the hands of the Khilafah .
The Khilafah , covering a massive geographical territory , offered its citizens the opportunity of unfettered travel and trade , which resulted in considerable prosperity in all fields of life .
During this period the growth in agriculture added to the commercial boom .
Rice and sugarcane , mainly found in India , were transported through Iran to the Mediterranean region where they were deemed to be luxury commodities .
In addition , various fruits such as oranges , apricots , mulberries and bananas were introduced in the region at the time .
Various spices , precious stones , fine and luxurious cloth and porcelain came from India and China .
However , Muslims did not just import goods for consumption but also exported finished goods .
Whilst the European industrial revolution may have triggered the practice of mass production , Muslims had produced goods such as military armaments , sugar , paper , fine textiles etc in large scales for export a thousand years earlier .
The textile industry was of huge importance to the Islamic economy .
The four main fibres – wool , silk , cotton and linen – were very widely produced by farmers in the region .
The textile industry was as important as the automobile industry in the west today .
Other successful industries included metalworking , glassblowing , and pottery .
Gordon write that this “ … growth of regional and trans- regional trade , and of urban manufacturing , produced new level of prosperity across the city landscape ” . [ 9 ]
Due to this vibrant economy , an internationally recognised monetary system based on the gold and silver standard had developed .
“ The Abbasid gold dinar remained an instrument of exchange for centuries … ” [ 10 ]
This economic system was not merely based upon primitive coinage ; Muslims had also developed a credit issuing system comparable to the modern system of cheque , which was used by traders travelling across the globe .
These letters of credit would not have been acceptable to traders in parts of the world unless there was an established economic system .
This was also made possible partly by the fact that the Khilafah was expanding over vast territories whose populations were also becoming Muslim .
It is narrated that when Caliph Harun al - Rashid died in 808 CE , his treasury department had 900 million gold dinars in surplus cash . [ 11 ]
Unlike the worthless paper currencies of the 21st century , the Abbasid gold dinar had in intrinsic value .
Therefore , this astounding sum of money in any nation at that time would have made it a very wealthy nation indeed .
This material wealth of the Abbasid Khilafah was a direct result of the Islamic economic system .
Education , science and intellectual progression
The growth in trade and the general prosperity directly contributed to the rise and proliferation of Islamic culture and learning internally and led to its promotion externally to other peoples .
The urban wealthy Muslim traders understood the purpose of life and hence extended their support to scholars and artisans alike .
These early Muslims made a concerted effort to strengthen the culture and values of Islam in their societies .
As the Caliphs governed an ever - growing state , they did not shy away from embracing science and technology to aid their governance .
The Khilafah needed scientists and mathematicians to assist in matters such as keeping accurate records of revenue collection or survey of lands .
The bureaucrats made use of the available knowledge even if they were from Indian , Persian or Greek scientists at the time .
However , Muslims scientists or mathematicians neither dogmatically accepted the available contemporary scientific knowledge , nor did they reject it because they came from the Greeks or the Persians .
Instead , Muslim scientists conducted their own empirical research and experiments to assess the strength of scientific theories available at the time and , “ thereby initiating a new era of scientific inquiry ” .
[ 12 ]
They challenged fundamental Greek scientific theories and often offered refutations based on their improved research findings .
Therefore , Muslim scientists introduced a revolutionary new method of progressing knowledge , a method that is valid to this day .
They focused on the scientific methods and instruments used for experiments and their reasoning qualities to elicit impressive results .
By the 8th century , there was a flourishing paper industry in Islamic world , which facilitated the growth of scholarship and wide availability of books .
In addition to religious knowledge , expertise in various scientific fields was actively promoted .
Wealthy families , including from the Abbasid household , funded research in scientific scholarships .
Muslims started the translation movement , which translated into Arabic works in other languages such as Greek , Persian and Indian in order to progress scientific knowledge .
This was a well - funded movement , receiving funds from across society .
People of all religious background participated in this search for knowledge in fields such as philosophy , medicine and astronomy .
Amongst many pioneering scholars was Muhammad ibn Musa al - Khwarizmi .
His work on astronomy was the standard work for many centuries whilst his book Kitab al - Jabr was the first work of algebra ( the name “ algebra ” originated from the title of this book ) .
The Bayt al - Hikma ( House of Knowledge ) library in Baghdad , founded by Caliph Harun al - Rashid , by the end of 9th century housed Arabic translation of all the major works of Persian and Indian geography and science .
Moreover , the Al - Azhar University in Egypt , which was the first of its kind in the world , was founded in 970 .
Whilst education and learning may not have been universal , it was certainly very common under the Khilafah .
The general masses could read and write ; but at the very least they could read .
Bloom and Blair argue , “ the general level of literacy was greater in the medieval Islamic lands than in Byzantium or western Europe .
Writing was found everywhere in this culture … ” [ 13 ]
The Khilafah invested heavily in the nation ’s education and scientific research and development .
Higher education institutions ( madrasa ) were established by the 11th century in all major cities .
The curriculum included Islamic sciences such as studies about the Qur’an and hadith , in addition to natural sciences such as mathematics , medicine , geometry , astronomy , philosophy and literary arts such as Arabic language and grammar .
A graduate from such a madrasa was well equipped to enter diverse career paths including teaching , scholarship and legal positions .
As a result of this successful education system , it is “ highly probable ” that the European higher education and college systems , e.g. in Spain and Italy , were modelled along the madrasa system .
This proposition is supported by the fact that the Islamic world had a well - established education system more than a century prior to its European counterpart .
As Europe had regular encounters with the Islamic world , both within commercial and intellectual spheres , it is perfectly conceivable that Europe learnt from the Muslims . [ 14 ]
The Khilafah produced some of the best personalities in the world at the time because under Islamic rule , there was no dichotomy between the temporal and the spiritual spheres and hence society excelled in all fields .
As Armstrong writes , “ Muslim scholars made more scientific discoveries during this time than in the whole of previously recorded history ” . [ 15 ]
Scholastic giants such as al - Khwarizmi ( mathematician / scientist ) , Ibn al - Haytham ( the “ father ” of optics ) , Ibn al - Nafis ( physician ) , Ibn Sina ( physician / scientist ) , Ibn Hazm ( philosopher ) , Ibn Khaldun ( philosopher / historian ) and al - Ghazzali ( theologian ) are only a few to name .
These are only some of the figures known to western academics , whilst there are countless others who remain unknown in the west .
Yet they too made similarly extraordinary contributions to humanity .
In acknowledgment this point , Gaston Wiet comments , “ People of the west should publicly express their gratitude to the scholars of the Abbasid period , who were known and appreciated in Europe during the Middle Ages ” . [ 16 ]
Life of non-Muslims and da’wah
Islam ’s tolerance of other faiths is exemplified by the fact that one did not have to be Muslim to be affluent and established in society .
In fact , western academics acknowledge that Jews and Christian citizens of the Islamic state flourished in trade .
Merchants came from all background within the Islamic state .
Even traders from the Byzantine Empire and Italian city states like Venice an Genoa were known to have traded freely within the Khilafah .
However , Muslims did not restrict their business relationships to mere monetary exchange .
Armed with a confident and powerful value system , Muslims in the Abbasid era actively promoted and disseminated Islamic culture and its way of life to outsiders .
As a result of interactions between Muslim traders and non-Muslims , large number of people became Muslim .
The Jews were at ease with living alongside Muslims in the holy land and elsewhere in the Khilafah .
The following example illustrates this point .
When the Crusaders conquered Jerusalem in 1099 and mercilessly slaughtered Jews , Christians and Muslims , the Jews sided with Muslims .
A Jewish pilgrim to Jerusalem wrote to a relative in 1100 , “ The Franks arrived and killed everybody in the city whether of Ishmael or Israel …
Now all of us had anticipated that our sultan – may God bestow glory upon his victories – would set out against the Franks with his troops and would chase them away … ” [ 17 ]
Unlike the states in the Middle East today , including the apartheid state of Israel , non-Muslims lived happily under Islamic rule and prospered .
Islam safeguarded the rights of non-Muslims and generally they were not oppressed under the Khilafah .
The heads of non-Muslim communities ensured that the terms of the dhimma ( contract of protection , which consisted of peace , order , obedience to the state and it laws ) between the state and the non-Muslim citizens were honoured .
Non-Muslims participated in all aspects of civic life .
The Coptic Christians in Egypt worked within the financial services whilst the Jews commonly worked within the medical profession .
Hourani mentions , “ Relations between Muslims and Jews in Umayyad Spain , and the Muslims and the Nestorian Christians in Abbasid Baghdad , were close and easy ” . [ 18 ]
Islam ’s ideological and cultural strength can be appreciated when one studies the rate at which many different nations and peoples accepted Islam as their way of life .
By the middle of the 8th century less than 10 % of the populations in Spain , North Africa and the Middle East ( excluding the Arabian peninsula ) were Muslim .
However , within two centuries there was a completely different picture , as these populations had entered Islam in their masses .
Whilst some polemicists may claim that Islam was spread by the sword , those who objectively examine the spread of Islam appreciate that “ in general they were not forced to convert ” to Islam ; rather “ the inducement to convert existed ” [ 19 ] because of the strength of Islam together with the Islamic state ’s active policies which encouraged populations to embrace Islam .
As Islam spread amongst people of different races and ethnicity , it uniquely shaped their identity .
The notion of Ummah was very deeply engraved in the Islamic society as Islam won people ’s hearts and minds and gelled all Muslims together .
Hourani explores the state of the Muslim identity by the 10th century :
“ men and women in the Near East and the Maghrib lived in a universe which was defined in terms of Islam … [ Muslims ] were aware of belonging to something broader : the community of believers ( the umma ) .
The ritual acts which they performed in common , the acceptance of a shared view of man ’s destiny in this world and the next , linked them with each other … ” [ 20 ]
The notion of modern ethnic nationalism based upon a common language and territorial entity was completely alien to Islam .
The nation state model , which exists today , is a foreign concept to Islam and indeed stands diametrically opposed to the history and culture of Muslims .
Politics and governance
The Abbasid Caliphs from the very beginning ruled only by the Shariah .
The judiciary had a very distinct role separate from the executive , at the apex of which sat the chief qadi ( Judge ) .
The Abbasid Caliphs understood and practically implemented the concept of an independent judiciary .
Hourani notes that the judge ’s “ functions were separated from the governors .
He had no political or financial duties … ” [ 21 ]
The judges ’ role was to resolve conflicts and give decisions in accordance with the Shariah .
The judges were specially trained in the madrasa .
The Abbasid Khilafah had administration systems divided into various departments , which was certainly complex for its time .
To put it into contemporary context , they had departments for military , legal , revenue collection , treasury , security and intelligence .
The Caliphs and their governors used to conduct joint public gatherings whereby they heard the people ’s concerns directly .
To prevent the governors from being overly entrenched in their positions and thus becoming neglectful , the Caliphs kept them in regular checks through the various intelligence gathering mechanisms .
The Islamic scholars kept themselves independent of the Caliphs in order to maintain their ability to keep the rulers in checks and acted as the protectors of Islam .
Unlike today , Islamic scholars under the Khilafah were multidimensional in their professional skills .
They were scholars , teachers and traders etc , as their education was of a high standard .
The Abbasid era was a time of rapid changes in many ways , as the Khilafah experienced demographic and territorial expansion , in addition to scientific and technological and intellectual challenges .
The Muslims however faced these challenges within the framework of Islam .
They resorted to Ijtihad to deal with new situations , and therefore , the Islamic state prospered .
The Khilafah was not an oppressive police state , as the Shariah safeguards the individual in society against state oppression .
Armstrong states , “ … no institution , such as the Khilafah or the court , had any power to interfere with the personal decisions and beliefs of the individual ” . [ 22 ]
This had particular implication for the non-Muslims because they were left alone to practice their beliefs so long as they obeyed the laws of the state .
Conclusion
The Abbasid Khilafah was a “ political and economic success ” from its infancy , as Caliphs like Harun al - Rashid maintained peace , security and prosperity for all citizens of the state . [ 23 ]
The Khilafah was a state that led the world in every field , whether scientific , intellectual or philosophical .
Unlike secular liberal capitalist states , the Islamic Khilafah was a balanced nation that maintained the equilibrium between the spiritual and the temporal spheres .
It is however absolutely clear that this astonishingly successful civilisation was founded upon Islam .
Therefore , far from being a “ hateful ideology ” , Islam guided many races and peoples out of backwardness .
Islam again has the unique opportunity to lead this world out of the misery created by the cataclysmic failure of capitalism , which can only be achieved once the Khilafah is restored .

The Softer Side of Ron Artest : The Newest Laker Gives Diamond Watch to Teenager by Ryan Kane
Lake Show Life has sources everywhere .
We ca n’t divulge how we attained the following phone conversation between Kurt Rambis and Phil Jackson but we ’re more than happy to share it with our readers .
Phil Jackson ( answers phone , chanting is heard in the background ) : Hello .
Kurt Rambis : Hey PJ , its Kurt .
PJ : Kurt ?
It ’s 4:20 in the afternoon .
You know what me and Jeanie are getting ready to do !
KR : Sorry PJ .
I really need to talk to you though .
What ’s that in the background ?
PJ : That is the soothing sound of the Mbuti Rain Forest Pygmies chanting in unison .
It is a very powerful sound that soothes the soul .
We flew them out for the week .
KR : Oh…look ,
Phil , I really need your advice on something .
PJ : What did I tell you last time , Kurt ?
Luke Walton is never going to be the poor man ’s Larry Bird .
Look , he ’s not even the homeless man ’s Larry Krystkowiak .
It is time to give up this quixotic quest of yours .
KR : No , this about me and my career .
Look Phil , I ’m thinking of taking the Timberwolves job .
PJ : ( talking to Jeanie in the background ) : Jeanie , I gotta take this call .
I know you already have the sage burning !
Give me five !
KR : Look …if this is a bad time ….
PJ : No , no , not at all .
So , you ’re going to be Kevin McHale ’s assistant ?
KR : No , he ’s gone .
I ’m thinking of taking the head coaching job in Minnesota .
PJ : Well , you ’d have some solid talent to build around .
That Kevin Garnett is going to win a title one of these days .
KR : PJ , KG ’s in Boston .
They beat us in the Finals last year .
PJ : Oh…well , that year is n’t on the side of my “ X ” hat so it does n’t really stand out to me …
Wait , Al Jefferson is in Minnesota right ?
KR : Yup .
PJ : Jefferson is like a new age McHale .
His footwork is not as good .
He does n’t have the low post arsenal that Kevin did .
But he ’s a better rebounder and I ’m sure he ’ll sell more shoes than Kevin did .
How those two did n’t make it work is a mystery .
Well , they drafted well .
I mean taking Brandon Roy in 2006 was a great move then drafting O.J. Mayo in ’08 was nice too .
Hell of a backcourt !
KR : PJ … they traded both those guys on draft night …
PJ : Oh…so who is on that roster now ?
KR : Jefferson , Kevin Love … they just drafted eight point guards in this year ’s draft so one of them should pan out .
PJ : That ’s right !
Did n’t they get some Spanish kid ?
I heard he ’s the new Pistol Pete .
KR : Well , they kinda sorta have him , well he ’s still in Europe but , well …it ’s complicated .
PJ : I see …
KR : They also just signed Shelden Williams .
PJ : You mean Parker .
Shelden Parker .
He ’s married now .
KR : Any how …So , I think this is the job for me .
Sacramento was n’t right because I did n’t want to have to get killed by you four times a year .
Philly was nice but wherever Elton Brand goes disappointment seems to follow .
I just think this is my time .
PJ : Well , there are lessons to be learned in life .
As Charley Rosen once said about me , “ For Phil , the destination is the journey . ”
Therefore each man must embark on a vision quest with Forest Whitaker as his guide …
KR : Wait , are you talking about the movie Vision Quest ?
PJ : Not really sure at this point .
All I remember from last night was being up way too late and for some reason my satellite could only get TBS .
Did you realize that channel is like a refuge for bad movies ?
One day M. Night Shyamalan is going to want to kiss the ground that Ted Turner walks on .
Trust me on that …What were we talking about ?
KR : Me taking the Minnesota job .
PJ : Right …as I was saying .
Each soul must find their center in order to properly travel through the constant cycle of life .
Birth and rebirth are the causality of the precious dogma which we hold sacred in the eighth chakra .
Uplifting the flux capacitor will send you through the 1.21 jiggawatts …
KR : Jigga what ?
PJ : Huh ?
KR : ( giggling ) : Nothing …
PJ : As I was saying …
KR : Cut the crap PJ .
You ’ve got a bowl to smoke and I ’ve got a flight to catch .
Do you think I should take the job ?
PJ : Oh come on Kurt !
If you leave then who is going to handle the defense next year ?
How about if I give you the defense , the right to call timeouts and you can lead the huddle during timeouts ?
KR : What ?
Have the head coach stand outside of the huddle ?
PJ : Mike Brown got coach of the year using that technique .
Do n’t knock it .
What a genius that Brown .
Just standing there like a towel boy waiting for the right moment to hand LeBron his Gatorade while his assistants work feverishly to diagram the right play with the game on the line .
Great stuff !
KR : Having LeBron does n’t hurt .
PJ : Who ?
LeBron ?
Oh right , the French Caribbean kid who tried to check Kobe in the Finals this year .
KR : No , that was Mickael Pietrus … Look , I ’m taking the job !
PJ : No , Kurt .
Do n’t make me coach again .
Please I ’m begging you .
Stay one more year and then you and Brian Shaw can get in the octagon to decide who gets my job .
KR : This is my time Phil .
I have to do this .
PJ : ( long moment of silence ) : Ok .
I understand .
Best of luck .
Just know that if Tony Campbell goes down injured that your season is over .
KR : Tony Campbell ?
PJ , he has n’t played in Minnesota in almost 20 years …
PJ : ( chanting is heard in the background ) :
Well , be seeing you around I guess .
Gotta run Kurt , Jeanie and the Pygmies are saying a sacred prayer for Stephon Marbury .
Hey , you guys do n’t have any point guards .
Maybe you can reunite him with Garnett .
That is your vision quest , Kurt .
To give the good people of Minneapolis a title with KG and Steph .
Reunite them for the job they left unfinished .
KR : Thanks
Phil , I think that ’s David Kahn on the other line , I gotta take this call .
PJ : Ok , Kurt .
Tell Troy Hudson I said hello .
KR : Will do , Phil .
Will do .
Dial tone
I was always taught that Angels could do nothing on their own .
They were created to do God 's will and had no free will of their own .
Then I hear Satan rebelled against God and 1/3 of the Angels followed him .
How can this be if they have no free will ?
The heavenly angels gladly and completely do the bidding of God. Psalm 103:20 - 21 states , " Bless the LORD , ye his angels , that excel in strength , that do his commandments , hearkening unto the voice of his word .
Bless ye the LORD , all ye his hosts ; ye ministers of his , that do his pleasure . "
Their purpose is to do His commandments , hearken to His voice , and do His pleasure .
However , no scripture declares that angels have no free will .
From the fact of the fall of so many of them , they obviously have some form of self - etermination .
That is , they have the freedom to remain in that holy estate into which they were placed by creation or to leave their first estate for a lower one .
" And the angels which kept not their first estate , but left their own habitation , he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day " ( Jude 1:6 ) .
Clearly , they are not robots unable to do anything but obey God .
However , their condition is not like that of man .
Man can be redeemed from his fallen state by the applied blood of Jesus Christ .
The fallen angels have no means by which they can return to their first estate after they leave it .
They will all be cast into the " everlasting fire , prepared for the devil and his angels " ( Matthew 25:41 ) .
Also , there is no mix of obedience with disobedience in the angels as there often is in regenerate man .
The angels in heaven perform the commandments of God with full obedience ( Psalm 103:20 - 21 ) .
The fallen angels are simply " the angels that sinned " ( 2 Peter 2:4 ) .
No good is seen in them .
We will probably never be able to grasp with fullness the reason for the angels to rebel against God and leave their heavenly estate .
They saw God in His absolute glory and holiness .
They saw the greatness of His power .
What could they hope to gain by a rebellion against such a God ?
However , scripture does reveal the initial motivation of their rebellion .
From a study of Satan and his part in leading the rebellion , we know that their rebellion was fueled by willful pride .
Isaiah 14:12 - 15 gives important insight into this matter .
In this passage , Satan ( as Lucifer ) states five times , " I will . "
Especially revealing is his fifth declaration : " I will be like the most High " ( Isaiah 14:14 ) .
He did not desire to submit to the will and glory of God , but rather wanted to be like God himself .
This was pride .
The bishop , or pastor , is not to be " a novice , lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil " ( 1Timothy 3:6 ) .
The devil fell into condemnation because he was lifted up with pride .
He refused to submit to the will of the Father , lost his first estate , and has taken many of the angels with him .
His " tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven , and did cast them to the earth " ( Revelation 12:4 ) .
The angels do not have a sin nature .
We have one because of our descent from Adam .
All angels have been directly created by God and must have been created with a holy nature .
Therefore , they never have the mix of good and bad often found in men .
However , they were created with the ability and responsibility of self - determination .
They can choose to leave the estate of heaven by an act of will .
Or , they can choose to stay with God .
Those who leave , do so in order to be gods .
Satan is the " the god of this world " ( 2Corinthians 4:4 ) .
Satan 's motivation is further revealed in his temptation of Adam and Eve in the Garden .
He told them , " and ye shall be as gods , knowing good and evil " ( Genesis 3:5 ) .
That is what moved him to rebel and that is what he used on Eve .
Understanding this helps with another verse .
1 Corinthians 11:10 states , " For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels . "
The passage in 1 Corinthians is dealing with the outward submission of the woman .
Her external act of submission is important " because of the angels . "
I take that to mean that ladies who submit to their husbands , not because he is any better than her but simply because it is God 's way , provide an excellent example to the angels in heaven .
If she can submit to her husband with all his faults and problems , then certainly the angels should be able to submit to the Holy God .

Imagine Freeways Being Carbon Sinks
August 10th , 2009 by Susan Kraemer
[ social_buttons ]
It seems like only yesterday that we covered an invention of “ Green ” cement at Cleantechnica :
The latest scheme for getting rid of the greenhouse gas comes from Stanford Professor Brent Constanz .
The Geological and Environmental Sciences Professor has invented a new type of cement that is carbon neutral — a huge innovation for a material whose production process normally spews vast amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere .
Today another start - up raised $ 1.7 million to fund a pilot plant making “ Green ” cement .
But Novacem ; a British spin - out from similarly government - funded research at Imperial College London , is going one step further than making lower carbon cement .
They are attempting to make a cement that actually sequesters carbon .
They plan a pilot plant to make their carbon - absorbing cement by 2011 funded by The Royal Society Enterprise Fund , the London Technology Fund and Imperial Innovations .
Rio Tinto is providing the raw material ; magnesium silicates .
As we adopt more stringent building codes to reduce carbon emissions , green cement is going to go mainstream .
Legislation pending in the US makes zero carbon building mandatory by 2030 if the new climate bill passes in its current form .
Low carbon cement is needed not only for buildings , but for also for binding together concrete freeway overpasses .
Novacem ’s cement will actually absorb more carbon dioxide over its life cycle than it emits .
The technique is very simple .
Instead of using limestone ; they make cement from magnesium silicates which do n’t emit CO2 in manufacture — and then they go on to actually absorb carbon dioxde as they age .

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
Australia and New Zealand have joined forces to bid for a multi-billion dollar international radio telescope .
New Zealand 's Economic Development Minister Gerry Brownlee and Australia 's Minister for Innovation , Industry , Science and Research , Senator Kim Carr , signed the agreement today in Sydney .
The signing is seen as a boost to Australia , which is competing with South Africa to host the Square Kilometre Array ( SKA ) .
" Signing the arrangement sends a strong signal to the international community that both countries are committed to supporting SKA - related industry opportunities and promoting the relevant capabilities of Australian and New Zealand industry , " says Brownlee .
Senator Carr says the SKA is one of the world 's great science projects , comparing it to the Large Hadron Collider in Europe .
" New Zealand is crucial to building the global collaboration required for the SKA to reach its full potential , " says Carr .
" If our bid is successful , the SKA will not only significantly increase Australia 's and New Zealand 's scientific capabilities ; it will result in economic benefits and spinoffs in a number of areas , including supercomputing , data transmission , renewable energy , construction and manufacturing . "
Spiral network
The SKA will comprise up to 5000 small radio antennas , all operating as one giant telescope .
Most will be concentrated in outback Western Australia , along with a series of remote ' array stations ' positioned in a spiral configuration radiating out over thousands of kilometres .
The addition of array stations in New Zealand will see the baseline of the SKA extend from 3000 to 5000 kilometres .
This will result in an almost doubling of the telescope 's resolution .
" The scale is enormous , " says Brownlee .
" It is a truly mega science project , which has a discovery potential ten thousand times greater than existing instruments . "
Professor Sergei Gulyaev of Auckland University of Technology says their close working relationship with Australian radio astronomers has helped them become part of the SKA bid .
" Without our Australian colleagues , we could never have made the leap to this next generation digital radio telescope , " he says .
Australian - born astronomer Dr Melanie Johnston - Hollitt of Victoria University of Wellington says New Zealand has a lot to offer the Australian bid .
" New Zealand also has strengths in high performance computing , imaging , signal pipeline processing , engineering and antenna design , " she says .
The announcement of the SKA 's location is expected to be made in 2012 .
The king of pop , Michael Jackson , was murdered with a lethal drug cocktail - and the personal physician with him when he died is the key suspect , according to reports from the US .
A law enforcement official today said the Los Angeles County coroner had ruled Jackson died from a killer dose of a powerful anaesthetic , as well as two sedatives .
The finding makes increasingly likely criminal charges will be filed against Jackson 's personal physician , Dr Conrad Murray , who was with him when he died .
The official told Associated Press the coroner had found a fatal combination of drugs was given to Jackson in his rented Los Angeles mansion hours before he died on June 25 .
The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the findings have not been publicly released .

The 68 - year - old music legend was picked up one Thursday last month by a 24 - year - old cop who failed to recognize him as he walked the streets of Long Branch , N.J. in the pouring rain .
It may have been as simple as it appears : Dylan told police he was talking a walk and looking at a home for sale .
But the area where Dylan was picked up was just a couple blocks from the beachside bungalow where Bruce Springsteen wrote the material for his landmark 1975 album " Born to Run . "
In the past nine months , Dylan has visited the childhood homes of Neil Young and John Lennon , in both cases appearing without fanfare and barely identifying himself after he was recognized .
Last November , Winnipeg homeowner John Kiernan told Sun Media 's Simon Fuller that Dylan and a friend arrived unannounced in a taxi to his Grosvenor Ave. home , where songwriter Neil Young grew up .
Dylan , Kiernan said , was unshaved and had the brim of his hat pulled down over his head .
He asked for a look inside and inquired about Young 's bedroom and where he would have played his guitar .
Dylan has shown a deep affinity for the Canadian rocker over the years , most recently in his 2001 song " Highlands . "
And Young said at a Nashville concert in 2005 that he once lent Dylan one of his most precious musical treasures -- Hank Williams ' guitar , for which Young wrote the ballad " This Old Guitar . "
Both men revere Williams , a country music legend .
In May , Dylan joined a public tour of John Lennon 's childhood home , according to the BBC .
A spokeswoman for the National Trust , which runs the home as London landmark , said Dylan " took one of our general minibus tours .
" People on the minibus did not recognize him apparently , " the spokeswoman told the British news agency .
" He could have booked a private tour , but he was happy to go on the bus with everyone else . "
Springsteen spent two of the most creative years of his young career in the house on West Court in Long Branch in 1974 and 1975 , penning " Born to Run , " " Thunder Road " and " Backstreets " while living there .
Dylan 's spokesman did not immediately return a call or e-mail for comment .
' Eccentric - Looking Old Man ' in Yard
On July 23 , Dylan , one of the most celebrated , eccentric artists in American history , was in the Long Branch , N.J. , area as part of a national concert tour -- a fact lost on Long Branch police officer Kristie Buble .
To hear her describe it , the scene was like something out of one of Dylan 's epic songs :
It was pouring rain , Dylan was all alone , far from the traveling home of his entourage of tour buses .
When Dylan wandered into the yard of a home that had a " For Sale " sign on it , the home 's occupants became spooked by his appearance and called police with a report of an " eccentric - looking old man " in their yard , Long Branch Police said .
One of the occupants even went so far as to follow Dylan as he continued on down the street .
A publicist for Dylan who was on his way to a Dylan concert in Fresno , Calif. , Friday evening , told ABCNews.com he had not heard the story , but would look into the incident .
But Buble said the man told her he was Bob Dylan .
" We got a call for a suspicious person , '' Buble said .
" It was pouring rain outside , and I was right around the corner so I responded .
By that time he was walking down the street .
I asked him what he was doing in the neighborhood and he said he was looking at a house for sale . "
" I asked him what his name was and he said , ' Bob Dylan , ' Buble said .
" Now , I 've seen pictures of Bob Dylan from a long time ago and he did n't look like Bob Dylan to me at all .
He was wearing black sweatpants tucked into black rain boots , and two raincoats with the hood pulled down over his head .
" So I said , ' OK Bob , what are you doing in Long Branch ? '
He said he was touring the country with Willie Nelson and John Mellencamp .
So now I 'm really a little fishy about his story .
I did not know what to believe or where he was coming from , or even who he was .
" We see a lot of people on our beat , and I was n't sure if he came from one of our hospitals or something , " Buble said .
She asked for identification , but Dylan said he had none .
She asked where he was staying and he said his tour buses were parked at some big hotel on the ocean .
Buble said she assumed that to be the nearby Ocean Place Conference Resort .
" He was acting very suspicious , '' Buble said .
" Not delusional , just suspicious .
You know , it was pouring rain and everything . "
Sergeant : ' That 's Not Bob Dylan '
Following her police training , Buble said she indulged him .
" OK Bob , why do n't you get in the car and we 'll drive to the hotel and go verify this ? ' " she said she told him .
" I put him in the back of the car .
To be honest with you , I did n't really believe this was Bob Dylan .
It never crossed my mind that this could really be him . "
Buble made small talk on the ride to the hotel , asking her detainee where he was playing , she said , but never really believing a word he said .
" He was really nice , though , and he said he understood why I had to verify his identity and why I could n't let him go , " Buble said .
" He asked me if I could drive him back to the neighborhood when I verified who he was , which made me even more suspicious .
" I pulled into the parking lot , " she said , " and sure enough there were these enormous tour buses , and I thought , ' Whoa . ' "
Her sergeant met her at the hotel parking lot .
" I got out of my car and said , " Sarg , this guy says he 's Bob Dylan , ' " Buble said .
" He opened the car door , looked in , and said , ' That 's not Bob Dylan . ' "
" So we go over to the tour bus and knock on the door and some guy answers and I say , ' Are you missing someone ? ' "
" Who 's asking ? '' came the reply , according to Buble .
" I was in full uniform , so I say , ' I 'm asking !
I 'm the police . ' "
Eventually , the police were shown Dylan 's passport , which Buble said she looked at , saw the legend 's name , and rather sheepishly handed it back to Dylan 's manager .
" OK , '' she recalled saying as she smiled .
" Um , have a nice day . "
A police department source said Buble had taken her share of good - natured ribbing from some of the older officers .
" To really appreciate the story from our end , you have to see Kristie , " one cop said .
" She looks like a 16 - year - old kid , next to this living legend .
It was unbelievable . "
Dylan Has Gone Incognito Before
In fairness to Buble , Dylan has a long history of intentionally seeking anonymity , often with hooded sweatshirts and other limited disguises .
In October , 2001 , he was held up at a checkpoint at Jackson County Exposition Center in Oregon as he attempted to get into the backstage area of his own concert , according to the Associated Press .
While it remains unclear whether Dylan was looking for Springsteen 's old home in this case , and he never mentioned that he was to Buble , the description that the Winnipeg homeowner gave of Dylan when the singer visited Neil Young 's home last year was similar Buble 's story .
" So these guys were standing at the front of the house about to get back into their taxi , '' Kiernan , the homeowner , said of Dylan and his friend in Canada .
" I noticed he was wearing these expensive - looking leather pants tucked inside these world - class boots .
Then I studied his face and tried to keep cool . "
It was Bob Dylan , who 'd grown up just over the U.S. / Canadian border , in Hibbing , Minn. , Kiernan said .
" When he said , ' Would Neil have looked out this window when he played his guitar ? ' , " said Kiernan , " I realized what a spiritual experience he was having at that moment , knowing that he would have been doing the same thing at the same time in Minnesota .
An example of the cracks appearing in Apple Macbooks with plastic cases .
A US law firm , Seeger Weiss , is investigating the issue for a potential class action lawsuit and is calling on affected customers to come forward .
But Apple refuses to acknowledge the problem , despite offering free repairs to some customers who have complained and are still within their warranty period .
Other customers have reported that Apple has refused repairs , blaming the problem on the way the customers have handled the machines .
Many who were successful in getting Apple to repair the problem have noticed that the issue reappears within months under normal use .
Anthony Agius , founder of the biggest Australian Mac community site , MacTalk.com.au , said there were countless reports on his forums from people repeatedly experiencing the issue .
" They 're certainly design faults - a laptop should n't develop cracks in the case without it being dropped or manhandled , " he said .
Agius said that he had not seen a Macbook that was used regularly that had not developed some sort of issue .
" Personally , I think it 's one of Apple 's worst quality products ...
No other Apple product in recent history has been quite so shoddy , " he said .
" First it was the issue with an incorrect amount of thermal paste applied to the CPUs , which resulted in the Macbooks overheating .
Then an issue occurred with the palm rests and other areas of the laptop becoming discoloured , or in the case of the black Macbooks , the paint wearing off . "
The latest debacle comes as Apple is under fire in Britain this week for trying to silence a father and daughter with a gagging order after the child 's iPod allegedly exploded and the family attempted to obtain a refund from the company .
The report , in Britain 's The Times , came after a US reporter revealed how she spent seven months wrangling with Apple to get the Consumer Product Safety Commission to release , under freedom of information laws , information about 15 other cases of iPods bursting into flames .
Richard Olsen bought his white Macbook at the opening of the Sydney Apple Store in June last year and within months the case began to crack .
" I did n't take much notice of it until one day I ran my wrist across the side of it and it pierced into my wrist , " he said .
Olsen said he took the laptop to Apple to be examined by a customer service representative , who told him that he had caused the problem and it was not covered by warranty .
The representative eventually agreed to repair the laptop but Olsen has now taken his case to the NSW Office of Fair Trading , as Apple would not provide him with a written statement saying it would repair the laptop a second time if the same issue occurred again .
From researching the cracking Macbook issue online , Olsen learned that , even though Apple has refused to acknowledge a design flaw , it had described the problem in an internal support article provided to its certified repairers .
Apple refused to show him the internal document but Olsen said an Apple customer service rep he spoke to in the US confirmed its existence and acknowledged that the problem was widespread .
But Olsen was still unable to obtain a copy of it .
" They said to me firstly we would be forced to recall every Macbook , so it would be expensive and it would be very bad PR , " he said .
Agius was of a similar opinion , saying : " It could be that if Apple recognise it as an official fault , they may be required by law to replace them out of warranty . "
When Olsen asked Apple Australia 's executive relations specialist , Janine Beach , for a copy of the internal support document , she told him she could not release it because " it may contain corporate sensitive information " .
Olsen said his claim with the Office of Fair Trading was being investigated .
Apple Australia spokeswoman Fiona Martin would not comment on the issue other than to say : " Our customers need to let us know if they have any concerns and we will definitely respond to those . "
In a statement , the NSW Office of Fair Trading said it had " no evidence of systemic problems with Apple Macbooks " , although products " should be able to withstand normal wear and tear without failing " .
It said people affected by the cracking Macbook issue could contact Fair Trading " who will attempt to mediate a solution with the trader " .
Loading Late last year , Apple introduced a new line of Macbooks featuring a durable aluminium enclosure .
However , the plastic enclosure is still being used on the entry - level $ 1599 13 - inch Macbook that is still on sale today .

Details are emerging from the massive cyber attack that hit South Korea and the U.S. earlier this month -- showing security researchers what went right in stemming the tide .
Initially , the South Korea government blamed North Korea for the attack , though no solid evidence has yet been put forth to support that claim .
In the meantime , researchers are learning precisely how large the attack had been and how it had been achieved .
As it turns out , South Korea , which is one of the most wired nations on Earth , was in part a victim of its own high - speed broadband network .
" The significant part of the attack was a DDoS [ Distributed Denial of Service attack ] that originated from about 30 - 40 thousand bots in South Korea , " Avi Chesla , vice president of security products at security vendor Radware , told InternetNews.com .
" Korea 's Internet infrastructure , which allows very high bandwidth in the main part of the country , allowed these bots to generate a very high - volume attack . "
Flickr is awesome , but the search stinks .
It 's impossible to peruse a large quantity of images without investing way too much time and energy .
In fact , most of us power Flickr searchers either use a few of these third - party search tools , or use the site : flickr.com operator with Google or Bing image search to get around the painfully poor search experience .
Thankfully , Flickr search just got a much needed makeover and it's now as smart as it should be .
The redesign has focused the search experience around processing large quantities of images with a much improved layout and quicker to find filters .
The new search experience was rolled out this morning , so you should already be greeted with the much improved results .
You 'll notice that results now follow a typical search engine layout with thumbnails as the default , and sorting options so you can toggle between relevant , recent , and interesting , and adjust size for small , medium , detail , and slideshow search results views .
You 'll also love that you can click the info icon for small and medium image results to get a glimpse of a slightly larger image , and see total image views , comments , and faves , as well clickable tags and user info .
Plus , should you use the advanced search options to filter for things like Creative Commons licensed images , Flickr now clearly highlights your search criteria at the top of the page .
On the right hand side of the page , you 'll now see related image options to supplement your search results .
According to Flickr , the new groups , photographers , tag clusters , and places boxes are " Based upon how our members are tagging their photos and participating in the Flickrverse . "
We 're really impressed with the Flickr search improvements , and think that it 's finally a smart image search experience that we would enjoy using .

Pedestrians walk past a Bank of America branch in New York May 8 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Lucas Jackson
( Reuters ) - Bank of America Corp is operating under a secret U.S. regulatory sanction that requires it to overhaul its board and address perceived problems with risk and liquidity management , The Wall Street Journal reported , citing people familiar with the situation .
Rarely disclosed publicly , the so - called memorandum of understanding ( MOU ) gives banks a chance to work out their problems without the glare of outside attention , the paper said .
Financial institutions that fail to address deficiencies can be slapped with harsher penalties that include a publicly announced cease - and - desist order , the newspaper said .
According to the paper , the order was imposed in early May , shortly after shareholders of the bank stripped Chief Executive Kenneth Lewis of his duties as chairman .
The MOU is the most serious procedural action taken against Bank Of America by federal regulators since the financial crisis erupted , the newspaper said .
The report said the MOU surprised some Bank Of America executives who had not expected federal regulators to issue such a formal rebuke .
It said the bank responded swiftly with six directors resigning since May 26 .
Bank of America faces a series of deadlines , some at the end of July and others in August , the paper said .
Bank of America could not be immediately reached for comment by Reuters .

1. Designed By An Amateur
Avoid websites that promote ridiculously cheap logo packages .
You get what you pay for .
A professional business should look professional .
New business owners often invest a lot of time and money in property and equipment , but do not often match it by investing suitably in their logo .
Here are the most common reasons why many logos look amateurish :
The business owner wanted to save money by designing the logo quickly themselves .
A friend or relative who claims to know a little about graphic design does it as a favor .
The wrong people are commissioned .
( Local printers are not likely proficient in logo design . )
The business outsourced the job via one of several design competition websites , which are mostly populated by amateur designers .
The job was given to an online company that offers really cheap logos .
All of the above can result in disastrous outcomes .
If your logo looks amateurish , then so will your business .
A business should know where to look when it wants a new logo .
David Airey offers great insight on how to choose the right logo designer for your requirements .
Here are the advantages of hiring an established and professional logo designer :
Your logo will be unique and memorable .
You wo n’t run into any problems down the line with reproducing it .
Your logo will have a longer lifespan and wo n’t need to be redesigned in a couple of years .
Your logo will look professional .
2. Relies On Trends
Focusing on current logo trends is like putting a sell - by date on a logo .
Trends ( whether swooshes , glows or bevels ) come and go and ultimately turn into cliches .
A well - designed logo should be timeless , and this can be achieved by ignoring the latest design tricks and gimmicks .
The biggest cliche in logo design is the dreaded “ corporate swoosh , ” which is the ultimate way to play it safe .
As a logo designer , your job is to create a unique identity for your client , so completely ignoring logo design trends is best .
Logo Online Pros has a great section on its website in which it updates current logo design trends every year .
Being aware as a designer of the latest crazes is important , mainly so that you can avoid them at all costs .
3. Uses Raster Images
An example of how raster graphics can limit reproduction .
Standard practice when designing a logo is to use vector graphics software , such as Adobe Illustrator or Corel Draw .
A vector graphic is made up of mathematically precise points , which ensures visual consistency across multiple sizes .
The alternative , of course , is use to raster graphics software , such as Adobe Photoshop .
A raster graphic – or bitmap , as it ’s commonly called – consists of pixels .
Using raster images for logos is not advisable because it can cause problems with reproduction .
While Photoshop is capable of creating very large logos , you never know for sure how large you will have to reproduce your logo at some point .
If you zoom in enough on a raster graphic , it will appear pixelated , making it unusable .
Maintaining visual consistency by making sure the logo looks the same in all sizes is essential .
The main advantages of vector graphics for logo design are :
The logo can be scaled to any size without losing quality .
Editing the logo later on is much easier .
It can be adapted to other media more easily than a raster image .
4. Contains Stock Art
Using stock vector graphics in a logo puts your client at risk .
This mistake is often made by business owners who design their own logo or by amateur designers who are not clued in to the laws on copyright .
Downloading stock vector imagery from websites such as VectorStock is not a crime , but it could possibly get you in trouble if you incorporate it in a logo .
A logo should be unique and original , and the licensing agreement should be exclusive to the client : using stock art breaks both of these rules .
Chances are , if you are using a stock vector image , it is also being used by someone somewhere else in the world , so yours is no longer unique .
You can pretty easily spot stock vectors in logos because they are usually familiar shapes , such as globes and silhouettes .
5. Designing For Yourself Rather Than The Client
Never impose your own personality onto a client ’s work .
You can often spot this logo design sin a mile away ; the cause is usually a designer ’s enormous ego .
If you have found a cool new font that you ca n’t wait to use in a design , well … do n’t .
Ask yourself if that font is truly appropriate for the business you ’re designing for ?
For example , a great modern typographic font that you just love is not likely suited to a serious business such as a lawyer ’s office .
Some designers also make the mistake of including a “ trademark ” in their work .
While you should be proud of your work , imposing your personality onto a logo is wrong .
Stay focused on the client ’s requirements by sticking to the brief .
6. Overly Complex
Highly detailed designs do n’t scale well when printed or viewed in smaller sizes .
What better analogy for thumbnail images than fingerprints ?
You ’ll notice the intricacies of your fingerprints only when looking at them really close up .
As soon as you move away , those details are lost .
The same holds true for highly detailed logo designs .
When printed in small sizes , a complex design will lose detail and in some cases will look like a smudge or , worse , a mistake .
The more detail a logo has , the more information the viewer has to process .
A logo should be memorable , and one of the best ways to make it memorable is to keep things simple .
Look at the corporate identities of Nike , McDonald ’s and Apple .
Each company has a very simple icon that can easily be reproduced at any size .
7. Relies On Color For Its Effect
Without color , your great design may lose its identity .
This is a very common mistake .
Some designers cannot wait to add color to a design , and some rely on it completely .
Choosing color should be your last decision , so starting your work in black and white is best .
Every business owner will need to display their logo in only one color at one time or another , so the designer should test to see whether this would affect the logo ’s identity .
If you use color to help distinguish certain elements in the design , then the logo will look completely different in one tone .
8. Poor Choice Of Font
Font choice can make or break a logo .
When it comes to executing a logo , choosing the right font is the most important decision a designer can make .
More often than not , a logo fails because of a poor font choice ( our example shows the infamous Comic Sans ) .
Finding the perfect font for your design is all about matching the font to the style of the icon .
But this can be tricky .
If the match is too close , the icon and font will compete with each other for attention ; if the complete opposite , then the viewer wo n’t know where to focus .
The key is finding the right balance , somewhere in the middle .
Every typeface has a personality .
If the font you have chosen does not reflect the icon ’s characteristics , then the whole message of the brand will misfire .
Bad fonts are often chosen simply because the decision is n’t taken seriously enough .
Some designers simply throw in type as an afterthought .
Professional font foundries , such as MyFonts and FontFont , offer much better typeface options than those over - used websites that offer free downloads .
9. Has Too Many Fonts
A logo works best with a maximum of two fonts .
Using too many fonts is like trying to show someone a whole photo album at once .
Each typeface is different , and the viewer needs time to recognize it .
Seeing too many at once causes confusion .
Using a maximum of two fonts of different weights is standard practice .
Restricting the number of fonts to this number greatly improves the legibility of a logo design and improves brand recognition .
10 . Copies Others
This is the biggest logo design mistake of all and , unfortunately , is becoming more and more common .
As mentioned , the purpose of a logo is to represent a business .
If it looks the same as someone else ’s , it has failed in that regard .
Copying others does no one any favors , neither the client nor the designer .
Harman gets a House husband : Deputy PM 's other half lined up for safe seat
Harriet Harman has spent her two weeks running the country moaning about the competence of men in public life .
But perhaps her husband Jack Dromey is something of an exceptional case .
Senior Labour sources say he is being lined up for a safe Labour seat at the next Election .
They claim the Unite union boss will be parachuted in at the last minute as a reward for supporting Gordon Brown .
Left - wing power couple : Harriet Harman and Unite boss Jack Dromey
The prospect of him joining forces in the Commons with his wife , will do little to boost her popularity with colleagues .
Labour aides revealed that events of the past week have persuaded fellow ministers to work together to prevent the Labour deputy becoming party leader once Mr Brown stands down .
Yesterday Miss Harman , who has strong views on feminism , denied ' absolutely ' claims that she has been running a leadership campaign in all but name during her period standing in for the Prime Minister .
In an interview with Radio 4's Woman 's Hour , she said : ' I can't be responsible for people 's perceptions .
' I 'm not going to become a shrinking violet .
I 'm not going to hide away from the agenda .
That 's one of the things that brought me into politics .
I felt there was a missing voice . '
' There is no point tippy - toeing around , ' she said .
' If I had been tippy - toeing around I never would have raised the issue of should we have a criminal offence for men who exploit prostitutes and who exploit victims of human trafficking .'
Miss Harman also announced plans for children as young as five to get lessons about wife beating and angered Cabinet colleagues by saying a woman should always hold one of the top two posts in the Labour leadership because ' men can not be trusted to run things on their own ' .
But the latest claims suggest her opposition to electing a male does not extend to to her husband .
As an MP , Mr Dromey could strengthen his wife 's power base in Parliament by acting as an informal link between her and other union - backed MPs in Westminster .
He is deputy general secretary of Britain 's biggest union , whose role as key donors to Labour 's General Election funds would surely help his chances of securing a safe seat .
Mr Dromey has been ridiculed in recent years for saying he knew nothing about the cash for peerages affair , in which three Labour donors were proposed as members of the Lords after making £ 3.5 million in loans to the party while he was treasurer .
He was also called ' lazy and stupid ' for declaring ignorance of suspect donations to his wife 's deputy leadership campaign two years ago , which resulted in an Electoral Commission investigation .
Colleagues of Miss Harman are scarcely more complimentary about her own elevation .
One minister branded her ' bonkers ' on Monday after she said the financial meltdown might not have happened if there had been more women in merchant banks .
Several Labour
MPs who refused to join the plot against Gordon Brown 's leadership in June declared that they had been concerned they would end up with ' prime minister Harriet ' .
One ministerial aide said : ' The party is divided and people can't agree on a successor .
The one thing everyone agrees on is that it must not be Harriet .
The last week has been proof of that in spades . '
The student union at Oaksterdam University in downtown Oakland was buzzing yesterday afternoon as several dozen people gathered together with Marijuana is Safer authors Paul Armentano of NORML and Mason Tvert of SAFER to celebrate the brand new book 's release .
( Co-author Steve Fox of MPP was on the East Coast .
The book also boasts a foreword by Norm Stamper , the former police chief of Seattle . )
After an hour or so of schmoozing , book selling , and signing , Armentano and Tvert were joined by Oaksterdam 's Greg Grimala for an informal discussion about the book , whose thesis -- that marijuana is safer than alcohol -- is an outgrowth of work originally done by Tvert as he organized college campuses around the issue of inequality in punishments for students got smoking pot as opposing to underage drinking .
Armentano , who has been keeping a keen eye on marijuana research for years , supplies much of the hard science .
" The fact that we 're even having this discussion is a measure of marijuana 's relative harmlessness , " Tvert pointed out , adding that he thought the alcohol vs. marijuana comparison was an excellent tactic .
" Parents can understand alcohol , and we can make the comparison between it and marijuana .
Within that framework , you get them to start thinking about marijuana the same way they think of alcohol .
The discussion of alcohol provides a reference point , and that will only further the debate . "
Tvert will be hitting the road to promote the book in coming weeks .
Armentano said yesterday the book was shipping to bookstores in the East now and would be showing up on the West Coast soon .
He also said he had directed that a review copy be sent to StoptheDrugWar.org , so look for a book review here next week .
( The Chronicle is on vacation this week . )

If you follow these steps , you wo n’t have this worry .
1. Piggy Bank
Yes , piggy banks are not out of style .
One of the best ways to accumulate savings is to always keep your spare change in a piggy bank .
When the piggy bank gets full , exchange these coins to cash .
Once you have the cash , you wonder how much cash you should keep .
Should you put some in the bank ?
We suggest keeping all of it in cash .
A small piggy bank may bring you a few hundred dollars .
Whereas a large piggy bank may bring in $ 1,000 .
The purpose of a piggy bank is to save for emergencies .
Assume that all money that accumulates in your piggy bank should be saved and kept in cash at home .
2. How Much Should I Save ?
What about the other options apart from putting loose change into a piggy bank ?
You might be wondering how much you should save from your salaries and investments .
The best way to calculate this is to first calculate the average of your monthly bills .
You should aim to have this amount plus a half ( at the very least ) saved up at any time .

We also encourage you not to keep withdrawing from your investments .
After all , they are meant to be held in the long term .
However , it may help to withdraw up to 10 % per year of your investments .
For example , if you made a profit of $ 5,000 in cryptocurrencies in a year , withdraw $ 500 , and keep it in cash .
If your returns are bigger , you may consider withdrawing each month as opposed to each year .
You may also want to look into holding your emergency cash in various currencies in case the dollar or any other currency loses its value .

Supporters of defeated presidential candidate Mir Hossein Mousavi gather in downtown Tehran on Wednesday for a fifth day of protests against the victory of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in Friday 's election .
( ( Reuters ) )
As tens of thousands of supporters of reformist leader Mir Hossein Mousavi gathered in Tehran Wednesday , Iran accused the United States of " intolerable " meddling in its internal affairs .
The White House dismissed the allegation .
President Barack Obama has been clear that there is " a vigorous debate in Iran , between Iranians , about their leadership , " spokesman Robert Gibbs said , adding Obama stands by his defence of democratic principles including the right of people to demonstrate peacefully .
Mousavi has accused Iran 's government of rigging the election in favour of hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
The two countries broke off diplomatic relations after the 1979 Islamic Revolution .
The government summoned the Swiss ambassador , who represents U.S. interests in Iran , to complain about American interference , according to an English - language state - run channel .
Meanwhile , Mousavi 's supporters gathered in Tehran 's central Haft-e Tir Square for a silent protest , even as authorities warned citizens against promoting the rallies online .

Most of the demonstrators dressed in black with green wristbands and headbands as they quietly flashed victory signs with their hands , witnesses said .
The gathering formed as Mousavi posted a message online calling for another mass rally on Thursday .
The message on Mousavi 's official website is seen as a direct challenge to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , who said Tuesday night that the opposition leader should pursue his demands through the country 's electoral system .
Khamenei also called on Iranians to unite behind their Islamic government as demonstrations continued over Friday 's disputed presidential election results .
' Deviant news sites '
After Khamenei's appeal , the Revolutionary Guard , an elite military force answering to Khamenei , issued a statement on the state news service on Wednesday ordering any material that " creates tension " and encourages public disturbance and street riots be removed from Iranian websites and blogs .
Sites and bloggers who do not heed the warning will face legal action , the Revolutionary Guard said .
The statement also alleged the " deviant news sites " were backed by Canadian , American and British interests .
Iranian websites , as well as blogs , Facebook and Twitter , have been vital conduits for Iranians to inform the world about protests over the apparent landslide victory for Ahmadinejad .
All three of Ahmadinejad 's challengers in Friday 's election have alleged fraud after results showed the president winning by a 2 - to - 1 margin .
Protesters to gather at mosques
Iranian authorities have also restricted all journalists working for foreign media from first - hand reporting on the streets in an attempt to block images and eyewitness accounts from the rallies .
Mousavi's online message condemned the government 's attempt to block the websites , saying the government did not tolerate the voice of the opposition .
" We are after a peaceful rally to protest the unhealthy trend of the elections and realize our goal of annulling the election results , " Mousavi said .
Demonstrators should gather in mosques on Thursday to express solidarity with the families of the people killed in post-election unrest , the online statement said , urging his supporters to remain peaceful .
Mousavi said he would take part in Thursday 's rally , but did not give details on when and where .
Supporters on both sides have taken to the streets in demonstrations and escalating violence that has seen at least seven people killed since the election .
Partial recount
The Guardian Council announced on Tuesday that it will conduct a partial recount of ballots at voting sites where candidates claim irregularities occurred .
According to government officials , Ahmadinejad won 62.6 per cent of the vote , while Mousavi garnered 33.75 per cent in a contest that appeared to divide urban and rural voters .
Mousavi has called the election an " astonishing charade " and demanded again on Tuesday its results be annulled and the vote be held again .
His representative , reformist cleric Ali Akbar Mohtashamipour , reiterated that demand after a meeting of the Guardian Council , an unelected body of 12 clerics and Islamic law experts close to the supreme leader and seen as supportive of Ahmadinejad .
" If the whole people become aware , avoid violent measures and continue their civil confrontation with that , they will win .
No power can stand up to people 's will , " Mohtashamipour said .
" I do not think that the Guardian Council will have the courage to stand against people . "
Gordon Brown 's authority was hanging in the balance today after the defence secretary , John Hutton , became the fourth cabinet minister to tender his resignation .
As the prime minister began a make or break reshuffle in an attempt to shore up his increasingly beleaguered premiership , Hutton announced he was to stand down from the government for " family reasons " .
He will leave parliament at the next general election .
His decision is another blow to Brown , not least because Hutton is the fourth Blairite cabinet minister to stand down in four days .
His resignation follows those of Jacqui Smith , Hazel Blears and James Purnell .
Alan Johnson , tipped as the most likely successor to Brown should he resign as prime minister , is to be rewarded for his loyalty in recent days with the key post of home secretary , moving from health .
But in a blow to Ed Balls , the children 's secretary and Brown 's key ally , the weakened prime minister was expected to allow Alistair Darling to retain his post as chancellor .
The justice secretary , Jack Straw , was also expected to remain in place , while Yvette Cooper was tipped to be promoted from chief secretary to the Treasury .
Today , more backbenchers echoed Purnell 's call for Brown to go amid suggestions that up to 100 Labour MPs were prepared to call for him to quit .
The first results from yesterday 's local elections compounded the crisis surrounding Downing Street , with the party losing 23 seats and holding only 20 .
Bristol fell into Liberal Democrat hands after Labour lost eight of the ten seats it was contesting in the city .
But after the resignation of Purnell , the work and pensions secretary , as the polls closed at 10 pm yesterday , Brown was given a boost by other cabinet ministers . .
Johnson released a short statement to the Press Association , insisting : " I continue to believe that Gordon Brown is the best man for the job .
" It is vital now , more than ever , that we unite for the sake of the party and the government . "
David Miliband , a close ally of Purnell 's , indicated that he would not be resigning from the government .
He is expected to remain as the foreign secretary .
Meanwhile , Darling – who endured speculation earlier this week that he was going to be removed from the Treasury – has yet to comment .
Last night , Purnell gave the prime minister only moments notice of his departure as work and pensions secretary , which was announced in an open letter published in the media .
The leading Blairite plunged the government deeper into crisis by saying Brown 's removal was needed to give Labour " a fighting chance " of victory at the general election .
" I now believe that your continued leadership makes a Conservative victory more , not less , likely , " he wrote .
" We need to show that we are prepared to fight to be a credible government and have the courage to offer an alternative future .
" I am therefore calling on you to stand aside to give our party a fighting chance of winning .
As such , I am resigning from government . "
His move was welcomed by backbenchers including Siobhain McDonagh , who was sacked as a whip after calling for a leadership election last year , and the Nottingham North MP , Graham Allen .
Allen said he hoped Brown would " take the honourable way out so that the party can progress with a leadership election " .
The Labour backbencher Paul Farrelly said Purnell 's actions were " courageous " .
" I 'm not particularly close to him personally or politically , but I think what he 's done is a courageous act , and reluctantly , and very sadly , his assessment is correct , " he told BBC Radio 4 's Today programme .
The senior backbencher Barry Sheerman , the chairman of the schools select committee , called for a secret ballot of Labour MPs on Brown 's future , which he predicted would result in a majority vote for the prime minister to go .
The Conservatives demanded an immediate general election , calling on Brown to go to Buckingham Palace today to ask for a dissolution of parliament .
David Cameron , the Tory leader , said the government was " falling apart in front of our eyes " .
In a statement , Downing Street said Brown was " disappointed " by Purnell 's decision but was giving his " undivided attention " to the big challenges facing the country .
Those defending the prime minister and criticising Purnell included the cabinet ministers Straw , John Hutton , Geoff Hoon , Shaun Woodward and Andy Burnham , as well as the Cabinet Office minister , Liam Byrne , the housing minister , Margaret Beckett , and a host of whips , junior ministers and backbenchers .
Cooper said Purnell had been guilty of a " misjudgment " .
She said : " I just profoundly disagree with James .
I 've known James a long time , for 20 years , and I just think he 's made a misjudgment about this .
" I also think he does n't speak for the cabinet , for the Labour party , for the ordinary members that I was out door - knocking with yesterday evening .
" I 'm not going to pretend this is n't a difficult morning for us , but I think that Gordon Brown , all the work he 's been doing on the economy , all the work to deal with the expenses problems , he 's the right person to lead us through this . "
Douglas Alexander , the international development secretary , told BBC Radio 4 : " I believe Gordon Brown is the right person to lead the party .
" At the moment , the country would not look favourable on a party that turned in on itself ... my interest is what ultimately is the right thing for the country .
" I do not believe the best interests of the party are served if Gordon Brown is removed as leader . "
But many of the supportive emails issued were almost identically worded , fuelling suspicions that they were part of a Downing Street effort to bolster Brown 's position .
However , other MPs were clearly outraged at the cabinet infighting at a time when grassroots activists were out campaigning for Labour in the elections .
The Morecambe and Lunesdale MP , Geraldine Smith , said : " I am absolutely furious at the gross disloyalty of these people .
" Most Labour MPs in the parliamentary Labour party are still backing Gordon Brown , and there is a small bunch of malcontents who are out to do as much damage as possible .
It is disgraceful . "
And the former deputy prime minister John Prescott used a message on the Labourhome blog to dismiss Purnell as " not so much a Blairite as a careerite " .
SOUTHWEST ASIA ( unspecified location ) –
At the heart of the high - tech , wired - to - the - hilt American air war in Afghanistan is a rusting plane so old - school , it predates John F. Kennedy 's term in the White House .
I 'm in front of a matte - gray jet , designed to deliver gas to the rest of the American air armada as it buzzes over Central Asia and the Middle East .
Every day , the KC - 135 tankers here haul a million pounds of fuel .
Without them , the fighter jets , bombers and airborne haulers circling above Afghanistan and Iraq would drop out of the sky .
That 's a pretty heavy burden for a bunch of old - timers – this plane was built in 1960 .
" And this is one of the newer ones , " says Captain Nick LaPlant , as we walk past rusting flaps and visibly loose panels .
" It 's absolutely amazing it stays in the air still . "
The cockpit is even more startling .
" Time capsule : does n't begin to describe it .
The navigator 's desk is held together by duct tape .
The seats are covered with Mad Men-era light shag .
There 's even a sextant still embedded in the ceiling of the cockpit – in case anyone needs to navigate by starlight .
Yet somehow , 91 percent of these tankers are ready to fly on a given day .
( For the rest of the Air Force , that number is often in the 70s . )
It 's a testament to the 400 - man maintenance team here , which not only tightens bolts and replaces blown tires .
They are constantly making new ailerons and gears from scratch for the plane .
The 135s are so old , some of the parts are n't even made any more .
So sometimes the " fabrication flight " here runs a laser - tipped claw over an old tube – scanning the specs into a computer - aided design program , from which they can burn a new piece .
Or the flight uses a giant 32 - bit robotic turret , to pound precision holes .
Or they just do it the old - fashioned way and bend metal .
Now , not everything in the 135 is ancient .
The avionics are new .
Sensors turn the crew 's cabin into a " glass cockpit , " so they can see underneath the plane .
This particular plane has extra communications gear installed , for special operations missions .
Its CFM - 109 engines are relative whippersnappers , installed in the 1980s .
Still , taking a tour of these planes only reinforces the utter and complete negligence of the folks in the Pentagon and in Congress who have managed for the better part of a decade to screw up the project to replace these creaking gas - haulers .
The nearly $ 100 - billion contract for the next generation of tankers has not been awarded yet , despite countless attempts .
And the current crop will be around for a whole lot longer .
" They tell us the mother of the last 135 pilot has n't been born yet .
We expect to be flying these planes quite a few years longer , " LaPlant says .
I tell LaPlant he must 've misspoken – the mother of the last pilot ?
That 's …
" Unfathomable , yeah . "

BOSTON ( Reuters ) - Harvard University announced 275 job cuts on Tuesday , the latest cost - cutting measure at the world ’s richest university after the financial crisis triggered big losses in its multibillion - dollar endowment .
The Ivy League school took the action to meet budget constraints caused by an estimated 30 percent fall in its endowment for its 2009 fiscal year , ending June 30 .
The cuts mostly affect administrative , clerical and technical jobs and will take place this week and next , Marilyn Hausammann , vice president for human resources , said in an e-mail to staff and faculty .
Another 40 staff were offered reduced work hours .
While the layoffs affect a fraction of Harvard ’s 16,000 staff and faculty , they illustrate the recession ’s toll on America ’s oldest institute of higher learning and other universities which depend on endowments and donations .
Harvard ’s endowment , which stood at $ 37 billion on June , 30 last year , tumbled to $ 29 billion by December and is projected to end this month at about $ 25 billion , hit by volatility in financial markets and a drop in donations .
The endowment funded about a third of Harvard ’s operating budget in 2008 .
Harvard has also taken other steps to cut costs , including keeping salaries flat for more than 9,000 faculty and staff in the 2009 - 10 academic year .
More than 500 staff opted for voluntary early retirement under a program offered earlier this year , said Harvard President Drew Faust .
A 30 - day external hiring freeze has been implemented for staff jobs .
“ All of the steps that we have taken to reduce spending over the past six months have been taken with the aim of sustaining the academic and organizational capabilities Harvard will need for the future , while minimizing the impact on our workforce , ” Hausammann said .
On average , U.S. colleges lost 24 percent of their endowments in the second half of last year , according to the Commonfund Institute , which polled 629 educational endowments .

Honda ’s Prius - killer is looking a lot like road kill .
When it debuted in March , Honda Motor Corp .'s retooled Insight hybrid looked to be the first serious challenger to the Prius , Toyota Motor Corp .'s ecological wunder - car .
Graced with a low price , 40 - mpg - plus fuel economy and the Japanese automaker ’s reputation for quality , the Insight even looked like the Prius .
Instead , all the Insight has delivered is a flurry of bad reviews and four months of dismal sales capped by a thorough battering at the hands of the Prius , whose third generation was launched in the U.S. last month .
Increasingly , the Insight is looking like the latest in a series of hybrid frustrations for Honda .
“ We ’re all pretty disappointed .
We thought we had the next hit on our hands , ” said Don Marino , general manager of Honda of Santa Monica .
Advertisement
Marino said he was selling five to 10 Insights a month , far less than the 30 or so he expected to move .
Throughout the country , Americans bought 2,079 Insights in June , bringing total sales of the streamlined hatchback since March to 7,524 , according to Autodata Corp .
At that rate , Honda will sell less than a third of its goal of 90,000 in the first 12 months .
By comparison , the higher - priced Prius was snapped up by 12,998 drivers last month .
Since March , Toyota has sold 40,398 of the gas - sippers .
The poor sales figures are all the more humbling because Honda was the first automaker to bring hybrids to the U.S. a decade ago , with an earlier version of the Insight .
Yet although Honda products almost always score well with consumers and car enthusiasts , it just ca n’t seem to get green right .

Weak sales forced the Japanese automaker to abandon an earlier two - seat Insight .
Its powerful six - cylinder Accord hybrid had unimpressive gas mileage and was killed after three years .
Combined , the two vehicles mustered scarcely 45,000 deliveries worldwide .
Meanwhile , the hybrid version of its popular Civic sedan , which Honda says it originally introduced to battle the Prius , has logged just a fifth as many sales as its rival .
“ Honda just has n’t had a cogent hybrid strategy at all , ” said Eric Noble , president of Car Lab , a product planning and research firm .
Noble is n’t sure why Honda has stumbled , but what is clear is that other automakers are gaining ever - larger footholds in the hybrid market .
Ford Motor Co. is making huge strides thanks to its highly regarded new Fusion hybrid , which , despite a price tag nearly $ 10,000 more than the Insight ’s , had June sales on par with the Honda offering .
General Motors Co. and Nissan Motor Co. both offer hybrids .
Germany ’s Daimler , maker of Mercedes - Benz , and even South Korea ’s Hyundai Motor Co. are preparing to enter the hybrid race .
Advertisement
Toyota remains the king , with a fleet of six hybrids including Lexus models , and the hybrid - only Lexus HS sedan on the way .
Honda ’s next hybrid offering , meanwhile , is a head scratcher : the CR - Z , a two - seat sports coupe aimed at one of the smallest - volume segments of the market .
Honda contends that it never intended for the Insight to compete with the Prius , which has logged more than 1.25 million sales worldwide since it first went on sale in Japan in 1997 .
Instead , spokesman Chris Martin said , Honda specifically targeted the Insight at a lower price point -- it starts at $ 19,800 compared with $ 22,000 for the Prius -- in hopes of winning over a new segment of penny - pinching would - be hybrid buyers .
Honda ’s annual sales expectations of 90,000 units are half those of Toyota ’s for the Prius .
But with gasoline prices low right now , Martin said that price - conscious buyers are waiting on the sidelines .
Advertisement
“ Insight is the value hybrid , whereas the Prius is designed to be more whiz - bang , ” he said .
Martin contends that the two cars have little in common , and Consumer Reports appears to agree .
It rated the Insight second to last among small hatchbacks in its August issue , behind the Chrysler PT Cruiser and the Scion Xd .
The magazine critiqued the Insight ’s handling , lack of interior room and cargo space , calling it a “ noisy car with a stiff ride and clumsy handling . ”
The Prius , meanwhile , ranked third .
And while the Insight gets a respectable 41 mpg , the new Prius reaches 50 mpg -- thanks in part to its more advanced hybrid technology .
The Prius has a powerful electric motor that by itself can propel the car at speeds of up to 34 mph .
The Honda , on the other hand , uses the electric motor as an assist ; its gas engine is always running when the car is in motion .
The Prius also has more horsepower , seating room and trunk space , plus snazzy features like a solar - powered sunroof .
“ Honda has learned from its mistakes in the hybrid market , but maybe it ’s learned the wrong lessons , ” said Jake Fisher , senior engineer at Consumer Union , which publishes Consumer Reports .

The Prius and Insight do have one thing indisputably in common : looks .
The Prius has drawn legions of fans , including celebrities such as Leonardo DiCaprio , with its quirky , aerodynamic shape reminiscent of an egg on wheels .
When Honda revealed its Insight at the Paris auto show last fall , it was a case of deja vu .
“ Everybody calls it the Honda Prius , ” said Alan Katz , owner of a Long Beach business that offers wedding officiant services .
After considering both vehicles , he chose the new Prius .
Honda ’s dealers have taken note , and some have urged the automaker to reconsider its marketing strategy .
Advertisement
“ Honda needs to start telling the price story , ” said Dave Conant , president of Norm Reeves Honda , with three dealerships in the Los Angeles area .
But the Insight ’s price edge is about to get narrower .
Toyota plans to release an entry - level Prius in September priced at $ 21,000 , just $ 1,200 more than the Insight .
“ Getting into a price war is not going to work for Honda , ” said Wes Brown , vice president at auto marketing firm Iceology in Los Angeles .
“ They have to find a way to convince people to buy this car , and I do n’t know what that is . ”
Of course , the Insight does have its fans .
It has been a big hit in Japan , thanks in part to government incentives , and was the top - selling vehicle in the country in April , selling over 10,000 in one month .
Advertisement
And because of Honda ’s reputation for quality , earned over decades of selling dependable Civics and Accords , many brand loyalists in the U.S. could n’t wait to get their hands on the Insight , placing orders with dealers months before the model came out .
Peggy Etheridge , a financial advisor in Richardson , Texas , said her experience owning four consecutive Hondas made the decision easy .
“ The Prius felt too weird to me , where the Honda felt like a regular car , ” said Etheridge , who bought her Insight , complete with custom leather interior , a few weeks ago .
Industry experts , however , are n’t so easily impressed .

“ In a world where other hybrids are getting better and better , Honda is increasingly in a disadvantaged position , ” said Jim Hall , managing director of industry consulting firm 2953 Analytics .
“ The Insight is not going to reverse that course . ”

Enlarge 2002 AFP / Getty Images photo Millvina Dean was just over 2 months old when the Titanic sank less than three horus after hitting an iceberg off Newfoundland April 14 , 1912 .
LONDON ( AP )  Millvina Dean , the last survivor of the sinking of RMS Titanic , has died , her friend Gunter Babler said Sunday .
She was 97 years old , and she died where she had lived — in Southampton , England , the city her family had tried to leave behind when it took the ship 's ill - fated maiden voyage , bound for America .
She died in her sleep early Sunday , her friend Gunter Babler told the Associated Press .
It was the 98th anniversary of the launch of the ship that was billed as " practically unsinkable . "
Babler said Dean 's longtime companion , Bruno Nordmanis , called him in Switzerland to say staff at Woodlands Ridge Nursing Home in Southampton discovered Dean in her room Sunday morning .
He said she had been hospitalized with pneumonia last week but she had recovered and returned to the home .
A staff nurse at the nursing home said late Sunday that no one would comment until administrators came on duty Monday morning .
Dean just over 2 months old when the Titanic hit an iceberg on the night of April 14 , 1912 .
The ship sank in less than three hours .
Dean was one of 706 people — mostly women and children — who survived .
Her father was among the 1,517 who died .
Babler , who is head of the Switzerland Titanic Society , said Dean was a " very good friend of very many years . "
" I met her through the Titanic society but she became a friend and I went to see very every month or so , " he said .
The pride of the White Star line , the Titanic had a mahogany - paneled smoking room , a swimming pool and a squash court .
But it did not have enough lifeboats for all of its 2,200 passengers and crew .
Dean 's family were steerage passengers setting out from the English port of Southampton for a new life in the United States .
Her father had sold his pub and hoped to open a tobacconists ' shop in Kansas City , Missouri , where his wife had relatives .
Initially scheduled to travel on another ship , the family was transferred to the Titanic because of a coal strike .
Four days out of port and about 380 miles southeast of Newfoundland , the ship hit an iceberg .
The impact buckled the Titanic 's hull and sent sea water pouring into six of its supposedly watertight compartments .
Dean said her father 's quick actions saved his family .
He felt the ship scrape the iceberg and hustled the family out of its third - class quarters and toward the lifeboat that would take them to safety .
" That 's partly what saved us — because he was so quick .
Some people thought the ship was unsinkable , " Dean told the British Broadcasting Corp. in 1998 .
Wrapped in a sack against the Atlantic chill , Dean was lowered into a lifeboat .
Her 2 - year - old brother Bertram and her mother Georgette also survived .
" She said goodbye to my father and he said he'd be along later , " Dean said in 2002 .
" I was put into lifeboat 13 .
It was a bitterly cold night and eventually we were picked up by the Carpathia . "
The family was taken to New York , then returned to England with other survivors aboard the rescue ship Adriatic .
Dean did not know she had been aboard the Titanic until she was 8 years old , when her mother , about to remarry , told her about her father 's death .
Her mother , always reticent about the tragedy , died in 1975 at age 95 .
Born in London on Feb. 2 , 1912 , Elizabeth Gladys " Millvina " Dean spent most of her life in the English seaside town of Southampton , Titanic 's home port .
She never married , and worked as a secretary , retiring in 1972 from an engineering firm .
She moved into a nursing home after breaking her hip about three years ago .
She had to sell several Titanic mementoes to raise funds , prompting her friends to set up a fund to subsidize her nursing home fees .
Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet , the stars of the film Titanic , pledged their support to the fund last month .
For most of her life Dean had no contact with Titanic enthusiasts and rarely spoke about the disaster .
Dean said she had seen the 1958 film A Night to Remember with other survivors , but found it so upsetting that she declined to watch any other attempts to put the disaster on celluloid , including the 1997 blockbuster Titanic .
She began to take part in Titanic - related activities in the 1980s , after the discovery of the ship 's wreck in 1985 sparked renewed interest in the disaster .
At a memorial service in England , Dean met a group of American Titanic enthusiasts who invited her to a meeting in the U.S.
She visited Belfast to see where the ship was built , attended Titanic conventions around the world — where she was mobbed by autograph seekers — and participated in radio and television documentaries about the sinking .
Charles Haas , president of the New - Jersey based Titanic International Society , said Dean was happy to talk to children about the Titanic .
" She had a soft spot for children , " he said .
" I remember watching was little tiny children came over clutching pieces of paper for her to sign .
She was very good with them , very warm . "
In 1997 , Dean crossed the Atlantic by boat for the first time , on the QEII luxury liner , and finally visited Kansas City , declaring it " so lovely I could stay here five years . "
She was active well into her 90s , but missed the commemoration of the 95th anniversary of the disaster in 2007 after breaking her hip .
Dean had no memories of the sinking and said she preferred it that way .
" I would n't want to remember , really , " she told The Associated Press in 1997 .
She opposed attempts to raise the wreck 13,000 feet from the sea bed .
" I do n't want them to raise it , I think the other survivors would say exactly the same , " she said in 1997 .
" That would be horrible . "
The last survivor with memories of the sinking — and the last American survivor — was Lillian Asplund , who was 5 at the time .
She died in May 2006 at the age of 99 .
The second - last survivor , Barbara Joyce West Dainton of Truro , England , died in October 2007 aged 96 .

The truth at last – abstinence - only programmes make the situation worse
To the surprise of few outside the rarefied world of the Religious Right , it has emerged that George W Bush ’s “ abstinence only ” policies led directly to a rise in teenage pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases .
The Centres for Disease Control ( CDC ) says that after years of falling rates , teen pregnancies and STDs started rising after Bush was re-elected in 2005 .
According to the CDC , birth rates among teenagers aged 15 or older had been in decline since 1991 but rose sharply in more than half of American states after 2005 .
The number of teenage girls with syphilis had risen by nearly half after a big decrease , while a 20 - year fall in the gonorrhea infection rate was being reversed .
AIDS cases in adolescent boys had nearly doubled .
The CDC says southern states ( the Bible Belt ) tend to have the highest rates of teenage pregnancy and STDs .
In addition , about 16,000 pregnancies were reported among girls aged 10 - 14 in 2004 and a similar number of young people in the age group reported having a sexually transmitted disease .
Some of the statistics the CDC report reveals :
75 % of teens will have sex prior to their 20th birthday .
The teenage birth rate in the US is the highest in the developed world .
1/3 of youths have not received any instruction on methods of birth control before the age of 18 .
The number of teen pregnancies is double in areas where abstinence is the only method of birth control taught as opposed to areas where there is comprehensive sex education and condoms are handed out .
The organisation Planned Parenthood said the report was alarming and that teenagers needed “ medically accurate , age - appropriate , comprehensive sex education ” .
However , religious proponents of the “ abstinence - only ” policies still insist that the reason for the rise is because their policies were not promoted hard enough ..

The nation ’s largest business lobby wants to put the science of global warming on trial .
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce , trying to ward off potentially sweeping federal emissions regulations , is pushing the Environmental Protection Agency to hold a rare public hearing on the scientific evidence for man-made climate change .
Chamber officials say it would be “ the Scopes monkey trial of the 21st century ” -- complete with witnesses , cross-examinations and a judge who would rule , essentially , on whether humans are warming the planet to dangerous effect .
“ It would be evolution versus creationism , ” said William Kovacs , the chamber ’s senior vice president for environment , technology and regulatory affairs .
“ It would be the science of climate change on trial . ”

The goal of the chamber , which represents 3 million large and small businesses , is to fend off potential emissions regulations by undercutting the scientific consensus over climate change .
If the EPA denies the request , as expected , the chamber plans to take the fight to federal court .
The EPA is having none of it , calling a hearing a “ waste of time ” and saying that a threatened lawsuit by the chamber would be “ frivolous . ”
EPA spokesman Brendan Gilfillan said the agency based its proposed finding that global warming is a danger to public health “ on the soundest peer - reviewed science available , which overwhelmingly indicates that climate change presents a threat to human health and welfare . ”
Environmentalists say the chamber ’s strategy is an attempt to sow political discord by challenging settled science -- and note that in the famed 1925 Scopes trial , which pitted lawyers Clarence Darrow and William Jennings Bryan in a courtroom battle over a Tennessee science teacher accused of teaching evolution illegally , the scientists won in the end .

The chamber proposal “ brings to mind for me the Salem witch trials , based on myth , ” said Brenda Ekwurzel , a climate scientist for the environmental group Union of Concerned Scientists .
“ In this case , it would be ignoring decades of publicly accessible evidence . ”
In the coming weeks , the EPA is set to formally declare that the heat - trapping gases scientists blame for climate change endanger human health , and are thus subject to regulation under the Clean Air Act .
The so - called endangerment finding will be a cornerstone of the Obama administration ’s plan to set strict new emissions standards on cars and trucks .
The proposed finding has drawn more than 300,000 public comments .
Many of them question scientists ’ projections that rising temperatures will lead to increased mortality rates , harmful pollution and extreme weather events such as hurricanes .
In light of those comments , the chamber will tell the EPA in a filing today that a trial - style public hearing , which is allowed under the law but nearly unprecedented on this scale , is the only way to “ make a fully informed , transparent decision with scientific integrity based on the actual record of the science . ”

Most climate scientists agree that greenhouse gas emissions , caused by the burning of fossil fuels and other human activities , are warming the planet .
Using computer models and historical temperature data , those scientists predict the warming will accelerate unless greenhouse gas emissions are dramatically reduced .
“ The need for urgent action to address climate change is now indisputable , ” said a recent letter to world leaders by the heads of the top science agencies in 13 of the world ’s largest countries , including the head of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences .
The EPA ’s endangerment finding for greenhouse gases , as proposed in April , warned that warmer temperatures would lead to “ the increased likelihood of more frequent and intense heat waves , more wildfires , degraded air quality , more heavy downpours and flooding , increased drought , greater sea level rise , more intense storms , harm to water resources , harm to agriculture , and harm to wildlife and ecosystems . ”
Critics of the finding say it ’s far from certain that warming will cause any harm at all .
The Chamber of Commerce cites studies that predict higher temperatures will reduce mortality rates in the United States .

My guest blogger is David Wilson , a fellow fan of sequences .
It is a nice exercise to understand how this graph works .
When you do , you will discover that you can use this graph to calculate the remainders of numbers modulo 7 . Back to David Wilson :
I have attached a picture of a graph .
Write down a number n.
Start at the small white node at the bottom of the graph .
For each digit d in n , follow d black arrows in a succession , and as you move from one digit to the next , follow 1 white arrow .
For example , if n = 325 , follow 3 black arrows , then 1 white arrow , then 2 black arrows , then 1 white arrow , and finally 5 black arrows .
If you end up back at the white node , n is divisible by 7 .
Nothing earth - shattering , but I was pleased that the graph was planar .

Rupert Murdoch has “ always been bold , ” said Andrew Sullivan in The Atlantic , and his newest plan — to charge for the content on all his news websites by next summer — certainly reinforces that reputation .
His experiment will probably “ drastically reduce ” online readership at the New York Post , The Times of London , and his other newspapers and tabloids , but it could “ conceivably save newspapers as we ’ve known them . ”
Then again , “ it may end in tears . ”
Well , Murdoch does have some good points , said Ben Parr in Mashable .
“ Good journalism is n’t cheap , ” and the current ad - based model is n’t holding up well .
And if his gamble pays off , it will certainly be followed by other news sites .
But it ’s a risky move .
“ Murdoch must see something encouraging at the WSJ , ” which already charges for access .
Specialist news sites like Murdoch ’s Wall Street Journal and Financial Times can , and do , charge for their content , said Jeff Jarvis in Britain ’s The Guardian , but for most online newspapers , putting content behind a pay wall “ is not only futile but possibly suicidal . ”
Newspapers have had 15 years to adjust to the “ post - Gutenberg ” new media “ link economy . ”
Maybe we “ should ” pay to read the news , “ but I ’ve never heard a business plan built on the verb ‘ should . ’ ”

I have been in bed with the doctor for two weeks and he does n’t do me any good .
If things do n’t improve I will have to send for another doctor .
Origins :
As is typical with such humorous lists of supposedly “ real - life ” examples , the howlers are written by women , a circumstance which invokes the widely - believed stereotype of illiterate welfare moms and thus makes the compilation appear more believable .
Could these have come off real
social assistance applications ?
Anything is possible , of course , but we can only note that this list has been circulating in various forms for decades , with new entries being added and old ones dropped off while various attributions have been added and subtracted throughout the years .
For example , the entry about the woman who has n’t had any relief since the husband ’s project was cut off appeared in a collection of funny letters circulated since the 1930s , in which it was headed : “ Dere Mr. President . ”
Likewise , the entries about the unclothed Mrs. Jones who is visited regularly by the clergy , a mother irate that her son has been labeled an illiterate , the bus driver who works day and night to get his wife pregnant , the twins born in the envelope , and the child who was a mistake all appear in a 1967 Reader ’s Digest collection identified as “ Troubles at North Dakota State Welfare Headquarters . ”
( Included in that list but not part of the Internet version quoted above is : “ Please send my money at once as I need it badly .
I have fallen into errors with my landlady . ” )
Some of the items quoted in the example text above appear in the following list found in a 1954 collection of folklore , entitled “ E.R.A. Howlers ” and presented as excerpts from letters received by ERA Farmers Rehabilitation Project .
My husband has worked about one shift two months ago and now he has left me , and I ain’t had no pay since he has gone , nor before either .
Please send me my elopement as I have a four months old baby and he is my only support and I kneed all I get every day to buy food and keep in close .
I am a poor woman and all I have is gone .
Both sides of my parents is very poor and I can’t expect anything from them as my mother has been in bed for one year with one doctor and she wo n’t take another .
Do I get more than I am getting ?
Please send me a letter and tell me if my husband has made applications for a wife and child .
I have already wrote to the President and if I do n’t hear from you , I will write to Uncle Sam both of you .
This is my eighth child , what are you going to do about it ?
I cannot get sick pay , I got six children , can you tell why this is ?
Mrs. Brown has no clothes for a year and has been visited regularly by the clergy .
I am glad to say my husband who has been missing is now deceased .
Sir , I am forwarding my marriage certificate and two children , one of them is a mistake .
I am writing to say that my baby was born two years old .
When do I get my money ?
Please find out for certain if my husband is dead , as the man I am living with now ca n’t eat or do anything until he knows for sure .
I am very annoyed to find that you have branded my oldest child as illiterate .
It is a dirty shame and a lie , as I married his father a week before he was born .
You have changed my little girl to a boy , will this make any difference ?
I have no children as yet as my husband is a bus driver and works day and nite .
In accordance with your instructions I have given birth to a boy that weighs 101 pounds .
I hope this is satisfactory .
I hope this is satisfactory .
The lady came into my office and reported this : “ I have had no relief since they cut my husband ’s project off . ”
I have two children and my husband cannot supply enough milk .
In accordance with your instructions I have given birth to twins in the enclosed envelope .
Additionally , all the entries in the Internet version quoted above were printed in an anecdotal history of the United States from 1923 - 45 published in 1988 , where they were attributed to Russell W. Ballard , director of welfare for Lake County , Indiana from 1936 to 1941 .
Real life ?
Maybe .
But a more likely conclusion to draw would be that most of these entries are more lore than truth .

Aon
August 25 , 2009
Aon Consulting surveyed more than 60 leading health care insurers , representing more than 100 million insured individuals , and found that health care costs are projected to increase by 10.4 percent for HMOs , 10.4 percent for POS plans , 10.7 percent for PPOs and 10.5 percent for CDH plans .
In addition , health care rate increases for retirees over the age of 65 are projected to be 6.6 percent for Medicare Supplement plans and 7.3 percent for Medicare Advantage plans .
http://aon.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=43&item=1676
Comment :
By Don McCanne , MD
Under the management of private insurers health care costs continue to increase at outrageous rates – this year at 10.5 percent .
With the decision of Congress to leave private insurers in charge , and with no measures that would have any major impact on slowing health care spending , it can be anticipated that these outrageous increases will continue even after reform is enacted .
The Medicare Supplement ( Medigap ) and Medicare Advantage plans are also private insurance plans , and so you might expect their increases to be similar .
In fact , though technically complex , rate setting of these plans is linked to spending in the traditional fee - for - service Medicare program .
The fact that rate increases in these programs are lower is not due to any efficiencies instituted by the private plans , but is due to greater efficiency of the public Medicare program .
In fact , there is much waste in these private Medicare programs .
The Medicare Advantage plans are overpaid deliberately to give the plans an unfair competitive advantage over the traditional Medicare program , with the intent of privatizing Medicare .
Most of the extra payment is wasted in administration and profits , and what little benefit there is should be given to all Medicare beneficiaries , not just those enrolled in these plans .
The Medigap plans provide the worst value in the private insurance market .
The insurers pay a much lower percentage of the premiums they collect for actual health care than they do in any of their other insurance product lines .
Americans would be receiving a much greater value if the benefits of the Medigap plans were rolled into the traditional Medicare program , and these wasteful private supplemental plans were totally eliminated .
This Aon report should lead to two obvious conclusions : 1 ) get the private health plans out of our Medicare program , and 2 ) replace the private employer - sponsored plans with an improved Medicare program for all of us .
If you agree , let President Obama and the members of Congress hear your message loud and clear .
Immediately .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The National Automobile Dealers Association is urging the federal government to begin shutting down the Cash for Clunkers program immediately .
In a statement released Wednesday evening , NADA said that , given the rapid pace at which deals are being done , it will be difficult to say when the program 's funds may run out .
Dealers have complained of problems and delays in getting payments due to them under the program .
But Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said earlier Wednesday that all dealers would be reimbursed .
" They 're going to get their money , " LaHood said during a press conference .
" We have the money to provide to them .
We have put an enormous number of people on the task of processing the paperwork .
There will be no car dealer that wo n't be reimbursed . "
The NADA said , in its statement , that the group had " confirmed elsewhere " that dealers would not get paid if cash ran out .
Still , the dealers ' group said that it had held meetings with officials from the Department of Transportation and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Wednesday morning in order to reiterate concerns about the program .
" As the first order of business , NADA stressed the importance of addressing - as soon as possible - how the program will end , including the possible suspension of the program , " the organization said .
NADA further warned that dealers who accept Clunkers deals at this point " face a growing risk that they may not be reimbursed .
The Senate passed a $ 2 billion extension of the Cash for Clunkers program on Thursday .
The program quickly burned through an initial $ 1 billion in funding after its official kick - off on July 24 .
So far , about $ 1.5 billion of claims have been submitted by dealers who have sold a total of about 360,000 cars .
Slow Cooker Barbecued Ribs -
These luscious , fall - off - the - bone tender ribs are prepped in a jiffy and cook long and low in the slow cooker .
I remember when I was much younger trying many times , always unsuccessfully , to cook ribs on a barbecue grill .
Either the flame was too hot and the ribs burned to a crispy , unappetizing , black piece of carbon , or the fire was too cool and the ribs sizzled away for hours becoming tough and unappetizing in the process .
I finally gave up trying and BeeBop and I just visited our local barbecue place any time we had a craving for some of that barbecued goodness .
Until ... I read an article somewhere about using your slow cooker to produce tender , perfectly cooked ribs .
It seemed quite logical to me .
Give the ribs a head start in the oven then finish them off in the slow cooker !
I was game to give it a try and this recipe is what I wound up with .
Luscious , fall - off - the - bone tender , spare ribs !

How to Make Slow Cooker Barbecued Ribs
Cover a baking pan with heavy duty aluminum foil and spray well with cooking spray .
Cut the ribs into serving sized pieces , 1 or 2 ribs per piece .
Salt and pepper well on both sides .
Place the ribs in a 400 - degree oven for 30 - 45 minutes until they have obtained a light golden brown color .
Place a single layer of ribs in your slow cooker .
Spoon over about 1 /2 cup barbecue sauce of your choice .
Continue layering ribs and sauce .
Notice the sauce I 'm using above ?
This is my family 's barbecue sauce .
The recipe has been handed down for several generations and I truly do n't know anyone else who makes the same sauce as ours .
It is a vinegar and tomato based sauce and we really enjoy it , although it 's not everyone 's cup of tea .
You just use whatever recipe or purchased brand you like best !
Cover the slow cooker and cook on the lowest heat setting for approximately 6 hours .
Be sure to stir the pot once during the cooking time to prevent the sauce and ribs from burning .
I used spareribs for this recipe , but I expect it would work equally well for baby backs .
Easiest method I 've ever seen for cooking ribs !
Enjoy !

Why did bigot Pastor Rick Warren — whose flip - flopping on his opposition to gay marriage is as entertaining as it is insulting — cancel his appearance on yesterday ’s This Week with George Stephanopoulos ?
His camp told the expecting show host that Warren was “ sick with exhaustion . ”
Now the situation was been detailed :
His condition was “ exacerbated by inhalation of fumes from the newly refurbished ( but still drying ) pulpit used in the televised services the previous night . ”
And not because he did n’t want to talk about gay marriage AGAIN .
Get better , Rick , because your charade is n’t over yet .
The romantic holiday isle of Capri lies in the Gulf of Naples
A Swedish couple in search of the isle of Capri drove to Carpi , an industrial town in northern Italy , because they misspelt the name in their car 's GPS .
Italian officials say the couple asked at Carpi 's tourist office where they could find Capri 's famous Blue Grotto .
The car 's sat nav system had sent them 650 km ( 400 miles ) off course to Carpi .
" Capri is an island .
They did not even wonder why they did n't cross any bridge or take any boat , " said a bemused tourism official in Carpi .
Once they realised their mistake , the couple got back in their car and headed south , the official added .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - A Connecticut church may operate a postal station without violating the constitutional separation of church and state , as long as it clearly distinguishes it from private space , a federal appeals court ruled on Thursday .
A panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the church in the town of Manchester did violate the U.S. Constitution by including “ religious displays ” such as prayer cards , pamphlets and church - related videos inside a postal station it had set up .
But it said the church could fix the violations by removing the displays and providing markers that make clear to customers where the postal station ends and church property begins .
Bertram Cooper , a former Manchester resident , had sued the Full Gospel Interdenominational Church and the U.S. Postal Service in 2003 , saying the displays made him “ very uncomfortable ” and constituted government - sponsored religious activity .
A district court judge in 2007 invalidated the displays and the church ’s offer to fix some violations .
The appeals court vacated that decision .
Chief Judge Dennis Jacobs wrote for the appellate panel that certain displays in the postal unit were religious and therefore illegal .
But the mere fact a postal station is located inside a religious facility , or sponsored by a religious entity , did not violate the Constitution , the ruling said .
The Postal Service allows postal units to be set up on private property in rural areas that cannot sustain full - service offices .
The appeals court directed the church to ensure that the postal counter , post office boxes and shelving are free of religious material .
It also ordered the installation of a barrier to make clear where the postal facility ends .
Both sides expressed support for the ruling and the church ’s lawyer said he expected it would be able to comply .
Typical antagonists come and go ; some are in the form of Super Villains , and others are maybe just annoying animals .
But no decent hero can really reach his or her intended moxie without someone or something acting as the nemesis .
And as we all know , there is but one archenemy - type that truly stands out as the most diabolical , most over - all aggravating , and all around completely exasperating : The Mad Scientist .
Over the course of comic and cartoon history , it seems that nearly every one worth its pulpy salt has usurped some kind of Mad Scientist .
From the early days of Fleischer ’s animated Superman toons to the dastardly rogues gallery in Batman , Mad ’s have played major rolls in the sheer lunacy of ill - conceived plot lines .
So , without further ado ( and without using any of the more common Comic Book villains ) here are eighteen of the greatest animated Mad Scientists from Television
.
Fritz Huhnmorder ( Robot Chicken )
Let ’s start off really simply .
Fritz is the evil doctor at the beginning who straps the road - killed chicken - come - android to the chair and makes him watch as much Pop Culture as possible … hence : Robot Chicken !
Bighead ( The Ambiguously Gay Duo )
As his name so rightly implies , Bighead has an enormous melon with which he concocts many of the ridiculous schemes that are , somehow , intended to not only trap Ace and Gary , but also out their blatantly obvious , yet rug - swept gayness .
As smart as he is , he still manages to lose his cool trying his best to get everyone to see Ace and Gary for who they really are .
Well , they are n’t .
Right ?
Dr. Alphonse Mephisto ( South Park )
Fully referencing Marlon Brando ’s character in the re-make of The Island of Dr. Moreau , Dr. Mephisto spends his days coming up with odd combinations of hybrid animals , as well .
Yes , he even once , claiming animals with one buttocks are doomed , created a seven - assed Galapagos tortoise in hope of winning a Nobel Prize .
Dr. Zin ( Johnny Quest )
Benton Quest had many people who attempted to destroy him time and again , but it was the evil mastermind of Dr. Zin who did it with an air of Mad Science .
In fact , he never even really met any of the protagonists save by two - way TV screens when he often admitted to having a hand in whatever nefarious plot was abut to go down .
Fun guy !
Professor Nut -Meg ( Felix the Cat )
Felix the Cat ’s chief antagonist who looks remarkably like any other Mad Scientist .
And , since he ’s been around since 1958 , it ’s quite possible he might be the cookie - cutout for every Mad to follow .
The Professor ’s bungling and inept sidekick was the one and only Rock Bottom – you can see both of them in this classic clip .
Dr. Weird ( Aqua Teen Hunger Force )
A mad scientist who lives in an abandoned Lunatic Bin on the always - rainy New Jersey Shore .
The ATHF movie reveals several possible correlations between Dr. Weird and Frylock .
While Dr. Weird is an Aqua Teen original character , the outside shot of his Nut House is actually a re-hashed animated clip of a Nepalese palace from the TV show Jonny Quest .
And there ’s some more trivia for ya .
Simon Bar Sinister ( Underdog )
The height - challenged evil scientist who constantly caused catastrophe all over the place was the chief nemesis of Underdog .
According to Wikipedia ( and your Trivia nugget of the day ) : ‘ The “ Bar Sinister ” in his name was a macaronic reference to a mark from heraldry , in English called a bend sinister ; on a shield it was denoted by a line ( to those facing the shield ) from the top right to the bottom left .
( The French equivalent is barre , and is pronounced the same way . )
His name could be translated as “ Simon , the Bastard ” Awesome .
Despite the fact that the live - action flick was utter shit , Peter Dinklage as Simon was about the best part .
Mojo Jojo ( The Powerpuff Girls )
Back in the day when Cartoon Network was first coming into its own as a decent place to watch toons , The Powerpuff Girls were all the rage .
Though they tussled with many enemies , the greatest of all had to be Mojo Jojo : the brilliant , yet hopelessly misguided , genius monkey .
As it turned out , he used to be the irritating lab assistant to Professor Utonium ( the ‘ dad ’ to the girls ) and went on to a life of crime .
Dr. Blight ( Captain Planet )
Dr. Blight was the main Mad Scientist on Captain Planet and the Planeteers who , with the use of “ uncontrolled technology and unethical scientific experimentation ” , would create nasty creatures , situations , and traps to thwart the group of ringed - heroes .
Ah , but then came Captain Planet and whooped all up on her .
Just kidding .
This show had like no violence .
Dr. Otto Scratchansniff ( Animaniacs )
Believe it or not , Dr S. is more than just a crazed mental lunatic , he ’s also Warner Brothers resident psychiatrist .
His primary job , as dictated by studio CEO Thaddeus Plotz , is to attempt to “ civilize ” the out - of - control Warner Brothers and Sister , often to absolute pointless results .
Lucky for him , his giant head of Sigmund Freud serves as a PEZ - like candy dispenser .
Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz ( Phineas and Ferb )
Though not as complicated as I ’m about to make it sound , this Disney Channel show crams an awful lot into 11 - minute segments and pops out a very cool show .
Step - brothers Phineas and Ferb spend their summer vacation coming up with elaborate plots for fun and excitement much to the chagrin of their sister .
In the backdrop , Ferb ’s pet platypus , Perry , is actually a special agent who must , at every turn , stop the ridiculously incompetent Dr. Doofenshmirtz before he uses his pointless and far - too complicated , world - dominating machinery .
It is very funny .
Dr. Thaddeus Venture ( The Venture Brothers )
Dr. Thaddeus S. “ Rusty ” Venture runs ‘ Venture Industries ’ .
Dr. Venture assumes the occupation of a “ super - scientist ” , and certainly has the smarts and presumed know - how to back up these claims , but his actual competence and credentials in the field are questionable at best .
He is , unfortunately , a diet pill addict , since he ’s constantly living in the huge shadow of his famous father , Dr. Jonas Venture , from whom he inherited Venture Industries .
There is some question as to his actual degree of ability … about anything .
Sheldon Plankton ( Spongebob Squarepants )
Though not a Mad Scientist in the traditional sense , Plankton is an evil genius with undeniable delusions of grandeur who spends every waking moment attempting to steal the precious Krabby Patty formula from Mr. Krabs .
He is the regular nemesis in the opposing and far less successful Chum Bucket wanting nothing more than the very fame he ’s never tasted .
Oh , and despite this video being foreign ( no decent American one available ) , I think you all know the REAL words …
SIng along !
The Evil Scientist ( Looney Tunes )
Gigantic cranium ?
Yep .
Dark , brooding facial features ?
Yes sir .
Diminutive stature ?
Oh boy .
Voice reminiscent of Dr. Frankenstein ?
All too true .
Though not in more than three total Looney Tunes animated features , the Evil Scientist has come to represent just what it is to be a completely brilliant doctor who ’s just not quite brilliant enough to stop the hero .
And when Bugs Bunny is your target … let ’s face it : you have no chance .
Dexter and Mandark ( Dexter ’s Laboratory )
In no other cartoon do we get the main character as the chief Mad Scientist himself .
Sealed behind a special lab door , which also happens to be his bedroom , Dexter holds himself up in his Lab - or - ah - torrey concocting , repairing , creating , fixing , and plotting .
Though he has two major irritants ( his sister DeeDee being possibly the worst ) , Dexter ’s actual nemesis is the nearly polar opposite yet equally as evil - minded Mandark .
Some of the best shows were the ones where these two butt heads .
The Brain ( Pinky and the Brain )
Both genetically ‘ enhanced ’ mice , though but one is the diabolical and sinister genius who wants nothing more than to ‘ Try to take over the world ’ .
However , the very oil to Brain ’s water is Pinky : the insipid , moronic , dunder - headed partner who , though always along for the ride , somehow manages to find a way to screw things up .
Most often , though , he just spouts stupid and arbitrary words , most famously , ‘ Narf ’ .
Brain has tried time and again to fulfill his life ’s credo , but , alas , has never seen it through .

Professor Frink ( The Simpsons )
Based nearly completely on Jerry Lewis’ ‘ Nutty Professor ’ character , Professor Frink is Springfield ’s resident ‘ Mad ’ scientist .
He is also a teacher at the Springfield Heights University of Technology , and sports the actual full moniker of Professor John I.Q. Nerdelbaum Frink , Jr. According to Wikipedia , here are a few of Frink ’s inventions : “ automatic tapping shoes for tap dancing , the frog exaggerator , monsterometer , the sarcasm detector , hamburger earmuffs ( which are apparently much more complicated than one would think , with problems that include the “ pickle matrix ” ) , the 8 - month after pill and apparently the cube , which was originally called the ‘ Frinkahedron ’ as mentioned in the partially 3D episode of The Simpsons .
Some of Frink ’s inventions , such as the automatic phone dialer , work better than others , such as his radio - controlled plane , which carries babies as passengers under their parents ’ control ( it crashed ) , or a secure building that sprouts legs and runs away from potential danger ( the legs of which often collapsed causing the house to crash to the ground and catch fire ) . ”

Regular readers may recall my question on August 13th about the whys and wherefores of the disappearance of the Arctic Sea , which subsequently reappeared off the coast of Africa in the middle of a full - dress Russian Navy panic , with rumours of piracy in the Baltic and stolen secret cargoes ...
Today an Asia Times in - depth report asserts :
[ ex - Russian military officer ]
Filin said the crates ( loaded on board in Kaliningrad ) could have contained four X - 55 strategic cruise missiles ( without front sections ) and devices to implement an air launch from military planes of the SU - 24 type , provided that the aircraft were retrofitted as carriers of a single cruise missile .
Last Thursday , the former commander of defense forces of Estonia , Tarmo Kiuts , repeated the same presumption .
He said on board the Arctic Sea most probably were Russian X - 55 missiles that the vessel was carrying to Iran .
In its latest version , official Russian television said ecologists had hijacked the Arctic Sea because they had ran out of fuel for their boats .
And to add to the fun : Piratical ecologists , or arms dealers smuggling cruise missiles to Iran .

KABUL , Afghanistan ( CNN ) --
Afghanistan officials said 26 people across the country were killed in election day violence , although they hailed Thursday 's vote as a success .

Nearly 95 percent of the more than 6,000 polling stations across Afghanistan opened on Thursday , according to government and electoral officials .
Counting is under way but initial results are not expected for another 36 to 48 hours , while final results will not be certified until mid-September .
Officials extended voting until everyone waiting in line had a chance to cast their ballots .
" At some [ polling stations ] there is a very large line , " said Azizullah Ludin of Afghanistan 's Independent Electoral Commission .
" We have to complete all these people that are coming here . "
It is the nation 's second presidential election since the 2001 fall of the Taliban .
Ludin said the decision to add more time to vote was because of a large turnout at some stations and technical issues that delayed voting for others .
There were no official details on voter turnout and it has been difficult to get an accurate count of how many Afghans voted in defiance of threats of violence from the Taliban .
CNN 's Atia Abawi said election officials at one polling station in Kabul had already begun counting ballots after a low turnout when the order to extend voting reached them .
Afghan voter turnout low as presidential election nears end »
When asked how many ballots had been counted , an election official said 1,000 -- which seemed high to the CNN crew that had been at the polling station all day .
" We were there all day and we did not see 1,000 people , " CNN 's Kevin Flower said .
Election workers in central Bamiyan province immediately began reopening the polls after the order to extend voting .
" Election workers had put up security tape barriers and even tied down the flaps to their voting tents shortly after 4 p.m. local time , " CNN's Ivan Watson reported from the province .
" The security tape has been removed and voters are straggling in again . "
Election observers from 30 groups -- both domestic and international -- said voting in Kabul province was fairly smooth , though a few reports surfaced of irregularities at various polling stations .
Afghans were electing a president from 40 hopefuls and 420 members of the provincial council in what was seen in the international community as a high - stakes test for the fledgling South Asian democracy .
The Taliban had vowed to disrupt the voting and the risk factor in some areas may have been too high for some Afghans to venture out to vote .

The government ordered a ban on media coverage of incidents of violence in an effort to " ensure the wide participation of the Afghan people " as 300,000 NATO and Afghan soldiers were out in force to safeguard voters .
The independent Pajhwok Afghan News , which had announced it would not heed the media ban , posted online reports of deadly attacks across Afghanistan .
CNN has not confirmed those incidents .
Afghan security officials said voting day violence claimed the lives of 17 Afghan policemen and soldiers , and another nine civilians .
An American service member was killed in a mortar strike in eastern Afghanistan , the U.S. military said .
It did not say where the attack took place .
Major fighting continued for a second day in the city of Baghlan , north of Kabul , security sources said .
Rockets were fired at the town throughout the day , a day after heavy fighting that claimed the life of the city 's police chief , the sources said .
Afghans in Baghlan are afraid to leave their homes to cast their ballots , Afghan security officials said .
In the eastern city of Gardez , four rockets pounded the outskirts of the city , while a roadside bomb struck in another area , the local security chief said .
There were no casualties from either incident .
But other parts of Afghanistan have been largely spared the daily drumbeat of car bombs , assassinations and whizzing rockets .
Enthusiasm filled the air as voters lined up to have their say .
Pajhwok reported brisk turnout in western Herat province , which borders Iran .
Khwaja Mahboob told Pajhwok that he voted for a woman for a provincial council seat because he believed women should have a stronger say in Afghanistan .
Watch what ranks high among Afghan concerns »
In central Bamiyan province , where predominantly ethnic Hazaras suffered under Taliban rule , thousands of voters cast their ballots behind cardboard screens inside dust - caked tents .
Police struggled to hold back and search the crowd and at one point , people pushed through , breaking off one of the gates to the polling center .
After voting , one elderly man admitted he was n't sure who he voted for .
" Whoever God wants will be king , " he said .
Many Afghans are illiterate and rely on symbols like light bulbs and books to identify their candidates on the ballot paper .
Organizers from Afghanistan 's Independent Election Commission said 11 polling centers in Daikundi province were closed because of security concerns .
Some polling stations in eastern Kunar and Nuristan provinces did not open and others , including 100 in Ghor , opened without a security presence , according to Pajhwok .
Afghanistan observers and experts said a high turnout would help marginalize the Taliban which ruled Afghanistan from 1996 until the 2001 U.S. - led invasion .
Incumbent President Hamid Karzai , dressed in his traditional purple and green striped robe , cast his vote shortly after the polls opened and had his finger stained with ink that is supposed to last for two weeks , a measure intended to thwart fraud by preventing people from voting multiple times .
" I 'm sure this will be for peace , for progress and for the well - being of the Afghan people , " Karzai said .
But at some Kabul polling stations , the ink apparently was not potent enough , according to Damaso Magbual , an observer from the Asian Network for Free Elections .
At another station , a boy who successfully voted with a fraudulent registration card , admitted to being only 13 , Magbual said .
Karzai's top rival was his former finance minister Abdullah Abdullah , who once served as a confidante of Ahmed Shah Massoud , the charismatic leader of the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance killed by al Qaeda .

The other candidate who gathered steam in the campaign was former Finance Minister Ashraf Ghani , a Western - educated man who served as a World Bank analyst .
Karzai was named interim leader after the fall of the Taliban regime and won the 2004 election by a significant margin .
His popularity , however , has waned in recent months as Afghanistan has been crippled by corruption and increasing bloodshed .
Both Abdullah and Ghani hailed anti-corruption measures and government transparency as centerpieces of their campaign platforms .
Women 's votes were seen as crucial after an especially repressive period for women under the Taliban when they were stripped of rights .
But in some polling stations Thursday , women voters were greatly outnumbered by men .

Habiba Surobi , the female governor of Bamiyan , said women who live in remote Afghan villages are still not aware of their rights .
" This is something to be concerned about , " she said , adding that it was the responsibility of Afghanistan 's women leaders to ensure better awareness and education .
About 15 million of Afghanistan 's 33 million people are registered to vote .
Earlier , officials had estimated that number as 17 million .

There appears no end in sight for when Dick Cheney , a rare former vice president with Secret Service protection , will lose his security detail .
Whispers has learned that the political battler 's Secret Service protection has been extended , though there were no details on the length .
We do n't know why President Obama OK'd the extension , which must be approved by the commander in chief because former veeps typically do n't get any Secret Service security after leaving office .
But indications are that the threats against Cheney , who 's working on his biography at his homes in Virginia and Maryland , have n't lessened since his term expired .
The entire Republican establishment ripped her apart based on racial terms for three months , further widening the divide between the party and the very important Latino vote .
And yet she was confirmed anyway by a 68 - 31 margin .
Knowing that she would very likely be confirmed , the smarter approach would ’ve been to lay off the racial crap , but they just could n’t resist the demagoguery and race - baiting for the delight of their redneck base .
The fact is , their base would ’ve stuck with them no matter what , but in scrambling to appease the far - right , they lost what remained of their Latino support — arguably the fastest growing voting block in America .
The Republican M.O. does n’t make any sense from a rational perspective , but it ’s a mistake to try understanding it that way .
By saying “ no , ” the GOP is systematically becoming the anti-Obama party in hopes this president will overreach and bring his party down .
Here ’s a revealing take on the president from The Economist :
Perhaps Mr Obama inwardly cringes at the personality cult that surrounds him .
But he has hardly discouraged it .
As a campaigner , he promised to “ change the world ” , to “ transform this country ” and even ( in front of a church full of evangelicals ) to “ create a Kingdom right here on earth ” .
As president , he keeps adding details to this ambitious wish - list .
He vows to create millions of jobs , to cure cancer and to seek a world without nuclear weapons .
On July 20th he promised something big ( a complete overhaul of the health - care system ) , something improbable ( to make America ’s college - graduation rate the highest in the world by 2020 ) and something no politician could plausibly accomplish ( to make maths and science “ cool again ” ) . [ … ]
All presidential candidates promise more than they can possibly deliver .
This sets them up for failure .
But because the Obama cult has stoked expectations among its devotees to such unprecedented heights , he is especially likely to disappoint .
Mr Healy predicts that he will end up as a failed president , and “ possibly the least popular of the modern era ” .
It is up to Mr Obama to prove him wrong .
( Emphasis mine )
“ The Obama cult ” is sheer projection .
It is of a piece with right - wing “ false prophet ” rhetoric .
Liberals and progressives have been labeled “ godless , ” secular humanist , ” and “ atheist ” for decades precisely because we do n’t swoon over charismatic figures .
These are characteristics of the wingnut mind ; Republicans are the ones who think laissez - faire capitalism and the Constitution came down from heaven inscribed on stone tablets .
I cannot even count the number of progressive bloggers who ’ve damned Obama for his centrism .
Ask yourself : what percentage of self - identified conservatives believe in End Times ?
What percentage of liberals ?
The answers are exactly what you would expect .
Republicans are betting on an invisible horse .
God will rescue their party by revealing the satanic perfidy of this administration .
Indeed , they ’ve demonstrated a remarkable ability to see that perfidy where it does not exist .
Opposition to Sotomayor is red meat for a shrinking base , but it ’s also perfectly in line with their millenial thinking .
As I wrote in February ,
The GOP is still fully engaged in Kulturkampf — Culture Warfare .
This basic conservative political paradigm precludes the very possibility of rational discussion ; Culture Warriors presume to know what is best because they have the authority of scripture ( Leviticus or Milton Friedman ; it ’s all the same ) .
Indeed , the word ‘ authority ’ is the key to understanding Culture Warriors : they are authoritarians , and they anoint themselves by the authority of gods . [ … ]
Why has the GOP become so shrill and banal ?
Quite frankly , they are victims of their own strategery ( sic ) .
By playing to the worst impulses of America for so long , they have internalized the inherent hypocrisies that their earthly gods — Reagan , Nixon , et al — used so cynically to gain political power .
That power was its own end , and they were willing to wield it as a weapon against their political opponents .
Indeed , to fully understand this moment in American politics , we must adopt the language of warfare .
Whereas Clausewitz said that war is the continuation of politics by other means , Kulturkampf is the continuation of war by political means .
The Sotomayor vote demonstrates that for thirty - one of the remaining 40 Republicans in the Senate , open political warfare is more important than ‘ bipartisanship . ’
They see 2010 and 2012 as their ‘ Last Stand ’ against the tide of godlessness , and they ’re more afraid of seeming “ impure ” than the electoral consequences of racist rhetoric .
BOSTON ( MarketWatch ) -- Chinese vaccine maker Sinovac Biotech Ltd. SVA , said it has begun production of a vaccine to prevent the H1N1 virus , also known as the swine flu .
The company said it is currently able to produce up to 30 million doses of pandemic vaccine per year , and hopes to combine the H1N1 virus into a broader pandemic vaccine known as Panflu .
Sinovac added that the number of doses it is able to manufacture will depend on how the H1N1 virus batches perform .
If a man who worked at a Make - a - Wish event was granted a wish of his own , it would probably be that Robert Maschio from " Scrubs " did n't allegedly get drunk and choke him with his own necktie .
According to a lawsuit filed in L.A. County Superior Court , Tom Binder claims Robert -- who plays The Todd on the show -- got smashed while tending bar at a Make - A - Wish event in Santa Monica last year .

Robert became so enraged when bidding on all items had come to an end , that he screamed , " You do n't know who I am !
I just raised $ 8,000 for this organization , you little piece of s**t ! "
That 's when the suit says Robert grabbed Tom " by his necktie and began choking him , lifting Plaintiff partly off the ground and yelling even louder : ' Let 's take this outside . ' "
On May 21 , 2009 , the California Supreme Court closed another chapter in the state ’s long - running fight over same - sex marriage when it upheld a 2008 voter - approved ballot initiative , known as Proposition 8 , which amended the California state constitution to ban gay marriage .
A month earlier , on April 27 , 2009 , the Iowa Supreme Court had unanimously ruled that a state law defining marriage solely as a union between a man and a woman violated the Iowa Constitution ’s guarantee of equal protection .
( See A Contentious Debate : Same - Sex Marriage in the U.S. . )
As the California and Iowa rulings suggest , while the gay marriage controversy has many elements , including disagreements over religious and social norms , much of the debate is a legal one .
Indeed , it was a 2003 Massachusetts high court decision legalizing same - sex marriage that elevated the issue onto the national stage , where it has remained ever since .
Since 2003 , courts in a number of states have handed victories to both opponents and supporters of gay marriage .
So far , court cases around the country have been based on state , rather than federal , constitutional provisions and thus have not been subject to review by the U.S. Supreme Court .
However , a suit alleging that California ’s Proposition 8 violates the U.S. Constitution was recently filed in a federal district court , giving the nation ’s high court a potential opportunity to determine whether the U.S Constitution guarantees the right of gay and lesbian couples to wed .
If the court takes such a case , its decision will likely stem , at least in part , from its prior rulings on privacy and related issues .
The Right to Privacy and the Griswold Revolution
Although the legal battle over same - sex marriage is rooted , in part , in the question of whether state and federal constitutions protect a right to privacy , the word “ privacy ” never actually appears in the U.S. Constitution .
However , the Constitution does recognize several rights relating to privacy .
For example , the Fourth Amendment recognizes the importance of privacy interests when it stipulates that because citizens need to feel “ secure in their persons , houses , papers and effects , ” the government may not carry out “ unreasonable searches and seizures . ”
In addition , the Ninth Amendment leaves open the possibility of a broader privacy right when it declares that there are rights “ retained by the people ” that do not expressly appear in the Bill of Rights .
The Supreme Court first laid the foundation for an expanded right to privacy early in the 20th century in Lochner v. New York ( 1905 ) .
In this case , the court relied on the reference to “ liberty ” in the 14th Amendment ’s Due Process Clause , which states that no person “ shall be deprived of life , liberty or property , without due process of law , ” to justify striking down a New York state law limiting the number of hours bakers could work each week .
According to the court majority , the Due Process Clause implicitly guarantees citizens the “ fundamental ” right , free from state intrusion , to enter into employment arrangements .
The court ’s reasoning in Lochner animated many subsequent decisions that form the foundation of what today is known as the constitutional right to privacy .
In one such decision , Pierce v. Society of Sisters ( 1925 ) , the court ruled that an Oregon law banning all private education violated the Due Process Clause because it directed how parents may educate their children , infringing upon parents ’ fundamental right to rear their children as they see fit .
In his majority opinion , Justice James Clark McReynolds went on to list other rights guaranteed by the Due Process Clause , including “ the right of the individual … to marry , establish a home and bring up children … and generally to enjoy those privileges long recognized at common law as essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men . ”
Four decades later , in Griswold v. Connecticut ( 1965 ) , the Supreme Court again turned its attention to whether the Constitution implicitly contains fundamental privacy guarantees .
In this case , the court held by a vote of 7 - 2 that a Connecticut law prohibiting the sale and use of birth control was unconstitutional because it intruded on the right of marital privacy .
Writing for the majority , Justice William O. Douglas asserted that a right to privacy exists not because of a specific constitutional provision but rather because it flows from several provisions relating to privacy , such as the Third Amendment right to refuse to quarter soldiers during peacetime and the Fourth Amendment prohibition of unreasonable searches and seizures .
These and other privacy - related provisions , Justice Douglas wrote , create “ penumbras ” ( or shadows ) in which “ zones of privacy ” exist .
Within these zones , he declared , are other rights , including the right of married couples to determine whether or not to have children .
In their dissent , Justices Potter Stewart and Hugo Black , while agreeing with the majority that the Connecticut statute was “ an uncommonly silly law , ” explained that they would have upheld the law because the Constitution does not speak to a general right to privacy .
Both justices expressed a fear that the majority ’s focus on constitutional penumbras would lead to judicial overreaching .
“ The adoption of such a loose , flexible , uncontrolled standard for holding laws unconstitutional , if ever it is finally achieved , will amount to a great unconstitutional shift of power to the courts , which I believe … will be bad for the courts and worse for the country , ” Justice Black wrote .
Echoes of Griswold could be heard two years later in Loving v. Virginia ( 1967 ) , a famous case involving a challenge to a Virginia law banning interracial marriage .
In a unanimous decision , the court ruled that this law violated the 14th Amendment ’s Equal Protection Clause , which guarantees all citizens equal protection under the law and thus prohibits the government from discriminating on the basis of race .
But the court moved beyond the issue of racial discrimination to assert that the right to marry is itself protected by the Constitution .
“ The freedom to marry has long been recognized as one of the vital personal rights essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men , ” wrote Chief Justice Earl Warren for the majority .
“ Marriage is one of the ‘ basic civil rights of man , ’ fundamental to our very existence and survival , ” the chief justice added .
In Eisenstadt v. Baird ( 1972 ) , the court broadened the right to privacy enunciated in Griswold to include unmarried people .
This case involved a Massachusetts law prohibiting the distribution of birth control to single people .
By a vote of 6 - 1 ( there were two vacancies on the court at the time ) , the court struck down the law .
“ If the right of privacy means anything , ” Justice William Brennan wrote , “ it is the right of the individual , married or single , to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the decision whether to bear or beget a child . ”
The following year the court extended privacy rights even further when , in Roe v. Wade ( 1973 ) , it established a constitutional right to abortion .
Writing for the majority , Justice Harry Blackmun explained that the “ right of privacy … founded in the 14th Amendment ’s concept of personal liberty and restrictions upon state action is broad enough to encompass a woman ’s decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy . ”
The court thus returned to locating the right to privacy in the Due Process Clause .
Starting in the 1970s , some politicians and legal thinkers began arguing that the court ’s privacy jurisprudence , particularly as articulated in Griswold and Roe , amounted to judicial activism by creating rights that were never envisioned in the Constitution .
Although this critique was most popular in conservative circles , it also won over some liberals and moderates who feared a significant expansion of the Supreme Court ’s power .
In response to this criticism , some legal scholars countered that the Griswold and Roe decisions were logical outgrowths of a long line of the court ’s decisions and were therefore harmonious with the court ’s tradition of enforcing fundamental rights that are not directly specified in the Constitution .
The Gay Rights Movement and the Road to Lawrence
During the 1970s , a gay rights movement , patterned in many ways after the civil rights and women ’s rights movements , developed momentum as the sexual revolution spurred new social and sexual mores , which in turn prompted legislatures to repeal many state laws regulating sexuality .
For instance , some 20 states , including California and Ohio , struck from the books their anti-sodomy laws .
Still , by the mid-1980s , laws that prohibited certain acts between people of the same sex , and in some cases between those of the opposite sex , remained in force in 25 states .
One of these state laws , a Georgia anti-sodomy statute , became the subject of a landmark high court ruling .
The case , Bowers v. Hardwick ( 1986 ) , arose after Atlanta police arrested Michael Hardwick for having consensual sex in his own bedroom with another man .
Georgia , like most states , rarely enforced its anti-sodomy law and , indeed , the state eventually dropped its charges against Hardwick .
Nevertheless , Hardwick sued the state , alleging that the criminalization of private and consensual sex between people of the same gender violated his constitutional right to privacy .
In a 5 - 4 ruling , a bitterly divided Supreme Court ruled that the constitutional right to privacy did not protect the right to have private , consensual sex with a person of the same gender .
Writing for the majority , Justice Byron
White declared that earlier privacy cases , such as Griswold and Loving , concerned “ family , marriage or procreation . ”
It would be an untenable stretch , White reasoned , to extend privacy rights to “ any kind of private sexual conduct between consenting adults . ”
Furthermore , he wrote , while existing privacy protections concerning marriage or child - rearing “ are deeply rooted in this nation ’s history and tradition , ” the opposite was true of sodomy , which all states had at one time banned and which half the states still banned at the time of the decision .
In a strongly worded dissent , Justice Blackmun dismissed the majority ’s contention that the case ultimately involved a “ fundamental right to engage in homosexual sodomy . ”
Indeed , he accused the majority of “ distort[ing ] ” the ultimate question before the court by ignoring the fact that the Georgia statute outlawed sodomy between heterosexuals as well as homosexuals .
What the case actually concerned , Justice Blackmun wrote , was “ the most comprehensive of rights and the right most valued by civilized men , namely , the right to be let alone . ”
More specifically , he argued , the Constitution guarantees each person , regardless of sexual orientation , the liberty to have consensual intimate relations in his or her own home .
Many conservatives hailed the Bowers decision as a much - needed restraint on a court that they said had become untethered from its constitutional mandate .
But a hint of change in course came just four years after the ruling , when Justice Lewis Powell , who had provided the crucial fifth vote for the Bowers majority , stated publicly that he subsequently regretted his decision .
“ I think I probably made a mistake , ” he admitted , three years after retiring from the bench .
Meanwhile , in 1996 the high court decided Romer v. Evans , an important gay rights ruling that , while addressing a different question than the Bowers case , ultimately proved to be a strong indicator of how the court might rule if it revisited the sodomy question .
In the Romer case , the court considered a challenge to an amendment to the Colorado Constitution ( approved by the state ’s voters in 1992 ) that nullified local anti-discrimination protections for homosexuals and prohibited passage of any such anti-discrimination laws in the future .
By a 6 - 3 vote , the high court held that the Colorado amendment violated the 14th Amendment guarantee of equal protection .
“ A state can not so deem a class of persons a stranger to its laws , ” wrote Justice Anthony Kennedy in the majority opinion .
In particular , he found , “ the [ Colorado ] amendment imposes a special disability upon [ homosexuals ] , ” who are “ forbidden the safeguards that others enjoy or may seek without restraint . ”
While Justice Kennedy did not specifically mention Bowers , Justice Antonin Scalia , in a forceful dissent , reasoned that the Bowers decision should have led the court to uphold the Colorado law .
“ If it is rational to criminalize the conduct , ” he wrote , referring to the Georgia sodomy statute upheld in Bowers , “ surely it is rational to deny special favor and protection to those with a self - avowed tendency or desire to engage in the conduct . ”
The Lawrence Case and Scalia ’s Dissent
As if in response to Justice Scalia ’s dissent in Romer , the court soon revisited the issue it had decided in Bowers , taking up another challenge to a sodomy statute , this one from Texas .
The case , Lawrence v. Texas ( 2003 ) , is remarkably similar to Bowers in many of its facts .
Once again , police discovered two men having consensual sex in a private residence and arrested them under a state anti-sodomy law .
And , once again , the defendants challenged the sodomy statute ’s constitutionality , taking the case all the way to the Supreme Court .
Despite these factual similarities , the court in Lawrence overruled its earlier decision in Bowers , thereby invalidating not only the Texas statute but all anti-sodomy laws .
Writing for the majority , Justice Kennedy stated that the court in Bowers had been mistaken in concluding that the government had historically restricted private and consensual intimate relations between people of the same sex .
Moreover , Kennedy explained , sexual mores had changed since Bowers , as evidenced by the fact that in the 17 years between the Bowers and Lawrence cases , 12 states had repealed their anti-sodomy statutes and nine stopped enforcing these laws , leaving only four states that continued to enforce them .
Finally , Kennedy wrote , gay people have a “ liberty under the Due Process Clause [ that ] gives them the full right to engage in [ intimate ] conduct without intervention of the government . ”
No matter how unpopular a group ’s sexual norms , he explained , the government may not “ demean their existence or control their destiny by making their private sexual conduct a crime . ”
In making this claim , though , Kennedy was quick to note the limited breadth of the decision .
This case , he assured , did not address the regulation of prostitution or other public sexual acts , nor did it require the government to extend marriage or civil unions to same - sex couples .
Just as he did in Romer , Justice Scalia dissented in Lawrence , arguing once again that the majority ’s reassurances did not agree with their logic .
Scalia asserted that by rejecting moral - based legislation , Kennedy and the other justices on the majority were paving the way for a future ruling requiring states to recognize same - sex unions .
The Massachusetts Decision
Ironically , Justice Scalia ’s interpretation of the Lawrence majority opinion would prove to have a profound effect on the gay rights movement .
Many lawyers subsequently arguing for a right to same - sex marriage pointed to Scalia ’s dissent in Lawrence as evidence that the majority opinion in that case generated a constitutional right to marriage for people of the same gender .
Previously , in the 1990s , supreme courts in Hawaii and Vermont interpreted their respective state constitutions to require that their state governments offer same - sex couples the same rights and benefits of marriage afforded to opposite - sex couples , even if the state chose not to define these rights and benefits as marriage .
In response , many states , fearing that their courts would issue similar decisions , passed what are known collectively as Defense of Marriage Acts ( DOMAs ) , which specifically define marriage as a union between an opposite - sex couple .
In addition , several states amended their constitutions to prohibit same - sex marriage , hoping that such an explicit ban would prevent their courts from reading other constitutional provisions so broadly as to guarantee same - sex couples the right to marry .
Despite the creation of DOMAs and other state legislative actions preceding Lawrence , the Lawrence decision dramatically changed the same - sex marriage landscape by articulating a constitutional framework that could provide robust rights for gay and lesbian couples .
Indeed , echoes of Lawrence could be heard in Goodridge v. Department of Public Health ( 2003 ) , a decision by the Massachusetts high court that ignited a national debate over the meaning of marriage .
In Goodridge , the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court held by a vote of 4 - 3 that the state ’s constitution requires the government to offer “ the protections , benefits and obligations conferred by civil marriage to two individuals of the same sex who wish to marry . ”
The case arose after Julie and Hillary Goodridge , a lesbian couple , sought a marriage license from the Massachusetts Department of Health .
The department denied the request , claiming that Massachusetts did not recognize same - sex marriage .
The Goodridges then sued the department , alleging that this denial violated their right to individual liberty and legal equality as guaranteed by the Massachusetts Constitution .
Writing for the majority , Chief Justice Margaret Marshall held that denying marriage benefits to same - sex couples violated the Massachusetts Constitution because it did not accomplish a legitimate government goal .
Indeed , the court explained , the reasons the government offered for banning same - sex marriage – promoting procreation , ensuring a good child - rearing environment and preserving state financial resources – would not be promoted by prohibiting same - sex couples from marrying .
Thus , according to the court , the only basis for the state ’s decision to exclude same - sex couples from the institution of marriage was a disapproval of their lifestyle .
Because the court concluded that condemning a lifestyle is not a “ constitutionally adequate reason ” for denying marriage benefits , it held that the state must permit same - sex couples to marry .
In contrast , the three dissenting judges in Goodridge argued that they would not have required the state to recognize such unions because the state legislature enjoys broad discretion when regulating nonfundamental rights , such as the right to same - sex marriage .
Given this discretion , the dissenting judges argued , the court should be very deferential in determining whether there is a connection between the ban on same - sex marriage and the legislature ’s asserted interests .
Applying this level of deference , the dissenting judges concluded that the legislature had a rational basis for two of its three stated purposes in banning same - sex marriage : to communicate to its citizens the view that marriage is about procreation and to promote the optimal setting for rearing children .
Then - governor of Massachusetts Mitt Romney responded to the Goodridge decision by proposing to amend the Massachusetts Constitution to define marriage as a union between one man and one woman .
Under Massachusetts law , the legislature must approve a constitutional amendment in two consecutive sessions before the people can vote on it .
After fighting a long and contentious battle over Romney ’s proposal , the legislature approved a compromise amendment in 2004 that prohibited gay marriage but created civil unions for same - sex couples .
In the following session , however , the legislature changed course and rejected this proposed amendment , thus denying voters the opportunity to consider it .
The Growing Battle Over Same - Sex Marriage in the States
Meanwhile , a debate over same - sex marriage was heating up at both the federal and state levels .
Many states became concerned that the U.S. Constitution ’s Full Faith and Credit Clause , which generally requires states to enforce judicial decisions issued in other states , would require each state to recognize a marriage between same - sex partners that took place in Massachusetts .
Many scholars have noted that this is probably an unfounded concern since the Supreme Court held many years ago that states need not violate their own policy interests in enforcing other states ’ policies on marriage .
In addition , the federal Defense of Marriage Act , which was signed into law by President Bill Clinton in 1996 , explicitly exempts states from having to recognize a same - sex marriage legally performed in another state .
Nevertheless , in 2003 , 2004 and 2006 , opponents of gay marriage in the U.S. Congress found this concern serious enough to declare it as the principal basis for proposing an amendment to the U.S. Constitution banning same - sex marriage in every state .
This effort , however , failed to receive the two - thirds majority of both the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate required to send a proposed federal constitutional amendment to the states for ratification .
At the state level , the success of the plaintiffs in Goodridge inspired other gay and lesbian couples to file similar claims around the country .
Until May 2008 , however , only one of these cases , Lewis v. Harris ( 2006 ) , was even partly successful .
In that case , the New Jersey Supreme Court found that the state constitutional guarantee of legal equality required the state legislature to grant same - sex couples the same rights and benefits of marriage that opposite - sex couples have traditionally enjoyed .
Although important , the Lewis decision did not match the breadth of Goodridge because the court permitted the state lawmakers to decide how to grant these rights – either by marriage or civil union .
Soon after the ruling , the New Jersey Legislature passed a measure allowing gay and lesbian couples to enter into civil unions but not to marry .
Besides the New Jersey decision , all of the suits on this subject at the state supreme court level were unsuccessful until May 2008 .
Indeed , in 2006 and 2007 , the highest courts in New York , Washington and Maryland found that their state constitutions do not guarantee same - sex couples the right to marry .
Each of these decisions held that recognizing same - sex marriage is a policy matter , not a constitutional matter , and that the decision must therefore rest with the people ’s representatives in the legislative and executive branches .
Proposition 8 and the Battle in California
In May 2008 , the California Supreme Court held 4 - 3 that state laws limiting marriage to opposite - sex couples violated the state constitution .
The California decision , which consolidated six individual cases , is much like the Goodridge decision in that it found that same - sex couples are constitutionally entitled to the identical marital rights and privileges as opposite - sex couples .
The reasoning in the Goodridge and California decisions , however , differed in one fundamental respect :
Whereas the Massachusetts court in Goodridge found a right to same - sex marriage on the ground that there is no rational basis for denying marital rights to same - sex couples , the California court went significantly further , elevating gays and lesbians to have the same protected legal status as racial minorities and women .
A law that discriminates against one of these protected groups is constitutional only if it meets a compelling government need .
So the upshot of this ruling was that the California Constitution generally forbids any distinction whatsoever between same - sex and opposite - sex unions , whether in benefits or merely in name .
Seeking to overrule this decision , same - sex marriage opponents placed Proposition 8 , a measure to alter the California Constitution to ban gay marriage , on the November 2008 state ballot .
Following expensive and contentious political campaigns waged by both supporters and opponents of the initiative , California voters passed the proposition by a narrow margin – effectively outlawing gay marriage in California .
But just one day after the passage of the initiative , same - sex marriage advocates filed a lawsuit in the California Supreme Court claiming that Proposition 8 was not constitutionally valid and thus did not trump the California high court ’s earlier ruling that the state must recognize the right to same - sex marriage .
The legal basis for the lawsuit was that California law provides for two types of changes to the state constitution : revisions and amendments .
A revision is a “ substantial ” change to the constitution ; it requires a vote by at least two - thirds of both houses of the California Legislature to submit the proposed revision to a popular vote or to a constitutional convention .
An amendment is a less substantial change to the constitution that only requires voters to place the proposed amendment on a state ballot and win a majority vote , as Californians did with Proposition 8 .
Gay - rights advocates argued that because the right of gays and lesbians to wed is a fundamental right , banning the practice required a constitutional revision , not just an amendment .
Therefore , these advocates asserted , Proposition 8 was invalid .
On May 26 , 2009 , the California Supreme Court ruled 6 - 1 that Proposition 8 was an amendment , not a revision , and thus was valid .
In its decision , the court noted that constitutional revision generally entails a significant change to the state ’s governmental framework , something Proposition 8 does not do .
In addition , the majority noted , earlier ballot initiatives that had altered fundamental constitutional rights – such as the restoration of the state ’s death penalty in 1972 – had also been deemed to be amendments , not revisions .
After upholding Proposition 8 , the court turned its attention to the status of the 18,000 gay and lesbian couples who had legally wed during the roughly five - month period between the May 2008 high court decision legalizing same - sex marriage and the early November passage of the proposition banning it .
Here the court sided with gay marriage advocates , ruling that the marriages would remain valid because the language of Proposition 8 does not explicitly apply the ban retroactively .
Finally , the court noted that those same - sex couples could still achieve the material benefits and obligations of marriage under California law thanks to the court ’s May 2008 decision legalizing the practice .
Proposition 8 did not “ repeal or abrogate ” these rights , wrote Chief Justice Ronald M. George for the majority .
Instead , George added , Proposition 8 merely carved “ out a narrow and limited exception to these state constitutional rights , reserving the official designation of the term ‘ marriage ’ for the union of opposite - sex couples . ”
Furthermore , the other major piece of the May decision – making gays and lesbians a protected class in future discrimination cases – also continues to stand .
Connecticut and Iowa Legalize Gay Marriage
Gay marriage advocates counted the Proposition 8 decision as a major defeat , but they did score important victories around the same time in two other state high courts .
The first of these wins occurred in October 2008 , in the Connecticut Supreme Court .
In Kerrigan v. Connecticut Department of Health ( 2008 ) , the state ’s high court ruled by a vote of 4 - 3 that a state law banning same - sex marriage violated the state constitution ’s guarantee of equal protection under the law .
The ruling overturned an earlier decision by a Connecticut trial court that had found no violation of the state ’s Equal Protection Clause because the state had enacted a civil union law giving gay and lesbian couples the same legal rights as married couples .
In this earlier decision , the trial court judge had written that the state constitution requires equal protection under the law but “ not that there be equivalent nomenclature for such protection . ”
But the majority of the Connecticut Supreme Court disagreed , ruling that offering homosexual couples civil unions in lieu of marriage amounts to unequal treatment “ because the institution of marriage carries with it a status and significance that the newly created classification of civil unions does not embody . ”
In addition , the Connecticut Supreme Court elevated the legal status of gays and lesbians , giving them greater protection against discrimination than was granted in the Massachusetts decision , but not the highest level of protection that was established in the California ruling .
In Kerrigan , the Connecticut high court ruled that laws that discriminate against gays and lesbians must be subjected to what is known as “ intermediate strict scrutiny . ”
This means that a law that discriminates against homosexuals will be struck down unless the state can show that it substantially furthers an important government interest .
Five months after the Connecticut decision , the Iowa Supreme Court followed suit , unanimously affirming a lower court ruling that struck down the state ’s 1998 DOMA banning same - sex marriage .
The decision shocked many observers because Iowa is a Midwestern state with a substantial population of Christian social conservatives .
However , the state also has long been known for its populist tradition and its willingness to embrace socially liberal causes .
As in Connecticut , the justices in the Iowa case struck down the law on the grounds that it violated the state constitution ’s equal protection clause .
And , as in Connecticut , the court in Iowa established the “ intermediate strict scrutiny ” test when assessing laws – including the DOMA – that discriminate against gays and lesbians , meaning that these laws can only be upheld if they substantially further an important government interest .
In this case , the court ruled , Iowa ’s DOMA did “ not substantially further any government objective ” and was thus unconstitutional .
Looking Ahead
Gay rights advocates will almost certainly continue to file lawsuits at the state level .
In addition , two prominent lawyers from opposite sides of the ideological fence have moved the issue into the federal court system .
Former Solicitor General Ted Olson and high - profile litigator David Boies , the two lawyers who faced off against each other in the famed Supreme Court case Bush v. Gore ( 2000 ) , have joined forces and filed a suit in federal district court in San Francisco arguing that Proposition 8 violates the equal protection and due process clauses of the U.S. Constitution .
Olson and Boies have publicly predicted that their case will end up before the U.S. Supreme Court , although such a result is by no means assured .
Still , filing such a claim at the federal level poses some risks for the gay marriage movement .
An unfavorable outcome for same - sex marriage supporters in the U.S. Supreme Court would prevent gay couples from subsequently arguing for a right to same - sex marriage under the U.S. Constitution ; gay couples would be able to secure a right to marriage only under state constitutions .
Moreover , an unfavorable high court ruling might influence the judgment of state courts in future gay marriage decisions .
Because of such concerns , a number of prominent gay rights groups , such as the Human Rights Campaign and Lambda Legal , have publicly questioned the decision by Olson and Boies to file the suit , arguing that such a case may be premature or even dangerous to the success of the same - sex marriage movement .
While it is impossible to predict how the high court might rule in a same - sex marriage case , several of the justices ’ past decisions offer some clues .
Of all the justices , Justices Scalia and Clarence Thomas probably offer the most solid indicators as to how they might rule .
Indeed , given their dissenting opinions in Lawrence , it would be surprising if either justice voted for a constitutional right to same - sex marriage .
At the same time , it is more difficult to predict the votes of their two conservative colleagues , Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito , because Roberts and Alito were not on the court when earlier gay rights cases , such as Lawrence , were decided .
However , many constitutional scholars predict that Roberts and Alito would most likely join Scalia and Thomas on this issue .
The court ’s more liberal justices , Stephen Breyer , Ruth Bader Ginsburg and John Paul Stevens , have voted in favor of gay rights claimants in every gay rights case they have considered .
However , these prior decisions , including Lawrence , never explicitly addressed whether the Constitution guarantees the right to gay marriage , making it difficult to know exactly how these justices might ultimately vote in a same - sex marriage case .
Like Roberts and Alito , federal Judge Sonia Sotomayor – recently nominated by President Barack Obama to replace retired Justice David Souter – has had no role in any major gay rights cases , and thus leaves few clues as to her likely vote in a case involving the constitutionality of same - sex marriage .
However , many Supreme Court watchers predict that , if confirmed , Sotomayor would probably join the more liberal wing of the court on most , if not all , issues .
If conservatives and liberals on the court were to split 4 - 4 on the issue of same - sex marriage , the outcome in such a case would likely hinge on Justice Kennedy , whose vote can be difficult to predict .
While Kennedy ’s opinion in Lawrence showed great sympathy for the gay rights movement , Kennedy also emphasized that , from a constitutional perspective , the case did “ not involve whether the government must give formal recognition to any relationship that homosexual persons seek to enter . ”
Kennedy thus explicitly refused to commit one way or the other on whether the constitution requires recognition of same - sex marriages .

The Kenyan Wildlife Service recently announced that massive declines in lion population may lead to their disappearance from the region within less than 2 decades .
Kenya currently has an estimated 2000 lions , but is losing the large cats at a rate of around 100 each year .
The dramatic declines in cats in Kenya and the rest of Africa are mostly a result of human population growth and conflict with livestock .
Wildlife biologist Laurence Frank explains , “ Vast areas of Kenyan rangelands that held lions 20 years ago are now devoid of nearly all wildlife .
Predators have been poisoned and speared , herbivores have been snared for meat , and the rangelands themselves have been destroyed by massive overgrazing by domestic stock . ”
Other experts report that people commonly lace cattle carcasses with poison to kill entire prides , which also ends up poisoning many other predators and scavengers .

In order to maintain the genetic diversity to ensure a stable lion population at least 50 to 100 prides are necessary .
A crippling drought has been effecting Kenya , forcing increasing amounts of pastoralists to search for water and resources to support their livestock .
This migrating pastoral population tends to exploit wildlife areas and out - compete natural inhabitants .
Frank insists , “ Only drastic action on many fronts – policy change , effective law enforcement , giving rural people an economic stake in their natural heritage , and a great deal of investment – will prevent the loss of wildlife in Africa . ”

The " Moon Trees "
Apollo 14 launched in the late afternoon of January 31 , 1971 on what was to be our third trip to the lunar surface .
Five days later Alan Shepard and Edgar Mitchell walked on the Moon while Stuart Roosa , a former U.S. Forest Service smoke jumper , orbited above in the command module .
Packed in small containers in Roosa 's personal kit were hundreds of tree seeds , part of a joint NASA / USFS project .
Upon return to Earth , the seeds were germinated by the Forest Service .
Known as the " Moon Trees " , the resulting seedlings were planted throughout the United States ( often as part of the nation 's bicentennial in 1976 ) and the world .
They stand as a tribute to astronaut Roosa and the Apollo program .
The project began after Roosa was chosen for the Apollo 14 mission .
Ed Cliff , Chief of the Forest Service , knew of Stuart Roosa from his days as a smoke jumper and contacted him about bringing seeds into space .
Stan Krugman of the Forest Service was put in charge of the project and selected the seeds for the experiment .
Seeds were chosen from five different types of trees : Loblolly Pine , Sycamore , Sweetgum , Redwood , and Douglas Fir .
The seeds were classified and sorted , and control seeds were kept on Earth for later comparison .
Roosa carried about 400 - 500 seeds in his personal kit which stayed with him as he orbited the Moon in the command module " Kitty Hawk " in February , 1971 .
Unfortunately , the seed cannisters burst open during the decontamination procedures after their return to Earth , and the seeds got mixed together and were presumed to be no longer viable .
Stan Krugman had the seeds sent to the southern Forest Service station in Gulfport , Mississippi and to the western station in Placerville , California to attempt germination .
Surprisingly , nearly all the seeds germinated successfully , and the Forest Service had some 420 to 450 seedlings after a few years ( some from cuttings ) .
Some of these were planted with their earth - bound counterparts as controls , ( as would be expected , after over twenty years there is no discernable difference ) but most were given away in 1975 and 1976 to many state forestry organizations to be planted as part of the nation 's bicentennial celebration .
These trees were southern and western species , so not all states received trees .
A Loblolly Pine was planted at the White House , and trees were planted in Brazil , Switzerland , and presented to the Emperor of Japan , among others .
Trees have also been planted in Washington Square in Philadelphia , at Valley Forge , in the International Forest of Friendship , and at various universities and NASA centers .
The Moon Tree shown at top left is a sycamore growing at Koch Girl Scout Camp in Cannelton , Indiana and at top right at Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Maryland .
A list of Moon Tree locations can be found at the bottom of the page .
Stuart Roosa was born on 16 August 1933 , in Durango , Colorado .
He worked for the Forest Service in the early 1950's as a smoke jumper fighting fires and later joined the Air Force and became a test pilot .
He was one of 19 people selected for the astronaut class of 1966 and was part of the astronaut support crew for Apollo 9 .
Following Apollo 14 , Roosa was backup command module pilot for Apollo 's 16 and 17 .
He then worked on the Space Shuttle program until his retirement as a Colonel in the Air Force in 1976 , the time when many of his trees were being planted .
Sadly , Stuart Roosa passed away in December , 1994 .
The Moon Trees continue to flourish , a living monument to our first visits to the Moon and a fitting memorial to Stuart Roosa .
Believed locations of some Moon Trees are listed below , but no list was ever kept nor any systematic tracking made of the disposition of all the trees .

ON WEDNESDAY August 19th South Korea 's attempt to launch its first rocket ended in failure , for the seventh time since 2002 .
Pressure on the country has been mounting since neighbouring North Korea claimed it had put a satellite into space in April this year .
Most launches are made from countries with well - established space programmes .
As of last year , Russia had sent 245 rockets with payloads into orbit successfully since 1999 , compared with America 's 218 , according to data from Futron , a technology consultancy .
China now surpasses Europe as a base for spacecraft launches , while India and Japan send up a few every year .
Israel has also put two rockets into space .

The main facility , which measures 82 by 84 metres , can been seen on satellite images published on both Google Earth and Google Maps Earth is showing a mysterious building in Burma 's jungle that some commentators think may be linked to activity by Burma 's regime to develop their own nuclear weapons like North Korea .

The large industrial complex is located in a rural area of central Burma , east of Mandalay near the town of Pin Oo Lwin .
That 's the same zone in which defectors recently told two Australian researchers that the Burmese army had been building a nuclear research and engineering centre with support from North Korea and Russia .

Buddhism in Modern Life by Ananda W.P. Guruge ---o0o---
The topic as it stands has several parts to it :
What is modern life ?
What is Buddhism ?
And what role has Buddhism to play in modem life ?
Modem life in itself is very difficult to define .
One might say that modem life is characterized by the fact that the world is getting smaller ; that people are having greater access to each other ; that communication barriers are fast disappearing ; that it is possible for one to know what happens everywhere in the world within a short time , and thereby pen-nits participation in the life of a larger cross-section of the world than one could have ever imagined .
That would be one aspect of modern life .
Related to that would be modern life understood in terms of science and technology .
Man in his attempt to conquer nature , disease , natural barriers , has performed certain feats of a technological complexity which are quite mind boggling .
That is another aspect of modem life .
A third , perhaps a more disturbing aspect of modern life , is that with the world getting closer , communication barriers breaking away , and scientific and technological advance becoming so rapid , we have come face to face with several problems in terms of economic and political rivalry , pollution , population explosion , scarcity of resources and the indiscriminate use of resources that might not be replaced .
With these come a host of other issues which can be plainly labelled as " survival . "
Can Modem Civilization Survive ?
To this one may add also a moral dimension - an ethical question - and ask : " To what extent , in the process of modernization and conquering nature , have we deviated from the ability to conquer ourselves ?
Has the struggle for survival meant that the modem man has become a slave to selfishness , bound by his own desires and his whims ?
Have we lost all the things of very special value to human beings such as inter-personal relations , the anxiety to look after the well - being of others , the spirit of being of selfless service to others ?
Have we lost these ? "
So when one thinks of modern life one can think in terms of a great degree of optimism and , at the same time , an equal degree of pessimism .
One can be so pleased that we live today at a time when there seems to be nothing that man cannot conquer .
Maybe , there are still some diseases that challenge him .
Maybe , there are still certain places in the universe where man would like to be , and still he has not developed his technology to be there .
But it appears as if all these are within reach of man .
With this optimism about man 's capacity , comes the pessimistic aspect that we have , in the process , lost something .
Let us keep both of these in mind .
Buddhism
Then let us look at what Buddhism is .
What do we understand by Buddhism ?
It can mean many things to many people .
To someone it can be only life of the Buddha ; the example that the Buddha and his immediate disciples set - that glorious feat of a man , who stood before men as a man and declared a path of deliverance .
This is one kind of Buddhism .
To another , Buddhism would mean the massive doctrine as recorded in the Buddhist literature , which indeed is voluminous and contains several thousand pages recording the words of the Buddha .
And in it is described a very lofty , abstruse , complex and learned philosophy of life .
Then based on whatever the Buddha taught , whatever the practices current at the time of the Buddha , there has grown a very rich culture , a culture which has extended to all ' parts of Asia for over 2500 years , and to which people from various walks of life with various backgrounds from all these countries have made a lasting contribution .
A large number of sects or schools or philosophical systems have evolved and all of them , quite rightly , go under the name of Buddhism .
Then comes another definition of Buddhism and that is the kind of ritual that has grown around the doctrine of the Buddha as a result of his teachings and the way of life preached by him , becoming a religion .
Whether the Buddha intended it or not , his teachings became a religion , a religion to which people were prepared to hold allegiance and which has its own ritual , organization , and ways or criteria for deciding what is properly done or what is improperly done .
Now that is another kind of Buddhism .
If one were to take each of these aspects separately , and try to examine the impact of what he would call Buddhism on modern life , it would certainly be an enormous task .
To me Buddhism is all these .
It is the Buddha and his life , the doctrine , the culture that evolves around it , and the ritual that is connected with it .
Once we take this to be one large body of human experiences , distilled in the finest form and presented to us in such a manner that each one of us could select that part which appeals to us , we begin to see the remarkable uniqueness of Buddhism .
During the days of the Buddha himself he used to emphasize this point .
One need not be a scholar and learn everything .
Buddhism is not like studying a subject like mathematics where you have to learn all your theorems and different methods of working out the various types of problems .
If you know the fundamentals , the basis , a scholarly detailed study is not an important precursor to practice .
So out of this vast Buddhist culture , religion , or literature , or the vast body of experiences that come to us as Buddhism , each one of us would find that which is relevant to our life , to our type of problems .
A Timeless Doctrine I have often wondered how Buddhism came to be called ' Akalika " which means " timeless " - that it exists for all time .
The more I see the changes that have taken place in Buddhist culture or religion , the more I see how it keeps on adjusting to the needs of different eras , populations , individuals , the more I see that it has been possible for the Buddha to evolve a message that would remain eternally fresh .
So if Buddhism has an application today and if Buddhism has a place in modem fife , it is because of that timeless relevance , emanating from a set of eternal values .
To talk of a characteristic of being eternal is a very paradoxical way of presenting or describing a religion which has the principle doctrine of impermanence at the bottom of it .
the characteristic of timelessness comes from the fact that it had understood that everything continues , but continues in a flux , in a process of continuing change and evolution .
Thus Buddhism was able to adjust to different times and civilizations .
We can therefore without any hesitation approach any aspect of Buddhism as something relevant and applicable to us today .
What are these elements that make Buddhism timeless ?
Let me take just a few of them .
First of these would be the recognition of the responsibility of the individual .
the Buddha is one of the most remarkable religious teachers who emancipated man from all bonds - bonds of supernatural ties , a Godhead , a creation , sin Of - any other characteristic inherited from anyone else ( rather than what you yourself have done ) .
So when the Buddha says that each person is his own master , he promulgates a principle whose applicability becomes stronger as man begins to get more and more confidence in the control of himself and the environment .
So if , today , with scientific and technological development , man feels that he has come to a point where his own intellect makes him superior to anybody else or allows him able to solve any problem that he has , whether physical or ethical or political or whatever , would not the principle that man is the master of himself - that he has to be responsible to himself because whatever he does he inherits - become one of the most important ways of looking at himself ?
So this fundamental approach to making man free from all bondages , spiritual and otherwise , is one of those very important doctrines of Buddhism that have contributed to its timelessness .
As we advance , as greater progress is made by man , there will be the greater need for him to assert that he is the master of himself .
The more he asserts himself to be the master of himself , the more is he reiterating the Buddha 's own statement : ' Atta hi attano natho . "
Freedom of Thought
Then comes another equally important doctrine .
The doctrine of open - mindedness - the liberty of thinking .
Buddhism not only frees us from a Godhead or super natural tie but also liberates mankind from dogma .
Let us visualize the time when the Buddha was preaching .
It was a time when various religious teachings were in a ferment and India of the 6th century B. C. was one of the most interesting places to be .
Religious teachers propounding various types of doctrines were vying with each other to have more and more converts .
Besides these new teachings , there were religious systems that were deep rooted .
In all these religious systems , the theory was : " We have found a way . "
This is the correct path . "
" You come , you will be saved . "
Into their midst comes the Buddha who says : " Do not believe what your book says .
Do not believe what your teachers would say .
Do not believe what your tradition says .
Do not take anything merely because it comes to you with the authority of somebody else .
Make it a personal experience .
Think for yourself .
Be convinced .
And once you are convinced act accordingly . "
Now this was a very refreshing manner in which man was given one of the greatest freedoms that he is fighting for , the freedom to think for himself .
If under feudalism , before the present advances were made , we were not able to assert so much of our light to think for ourselves , as these advances take place we will be asserting that right more and more .
We will be wanting to feel that we are convinced , after our own investigations , after we have been able to go through the principles , the facts , the pros and cons .
This we consider an inviolable right
This is the second doctrine , whose applicability to modern times , and future times , would continue .
Role of Buddhism
Then comes the most important question - apart from supporting what man will want to assert for himself today and in the future , has Buddhism a corrective role to play ?
With this question comes the most important aspect to which all of us should pay a fair amount of attention today .
While man is making all these advances , we also find that the pressure of modern life - the rivalry for survival , the rivalry for doing better than the other , the desire to live a life of competition economically , politically , culturally , or in whatever form - has brought tensions .
In order to relieve these tensions man has evolved more and more recreations and relaxations .
They apparently result in slight relaxation of the tensions but seem to take people more and more into a vicious circle .
Because of the tensions one engages oneself in a variety of escapist activities , and because these escapist activities take too much time , one has to catch up with the process of survival , only to oneself in a worse period of tremendous tension .
The greater the economic progress , the greater the political enlightenment , the more the people need sedatives and tranquilizers to keep themselves doing their normal duties .
You have to take one pill to keep awake , one pill to sleep , one pill to relax and so on .
This kind of modernization that has come in , wherein man 's tensions have mounted to a point where he finds that all that he has gained is of no use , is a very serious situation .
In addition to these tensions comes another facet wherein , with the greater amount of leisure that man gets today as a result of freedom from work drudgery , he has another problem to cope with - that is , boredom .
So with tension on one side , boredom on the other , comes a variety of other complications which make many people really unhappy .
Today one may ask the question :
Are we in a situation where people are really happy or are we in a situation where people at last have realized that in spite of all that they could gain , they have lost something in the form of some fundamental aspects of life ?
Who is to be blamed ?
Are we to blame science ?
Are we to blame technology ?
Are we to blame the political systems ?
Are we to blame the economic system that we have inherited or we have developed ?
Or are we to blame ourselves ?
You are your own Master Going back to the Buddha 's own way of looking at the problem you will say , you hold the reins of life in your hands .
Because whatever has gone wrong you are responsible , you are your own master .
You have let it go - allowed it away out of your hands .
It is easy to blame a person , saying " You have let an opportunity pass .
It has slipped away from your hands ! "
But does that help ?
The greatness of Buddhism lies in the fact that it does not stop after placing the responsibility on you , it does not say " Now that is it .
We have now found the culprit . "
It proceeds to the next stage of saying : " Here are a few things that could be done . "
If one were to go around looking at the various types of religious , psychiatric , psychological measures that have been evolved in order to save man or to cure man from tension on one side and boredom on the other side , you would find that there are many but not one as inexpensive and as practical as some of the very simple directions that Buddhism offers .
One would ask the question - does this mean that once you become a Buddhist you would be freed from the tension and boredom of modern life ?
To answer that question is very difficult because no one becomes a Buddhist .
There is no one who is to be labelled as a Buddhist .
Because Buddhism is not one of those philosophies or ways of life or religions - I use the word religion because there is no other classification to which it can be put squarely - wherein there is a need to have a label .
During the days of the Buddha , people went to him , listened to him and if they were pleased with him they would say , I take refuge in you , I take refuge in your teachings , I take refuge in the Sangha , the community , the disciples who are following this way of life . "
Even today that is all that is needed for anybody to call himself a Buddhist .
Having been convinced that what the Buddha has taught has some relevance to one 's life problems , one feels that it is a way of life that could be followed with profit , by taking refuge in the Buddha , the Dhamma and the Sangha .
With this inner conviction he becomes a Buddhist with absolutely no ceremony , no ritual of any kind , no registration , no other legal requirements .
It is what F.L. Woodword , one of the finest translators of the words of Buddha , calls " a do - it - yourself religion . "
What is very significant today is that there may be thousands of people who have never gone into a Buddhist temple , never got into the ritualistic set - up which has evolved in the Buddhist countries , but who in their own heart have seen the validity of the message of the Buddha and who are leading a life according to the tenets of Buddhism .
In fact , we are finding that a vast majority of the world 's population hold allegiance to the Buddha for one reason or another .
This is one of the most remarkable things that one would regard as almost a miracle .
A Way of Life
The way of life the Buddha preached was very simple .
To the layman it consisted of just five simple precepts : do not kill , do not steal , do not engage in sexual pleasures through wrong means , do not lie , do not take intoxicants - a very simple set of precepts indeed .
But the Buddhist way of life , the way the Buddha described does not end with this kind of precepts .
Simplified in a manner that anyone could understand , there are three things that each person is expected to do , namely ( using the Pali words because most of you are familiar with them ) Dana , Sila and Bhavana .
Dana would mean liberality , generosity - the act of giving .
It is very important that Buddhism begins with Dana as the first virtuous act which one should engage in , in order to put himself on the correct path , because giving is an act of sacrifice .
To be able to give something is to prepare your mind fully to give up something that you have , something you treasure , something to which you are attached .
Thereby you counter one of the biggest causes of all the problems which , again in Pali , is called Lobha or desire or greed .
It is very interesting to see how the way of life is presented to us in a manner that in following it step by step we get rid of some of the human weaknesses and characteristics that cause tension , and the boredom that is bothering most of us today .
Liberality is to counteract desires , the greediness , the clinging nature .
Then Sila is adherence to certain precepts , or ethical or moral conduct .
Buddha was fully aware of the fact that one could not set rules and regulations for everybody in the same manner .
So there are a few rules for the lay people .
There are a few more for those who want to enter into a committed religious life , and still more for monks , who have committed themselves to adhere to a very strict path of discipline and purification .
So the Sila is a graduated thing , so that each person picks up that which he is able to follow for the present .
In Sila , or moral conduct or the ethical teachings of the Buddha , we come back to this original doctrine : they are not commandments , they are not prescribed from above , they are not prescribed by the Buddha as commandments to obey .
Each one of the precepts , which we , as Buddhists , take , is a promise unto ourselves of our own freewill .
And the way they are worded is I take upon myself the discipline of not killing " , I take upon myself the discipline of not stealing " and so on , because I am the master of my own destiny and it is I who should decide which kind of life I should lead .
The Buddha as a guide had shown certain fundamental weaknesses , or faults , that one should try to avoid .
The second cause of most of the problems we have is our animosity , or hatred to others .
In Pali we say Dosa .
Sila is one of those antidotes for this second cause of all our weaknesses .
When we follow Sila we control , or rather we completely eliminate the cause of hatred .
The Buddha was one of those who were very conscious of the many effects of hatred .
He had seen people ruining themselves as a result of hatred .
That is what made it possible for him to state very categorically that hatred never ceases by hatred , that the more you hate , the worse it becomes .
You hate me , I hate you : I hate you more , you hate me more and the hatred keeps on increasing to a point where both you and I burn ourselves in our mutual hatred , and to the Buddha the only way to solve it is that one party must stop .
Because without one party , or better still both parties , trying to conquer hatred with friendship , hatred with non-hatred , this sequence of hatred would never cease .
One way of dealing with it is based on the entire doctrine of the virtuous life of Buddhism .
Because a virtuous life is attacking the second cause of our weaknesses , namely hatred , we have in Buddhism a most interesting , and again a timeless doctrine , of loving kindness .
Loving kindness , which is the cornerstone of Buddhism , ( the foundation on which the Buddhist doctrine is built ) has not been taken by the Buddha as merely a simple ethical principle .
He had analysed the principle of loving kindness into sublime life .
Then comes Karuna - compassion .
Compassion is more easily generated .
You see somebody in trouble , you see somebody who needs your help , your heart moves towards that person and you rush to help him .
That quality of rushing to somebody 's help ~ feeling sorry for the other who is suffering , that is another aspect of loving kindness .
Then comes a third aspect of it which is more difficult to practise , and that requires tremendous love and pains , that is called Mudita that is , to share in others ' happiness - to wipe out from your mind all traces of jealousy and envy , so that you enjoy the well - being of the other person , your neighbour , even your enemy .
Last of all comes the fourth aspect of loving kindness and that is total equanimity , Upekkha .
You have no friends , no enemies , no one higher , no one lower .
You have absolutely no distinctions between one person and another , and you are totally merged in a kind of unity with all beings , all things , all situations .
So once you are able to live a life in which all these four characteristics govern your actions , there is no place for hatred , there is no place for rivalry , there is no place for competition .
So this second principle of Sila looks after this set of troubles that we would have .
Last of all comes the most significant , and the one to which you will be preparing to proceed immediately after this , that is Bhavana - meditation .
Bhavana means the training of the mind .
The word itself etymologically means development - a further development of the mind .
The Buddha believed , and he is one of the earliest to state it in that manner , that everything emanates from the man 's mind .
The organization that I represent has as the preamble to its Constitution " As wars begin in the minds of men , it is in the minds of men that the defences of peace must be constructed . "
And that reflects the first line of the first verse of the Dhammapada .
A pure mind , a trained mind , a well - developed mind , a mind that can be controlled at will , a mind that does not go on to subjects that are conducive to tension and boredom , but keeps alert , keeps on developing itself , discovering itself and within itself the secret of life , the problems of life and the reality of life , is man 's greatest treasure .
I am not surprised today that there is almost a craze , in the highly technologically developed part of the world , for all types of meditation .
It makes no difference who preaches what , or what philosophy or technique is adopted .
But the fact remains that the people are beginning to realize that a moment of quiet contemplation , a moment of deep penetrative thinking , a moment of well - directed properly controlled functioning of the mind , is an essential thing for the well - being of Man .
Two thousand five hundred years ago the Buddha taught exactly the same way .
And if there is nothing else that the man of today needs , he needs peace of mind .
He wants to get away from his tensions and battle against boredom .
And I see the answer in Buddhism , particularly in the three - fold path of Dana , Sila , Bhavana .
Look at the Buddha 's own principle as the basis or beginning of his religious life .
We hear of so many people who go from rags to riches but here was the case of a man who went from riches to rags , in search of , we may say , peace of mind - that greatest of blessings .
As a result , he saw for himself , then taught to others , that the great handicap , the source of all trouble , is attachment .
So , if somebody were to come today and say : I can take you straight to Nibbana this very minute , " I think most of us will have lots of excuses to give .
Someone will say , can't I wait till my daughter gets married ? "
Another might say , can't I wait till this World Fellowship of Buddhists General Conference is over ? " can't I wait till I have finished my assignment in Bangkok ? "
We have our own preferred times when it comes to the ultimate goal .
Whatever be our decision as to reaching this goal , there is a point at which we have no escape .
We cannot deny the fact that all modern developments have nothing to offer but insecurity and competitiveness as well as tensions and boredom associated with them .
Buddhism offers a few very simple and very efficacious methods to combat that .
And with this I feel that Buddhism has a role to play in our life and a role in which we , from the Buddhist countries , have an important part to play .
It is our responsibility to share our thinking , our knowledge , and our experience , with as many as possible , so that ultimately we all see that the message of the Buddha , which is meant for the good of mankind , continues to reach mankind in every nook and corner of the world .

New sanctuary proposal on protecting youths SANCTUARY CITY Supe 's proposal would make it harder to turn over undocumented juveniles

A San Francisco supervisor 's proposed legislation would make it more difficult for officials to hand over undocumented youths suspected of crimes to federal immigration authorities , a policy that , if approved , could have far - reaching impacts .
The proposed law would require that juvenile suspects be convicted of a felony before San Francisco officials contact federal immigration authorities - unless the suspect is charged as an adult .
Currently , immigration authorities are contacted at the time of a felony arrest - a change implemented last year by Mayor Gavin Newsom after the city 's sanctuary city policy made national headlines .
Newsom 's change angered many in the city 's immigrant community .
Supporters of Supervisor David Campos ' proposed amendment to the 1989 sanctuary city ordinance say most juveniles arrested on suspicion of a felony later see those charges dropped to a lesser offense in court .
They also argue that youths should be treated differently than adults and make the case that police would gain greater trust if the threat of splitting up families is removed .
The legislation appears to have enough support to pass the Board of Supervisors , which may be able to override a mayoral veto should that be the case .
Detractors warn that if passed , the proposal could open the city up to legal challenges .
It could also impact policies nationwide .
Angie Junck , an attorney who has been tracking sanctuary city policies for several years , said that what happens here is being closely watched .
The city has one of the few written policies in the United States , and while it was once one of the most liberal when it came to handling undocumented juvenile immigrants , the change last year made it one of the toughest .
" This is a carefully drafted piece of legislation that in a very measured way strikes the balance between two extremes : the prior extreme of never reporting anybody to immigration authorities when laws were broken and the other extreme of the existing policy , which in a very reactionary way reports children the moment they are booked for something they may or may not have done , " Campos said .
Evolving policy
San Francisco 's sanctuary city ordinance , created in the late 1980s for refugees fleeing Central American civil wars , made headlines last year after The Chronicle reported that the city was shielding young felons from deportation .
In one of the most high profile cases , Edwin Ramos , 22 , who had been arrested for several felonies as a youth but never referred to immigration officials , was arrested and charged with the 2008 slayings of Tony Bologna and his two sons .
Newsom's new policy angered Latinos and immigrants , who said the change has cast too wide a net and led to racial profiling .
Lawyers for youths who have been arrested cite cases where legal residents are referred to immigration officials , or where youths arrested for minor offenses are suddenly taken from their family .
One of the youths facing deportation is a 16 - year - old Mission District resident who did not want his name used because his immigration case is pending .
The teenager was arrested for felony graffiti , though a juvenile court judge considered the offense minor enough to warrant just six months of informal probation and some community service .
The teenager has lived here since he was 7 and says San Francisco is the only home he knows .
" I wo n't have no one to turn to - no shelter , no food , " if he is deported , said the youth , whose father lives in San Francisco .
Junck , the attorney , argued that referring children for deportation can have terrible effects because youths who may have committed a minor offense often become trapped in a web of more serious crimes , including illegally re-entering the United States to reunite with their families .
" It becomes a maze they can never get out of , " she said .
Legal questions await
However , even if Campos ' legislation passes , it could face legal challenges .
Newsom 's spokesman , Nathan Ballard , warned that if the city does " not follow state and federal law to the letter , our sanctuary city ordinance will not survive . "
Whether the current policy follows stated and federal law is in dispute .
Two lawsuits have already been filed regarding San Francisco 's sanctuary city policy .
In one , Bologna 's surviving family members are accusing the city of negligence .
In the other , Charles Fonseca argues that the city 's policy violates a state law that requires police to tell federal authorities whenever they arrest a suspected illegal immigrant for any of 14 specified drug crimes , including misdemeanor possession .
The lawsuit was thrown out once but was reinstated on appeal , and is still pending .
Supporters of Campos ' legislation said its overarching aim should n't be sacrificed because of drug crimes that account for only a fraction of the offenses youths can be charged with .
Yet a draft report prepared by the Juvenile Probation Department earlier this year showed that the majority of undocumented youths in the juvenile probation system were there because of drug offenses .
Over a four - year period , out of 252 cases involving undocumented youths , 180 were accused of drug offenses , the report said .
U.S. Attorney Joe Russoniello , a Republican appointee and vocal critic of the city 's sanctuary policy , said in a statement that " legislating ' harboring ' will provide no greater protection against federal criminal prosecution than any of their past suspect practices did . "

Surprise Candlelit Vow Renewal
Surprise sunset vow renewal in the exact spot that the couple got married
The loudest part of the crowd seemed to have its mind made up before Inglis even began talking scolding him and applauding anyone who referenced the Constitution or denounced socialism .
A man against the wall held a sign that stated Congress & CNN have awakened a sleeping giant .
One man stood up , said he considered himself a mainstream conservative and said , " I look at the government , and they 're so far outside the Constitution and there 's not a week that goes by that I do n't hear talk about revolution in our country .
The only one I know in Congress who abides by our Constitution is Ron Paul . "
A standing ovation followed .
... Inglis had to point out that he did not think health care was a right , and he even had to remind people that he was a Republican , not a Libertarian .
He did say , when asked , that if the current health care plan passes , he will opt out of the plan he has by virtue of his office and join the rest of us .
But the crowd was restless .
At one point , Inglis had to say , " You may not believe me , but I really do n't have any secret plan to get you vaccinated . "
“ Probably , ” Inglis said .
“ That ’s what he does .
That ’s what Glenn Beck is all about .
And Lou Dobbs .
I ’ve had the misfortune of listening to those shows a couple of times ...
I do n’t listen often to Glenn Beck , but when I have , I ’ve come away just so disappointed with the negativity … the ‘ We ’ve just gone to pot as a country , ’ and ‘ All is lost ’ and ‘ There is no hope . ’
It ’s not consistent with the America that I know .
The America I know was founded by people who took tiny boats across a big ocean , and pushed west in tiny wagons , and landed on the moon .
That ’s the America I heard on the streets of Boiling Springs ...
The America that Glenn Beck seems to see is a place where we all should be fearful , thinking that our best days are behind us .
It sure does sell soap , but it sure does a disservice to America ...
If Walter Cronkite said something like Glenn Beck said recently on the air , about the president being a racist , Cronkite would ’ve been fired on the spot .
But I guess the executives of these cable news shows are more enamored with the profits that come from selling this negative message than they are with undermining the faith of people in this wonderful constitutional republic . ”
" During Kathy Castor ’s healthcare town hall meeting on Thursday night , I sat in the second row with my 14 - year - old daughter , Hannah .
I saw firsthand the hatred and violence being aroused by the orchestrated efforts of the rabid right .
Ms. Castor had no more said , ' Good Evening , ' when the booing , cursing , and shouting began .
Taking firm middle ground , trying to talk about the benefits of reform for small business owners , retirees , and families , she never completed a full sentence due to the volume of the fanatical right .
Shouting turned to shoving which turned to fistfights .
It was a grotesque display of the ability of misinformation to turn people , whom I guess are otherwise decent folks , into brown - shirted thugs on behalf of insurance industry profits .
The leaders of the Republican Party , as well as Blue Dog Democrats , need to take an unequivocal stand against the hate speech being spewed by Limbaugh , Beck , and their ilk .
If not , they can hold themselves personally responsible for the violence that will eventually befall one of our legislators .
As for me , I will no longer allow my children to attend political functions out of concern for their safety . "
Glenn Beck has said Barack Obama hates white people , and jokes about assassinating the Speaker of the House .
Rush Limbaugh makes repeated and extended comparisons between Obama and Hitler .
Mobs hang a congressman in effigy and physically attack people at a town hall meeting .
Members of Congress have death threats issued against them , while other Members make jokes about lynching their colleagues .
With all of this hateful and violent rhetoric going on , I have n't seen one Republican leader asking for people to cool their rhetoric , or heard them condemn any of these tactics .
My question for Republican party , and their allies at conservative media companies that employ the kind of people making these remarks : what exactly would have to be said for you to distance yourself from these people ?
How far would someone have to go before you got uncomfortable with it ?
What would have to said before Fox News considered firing someone ?
If Glenn Beck actually directly called for the assassination of someone , would it bother you guys ?
If Rush Limbaugh just screamed a racial insult referring to the President of the United States into his microphone , would it make you pause at all ?
If Lou Dobbs went so far as to call for the murder of random Hispanics in the street , would CNN consider firing him ?
If Michael Savage actually encouraged a caller to his show to go blow up a federal building like Timothy McVeigh did , would any Republicans suggest he pull his rhetoric back a bit ?
Early on August 5th , as the corporate - funded , Limbaugh / Beck incited violence was just starting to roll , John McCain sent out a tweet : " Town hall meetings are an American tradition - we should allow everyone to express their views without disruption - even if we disagree ! "
He led ; few in his party followed .
Thursday evening South Carolina Republican Congressman Bob Inglis -- first elected in 2004 ; re-elected last year with 61 % of the vote -- went a step further .
Inglis is a mainstream conservative with a fairly lockstep party - line voting record .
But he 's more in the Lindsey Graham camp than the KKK / Jim DeMint camp in South Carolina politics .
Thursday he felt the wrath of the KKK / Jim DeMint camp when he held a town hall meeting to talk with his constituents about health care reform , which he opposes .
The 350 constituents who showed up oppose it too-- but they oppose a lot more than just health care reform and they were hell bent on having their say .
Revved up by pent - up , self - righteous rage , too much Fox News , and enabled by corporately - funded astro - turf operations , many in the audience were looking for trouble .
One man started screaming that " There is no way , shape or form we need to have a national healthcare system .
No !
Nothing !!
None !
It 's got to stop now ! "
They heckled and shouted down Inglis even as he tried to tell them he opposes the health care legislation the Democrats are trying to pass .
( By the way , if you 're interested , in how badly South Carolinians are doing health care - wise and how the proposed legislation would help them specifically , there 's a very informative report from the Center For American Progress , explaining , among other things , that South Carolina 's uninsured rate has increased by 17 % since 2007 , that there are 760,000 uninsured people in the state and that the average family premium there will rise from $ 12,659 to $ 21,602 by 2019 without health care reform .
Not the kind of information Inglis was interested in giving or this audience would have been receptive to in the slightest . )
Instead they wanted to talk about forcing immigrants to be sent back to their countries , about the dangers of Obama declaring martial law , about Obama forcing them to get vaccinated , and about the horrors of Big Government .
Inglis was mercilessly boo-ed when he suggested that in some cases government can play a positive role in people 's lives .
But the most calamitous moment in the meeting came when someone in the audience asked about fear mongering by Hate Talkers like Glenn Beck .
" What I would suggest , " said Inglis , " is turn that television off when he comes on . "
The place exploded in rage and many got up and left -- in effect , turning off Inglis , not Beck .
Watch the video of an uncomfortable conservative Republican congressman facing his fascist base , reaping what his party has sown .
Later Inglis talked with a local blogger who asked him if people exploded because he had used the word " fear - mongering " in relation to Beck :
This morning I was on the phone with a very different kind of politician than Bob Inglis .
Doug Tudor is a retired career Navy man who is running for Congress in the Polk County area of Florida , a seat being abandoned by Adam Putnam and also being contested by a far right Republican and an only slightly less far right Blue Dog .
Doug is a progressive who very much believes in the good that government can do in people 's lives and in the need to bring health care reform to this country .
He 's a grassroots candidate -- with no corporate funding -- and I want to ask you to read his account of a health care town hall he attended last week and then to think about donating -- even if only $ 5 or $ 10 -- to his ActBlue page

Global revolt against dangerous untested jab builds momentum
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet.com
Friday , August 28 , 2009
According to a Fox News poll , the majority of respondents think that the swine flu vaccine is deadlier than the actual virus itself , emphasizing the growing momentum in the revolt against government plans to institute mass H1N1 vaccination programs .
Despite attempts on behalf of governments and their lapdog corporate media allies to push the necessity of the H1N1 vaccination , large numbers of the general public along with health workers have made it known that they will refuse to take the shot .
The latest effort on behalf of the establishment to push the vaccine occurred earlier this week when Dr. Nancy Snyderman , billed as chief medical editor at NBC News , stated during an MSNBC panel discussion that people should reject “ conspiracy theories ” about the vaccine ’s safety , trust the government and “ get your damn vaccine ” .
The desperation and anger in Snyderman ’s snarly voice was clearly a result of frustration arising out of the fact that vast numbers of people are getting educated about what will actually be in the vaccine .
The swine flu vaccine is being rushed through safety procedures while governments have provided pharmaceutical companies with blanket immunity from lawsuits arriving out of the vaccine causing deaths and injuries .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
It was previously revealed that some batches of the vaccine will contain mercury , a toxin linked with autism and neurological disorders .
The vaccine will also contain the dangerous ingredient squalene , which has been directly linked with cases of Gulf War Syndrome and a host of other debilitating diseases .

It was also recently reported that the UK government sent a confidential letter to senior neurologists telling them to be on the alert for cases of a brain disorder called Guillain - Barre Syndrome ( GBS ) , which could be triggered by the vaccine .
The Fox News poll on the issue is not scientific but is impossible to “ game ” for one side or the other because votes are restricted to one per IP address .
The results show that 50 % think the vaccine is a greater risk than the virus , 32 % think not taking the vaccine is the greater risk , while 19 % are undecided .
The poll arrives on the back of a study published in the world ’s foremost peer - reviewed medical journal which found that half of Hong Kong ’s medical workers would refuse to take the swine flu vaccine because of fears about its safety .
Research conducted by the University of Hong Kong and made public by the British Medical Journal consistently found that less than half of 8,500 doctors and nurses in public hospitals would accept vaccination against H1N1 influenza .
“ The major barriers identified were fear of side effects and doubts about efficacy . ”
The study reveals .
Microbiologists and infectious disease experts involved in the study also suggest that the number of dissenters is likely to be broadly representative of health workers worldwide .
This followed a survey conducted by Nursing Times magazine in which it was discovered that just 37 per cent of nurses and frontline health workers said they would take the swine flu vaccine in a survey conducted by Nursing Times magazine .
30 per cent said they would not be immunized and 33 per cent said they were unsure .
Two separate polls of GPs in Britain have also revealed that one in two doctors have severe reservations over the safety of the forthcoming H1N1 flu vaccine , raising serious questions over the government ’s planned mass vaccination program .
A poll of doctors for Pulse magazine found that 49 % would reject the vaccine with 9 % still undecided .
56 of the 115 GPs surveyed said they did not intend to receive the jab , according to the UK ’s leading medical weekly publication for health professionals .
A second poll conducted by GP magazine reveals that Up to 60 % of GPs have severe doubts over the proposed vaccine .
Of 216 GPs surveyed , 29 % say they will outright refuse to be vaccinated , while a further 29 % remain unsure .
Only 41 % of doctors said they would definitely take the shot .

As some of you know I ’ve been digging more deeply into Ruby lately , using various libraries and in general having some Ruby fun .
Well , throughout all this I ’ve been using NetBeans as my IDE .
It ’s been interesting switching over from Eclipse , I ’ve been feeling a little unproductive since I did n’t know any of the shortcuts .
After a while it got particularly annoying so I decided to force myself to learn all the useful shortcuts , mostly by denying myself the use of the mouse as much as I could :) .
Many of the shortcuts that work for a Java in NetBeans do n’t work for Ruby , but I did eventually settle on a list of the most useful ones ( slowly starting to learn to use these instead of doing things the hard way ) .
Anyways , I thought I ’d share :
Code Editor - Related Shortcuts
Ctrl + Shift + Up – copy line under cursor up .

Alt + Shift + Period – this one is used for selection , every time you press this one the selection widens to capture the next logical syntactic element .
For example if you have your cursor over a word , pressing this ones would select the whole word , pressing again would select the whole line .
If you ’re inside a method definition , pressing it again would select the content of the method ( between def .. end ) , once more would select the whole method .
If you continue pressing it , you will eventually select the whole file .
Very handy .

Ctrl + K – complete word by inserting word from buffer .
This one is awesome !
Start typing a word then press the shortcut – it will attempt to complete the word based on what else is currently in the file .
If you press it repeatedly , it will cycle through all possible words in the file that might complete what you started typing .
It does this very simply by scanning backwards through the file from your current position .
It is usually correct the first time .
Considering that IntelliSense is almost useless for Ruby development , this one is especially handy .

KHARTOUM ( Reuters ) - Police used teargas to disperse protesters rallying in support of a Sudanese woman facing 40 lashes for wearing trousers in public Tuesday , a case that has become a public test of Sudan ’s indecency laws .
Lubna Hussein , a former journalist and U.N. press officer , was arrested with 12 other women during a party at a Khartoum restaurant in July and charged with being indecently dressed .
Women ’s groups have complained that the law gives no clear definition of indecent dress , leaving the decision of whether to arrest a woman up to individual police officers .
Dozens of men and ululating women gathered outside a Khartoum court room where Hussein appeared Tuesday , carrying banners with the message “ No return to the dark ages ” and “ Lubna ’s case is a case for all Sudanese women . ”
Speaking after the hearing , Hussein said the judge had adjourned her case until September 7 .
“ They want to check with the U.N. whether I have immunity from prosecution .
I do n’t know why they are doing this because I have already resigned from the United Nations .
I think they just want to delay the case , ” she told Reuters .
Hussein said she resigned from her U.N. job last week to give up any legal immunity so that she could pursue the case to prove her innocence and challenge the decency law .

Journalists were allowed into the downtown court building , but a line of police prevented them from entering the room where the case was heard .
Hussein went on to greet her supporters , gathered on a traffic island , then led them on a march , blocking a busy road .
In a rare and short unauthorized rally , they flashed V - for - Victory signs and received supportive hoots from passing cars .
Armed riot police advanced toward the crowd , beating their shields with batons .
Officers later fired teargas canisters into the air , forcing the crowd to disperse .
“ We are against this law .
It is against women , against Islam and against human rights , ” said Zainab Badradin , one of the women in the crowd .
“ I want to send a message to the government to stop harassing women , ” said Nusayba Abdel Mahmoud , 20 , who came to the rally wearing jeans .
“ This is what I wear .
It is normal . ”

Indecency cases are not uncommon in Sudan , where there is a large cultural gap between the mostly Muslim and Arab - oriented north and the mainly Christian south .
Hussein has attracted attention by publicizing her case , posing for photos in her loose green trousers and inviting journalists to campaign against dress codes sporadically imposed in the capital .
“ Her main argument is that her clothes are decent and that she did not break the law , ” defense lawyer Nabil Adib Abdalla told Reuters shortly before the hearing .
“ Failing that , we will ask for a stay of the proceedings to challenge the trial in the constitutional court ...
We are saying the law is so widely drafted that it contravenes her basic right , her right to a fair trial , ” he added .
Hussein told reporters 10 of the women arrested with her pleaded guilty and were whipped the day afterwards .
U.N. Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon last week said he was “ deeply concerned ” by the case .
Max Blumenthal at The Daily Beast has a damning expose of Louisiana Sen .
David Vitter 's incredible hypocrisy in dealing with the health - care teabagging crowd .
First ,
Vitter crows to the press that , unlike some of his fellow congresscritters , he 's not afraid to have teabaggers at his town hall meetings :
“ Please know that this and any other angry mob is welcome at my town - hall meetings whenever you want to come , ” Vitter declared , bringing the audience to its feet with a raucous ovation .
But what he apparently is afraid of is dealing with any Democrats who favor health - care reform -- because he excluded them from his town halls :
At a town - hall meeting on August 10 in Jefferson Parish , many local constituents were reportedly turned away while Tea Party activists were allowed to enter .
When the event concluded , Vitter rushed out of the back door and away from the press and his constituents , guarded by a phalanx of police officers .
But the most disturbing part of the piece featured Vitter actually promoting the effort by right - wing extremists -- which has been similarly encouraged by both Glenn Beck , Neil Cavuto , and Sean Hannity -- to advocate " state sovereignty " as a means of defying the federal government :
Vitter earned even more enthusiastic cheers with a not - so - subtle appeal to states ’ rights .
When an audience member asked him if Louisiana could withdraw from Obama ’s health - care plan if it passed , Vitter proclaimed , “ The first thing we need to do is elect members of Congress who respect the Tenth Amendment . ”
Invocations of the Tenth Amendment , which reserves “ powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution ” to the “ states respectively , or to the people , ” have become common among secessionists seeking a veneer of constitutional legitimacy .
As I explained when Beck did this , these " 10th Amendment " theories are not only highly dubious , they actually originated in the 1990s with the black - helicopter / militia crowd :
Now , it 's one thing to point out the radical origins of these " constitutional theories . "
But it 's also important to understand where they want to take us -- to a radically decentralized form of government that was first suggested in the 1970s by the far - right Posse Comitatus movement .
They essentially argue for a constitutional originalism that would not only end the federal income tax , destroy all civil - rights laws , and demolish the Fed , but would also re-legalize slavery , strip women of the right to vote , and remove the principle of equal protection under the law .
Blumenthal explains that this all appears to be Vitter 's 2010 re-election strategy -- get the nutcases worked up into a frenzy so they can forget about the D.C. Madam scandal and those infamous diapers he evidently is fond of :
Ah , Texas .
Big sky country , land of the longhorn steer , Shinerbock brew , and some of the best songwriters in North America .
I used to spend a lot of time around that area , and I genuinely loved it .
Unfortunately Texas gets a bad rap – between oil magnates and the Bush family , as well as its public face as a predominantly “ red ” state , Texas has become the butt of countless redneck jokes and has wrongly earned the disdain of the liberal left .
In reality , the people in Texas are pretty awesome , surprisingly liberal , and serve some of the best barbecue in the known world .
I am constantly defending the Lone Star State back home in Canada against my more liberal friends who buy into the cliches – yeah , everybody owns guns , but in all the time I spent there I did n’t witness a single lynching , abortion clinic bombing or pro-war rally .
Goes to show that things are n’t always what they appear to be .
However , sometimes the stereotypes are well - founded – at least as far as America is concerned – because I can’t imagine something like this happening anywhere else .
Apparently jury selection has just begun in what I can categorically say is the most bizarre trial I ’ve seen all year .
According to Fox News ( and yeah , I feel as dirty as you do for referencing Fox News ) six guys who used to work at a Corpus Christi State School for the mentally disabled are up on charges for staging and filming Fight Club - esque brawls between the residents .
Let me be perfectly clear : these guys took the Bum Fight framework and applied it to delayed people .
At the risk of sounding crass , which I do n’t mean to be , they ’re monopolizing on an extremely vulnerable subset of our society to bring Retard Fights to the masses ?
Are you fucking serious ?
Let ’s break it down .
I do n’t pretend to have anything more than a cursory understanding of the nature of developmental disabilities .
Like most people I went to a school that housed a “ special education ” class for those with mild to serious delays , and again like most people , I did n’t pay an awful lot of attention to what went on in that class – it was sort of an oddity , I guess ; not a carnival sideshow , nothing to be gawked at or ridiculed , just a group of people with some very difficult challenges to overcome .
I ’m not going to lie and say I was perfectly comfortable interacting with the special ed kids – it ’s not that I was afraid of them or anything like that , I just did n’t know how to interact with them .
They were all friendly people , but the way they associated with the rest of the school population was understandably stilted – if they were able to associate at all , because obviously the more pronounced their disabilities , the less able they were to communicate in a ( and I cringe as I use the term ) “ normal ” way .
That said , I never agreed – tacitly or overtly – with the way a lot of my peers treated the special ed students .
I never got on board the standard pubescent band wagon that preaches intolerance to anything remotely different that inserted itself into our day - to - day paradigm .
I did n’t rag on people for any reason that was n’t their own fault : acne , awkwardness , nerdy tendencies , sexual orientation , and certainly not developmental delays .
If you were an asshole that deserved to be taken down a peg or two , fine – I ’d do that .
Otherwise I never saw it as fair or reasonable to castigate somebody for so - called deviances that separated them from the general school population , but were just part of their makeup .
I have several close friends who work with special needs children : one who runs a group home for autistic teens , and one who has worked closely with kids who have generalized delays .
I have the utmost respect for them , because in my opinion , it takes a very dedicated and empathetic individual to be able to do that kind of job and do it well .
These two amazing women have worked very hard to positively influence the growth and lives of their clients ( which is n’t even really the right word , given the relationship that has developed between my friends and their charges more closely resembles family ) , and I consider that reason for applause .
What sickens me most about this case in Texas is that it undermines all the work my friends ( and hundreds others like them ) have done .
A big part of their work has been to change the popular perception of developmental delays and mental disorders – to educate people about the challenges faced by their charges every day , to put to rest the decades - old stigmas attached to those challenges , to humanize the issue so we no longer look at these people as sideshow freaks or objects of ridicule .
And yet , everywhere we turn , the general perception in media is still polarized .
For every “ I Am Sam ” there ’s a “ Waterboy ” or worse , “ The Ringer ” that makes light out of a serious situation .
I do n’t understand why it ’s funny to see that Jackass jackass pretend to be delayed so he can compete in the Special Olympics .
I ’m all about making fun of just about everything , because I truly believe it ’s dangerous to take everything too seriously , but there ’s a limit .
There ’s comedy and then there ’s exploitation , and if you cross that line , I stop laughing and start looking for my sniper rifle , because it ’s not cool .
That ’s the worst part about this case .
These guys would n’t be making these sicko asshole videos if there was n’t some kind of market for it .
People want to see this stuff , just the same way they want to see Bum Fights and Saw part 17 and Passion of the Christ and extreme sadomasochistic porn and everything else .
I hate to rag on the obvious , but the parallel is too clear to ignore – we ’re at the point where we ’re bored with the gladiators and have taken to throwing people to hungry lions – and we ’re cheering for the lions .
Somebody out there wants to see this go down , and I think that ’s the root of the problem – not the people providing the service , but the people asking for it .
I implore you ,
Texans the world over : do n’t let this shit fly .
If you ’re going to be stereotyped for doling out harsh justice , make sure the right people get it .
Hang these assholes up to dry .
With the political rows that have dominated this Formula 1 season more or less over apart from a few late skirmishes , attention in Valencia has turned to the driver market .
The key move this season is Fernando Alonso 's prospective switch to Ferrari .
This has not been officially confirmed yet , but it is considered a given .
And it will trigger a series of swaps that will significantly change the look of the F1 grid next season .
Among the top teams , only Red Bull are not changing their line - up and there are attractive seats available at Ferrari , McLaren and Brawn .
In the wake of Alonso 's move , the key men in the market place are Kimi Raikkonen and Robert Kubica .
Assuming Jenson Button stays at Brawn - which is not 100 % certain , but looks very likely - they are the A - listers who will be top of most teams ' shopping list .
The driver market is always complicated - but the injury suffered by Felipe Massa has made it more Byzantine than usual this summer .
Ferrari have actually got themselves into a bit of a pickle .
Alonso 's arrival means they have three of the top drivers in F1 for next season and only two cars to put them in , as both Felipe Massa and Raikkonen are under contract until the end of 2010 .
They intended to partner Alonso with Massa , but the Brazilian has a fractured skull following his accident in qualifying for the Hungarian Grand Prix .
Although he is expected to make a full recovery , in terms of living a normal life , it is impossible to know right now whether he will be able to race in F1 again , even if Brawn driver Rubens Barrichello and Massa 's race engineer Rob Smedley , probably the two people closest to him in the paddock , are optimistic .
Massa is talking about an emotional return for the Brazilian Grand Prix in October , but many feel that may well be over - optimistic , even allowing for the traditionally astonishing powers of recovery of F1 drivers .
And if Massa cannot drive until after the end of the season - which means he might not be able to do so until January , because of the testing restrictions in December - that makes getting rid of Raikkonen less immediately appealing .
Despite that , it does appear that the Finn will be the one to leave Ferrari , for whom one solution would be to gamble on Massa being fit and , if he is n't , take one of the experienced drivers who may be left standing after the game of musical chairs finishes .
Jarno Trulli looks certain to leave Toyota - whose entire future in F1 may be in doubt - and the futures of Rubens Barrichello , Giancarlo Fisichella and Nick Heidfeld are all up in the air .
All would make a more than decent one - year stand - in .
In that eventuality , the question is where Raikkonen will end up .
There are a number of interesting possibilities .
His advisors are known to have had talks with Brawn , which interests him , and Toyota , which does not .
And another obvious possibility is Renault , who need a top - liner to replace Alonso .
And there is one intriguing possibility that I have not heard discussed on the paddock rumour mill - could Raikkonen make a shock return to McLaren ?
It comes a bit out of left - field and might seem outlandish , but bear with me on it for a moment .
Lewis Hamilton is locked in there until 2012 , but the second seat is open .
Hamilton 's team - mate Heikki Kovalainen is under pressure because of his unconvincing performances in races and there has been talk of Nico Rosberg moving over from Williams .
But , if you were McLaren , why replace one guy who is not as quick as Hamilton with , in Rosberg , another who is n't either but might be more disruptive ?
Raikkonen , on the other hand , is well known by McLaren having driven for them from 2002 - 6 , and he is low maintenance - he just gets in the car and drives and could n't care less who his team - mate is .
Rosberg is known to be wary of facing Hamilton in the same car - he was his team - mate in karting and knows how quick he is - and Kubica has a reputation as hard work and demanding .
Raikkonen is the total opposite .
He would not be bothered about the team 's focus on Hamilton .
He would just do his job and go home - just like he always has .
Not only that , but he left McLaren largely because he fell out with Ron Dennis , but the former boss has no involvement in the F1 team any more .
So a fresh link with Raikkonen could be an appealing idea for McLaren - and vice versa .
And read this quote from team boss Martin Whitmarsh after Sunday 's European Grand Prix : " Kimi 's really raised his game and all weekend has done a great job and Heikki has always been a fantastic team player and a good asset in our team but his race pace has n't been good enough . "
Of course , all of that might be hugely wide of the mark , in which case Raikkonen will probably end up at Brawn or Renault - at both of which Kubica must be considered a contender .
The Pole has been strongly linked with a move to Williams following BMW 's decision to quit F1 .
But this weekend he has opened negotiations with Brawn , which would surely be a more appealing option considering the two teams ' respective performance this season .
It is a difficult decision for Brawn .
Given that Raikkonen has been a little off the boil in the last couple of seasons , Kubica is arguably the best driver on the market this season .
But he has a reputation for being disruptive inside a team and Ross Brawn might prefer not to disturb the equanimity of Button , the man who still looks likely to be world champion this year .
On top of that , Kubica is understood to want a one - year contract so he has the ability to move on for 2011 if a better drive becomes available , while Brawn would almost certainly want him to sign for two seasons .
Traditionally , early September is the time the big pieces in the driver market puzzle begin to fall into place .
But given the inherent complications , this season it could be a good deal later than that .

Beer activists are calling on the government to scrap tax on brews made with just 2.8 % alcohol .
But would drinkers sup a weaker pint for the sake of 60 p ?
It has the same rich brown body and frothy head as most of the hundreds of beers on tap at the Great British Beer Festival .
Swilling back a mouthful may well prompt the same satisfying smack of the lips and hoppy aftertaste .
But drinking four or five of Welton 's Pride ' n '
Joy will not have quite the same inebriating effect as Oakham brewery 's formidable Attilla , at 7.5 % alcohol , or even Thwaites '
Wainwright , at a fairly standard 4.1 % .
Sussex - brewed Pride ' n '
Joy is being showcased by the Campaign for Real Ale ( Camra ) at the festival , in London 's Earl 's Court in a bid to prove that weaker beer can be tasty .
And , at 2.8 % alcohol , it is a little over half the strength of many premium beers .
Lower strength beers have rated highly among the hundreds at the festival With British palates grown accustomed to high - strength continental lagers , many brewers also upped their ale 's alcohol content as people shunned traditional milds and weaker " boys bitters " .
It left mid-strength beers difficult to come by , with a resultant hangover for the government in the form of drink - fuelled violence and rising rates of alcohol - related illness .
However , Camra says one remedy may be easily at hand , with EU rules allowing member states to apply reduced excise rates to beers not exceeding 2.8 % .
It claims completely scrapping tax on these lower alcohol brews would slash the price of a pint by up to 60 p , although the Treasury does not recognise this figure .
In a survey , 55 % of respondents told Camra they would try a more timid tipple .
' People 's pint '
Its chief executive , Mike Benner , says that with a recession hitting people 's pockets and pubs closing " at a rate of seven a day " , it is the perfect time to introduce a duty - free " People 's Pint " .
" This is an opportunity to make it easier for people to drink responsibly whilst also supporting the tens of thousands of jobs under threat as a result of falling beer sales and pub closures , " he says .
" It 's quite common in pubs to hear people trying to control consumption by asking for shandy .
This would give people the option of a tasty bitter instead . "
Mr Benner will be pressing Chancellor Alistair Darling to include the measure in November 's pre-Budget report and the Treasury says it will engage with the drinks industry on alcohol duty .
In the past a lot of brewers have made poor quality lower strength beers that taste like dishwater
Ray Welton , independent brewer
Of course , it 's not necessarily a solution that would keep all sides happy .
" Alcohol duties are an important contributor to the public finances , " a government spokesman cautions .
Camra 's case has the backing of at least one influential voice which warns about Britain 's rising alcohol consumption - Alcohol Concern " Having more lower strength drinks on the market allows people to enjoy a night out while making it easier to stay within safe drinking guidelines , " says the charity 's chief executive , Don Shenker .
But this is not the first time brewers have tried sipping from a more moderate chalice .
Concerns over binge drinking have led the alcohol industry to promote responsible intake .
Brewers of premium strength beers , such as Beck 's and Stella Artois , are now touting 4 % varieties .
And Carling could justifiably claim to be ahead of Camra 's call , having launched its C2 brand - at 2 % - in 2006 .
Guinness too has been trialling its 2.8 % " Mid-Strength " in Ireland .
But if they were hoping for a mass conversion , they so far have been disappointed , says industry analyst Graham Page .
These tamer brews have " not done anything spectacular , " says Mr Page , of market research company Nielsen .
' Thinner flavour ' " If you 're driving or have work to do after lunch then it works but part of the difficulty for brands of 2 to 3 % is that , comparatively , the flavour characteristics are thinner . "
" I 've been in the industry 40 years and no - one has found a solution to the low or mid-strength alcohol opportunity . "
Many micro- breweries already enjoy significant tax breaks and so may not , in reality , be able to cut as much as 60 p from a pint , he adds .
Even if some can - and the public are ready to respond to price incentives - brewer Ray Welton admits mid-strength beer has always been " very difficult to sell " .
It was frustration at " poor quality , lower strength beers that tasted like dishwater " that prompted him to produce Pride ' n '
Joy , two years after setting up his Horsham - based operation in 1995 .
Finding lower strength beer has become difficult Mr Welton believes reducing duty would encourage more brewers to follow suit - though he admits it is " the hardest beer to brew " .
Using less sugar and malt to reduce the alcohol content also means using fewer hops to balance the taste - but it's these ingredients that give beer its flavour .
The end product also gives publicans a problem , in that a lower alcohol content reduces a beer 's lifespan .
Even then , a landlord must work hard to convince his regulars to give it a go .
Just ask Simon Johnson , who runs the White Horse in Maplehurst , Sussex .
" I might have six beers on and they 'll look at the low alcohol one and say ' it looks a bit thin ' , " he says .
" I have to give them a sample and once they taste it , they 'll buy it . "
Ratings on the festival 's website seem to bear out this view , with visitors awarding four out of five to Belhaven 60 /- , an East Lothian light beer at 2.9 % , and several 3.6 % products such as Wells Eagle IPA and Hobson 's Twisted Spire .
So how would it go down with punters at the Earl 's Court festival ?
Would they too be prepared to stomach a lower alcohol pint ?
Tom Cosens , 35 , of Reigate in Surrey , thought Pride ' n ' Joy " quite refreshing " .
" I would n't immediately think that 's a weak bitter .
It 's still quite flavoursome and if it was 60 p cheaper I would definitely drink it . "
Richard Sanders , 59 , from Loughborough , Leicestershire , agreed .
" For a low gravity beer , it has quite a lot of character .
On a hot summer 's day it would be lovely . "
So , brewing good low alcohol beers seems possible .
Whether the market is large enough to encourage mass production - and prompt a change in the nation 's drinking habits - remains to be seen .
Below is a selection of your comments .
The reason that HMRC does n't recognise the 60 p figure is that it 's highly unrealistic .
Beer gets taxed by the % of alcohol in it , with the rate working out at about 9.5 pence per percentage point of alcohol in a pint .
Therefore a pint would need to have been over 6 % alcohol for punters to save 60 pence !
A saving of 40 p ( UK strength ) or 50 p ( export strength ) seems more realistic .

Once again a sizeable proportion of the population has lost the plot in displaying ignorance or incomprehension of perfectly good solutions from the past .
There is a myriad of very flavoursome low to mid-strength beers produced by independent breweries who have not taken the easy route of upping the ABV % .
This will be lost on those whose idea of social drinking requires an equally high sugar content , or decanting their night 's consumption into the gutter , or the taxi on the way home .
J Fairfield , Derby
Why can't all alcohol be taxed at a flat rate based on the quantity of ethanol ( the stuff that makes you drunk ) in it ?
That way , the tax on a pint of 3 % will be half that of 6 % .
Thus the tax on a litre of 40 % spirit will be 8 times that of a litre of 5 % beer .
Alister Troup , Aberdeen
Yes I would certainly , being of Asian descent I have a low tolerance for alcohol .
The trend in recent years has been for beer and wine strength to increase , and also now many bars sell a " small " glass of wine which is 175 ml .
Now most premium beer is about 5 % which might be OK for most people but for me it is too strong for more than a couple of pints .
Having a reduced strength beer would be useful as I would be more likely to be able to have a couple more drinks than currently without getting in a horrible state .
However this would come with the caveat that it should be good beer , rather then just being weak .
If it is bad beer it wo n't get bought anyway .
But I am all for having reduced alcohol drinks .
Seb , London
If it 's good beer , I 'll drink it ( and delight in the price ) .
Like many people , I drink for flavour and not for alcohol
Nic , London
As a keen sportsman , I train on a regular basis .
Due to this I often opt for a weaker beer so that I can still go out with my friends on a night out , minus a hangover the following day .
This however does become more difficult as some establishments do n't even sell bitter ( which usually has the lowest percentage ) and because of this I will transfer onto soft drinks .
I am sure that this is also the case for a lot of other sports people out there , so i think that the introduction of lower percentage beers is a great idea .
And if the cost is even less , then that 's just an added bonus .
Sam Brennan , Peel , Isle of Man How about a new drink size of 3/4 pint , for 90 p cheaper ?
A half is too small but a full pint 's often too big .
Most people now drink lager , and who cares about the taste of lager so long as it's not metallic from bad storage ?
Might as well make Stella et al 0 % alcohol and avoid all those God-awful streets of drunkenness at weekends .
Robert , Peterborough I have long said that beers should be costed on there ABV .
To an extent they are but an ale at 3.6 % should cost a lot less than a beer at the higher end of say 5.0 % .
The government certainly wont see dropping tax on lower ABV drinks as a good idea as they see it as revenue lost , more than likely the brewer will see it as the same .
Sadly until the days of profit ruling have gone , binge drinking is here to stay .
Cheers .
A Whyte , Lancaster England .
As a gout sufferer I already seek out the lighter option .
I think this makes sense and would help curb other alcohol related issues we face today .
Parker , London
It could work for a genuinely good product .
But of course some makers are bound to get on the bandwagon and produce utter swill .
Well , some do already , and we are not children .
Consumers have faced worse challenges so why not give it a try .
The level of tax on drinks is scandalous .

If politicians want to effect economic recovery , national competitiveness , good public health and high civic engagement , they have a duty to keep the internet free and open .
But politicians around the world seem willing to sacrifice their national interest to keep a few powerful phone and telcoms companies happy .
Take the Telcoms Package now before the EU : among other things , the package paves the way for ISPs and Quangos to block or slow access to websites and services on an arbitrary basis .
At the same time , ISPs are instituting and enforcing strict bandwidth limits on their customers , citing shocking statistics about the bandwidth hogs who consume vastly more resources than the average punter .
Between filtering , fiddling connection speeds and capping usage , ISPs are pulling the rug out from under the nations that have sustained them with generous subsidies and regulation .
Take filtering : by allowing ISPs to silently block access to sites that displease them , we invite all the ills that accompany censorship – Telus , a Canadian telcom that blocked access to a site established by its striking workers where they were airing their grievances .
Around the world , ISPs co-operate with censorious governments in their mission to keep their citizens in the dark : for example , ISPs in the United Arab Emirates are blocking access to stories about a UAE royal family member who was video - recorded torturing a merchant with whom he had a business dispute .
As a matter of policy , Transport for London is n't allowed to block us from riding the tube to a rally in support of striking transit workers ; British Gas does n't turn our heat off if they suspect we 're housing a benefits cheat ; and BT does n't divert our phone calls if we 're ringing up a competitor to change carriers .
Giving an ISP censorship powers — and then layering censorship in secrecy and arbitrariness — we make the internet a less trustworthy and less useful place to be .
ISPs would also like to be able to arbitrarily slow or degrade our network connections depending on what we 're doing and with whom .
In the classic " traffic shaping " scenario , a company like Virgin Media strikes a deal with Yahoo to serve its videos on a preferential basis , and then slows its customers ' connections to Google , Hulu , and other videohosting sites to ensure that Virgin 's videos are the quickest to load .
As the Craigslist founder , Craig Newmark , said , this is like the phone company putting you on hold when your ring your local pizzeria , with a message inviting you to press one to be immediately connected to Domino's , its " preferred pizza partner " .
But the real action in network fiddling is n't the battle between giants such as Yahoo and Google .
Both well - established , have armies of otherwise unoccupied " business development " people lying around , and are handily capable of fanning out across the globe and buying lunch for their opposite numbers at every telcoms operator on the planet .
The real victims of network discrimination are the nimble little startups , the firms that are in the same position today that Google was in 10 years ago when it consisted of a few marginally funded hackers and some taped - together hardware under a desk .
Google need n't be the last Google .
It need n't be the last firm to emerge from the fevered imagination of two bright kids and turn the world on its ear .
And it need not always come from Silicon Valley .
Just as Research in Motion was able to take the world by storm from Waterloo , Ontario ; just as Moo.com was able to conquer the world 's business - card needs from Clerkenwell , so , too could the next remarkable startup emerge from the UK .
Unless , that is , the cost of entry into the market goes up by four or five orders of magnitude , growing to encompass the cost of a horde of gladhanding negotiators who must first secure the permission of gatekeepers at the telcoms giants .
In that case , only the least experimental , safest , lowest - risk / lowest - return firms will be capitalized , because no one wants to take a big plunge on a risky proposition that could be stopped dead in its tracks by a phone company that 's already given pole position to an incumbent .
Finally , there 's the question of metered billing for ISP customers .
The logic goes like this : " You have a 20 Mbs connection , but if you use that connection as though it were unmetered , you will saturate our bandwidth and everyone will suffer . "
ISPs like to claim that their caps are " fair " and that the majority of users fit comfortably beneath them , and that only a tiny fraction of extraordinary bandwidth hogs reach the ceiling .
The reality is that network usage follows a standard statistical distribution , the " Pareto Distribution , " a power - law curve in which the most active users are exponentially more active than the next - most - active group , who are exponentially more active than the next group , and so on .
This means that even if you kick off the 2 % at the far right - hand side of the curve , the new top 2 % will continue to be exponentially more active than the remainder .
Think of it this way : there will always be a group of users in the " top 2 % " of bandwidth consumption .
If you kick those users off , the next - most - active group will then be at the top .
You can't have a population that does n't have a ninety - eighth percentile .
But the real problem of per-usage billing is that no one – not even the most experienced internet user – can determine in advance how much bandwidth they 're about to consume before they consume it .
Before you clicked on this article , you had no way of knowing how many bytes your computer would consume before clicking on it .
And now that you 've clicked on it , chances are that you still do n't know how many bytes you 've consumed .
Imagine if a restaurant billed you by the number of air - molecules you displaced during your meal , or if your phone - bills varied on the total number of syllables you uttered at 2 dB or higher .
Even ISPs are n't good at figuring this stuff out .
Users have no intuition about their bandwidth consumption and precious little control over it .
Metering usage discourages experimentation .
If you do n't know whether your next click will cost you 10 p or £ 2 , you will become very conservative about your clicks .
Just look at the old AOL , which charged by the minute for access , and saw that very few punters were willing to poke around the many offerings its partners had assembled on its platform .
Rather , these people logged in for as short a period as possible and logged off when they were done , always hearing the clock ticking away in the background as they worked .
This is good news for incumbents who have already established their value propositions for their customers , but it 's a death sentence for anything new emerging on the net .
Between these three factors – reducing the perceived value of the net , reducing the ability of new entrants to disrupt incumbents , and penalizing those who explore new services on the net – we are at risk of scaring people away from the network , of giving competitive advantage to firms in better - regulated nations , of making it harder for people to use the net to weather disasters , to talk to their government and to each other .
Telcoms companies argue that their responsibility is to their shareholders , not the public interest , and that they are only taking the course of maximum profitability .
It 's not their business to ensure that the Googles of tomorrow attain liftoff from the garages in which they are born .
But telcoms firms are all recipients of invaluable public subsidy in the form of rights of way and other grants that allow them to string their wires over and under our streets and through our homes .
You and I can't go spelunking in the sewers with a spool of cable to wire up our own alternative network .
And if the phone companies had to negotiate for every pole , every sewer , every punch - down , every junction box , every road they get to tear up , they 'd go broke .
All the money in the world could n't pay for the access they get for free every day .
If they do n't like it , they do n't have to do it .
But we do n't have to give them our sewers and streets and walls , either .
Governments and regulators are in a position to demand that these recipients of public subsidy adhere to a minimum standard of public interest .
If they do n't like it , let them get into another line of work – give them 60 days to get their wires out of our dirt and then sell the franchise to provide network services to a competitor who will promise to give us a solid digital future in exchange for our generosity .

Antony Hegarty -- the 38 - year - old , Britain - born , New York - based leader of Antony and the Johnsons -- reduces easily in print : " A white man who sounds like a black woman , " Alexis Petridis wrote for The Guardian in January .
" The ethereal torch singer , " said The New York Times ' Melena Ryzik this spring in the first sentence of the newspaper 's second profile of Antony .
Three years earlier , The Times ' Ben Ratliff described Antony as " a teenager who can communicate only through music , " beneath a tawdry headline that alliterated the singer as the " musical manchild . "
The Sun's Simon Cosyns wrapped all of Antony 's defining characteristics -- large , queer , theatric , delicate and beautiful -- inside one platitudinous sentence : " Adopting a pose something like an effeminate Roman emperor , the transgender singer launches into his operatic , beatific falsetto . "
But for today , Antony is n't posing .
Instead , he 's sitting comfortably in a big- armed wooden Adirondack chair in Podunk , a tiny tearoom in Manhattan 's Lower East Side .
The setting emphasizes Antony 's physique , striking as billed :
He stands just above six feet tall with wide shoulders , round features , and blue eyes .
He wears white cotton pants and scuffed brown leather shoes , topped by a black T - shirt covered with Malcolm X's portrait .
Asked about the shirt , he laughs , blushes , and pulls his sweater -- black , buttoning lengthwise , with large silken flowers embroidered around it in camouflaging black thread -- shut : " I 'm not supposed to wear this in public . "
Antony lives nearby , and he 's comfortable here .
He greets the owner like an old friend , asking how she 's been before introducing his guest .
When Elspeth 's daughter walks the tea to the table , Antony smiles at her , too , asking about the teas and her life .
Convivial and curious , Antony is given to small talk and shared laughter .
He listens intently to answers and almost always presents follow - ups .
" I want to be in dialogue , " he says , the British roots of his voice always apparent when something excites , frightens , or engages him .
" I do n't want to build a wall around myself and have some fun , like the MGMT song , and try to make it a dream - life that 's satisfying .
I believe in a dream - life , but I want to be in dialogue .
I have to represent . "
Yes , Antony 's talking about that MGMT song , " Time to Pretend " , the kaleidoscopic , booming pop tune that he heard for the first time the day before .
By now , he says , he 's listened 10 times , studied the video , read the reviews , and scrutinized the lyrics .
He 's as disturbed by the song 's idea -- narcotic and material escapism , where the world collapses as the narrators and their model wives steal away to Paris for coitus , cars , and cocaine -- as he is obsessed with its hook .
" I 'm the kind of person that wrote a thesis on the political implications of Pink Flamingos for college , like full of bullshit about what it really means , " says Antony of the 1972 John Waters film about trying to be the " filthiest person alive . "
" But a song like that can take you all the way home .
It 's crazy and so sad , with all of these wasteland scenarios for this imaginary world .
There 's a powerlessness .
' Give up .
Let 's live in our imagination . ' "
Like a funhouse mirror , one of Antony 's own songs , " Another World " , unintentionally reflects " Time to Pretend " .
The title track from a 2008 EP of the same name , " Another World " also sits as the sobering piano - and - voice centerpiece of his third and best album , The Crying Light .
" I 'll miss the playgrounds and the animals and digging up worms , " MGMT sings cheerily and confidently , like pioneers of decadence retiring from old comforts and treasures .
" I 'll miss my sister , miss my father , miss my dog , and my home . "
But Antony strips away the selfishness .
He 'll miss only those things he cannot possess -- the sea , the snow , the bees , " the things that grow " -- and the chance for the dream - life he mentions .
" Another World " , says Antony , offers the dirge for a planet he fears is dying but hopes can be saved .
" Maybe this is an unprecedented moment in our development , as human beings .
We 're facing a really wild scenario , " he 'd said in a Stockholm hotel room a month earlier .
" When I think about the environment and think about the future , I shut down emotionally and go into shock and denial .
When someone dies , for instance , you have to grieve and move through the feelings once you 're in a safe place .
It 's part of the healing process . "
Such ideas unite much of Antony 's work over the last decade : Vanishing worlds , blurred lines , and how those concepts work together .
Antony , after all , moved to Manhattan in the early 1990s as AIDS plagued the downtown gay community at which he 'd marveled from afar in California .
In New York , he immediately stepped into that scene , started his own 3 a.m. performance troupe and worked to preserve its history and spirit .
And now , after magazine covers , major music awards , and late - night television appearances , he 's that scene 's popular manifestation .
Built with natural images and a romantic sense of survival , The Crying Light is his attempt to examine the troubles inside himself as they relate to the woebegone world around him .
Helping himself , he thinks , might just help the rest of us .
But Antony does n't kid himself :
His songs or his visual art , which also often focuses on the environment , can't save the world .
But they can help him join the conversation and , in some respects , start it .
" As I was raised Catholic , I was raised with a very rigid sense of what had spiritual content , of what was valuable .
Human beings had soul .
The Earth did n't .
This place was a holding cell for people to figure out their spirit value , " says Antony .
" There was this whole idea that we had separated from nature .
I think that 's all fallen down for me .
As I 've gotten older , I 've returned more and more to my environment . "
And that 's what Antony 's albums have always reflected : attempts to reconcile himself with the world around him .
On his self - titled 2000 debut , for instance , Antony exposed his internal emotional trauma -- " I always wanted love to be filled with pain " -- alongside his indignation with a world that marginalized any of its people : " For we all know the baby has expired / Long ago she was pulled from the mire /
And no precious liar or well - wisher / Can return the love that was stolen , " he sings on " River of Sorrow " , a song about the unsolved 1992 death of New York drag queen Marsha P. Johnson .
He named Antony and the Johnsons in memoriam to her and the New York scene from which she 'd sprung .
Similarly , I Am a Bird Now , the 2005 album that broke Antony to a larger audience , explores his struggles with gender identity and his quest for feminine freedom and strength within a man 's body : " Forgive me , Let live me / Set my spirit free / Weakness sown , Overgrown / Man is the baby , " he cries out on the cascading " Man Is the Baby " , a track overshadowed by its more famous surroundings -- the Boy George duet , " You are My Sister " , " Fistful of Love " , " Hope There 's Someone " , and Antony 's anthem , " For Today I Am a Boy " .
But The Crying Light finds
Antony stepping beyond those solipsistic conflicts to his -- and , he hopes , our -- biggest concern : the world he sees " rapidly disintegrating " around him .
It 's his most fully rewarding and subtly shaded album to date because it's as much about mourning as it is about renewal , as much about protesting as it is about acceptance .
" It 's about the garden inside and its relationship to the world outside .
For me , that 's been very powerful , " says Antony , speaking softly , secreting his thoughts away from the chattering families at nearby tables , as if he realizes how outlandish such metaphors might seem .
" I can get really held hostage by my fear and trepidation for the future -- and the present at this point .
Yet , I still have to create .
Nothing 's going to come unless I keep nurturing the inner world and watering all the plants in my heart .
" I know that sounds ridiculous , but I have to keep that garden alive .
I see myself as a microcosm -- that 's the word -- as one example of humanity and of the brokenness of humanity .
I 'm interested in exploring that on a very personal level in that it might be useful for my own attempt to evolve . "
As an actor , singer , and painter for more than two decades , Antony 's lived the battles , obsessions , and joys of his life on tape , stage and canvas .
The results -- considered , considerate , wounded , powerful -- offer a fairly exacting a map of the person who made it .
Like Antony , his music has long fit those easy descriptors -- large and grandiose , queer , theatric , delicate , and beautiful .
Considered with the slow , decades - long ferment that led to The Crying Light , though , Antony 's oeuvre blurs far too many lines to reduce so easily .
It was a devastating knockout after Hendo landed the hook that felled Bisping .
But add in the second punch with Bisping already floored and it becomes one of the most brutal KOs ever .

ChefStack automatic pancake machine : kitchen heaven
As someone who was banned from even considering bringing an automatic donut machine into the kitchen , you ca n’t begin to imagine how impressed I am with the ChefStack automatic pancake machine .
Capable of producing 200 pancakes per hour with minimal human intervention , the ChefStack works from pre-filled bags of pancake batter fitted with special nozzles .
While that does mean you ca n’t really use your grandmother ’s favorite pancake recipe , it also reduces clean - up issues and – since the bags can sit for a year on an unrefrigerated shelf without spoiling – adds convenience .
The unit is around the size of a microwave and consists of two teflon - coated rollers which shuttle the tender , fledgeling pancakes from nozzle to plate .
Those pancakes , incidentally , are 97 - percent fat free and contain less than 83 calories apiece .
Unfortunately you ’re looking at $ 3,500 for the machine itself , which thankfully for those I share my kitchen with puts it well out of my reach .

Texas Memory Systems today unveiled its fastest and highest capacity solid state disk ( SSD ) system , the RamSan 6200 , which offers as much as 100 terabytes of capacity in a single 40U rack configuration .
The system also can sustain 5 million input / outputs per second ( IOPS ) with 60 GB / sec. throughput while using slightly more than 6 kilowatts of power , the company said .
The array is aimed at high - performance , enterprise - class relational database systems , as well as data warehousing , modeling , simulations , rendering and video editing .
To achieve the equivalent level of performance with hard disk drive - based storage arrays would require several thousand of the fastest , most expensive 15,000 RPM Fibre Channel hard disk drives , Texas Memory Systems said .
But the system does n't come cheap .
A fully loaded RamSan 6200 rack will have a retail price tag in the $ 4.4 million range .
A single 1U , 5TB RamSan -620 unit is $ 220,000 , the company said .
The RamSan 6200 SSD array
" The RamSan 6200 changes the storage equation for large databases , science and research labs , seismic processing , video , and federal government installations , " said Woody Hutsell , Texas Memory Systems president , in a statement .
" It 's the only currently available SSD system offering anything remotely approaching this storage capacity and performance . "
The RamSan -6200 uses single - level cell ( SLC ) NAND flash memory , multiple levels of RAID and advanced flash management algorithms to provide greater reliability .
The SSD array is managed through Texas Memory System 's own TeraWatch software that is capable of monitoring up to twenty RamSan 620 chassis from a GUI console .
The RamSan 6200 supports from 40 to 160 4 G bit / sec Fibre Channel ports or 20 to 80 10 G bit/ sec InfiniBand ports .

Class and opposition to teenage sex : A life history perspective Class and opposition to teenage sex : A life history perspective
The GSS asks people about the morality of premarital sex between post - pubescent minors ( TEENSEX ) :
What if [ a male and female ] are in their early teens , say 14 to 16 years old ?
In that case , do you think sex relations before marriage are always wrong , almost always wrong , wrong only sometimes , or not wrong at all ?
Most people say " always wrong , " so I 'll just look at those responses ; the other responses have little room to vary since all must add up to 100 % .
How does opposition vary across demographic groups ? [ 1 ]
As for social class , the elites say they 're more ethical than the rabble , but on the other hand , they 're big supporters of " sex is natural and therefore can't be harmful . "
So which is it ?
Clearly , those with more prestigious jobs ( SEI ) are less opposed .
Perhaps this is because the prestigious can get away with more shocking or outside - the - mainstream views .
But that 's not what the three other measures of social class suggest .
As for real income ( REALINC , in $ 5000 intervals ) , opposition increases from poor to lower - middle income people ( $ 40 K ) , and then declines somewhat steadily among middle and upper income people .
My guess here is that middle and upper income people do n't think the teenage years count -- as long as their kids get advanced degrees , make a lot of money , and do n't marry scumbags , they could care less if they fool around a little in high school .
Poor people , though , see their kids as living shorter lives -- they enter Adult World sooner , so it matters what they do right after puberty .
If you live in the same town you grew up in and plan to get married in your early 20s , having a reputation as a slut in high school will harm your prospects a lot more than if you move across the country five times before marrying , and even then only 10 years after graduating .
Education ( EDUC ) and intelligence ( WORDSUM ) show a similar pattern to job prestige and real income , as all are indicators of social class .
Opposition increases up through 6th grade graduates , but declines pretty steadily among those who made it through middle school and beyond .
For intelligence , like the other class variables , there 's an increase among the below - average , and then a steady decline among the above - average .
So , judging by these four ways of measuring social class , there seems to be a real difference between the upper , middle , and lower groups in how fast or slow they expect their children to grow up and do adult things .
In biology jargon , this is a difference in life history strategies .
There 's a parallel here between parents who invest more in their sons or their daughters , according to the
[ 1 ]
It seems like younger people would be least opposed , since 14 to 16 is awfully close to their own age .
They might think the police will come after them next .
Sure enough , Let 's see what the data say : Clearly , those with more prestigious jobs ( SEI ) are less opposed .
Perhaps this is because the prestigious can get away with more shocking or outside - the - mainstream views .
But that 's not what the three other measures of social class suggest .
As for real income ( REALINC , in $ 5000 intervals ) , opposition increases from poor to lower - middle income people ( $ 40 K ) , and then declines somewhat steadily among middle and upper income people .
My guess here is that middle and upper income people do n't think the teenage years count -- as long as their kids get advanced degrees , make a lot of money , and do n't marry scumbags , they could care less if they fool around a little in high school .
Poor people , though , see their kids as living shorter lives -- they enter Adult World sooner , so it matters what they do right after puberty .
If you live in the same town you grew up in and plan to get married in your early 20s , having a reputation as a slut in high school will harm your prospects a lot more than if you move across the country five times before marrying , and even then only 10 years after graduating .
Education ( EDUC ) and intelligence ( WORDSUM ) show a similar pattern to job prestige and real income , as all are indicators of social class .
Opposition increases up through 6th grade graduates , but declines pretty steadily among those who made it through middle school and beyond .
For intelligence , like the other class variables , there 's an increase among the below - average , and then a steady decline among the above - average .
So , judging by these four ways of measuring social class , there seems to be a real difference between the upper , middle , and lower groups in how fast or slow they expect their children to grow up and do adult things .
In biology jargon , this is a difference in life history strategies .
There 's a parallel here between parents who invest more in their sons or their daughters , according to the Trivers - Willard Hypothesis : richer families favor their sons , while poorer families favor their daughters .
One study found support for this idea by looking at how Gypsy vs. Hungarian families in Hungary invested in their children ( free PDF here ) .
Since lower class families care more about their daughters , they 'll freak out more if they engaged in premarital sex while still young and thus when reputations matter most .
Upper class families will be thinking of their sons , though , and conclude , " Meh , let them sow their wild oats , as long as they settle down when the time comes . " [ 1]
It seems like younger people would be least opposed , since 14 to 16 is awfully close to their own age .
They might think the police will come after them next .
Sure enough , age is a very strong predictor here -- indeed , the only demographic group I could find among whom a majority does n't consider it " always wrong " is 18 year - olds .
The GSS asks people about the morality of premarital sex between post - pubescent minors ( TEENSEX ) : Most people say " always wrong , " so I 'll just look at those responses ; the other responses have little room to vary since all must add up to 100 % .
How does opposition vary across demographic groups ? [ 1 ]
As for social class , the elites say they 're more ethical than the rabble , but on the other hand , they 're big supporters of " sex is natural and therefore can't be harmful . "
So which is it ?

Production on Lost season six does n't begin for another few weeks , but thanks to Comic - Con , we 're starting to get a sense of the new season , including which castmembers might be back to cavort in those alternate timelines the producers teased .
Which brings us to Dominic Monaghan 's beloved Charlie .
His appearance on stage as the grand finale of Lost 's panel all but confirmed that Mr. Pace would be back for the final season of Lost .
But is it true ?
And if so , how much might we see of him ?
Here 's what we 're hearing ...
OLATHE
— Bill Hewitt ’s thrice - daily medicine is laid out on a tiny table in his trailer : a couple of marijuana buds alongside a glass pipe and a Zippo lighter .
Hewitt , who suffers from muscular dystrophy , is a card - carrying medical - marijuana user .
And he is living in this worn - down travel trailer because he was evicted from federally subsidized housing on account of his marijuana use .
The difference between Colorado ’s legal acceptance of marijuana for medical use and federal law , which categorizes marijuana as an illegal drug , is resulting in a housing quandary for the disabled .
Even with the state ’s OK to use medical marijuana , people such as Hewitt can’t live in federal housing or receive federal subsidies for rent under the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development ’s Housing Choice Voucher Program .
Hewitt and another medical - marijuana user from Durango have challenged that policy with HUD ’s fair - housing division and in court .
The policy has drawn lawsuits in at least two of the other 13 states that allow medical - marijuana use .
But so far HUD has prevailed .
HUD officials stress they have no choice in the matter .
“ HUD lawyers are very clear about this .
There is not to be any substance abuse in federal housing or voucher housing , ” said Teresa Duran , interim director of the Colorado Division of Housing .
“ Until the federal laws change , we have to abide by that . ”
There is no data to say how widespread the problem is .
HUD officials say they do n’t track evictions or complaints tied to medical - marijuana use .
Medical - marijuana users and suppliers say it is common and becoming more so .
“ It ’s safe to say this is a growing problem .
We ’re going to encounter it more , ” said Brian Vicente , executive director of Sensible Colorado , a nonprofit resource for medical - marijuana users .
Hewitt said he knows three other disabled users in federally subsidized housing in the small town of Olathe who plan to move into his trailer park rather than fight HUD rules .
“ It ’s disgusting .
Most disabled can’t afford a house , so they get assistance .
These people should not be thrown in the street because they use a medication that alleviates pain , ” Hewitt said .
He said he received an eviction notice this spring , a day after HUD inspectors looked over his rental house and told him everything was satisfactory .
He said he gave them a copy of his medical - marijuana card months before that .
But Tim Heavers , director of the Montrose County Housing Authority , said all residents of federally subsidized housing or those who are receiving housing vouchers for private rentals are warned up front about illegal drug use .
Hewitt said he may have received that warning , but Colorado voters legalized the use of medical marijuana in 2000 .
Hewitt said smoking marijuana has allowed him to cut out many prescription medications with bad side effects .
He said he no longer uses tranquilizers , muscle relaxers , sleeping pills and a nerve drug .
He still takes medications for his heart , bladder and stomach and a half dose of the painkiller methadone .
Travis Chambers , who owns God ’s Gift , a medical - marijuana dispensary in Clifton , said that points to the irony in the federal housing rules .
“ You can sit there and do morphine and Oxycontin and all the other heavy drugs you want , ” he said .
“ But not marijuana . ”
Chris Hermes with Americans for Safe Access called the HUD denials “ discrimination . ”
“ Many of these patients have no options for where they consume their medical marijuana .
They are disabled , ” Hermes said .
In Durango , Vietnam veteran Andrew Rizzo said he was evicted from a federally subsidized housing complex after other residents complained about the odor of marijuana smoke from his apartment .
He said it is not feasible to go somewhere else to smoke it , nor to use a different delivery method such as balms , tinctures or pills , because they do n’t have the same effect .
While the issue works its way through the bureaucracy , Hewitt is fearing winter in his little trailer .
He said the owner has told him it will be like an icebox .
And he has to make his way about 50 yards across a lot to use a restroom in a former gas station .
“ It ’s a lot harder than living in a house , ” he said .
“ But the peace and the freedom is so worth it . ”

Author Terry Pratchett is lending his support to a bill going through the House of Lords to legalise assisted suicide in England .
The Wiltshire - based fantasy writer has Alzheimer 's Disease .
In 2006 , retired doctor Anne Turner travelled with her family from Bath to Switzerland to end her life at an assisted suicide clinic in Zurich .
No - one faced prosecution over that action .
Sir Terry , 61 , said no " real law " would have been contravened .
He told BBC News : " I think it is possible that someone in possession of their faculties who has an incurable disease could actually request death rather than face an unpleasant endgame .
" It seems to me to contravene no real law . "
The House of Lords are expected to vote on the amendment to the Coroners and Justice Bill next week but even if they do opt for change , it could be next year before it becomes law .
For centuries , Mediterranean countries have found countless ways to disagree -- over religion , ethnicity , colonialism and trade .
But there are signs the region might yet unite in pursuit of a common goal : renewable energy .
European government and industry have been eyeing tracts of sun-drenched , vacant land in North Africa and the Middle East for some time .
And now , officials and business executives are beginning to sweat out the details that could see renewable power sprouting in the desert .
Their vision is ambitious .
By 2050 , massive solar thermal plants , which concentrate the sun 's energy using mirrors to heat steam - generating media , would sprawl across the Sahara and Middle East , feeding most of their power to their host nations .
Leftover energy , meanwhile , would travel north on a new € 45 billion grid to meet 15 percent of Europe 's electricity needs .
The technology to build the plants exists and industry is ready , if certain political conditions are met , said Gerhard Knies , a German physicist who has become the leading advocate for the solar thermal plans , which are projected to cost hundreds of billions of euros .
" Europe should be ready to financially support clean power provided by North Africa , " Knies said .
Europe will need reliable , always - on electricity in the future from renewable sources , and North Africa needs investment -- a win-win for both , he said .
" This is exactly the moment for this kind of thing , " said David Wheeler , a senior fellow at the nonprofit Center for Global Development in Washington .
The United States is gearing up for gigawatts of investment in solar thermal in the Southwest , he noted , and the same is being seen in Rajasthan , India , and in China .
" An area the size of Austria could power the entire world , " Wheeler said .
" We have room to spare out there .
It 's simply not a limited resource . "
But when it comes to the Mediterranean , the enthusiasm of optimists like Knies and Wheeler must face cold political reality .
The most prominent support for desert solar has come from the Union for the Mediterranean , a troubled alliance launched last year by the French president , Nicolas Sarkozy .
Aimed at creating stronger economic ties in the region , the union announced as its premier project a Mediterranean solar plan that cribbed many ideas from Knies ' proposals .
While Knies was elated for the support -- he had consulted with French officials in the winter beforehand -- he became troubled when the union came " to a grinding halt " after this winter 's conflict in Gaza , which saw Israel invade the Gaza Strip in a campaign to halt rocket attacks from Hamas .
The brief war resulted in up to 1,000 fatalities , mostly on the Palestinian side , and inflamed anti-Israeli sentiment across the region .
Seeking to keep momentum generated by the Union for the Mediterranean announcement , Knies approached Munich Re , a massive German insurance company that has been troubled by increased liability claims it has seen from natural disasters .
Once the insurer signed on , German industry followed .
That collaboration led to the announcement last week of the Desertec Industrial Initiative , which made waves with the blue - chip names supporting it : Siemens , Deutsche Bank , ABB and others .
In its planning document , the initiative 's companies make clear that if a suitable political framework exists , they are ready to invest in North Africa now .
Picture without a frame
For any private money to flow into North Africa , certain political hurdles must be cleared , said Jens Hobohm , an energy consultant at the German firm Prognos .
" One of the obstacles obviously is that the political framework in the countries is not ready yet to adopt larger amounts of solar power , " Hobohm said .
Desertec has called for a single , unified market across the region , allowing a consumer in Germany to purchase power from Algeria .
The Union for the Mediterranean remains the most likely actor to set up such a framework , Knies said , and while it does not yet have a permanent headquarters or director , the union has established working groups on how to create the regulations needed for the exchange of large flows of energy .
Over the past month , the union has gone through what amounts to a relaunch , with environmental meetings in Paris late last month and a summit in Milan this week .
The Paris meetings really began movement on the solar project , said Marc Strauss , who coordinates the solar plan for France 's Ministry of Ecology , Energy , Sustainable Development and the Sea .
" Now it 's time to study the projects , " Strauss said , adding that the plan had generated between 100 and 150 proposals .
All the Arab states attended the Paris meetings , and Egypt , in particular , has been a strong supporter .
According to Egyptian officials , this is because for the first time , in a Mediterranean detente , Europeans are treating African and Middle Eastern countries as equal partners .
This is best seen in the union 's co-presidency , which Sarkozy and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak share .
Also attending the Milan summit was Sweden 's energy minister , Maud Olofsson .
While it would at first seem odd for Sweden to attend the summit , it is an indication of the hybrid beast the Union for the Mediterranean has become .
Though the union was originally designed by Sarkozy as a " Club Med " limited to countries around the sea , many European countries , especially Germany , objected to what could become an eventual E.U. competitor .
Conceding to these concerns , the union was launched with all E.U. countries as members .
Sweden holds the rotating presidency of the European Union , hence its presence at Milan .
In fact , according to analysts , nuclear - powered France does not have nearly as much to gain in the energy sector from solar development in North Africa .
Far more important to Sarkozy are the climate benefits and the influence a successful union could give his country .
Perhaps because the French have acted as facilitators , a virtue of the union 's solar plan is that it makes clear that renewable energy will be developed in the south primarily for domestic purposes and only partly for European exports , said Houda Allal , the strategic director of OME , an umbrella organization for Mediterranean energy companies .
" This is a prerequisite , " Allal said .
The Mediterranean solar plan " is very clear on that .
Desertec has improved itself in that area , but they 're not convincing yet . "
Hobohm added , " This is not a good solution if we send German or whatever companies down there and they do it all alone .
We need joint ventures between European and Arabic - speaking countries . "
Such large - scale investment could be a huge boon to structurally weak countries in North Africa and could also give countries like Algeria an economic path after their hydrocarbon resources flag .
At its rosiest , the solar projects might even bridge gaps among the non-E.U. countries of the region , Hobohm said .
About two decades ago , Morocco , Algeria , Tunisia and Libya pledged to create an economic union , yet trade between them remains the lowest of any region in the world .
By stimulating energy trade , the Union for the Mediterranean hopes to bring about deeper dialogue .
There is a model for this :
The European Union evolved from a treaty in 1950 that created a common market for coal .
Funding vehicles
Solar thermal plants are already being built in Morocco , Egypt and Algeria .
The problem is , Allal said , " they are taking too much time to come into force . "
That highlights the remaining question for these solar dreams : money .
" We will need some kind of fixed tariff for the electricity that will be produced in Northern Africa , " Hobohm said .
Solar thermal plants remain expensive , costing 20 to 25 cents a kilowatt - hour of electricity produced , while gas or coal costs 4 to 5 cents .
Costs for solar thermal could eventually come down to about 10 cents a kilowatt - hour as the technology scales up , said the Center for Global Development 's
Wheeler , who has written an influential paper on the topic .
If carbon prices were as high as officials hoped they would be when the European Union established its carbon cap - and - trade system , solar thermal would likely already be viable .
However , while the price of carbon remains low , additional stimulus will be needed , said Knies , the German physicist .
If the solar plants were built purely for domestic purposes , it would be difficult for countries like Egypt to establish feed - in tariffs , which would guarantee higher pricing rates for solar projects .
Germany was able to justify the tariffs by routing the money to industry ; no similar technology giants exist in Africa or the Middle East .
Hobohm would like to see a E.U. - wide feed - in tariff established that would guarantee African and Middle Eastern energy companies set rates for their electricity exports .
At the least , countries with existing programs like Germany and Spain should open up their systems to importers , Knies said .
Spain , so close to Morocco , is an obvious candidate .
It would be a " kind of a global justice " for Europeans to support these renewable projects , Knies said , since it was European reliance on fossil fuels that both brought the region great prosperity and exacerbated climate change .
In return , the European - spurred renewable projects could " set off a whole round of industrialization in North Africa , " Wheeler said .
First in this industrialization line could be Morocco , which has an existing , if weak , electrical connection with Spain ; its neighbors have no route into the European grid .
Morocco 's government has announced a $ 1 billion fund to support renewable energy and hopes to pass a law in September to create a framework for renewable cooperation .
Other funding vehicles are also being set up .
Egypt 's finance minister , Rachid Mohamed Rachid , has proposed an InfraMed Fund , which would be privately funded and managed , his officials say .
The fund would separate financing for energy projects from the budgets of member countries , granting more year - to - year stability .
The World Bank has shown interest in North African solar thermal projects , according to Wheeler , and it is now considering whether to support a 1 - gigawatt project with its clean technology fund .
Such a project could cost up to $ 8 billion , with a possible $ 750 million in World Bank support .
The bank is scheduled to look at the proposal in October .
The benefits of such technical assistance should not be underestimated , Hobohm said .
" Cooperation brings along an interest on both sides to stabilize the relationship , " Hobohm said .
" This would be a good symbol to the Islamic world .
...
This is a common project .
Let us do some clean business here . "

Women with M.B.A.s have fared during the recession as well as their male counterparts , according to a new study by New York nonprofit research group Catalyst .
The study , scheduled to be released Tuesday , analyzed data from 873 M.B.A.s who graduated between 1996 and 2007 from top business schools in Asia , Canada , Europe and the U.S.
The respondents were surveyed about their experiences between November 2007 and June 2009 , as the economic downturn intensified .

Holder Ponders Limited Torture Probe Last year , in the heat of the presidential campaign , Eric Holder was a featured speaker at the American Constitution Society ’s annual convention where he told a packed crowd that the “ American people are owe [ d ] a reckoning ” as a result of the “ abusive ” and “ unlawful ” policies of the Bush administration .
Email
Printer friendly “ Our government authorized the use of torture , approved of secret electronic surveillance of American citizens , secretly detained American citizens without due process of law , denied the Writ of Habeus Corpus to hundreds of accused enemy combatants , and authorized the use of procedures that both violate international law and the United States Constitution , ” Holder said in June 2008 .
“ We owe the American people a reckoning . ”
If recent news reports are accurate , some form of that day of reckoning may soon be upon us as now - Attorney General Holder weighs the possibility of appointing a federal prosecutor to probe the Bush administration ’s use of torture during the interrogation of detainees captured in the “ war on terror . ”
But those same news reports , quoting unnamed sources , say that if Holder decides in the coming weeks to authorize a criminal investigation it would be limited to the “ few bad apples ” at the CIA who exceeded interrogation limits set by Justice Department attorneys in memos that authorized brutal acts of torture against suspected terrorists .
If that is the case , the Obama administration ’s approach would be virtually the same as the Bush administration 's in the aftermath of the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse scandal , in which low - level MPs were court - martialed and imprisoned for acts that supposedly had not been sanctioned by their superiors .
By targeting just CIA interrogators who exceeded the torture guidelines , the Obama administration also would be shutting the door on new internal investigations that might reach higher levels -- the Justice Department lawyers who established the parameters and the White House officials who encouraged the brutal tactics , including the near - drowning of waterboarding .
In April , Holder declared that it " would be unfair to prosecute dedicated men and women working to protect America for conduct that was sanctioned in advance by the Justice Department . "
What that meant was that a possible criminal investigation would be limited to examining actions that went beyond what was sanctioned , such as repetitious use of waterboarding .
Critical Report Still , Holder might face public pressure to expand the probe if and when a CIA inspector general ’s report is released that reportedly calls into question the legality of the agency ’s torture of “ high - value ” detainees .
The secret findings of CIA Inspector General John Helgerson led to eight criminal referrals to the Justice Department for homicide and other misconduct , but those cases languished as Vice President Dick Cheney is said to have intervened to constrain Helgerson ’s inquiries .
Holder may reopen those cases , but if an investigation is narrowly focused on the CIA interrogators and outside contractors and does not include the Bush administration officials who implemented the policies then the probe would likely amount to a whitewash , much like the Abu Ghraib case .
Of the 12 investigations launched in the aftermath of the Abu Ghraib prison scandal , not one scrutinized the roles of Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld or any other senior Bush administration official .
The inquiries concentrated instead on the military police identified in the photographs , like Private Lynndie England and Corporal Charles Graner Jr .
Back in 2004 , even the neoconservative editorial page of the Washington Post found the Abu Ghraib “ whitewashing ” of the higher - ups ’ roles hard to take .
" [ D]ecisions by Mr. Rumsfeld and the Justice Department to permit coercive interrogation techniques previously considered unacceptable for U.S. personnel influenced practices at the prison at Guantánamo Bay , Cuba , and later spread to Afghanistan and Iraq , ” a Post editorial said .
“ Methods such as hooding , enforced nudity , sensory deprivation and the use of dogs to terrorize — all originally approved by the defense secretary — were widely employed , even though they violate the Geneva Conventions . ”
Now , five years later
In a July 27 editorial , the Post deviated from the logic of its earlier position by urging Holder to move forward with an investigation focused only on rogue individual interrogators who exceeded the legal limits outlined in the torture memos .
Evidence of Approval
But such an approach would ignore evidence that senior Bush administration officials and high - level officials at CIA headquarters in Langley micromanaged the torture of at least one high - level detainee .
Documents released earlier this year in a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit between the American Civil Liberties Union and the CIA showed that CIA interrogators provided top agency officials at Langley with daily " torture " updates of Abu Zubaydah , the alleged " high - level " terrorist detainee , who was held at a secret " black site " prison and waterboarded 83 times in August 2002 .
Additionally , alleged 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was waterboarded 183 times in the span of a single month .
CIA Inspector General Helgerson also " had serious questions about the agency 's mistreatment of dozens more , including Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , " according to Jane Mayer , a reporter for The New Yorker and author of the book The Dark Side .
Senior Bush administration officials were known to be closely following these developments and pressed the CIA for more and more results .
In an interview with Harper 's magazine last year , Mayer said Helgerson " investigated several alleged homicides involving CIA detainees " and forwarded several of those cases " to the Justice Department for further consideration and potential prosecution . "
" Why have there been no charges filed ?
It 's a question to which one would expect that Congress and the public would like some answers , " Mayer said .
" Sources suggested to me that ... it is highly uncomfortable for top Bush Justice officials to prosecute these cases because , inevitably , it means shining a light on what those same officials sanctioned . "
One possible reason that the Justice Department investigations went nowhere was that Vice President Cheney intervened and demanded that Helgerson meet with him privately about his investigation .
Mayer characterized Cheney 's interaction with Helgerson as highly unusual .
Cheney 's " reaction to this first , carefully documented in - house study concluding that the CIA 's secret program was most likely criminal was to summon the Inspector General to his office for a private chat , " Mayer wrote .
“ The Inspector General is supposed to function as an independent overseer , free from political pressure , but Cheney summoned the CIA Inspector General more than once to his office . ”
" Cheney loomed over everything , " one former CIA officer told Mayer .
" The whole IG 's office was completely politicized .
They were working hand in glove with the White House . "
Cheney 's Admission
Last year , in several interviews prior to exiting the White House , Cheney admitted that he personally authorized the waterboarding of three so - called “ high - value ” prisoners .
“ I signed off on it ; others did , as well , too , ” Cheney said .
Waterboarding , in which a person is strapped down to a board with a cloth covering his face and then water is poured over it , is a torture technique dating back at least to the Spanish Inquisition .
The victim feels as if he is drowning .
“ I thought that it was absolutely the right thing to do , ” Cheney said of what he called the “ enhanced interrogation ” of the detainees .
“ I thought the [ administration ’s ] legal opinions that were rendered [ endorsing the harsh treatment ] were sound .
I think the techniques were reasonable in terms of what they [ the CIA interrogators ] were asking to be able to do .
And I think it produced the desired result .
“ Was it torture ?
I do n’t believe it was torture , ” Cheney said .
“ The CIA handled itself , I think , very appropriately .
They came to us in the administration , talked to me , talked to others in the administration , about what they felt they needed to do in order to obtain the intelligence that we believe these people were in possession of . ”
Regarding the earlier Abu Ghraib case , retired Lt. Gen. Ricardo Sanchez , who was commander of U.S. forces in Iraq at the time , confirmed in the paperback version of his book , Wiser in Battle , that the prisoner - abuse investigations were constrained for political reasons .
" A meaningful and unlimited investigation , which the Bush administration adamantly opposed , would result in an unmitigated disaster , " Sanchez wrote .
" It would open up Pandora 's box and let out a world of evil . ”
Sanchez added , “ It ’s now clear the Bush administration did not tell the truth about the use of torture at Guantanamo Bay , or in Afghanistan and Iraq . …
In the aftermath of Abu Ghraib , administration officials worked diligently to deflect responsibility away from them and down to military leadership on the ground . …
“ It is also apparent that the White House and the Department of Defense consistently attempted to minimize any further exposure of their actions and , specifically , to prevent a serious investigation into their executive - decision making process . ”
Sanchez wrote that “ to prevent this [ disgrace ] from ever happening again ” and “ to restore America ’s moral authority , ” the Obama administration and Congress “ must conduct more comprehensive investigations across all involved agencies , learn from the findings , and implement permanent changes . ”
Whether Attorney General Holder is up to that task remains to be seen .

He Was Tormented Not By Peers , But His Teachers .
Guess Who the School Stands Behind ?
When Alex Merritt spoke up to reveal two of his own teachers made fun of him , in front of classmates , for thinking he is gay , Merritt probably did n’t think he ’d walk away with a $ 25,000 settlement from the Anoka - Hennepin School District in Minnesota .
He probably also did n’t think he ’d have to listen to the the school district stand behind the teachers .
Last night a “ standing - room only ” crowd gathered at the school district ’s meeting , with plenty of parents outraged over the school board ’s decision to defend the two accused teachers ( Walter Filson and Diane Cleveland ) , who Merritt says made jokes about his perceived sexuality and appearance during the 2007 - 08 school year , which left him alienated and forced to change schools .
The boy ’s “ fence swings both ways , ” teacher Diane Cleveland commented during a class in the 2007 - 2008 school year , according to an investigation by the Minnesota Department of Human Rights .
When the boy wrote a report on Ben Franklin , Cleveland allegedly said before the entire class that the boy had a “ thing for older men . ”
Another teacher , Walter Filson , said in front of other students that the boy “ enjoys wearing women ’s clothes . ”
When the boy decided to report on Abraham Lincoln , Filson allegedly said , “ Since you like your men older … ” the Human Rights report said .
But there ’s only so much concerned parents and a Facebook page , with 1,200 supporters , can do , apparently .
The board has so far stood behind the teachers , claiming this is an isolated incident and both teachers have an excellent record with the district .
Board chairman , Michael Sullivan said the board will consider all that was said at the meeting .
“ There have been specific suggestions that I would hopefully will follow up on and pursue to see if they make sense in the context of this district , ” he said .
Know what we have here ?
A school district protecting teachers who are actually harming children .
The board denies the teachers violated the Minnesota Human Rights Act , but paid up anyway .
We do n’t have to get into the psychology of teens , especially those who do n’t fit strict gender norms .
To our knowledge , Merritt has n’t said whether he is gay or straight , Merritt says he ’s straight , but that does n’t matter : Targeting a student should n’t be tolerated by classmates , but particularly their instructors .
It fosters an environment of ridicule and torment .
For Merritt ’s sake , we hope he is straight ; he leaves for basic Army training next week .
UPDATE : The teachers have been placed on leave .
We clicked over to Zero Hedge last night for a brief check - in on the decline and fall of civilization .
We found these two beauts .
As with many reports in this genre , the logic is weakened by the dismissiveness and arrogance of the rhetoric , but the reports make some excellent points .
They 're also a fun contrast to endless celebrations of the v-shaped recovery crowd .
To briefly summarize :
Our collective debt is still vastly higher than it was in the early 1930s and in Japan in the 1990s .
Consumers account for 70 % of economic growth , and they 're broke
The banks are still insolvent , but they 're now allowed to lie about it

You Fools Don't Get It : We 're Doomed !
-- James Saft is a Reuters columnist .
The opinions expressed are his own --
HUNTSVILLE , Alabama ( Reuters ) -
As much as bonus - eligible employers may rejoice , the government , taxpayers and shareholders have real reasons to be concerned about Goldman Sachs ’ huge surge in profits and how they are being generated and allocated .
Goldman this week notched up its largest ever profit as a public company - $ 3.44 billion for the second quarter - but did it while taking on considerably more risk by a key measure .
Furthermore , Goldman set aside 48 percent of its total revenue , or $ 6.65 billion , to fund employee compensation , an amount that is not only titanic for a company that only recently was in receipt of direct government support but is , even more astonishingly , the same percentage as was doled out to employees in 2007 , in the supposedly bad old pre-crisis days .
“ Our model never really changed , ” Goldman Sachs Chief Financial Officer David Viniar told Bloomberg News .
“ We ’ve said very consistently that our business model remained the same . ” I ’ll say .
We have just lived through the biggest financial markets blowup in several generations , one in which a catastrophic mixture of bad policy , lax regulation , failed risk management and perverse incentives combined to throw the world into recession and put taxpayers in the position of having to bail out the financial sector .
But yet , Goldman is taking on more risk than before the deluge , and , when it makes more money , allocating the same amount to the no - doubt brilliant employees who helped produce it .
If I were a politician who might need to underwrite the next bailout if Goldman ’s bets go bad , I ’d be a bit worried .
If I were a Goldman shareholder who had seen Lehman and Bear Stearns fall , I ’d be wondering why , given the risks they exemplify , I do n’t get a bigger share of the pie .
It all puts me very much in mind of the old and doubtless apocryphal joke about the out of town J.P. Morgan client a century ago who , when his salesman sought to impress him by pointing out the yachts of Mr. Morgan and his executive lying at anchor at the foot of Wall Street quipped , “ Where are the customer ’s yachts ? ”
Where , indeed , are the shareholders ’ yachts , and , if the taxpayers ca n’t get yachts , where are their harbor fees to help clean up the oil slicks when the yachts sink ?
A CREATURE OF GOVERNMENT
Goldman ’s value - at - risk ( VAR ) , a calculation which attempts to measure potential daily losses , increased to $ 245 million in the quarter , up from $ 185 million last May and just $ 127 million in the palmy days of February , 2007 .
Shareholder equity has also increased , so you could argue that there is a bigger cushion to buffer losses , but even so Goldman is taking on nearly 15 percent more VAR as compared to shareholder equity than in February 2007 .
To be fair , leverage , the ratio of assets to shareholders equity , at the bank is falling and stands at 14.2 percent .
VAR has been widely criticized , not least because of claims it is poor at discounting the kinds of very rare events which ruin firms , but I think it is fair to use it as a proxy for changes in the direction of risk taking .
Goldman may well be better , smarter and even safer than all of the competition , and I am sure they will argue persuasively that they are never going to need to have recourse to the public purse , but a lesson of the past year is that if private risk taking at a big enough institution goes wrong , the government will have to pick up the pieces .
Goldman and virtually every other bank and investment bank around the world are creatures of government .
They exist , whether they want to or not , only by grace of the taxpayers who , it has been demonstrated , stand ready to pick up the pieces when risk management fails .
Even if all the government equity and FDIC - insured bonds are paid back , that is still true and is understood by Goldman and everyone else ’s clients , lenders and counterparties .
This gives regulators the right to do what they think is needed to control risk taking , and compensation too , given the strong relationship between incentives and foolish risk taking .
It may be that Goldman ’s stonking profits and increase in risk are an anomaly , as Goldman was strong enough to be the firm best able to function and take on more risk in the aftermath of last autumn ’s blowup , and it may also be that regulators become more effective and better at limiting and controlling risk - taking .
A mooted plan to impose fees on activities like proprietary trading is promising and seems both more elegant and easier to manage than outright controls on compensation .
One thing is certain : if regulators do n’t act there will be a lot of competitors gunning to make Goldman - like profits and not all of them will be as well managed or successful .
Oct. 31 , 2008 -- Gaining 40 pounds or more during pregnancy nearly doubles the risk of having a baby who weighs 9 pounds or more , in turn increasing the health risks to mother and baby , according to a new study .
Excessive pregnancy weight gain and big babies have often been linked , says Teresa Hillier , MD , senior investigator at the Kaiser Permanente Center for Health Research , Portland , Ore. , and the study 's lead author .
Researchers have also known that women who develop diabetes during pregnancy , called gestational diabetes , are more likely to deliver heavier babies , Hillier tells WebMD .
But the new study is believed the first to conclude that women who gain excessive weight during pregnancy are even more likely to have heavier babies than women treated for gestational diabetes who do n't gain excess weight .
" More than one in five women gain too much weight during pregnancy and only 5 % have gestational diabetes , " Hillier tells WebMD .
The study , she says , points to the need for all women to follow recommendations about not gaining excessive amounts of weight .

Thanks a lot !
I think this is the one you want Volker .
jerry ========================================================
I 'm starting a new thread for this as I think the thread it came from is getting just a tad overloaded .
For those who have been just deleting the other thread the background is that I made the claim that virtual servers are needed to properly support guest and non-guest shares on the same machine .
In other words , user level security does not allow guest shares to work properly .
First some background for those of you not totally familiar with how SMB security levels work .
When a SMB client connects to a server the server tells the client in the negprot response what " security level " is supported by the server .
The server must choose " share level security " or " user level security " ( the " server level security " in Samba is just user level security in disguise .
It is identical to user level security from the clients point of view ) .
The difference that this choice makes at the protocol level is how the client attempts to authenticate with the server and what assumptions the client makes about the servers response .
If the server selects share level security then the client expects that it will need to separately authenticate each share that it wants to access and that the only authentication token it will need to do that authentication is a password .
The client may , or may not , send a username in a session setup request .
With Windows clients , whether it does send a username in a session setup seems to depend on whether it already has an established " anonymous " session that it has used for browsing .
The Microsoft programmers may be able to reveal more details about this aspect of the clients behaviour .
It is the lack of a username in share level security that makes it unsuitable for many installations .
SMB vendors and the SMB spec sensibly recommend that new installations use user level security .
In user level security the client expects to authenticate itself via a session setup request containing a username and a password .
This is done before the client tells the server what resource they are going to access .
By convention current servers ( at least the ones I know of ) accept a NULL username and password in a user level session setup request as meaning that they wish to make a anonymous connection .
This is used for the parts of the browsing protocol that involve the transfer of large number of host names .
The special IPC $ share is used for this purpose .
It does not seem possible to get current Windows clients to send anonymous session setup requests when attaching to file or printer shares ( they insist that the username not be blank ) .
Astute readers will note that this " anonymous login " opens a door to attack user level security servers without knowing a password ( and indeed the ./ attack worked over a anonymous IPC$ connection ) .
In responding to the session setup request a user level server has a small number of choices .
1 ) reject the session setup and set one of a small range of error codes .
2 ) accept the supplied username / password .
A integer VUID is returned to the client .
The client is required to offer this VUID in future packets that require the security context of the supplied username / password .
3 ) accept the session setup but set the " guest " bit in the reply .
It is unclear how Windows clients change their behaviour when they get a guest response .
Maybe a Microsoft programmer could comment ?
Assuming that option 2 or 3 is chosen by the server the client will then proceed to request access to particular shares using a " tree connect " .
The client will not supply a password with the tree connect .
Ok , so enough background , now to some specific problems .
The first problem I 'd like to point out is what happens if a Win95 clients needs access to two different shares that need different authentication on the same user level server .
This is n't the main guest access problem that this email is all about but it is related .
For example , I might set a share " foo " as only accessible by user " fred " and another share " bar " as only accessible by " staff " .
Once the Windows95 client has successfully established a connection to " foo " it is not possible for it to authenticate itself differently for " bar " .
If you try and access " bar " and the server gives an error then the client will deceptively pop up a dialog box asking for a password for " bar " .
No matter what password you enter you will not succeed and you will get a dialog saying " The password is incorrect .
Try again " .
If you look at this with a sniffer then you find that the client is not sending the entered password over the link at all but is just sending a blank password with each tree connect attempt .
Users sometimes sit for ages trying to guess what the password is , little knowing that the client is silently sending a blank password in every attempt then telling them to " try again " .
NT does this as well in a slightly different situation .
It is very frustrating .
The above problem rules out " known password " guest shares on user level security servers .
These are the sort of shares where someone writes the password up on a whiteboard for everyone to see and the admin wants users to only connect as the guest user rather than themselves , but to connect to home directories as themselves .
There are other ( more common ) sorts of guest shares .
The most commonly asked for is a share where the admin wants anyone to be able to connect without knowing a password .
This is often used for public resources ( cdroms are commonly shared like this ) or printers .
Lets think about what happens when a client tries to access such a share on a user level server .
The client does not have an account on the server so it will need to send a username / password that the server cannot validate .
The client does still send a username / password in a session setup , however , as Windows clients are not able to send anonymous session setup requests for printer and file shares .
When the server receives the session setup it has to decide whether to accept it or not .
If the server has any guest shares at all then rejecting the session setup is not an option as the client might be trying to access a guest share .
At the time of the session setup the server has no way of telling .
But what if the username sent by the client is valid on the server but the password is wrong ?
The user has no control over what username is sent to the server by Windows .
( Windows clients always send the username that the user used to login locally ) .
The server does not know whether to send a " ERRbadpw " error response or a positive session setup reply with the guest bit set .
The server has no way to distinguish between a mistyped password and a user that does n't have an account on the server .
Whichever choice the server makes you are sunk .
You can configure Samba either way , which really just lets administrators choose the flavour of poison that they like .
Say you choose to reject the session setup if the username exists but the password is invalid .
You better hope that local " windows " usernames are unique across your organisation or you will end up rejecting access to guest shares for users that happen to have a username that matches one on the server .
We have 13 k machines within ANU .
We do not control what local usernames people choose on their desktop boxes .
We do offer guest shares on central Samba servers .
Say you choose the other route .
You accept the session setup and maybe mark it as " guest " for good measure .
You then discover that the client does a " tree connect " to a non -guest share .
The tree connect does not contain a password .
The server has no choice but to reject the tree connect .
The client pops up a dialog box and asks for the password for share .
The user enters the correct password this time .
The client does not send it over the wire , instead it sends a blank password then pops up a " The password is incorrect .
Try again " message .
Refer to my earlier comments on the frustrating time that eventually leads to the user pressing the big red reset switch .
There are other potential solutions that people have offered over the years to solve the " user level securuty + guest shares " dilemma .
We have tried them all .
None worked .
I am very happy to listen to other suggestions and if you come up with something that actually works then I 'll be very happy !
The only solution we have been able to offer users is virtual servers .
The guest shares are configured on a share level security virtual server .
The non -guest shares are on the user level security server .
I hope this explains why I 'd be unhappy to see the current session request mechanism disappear without a suitable replacement .
Andrew " more coffee ! quick ! "

GAZA CITY
Arafat Hamdona , 20 , has been confined to the cancer unit of As - Shifa , Gaza ’s primary hospital , since he was diagnosed with maxillary skin tumours in June 2008 .
Red lesions protrude from his face , his features are distorted and his eyes swollen shut .
In April , Arafat was permitted to travel to Augusta Victoria Hospital in East Jerusalem where he received three series of chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatment .
He was scheduled to return for further treatment , but has not been granted permission by the Israeli authorities to leave Gaza .
“ He is only given pain killers , ” said Arafat ’s father , Faraj Hamdona , explaining that that is all As - Shifa has to offer .
According to a July 2009 report published by the World Health Organization ( WHO ) in Jerusalem , Gaza doctors and nurses do not have the medical equipment to respond to the health needs of the 1.5 million people living in the Gaza Strip .
Medical equipment is often broken , lacking spare parts , or outdated .
WHO attributes the dismal state of Gaza ’s healthcare system to the Israeli blockade of the territory , tightened in June 2007 after Hamas , considered a terrorist organization by the West , seized control .
The poor organization of maintenance services in Gaza compounds the problem , reports WHO .

Mohamed Daher , admitted to As - Shifa Hospital for a blood disorder , and his wife Hyam , who had to take his blood samples to an outside clinic for testing as As - Shifa lacks equipment for basic chemical blood tests
Medical equipment sits idle
Some 500 tons of donations of medical equipment which flooded the Strip after Israel ’s military offensive ended on 18 January sits idle in warehouses .
Few donors consulted the health ministry or aid agencies working in Gaza to find out what provisions were needed .
According to the health ministry , 20 percent of the donated medications had expired .
WHO said much of the equipment sent was old and unusable due to a lack of spare parts .
WHO also said suppliers were unable to access medical equipment for repairs and maintenance and “ since 2000 , maintenance staff and clinical workers have not been able to leave the Strip for training in the use of medical devices ” .
The Israeli Defence Ministry says it is not obliged to allow into Gaza anything other than basic humanitarian supplies necessary for survival , and is concerned certain medical technology could be used for other more sinister means .
Gaza ’s only other connection to the outside world is its border crossing with Egypt , which is closed most of the time .
The lack of proper medical care in Gaza can have dire consequences .
“ The largest number of deaths due to the siege is among cancer patients , ” Gaza deputy health minister Hassan Halifa said .
“ Radiotherapy for cancer patients is not available due to the lack of equipment , and chemotherapy is generally not available due to the lack of drugs . ”
Lack of drugs , medical supplies
In July , 77 out of 480 essential drugs and 140 out of 700 essential medical supplies in Gaza ’s health ministry were out of stock , according to WHO .
Ismail Ahmed , a 66 - year - old from Shujayah , also lies in the cancer unit of As - Shifa , with a catheter for urination flowing into a wastebasket .
There are not enough IV [ intravenous ] bags .
The nurses put blood into plastic water bottles to transfer into my IV bag .
“ We lack necessary equipment for the patients , ” Abdullah Farajullah , a nurse at the unit , said .
Suffering from bladder cancer , Ismail requires blood transfusions .
“ There are not enough IV [ intravenous ] bags .
The nurses put blood into plastic water bottles to transfer into my IV bag , ” Ismail said .
Due to a lack of equipment , he has been on a waiting list for over a month to have a CT ( computed tomography ) scan , and requires an MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) - although Gaza lacks a single working MRI scanner , according to WHO .
As - Shifa lacks equipment for basic blood tests .
Patients rely on family members to take their blood to certain clinics for testing .
Another problem for medics in Gaza is the irregular electricity supply , which affects sensitive medical equipment such as incubators and kidney dialysis machines .
Hospitals in Gaza use uninterruptable power supply ( UPS ) systems as backups , but they require batteries which are often not available due to border closures with Israel and Egypt , according to WHO .
The International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) is funding and supplying 30 percent of medications and medical supplies in Gaza , said communications officer Mustafa Abu- Hassanain in Gaza .
“ Most of the other 70 percent comes from the health ministry in Ramallah , paid for by the Palestinian Authority budget , ” said Tony Laurance , head of WHO ’s West Bank and Gaza Office in Jerusalem .
There is a dialogue between the health ministry in Gaza and the ministry in Ramallah ( under Fatah ’s control ) .
Deliveries must be approved by the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories ( COGAT ) , a unit of the Israeli Ministry of Defence , before being allowed into Gaza , explained Laurance .
This supply chain is unpredictable and exacerbated by the conflict between Fatah and Hamas.

This story was updated at 2:00 p.m. EDT .
The 13 people aboard the crowded International Space Station can breathe a bit easier now that some astronaut plumbers have fixed a broken zero gravity toilet .
The toilet is one of two orbital commodes on the space station for the outpost 's permanent six - person crew and seven visiting astronauts from the docked shuttle Endeavour .
It flooded on Sunday , forcing Mission Control to ask the shuttle and station crew to hang an " out of service " sign on the door until further notice .
Space station crewmembers repaired the Russian - built space commode by replacing a separator pump and control panel .
The fix took them much of Monday morning to perform , but in the end Mission Control declared the revived space bathroom - known as the Waste Hygiene Compartment , or WHC - fit for astronaut use .
" Copy , the WHC is go for nominal ops , " Canadian astronaut Robert Thirsk replied .
The call was good news for the space station , which is currently hosting its largest crowd ever .
It means astronauts wo n't have to resort to Apollo - era bags to stow their waste once the commode aboard Endeavour was full .
By coincidence , Thirsk repaired the space toilet on the 40th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing on July 20 , 1969 .
Two astronauts were also working outside the station to deliver spare parts in the second of five spacewalks by Endeavour 's crew .
Space toilet breaks
At the start of Endeavour 's mission , NASA wanted astronauts to refrain from using the shuttle 's toilet while docked at the station because the vent valve used to dispose waste water overboard is located too close to a new experiment porch , which spacewalkers installed on Saturday .
When the toilet broke , Mission Control gave the okay to use Endeavour 's bathroom temporarily , while drawing plans for a repair .
NASA spokesperson Brandi Dean said the bathroom was fixed before the wastewater tank aboard Endeavour was full , so no overboard dump will be required .
" Thanks for the help , " Mission Control told Thirsk .
The $ 19 million space toilet is the newer of two bathrooms aboard the International Space Station and is installed in NASA 's Destiny laboratory .
It was delivered last fall and joined an older space toilet , also a Russian design , which is located in the station 's Russian - built Zvezda service module .
Since astronauts are weightless in space , the space toilets use airflow and vacuums to draw waste away from the body in place of gravity .
The newer toilet is part of a larger wastewater system that recycles astronaut urine , sweat and wastewater back into drinkable water .
The older toilet has failed in the past as well , but was successfully repaired last summer .
NASA officials have said that two functioning toilets are a vital requirement for supporting permanent six - person crews that can temporarily peak at 13 people during shuttle missions .
The space station doubled its crew from three to six people for the first time in May .

The UK is to share fingerprint information with Canada and Australia , with the US and New Zealand to follow soon , the Home Office said today .
The collaboration will make it easier to detect people with criminal histories in other countries , speed up deportations and establish previously unknown identities , the Home Office said .
The new data - sharing agreement is aimed at fighting identity fraud , the Home Office said in a statement .
It is a product of the Five Country Conference on immigration and border control .
It said the US will be joining shortly and New Zealand is to consider legislation to join in the near future .
For the first year each country will be able to share and check 3,000 sets of fingerprints with partner countries .
This will let them explore the feasibility of routine information sharing , the Home Office said .
UK Border Agency deputy chief executive Jonathan Sedgwick said the checks would complement ones they already share with European partners .
Trials had already shown results , he said .
" This new agreement will help us identify and remove individuals whose identities were previously unknown but also improve public safety through better detection of lawbreakers and those coming to the UK for no good . "
The Home Office said an individual who claimed asylum in the UK as a Somali was found to have been fingerprinted in the US while travelling on an Australian passport .
Australia subsequently confirmed he was an Australian citizen wanted by police on a charge of rape .
The US deported him to Australia , where he was tried and jailed .
Measures to protect privacy include :
Ensuring all fingerprints are anonymous and cannot be linked to an individual unless a match is detected between countries .
Destroying fingerprints once a match made , with no fingerprint database being compiled .
Using encryption and other security tools to protect shared files .
The UK Border Agency published a privacy impact assessment that sets out how the arrangement will operate .
We recently launched a teaser - site for our upcoming CMS , HiFi .
It 's still a bit premature to be talking about the details of HiFi in this space ( sorry ! ) , so instead I want to explain how we implemented the nifty color - changing header .
Joel deserves most of the credit here , since he came up with the concept and did most of the coding .
I just tweaked things for a smoother result .
The secret to the ever - changing color scheme is an 8000 - pixel wide image containing a continuous color gradient .
This image is tiled vertically across the header section of the website and overlaid with several other semi-transparent PNGs ( IE6 ?
We do n't need no stinking IE6 ) containing the logo , hightlight around the logo , and the dark edges along the top and bottom .
We are using JavaScript to slowly move the gradient from right to left , exposing a contiuously changing portion of the color spectrum .
The script itself is very simple , but it relies on jQuery and the jQuery Background - Position Animation Plugin .
$ ( document ) .ready ( function ( ) { var initialPos = ( Math.floor ( Math.random ( ) * 8000 ) +90000 ) + ' px 0 ' ; $ ( ' # slider ' ) .css({backgroundPosition : initialPos} ) .animate({backgroundPosition : ' (0 0 ) '} , 1500000 , ' linear ' ) ; } ) ;
We start by generating a random initial position along the gradient .
Actually , we 're starting at the end , and moving backwards so the colors fade from right to left .
Once we set the starting position , all we need to do is setup a very slow animation of the background position .
The animation takes 1500 seconds — 25 minutes — and will cycle through the full rainbow twelve times .
Since background - images repeat by default , the gradient will wrap around whenever it reaches the end .
That 's all there is to it !

ANALYSIS / OPINION :
The civil unrest in Iran is being directed by a secret cabal of intellectuals in the United States , or so the Islamic regime would like the world to believe .
Defendants in the show trials under way in Tehran are being given the third degree over their links to foreign masterminds .
The chief prosecutor is asking defendants questions such as , “ Were you sent by Michael Ledeen ?
What did Michael Ledeen tell you to do ? ”
Another was told flat out , “ You are an agent of Michael Ledeen ! ”
The universal response has been , “ Michael who ? ”
“ You have to understand - these are crazy people , ” Mr. Ledeen told The Washington Times yesterday .
He is the Freedom Scholar at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and a former consultant to the National Security Council , the State Department and the Defense Department .
He has published widely on Iranian matters , and his tag line “ faster , please ” — referring to the need to accelerate the pace of change in Iran — is well - known among those who follow the issue closely .
Mr. Ledeen is one of three public intellectuals implicated by the Iranians , the others being Ambassador Mark Palmer and political science professor Abbas Milani at Stanford University .
Why these three ?
“ I have no idea , ” Mr. Ledeen said .
“ We mostly agree on the issues , but we ’ve never worked as a group . ”
Accusations began to fly after Iran ’s former President Mohammad Khatami called for a referendum on the recent contested presidential election , invoking Article 110 of the Iranian constitution .
Reformist media took up the idea , and it began to gain momentum .
They must have touched a nerve .
On July 21 , the hard - line paper Keyhan ran an editorial denouncing the idea , “ Khatami ’s Suggestion or Michael Ledeen ’s Guideline ? ”
The author , a radical named Hoseyn Shari’atmadari , accused Mr. Khatami of “ acting upon the guidebook provided by Michael Ledeen or the CIA ” and said that even proposing a referendum was “ part of the scenario written by the West for creating sedition ” in Iran .
“ I ’ve been putting the idea of a referendum out for years , ” Mr. Ledeen told us , “ and I ’m not the only one . ”
His version is much different from what Mr. Khatami suggested .
He would pose one simple question : Do you want an Islamic Republic ?
“ My belief is , most Iranians would say no , ” he said .
Once Islamic rule has been delegitimized , the Iranians can establish an interim government with a neutral party in charge — “ Jimmy Carter , someone like that , ” Mr. Ledeen suggested helpfully — until a new secular - based constitution could be written .
As for the idea of conniving with Mr. Khatami , Mr. Ledeen laughed , calling him a “ phony reformer who was guilty of ordering the massacre of Iranian students 10 years ago ” when he was president .
The Islamic regime has responded with vitriol because it sees any such referendum as a mortal threat .
The last thing the rulers want is for the unvarnished , unfiltered voice of the people to be heard .
So they need scapegoats to discredit the idea of a referendum and the civil unrest generally .
The picture they are painting at the show trials is that the uprising in Iran is not a spontaneous expression of domestic public outrage after decades of repression but a sinister plot being orchestrated by malevolent forces outside the country .
Mr. Ledeen told us the regime has to blame an organized conspiracy from abroad “ because they cannot admit the possibility that there are ordinary citizens who got it into their heads that their government stinks . ”
Laying the blame on malefactors in the heart of the Great Satan absolves the regime from having to address the hard questions that put people out in the streets in the first place .
This is kind of like when the White House shrugs off tea parties or the town - hall ruckus .
The accusations against Mr. Ledeen , Mr. Milani and Mr. Palmer are farcical , but their purpose is deadly serious .
The Iranian mullahs are using the show trials to lay the groundwork for future action against leaders like Mr. Khatami , Mir-Hossein Mousavi and Hashemi Rafsanjani .
Badgering street demonstrators into confessing they were acting under the influence of foreign ideas raises the specter of treason charges .
The hard - liners are gradually building their case based on forced confessions and fabricated conspiracies .
All the while , the Obama administration sits idle , waiting for Tehran to respond to its feeble diplomatic overtures .
We hope the U.S. government will soon realize the nature of the regime it is trying to deal with .
To borrow a phrase , faster please .

Fuck the Senate .
The Progressive / Liberal Democrats in the House ( who significantly outnumber the Blue Dogs ) were abused , ignored , bullied and beaten down by Gingrich / DeLay repugs for 14 years and they 're not going to take it any more .
The public option ( if they can't have single - payer ) puts them on the right side of the issue , the right side of the American Public ( 76 percent ) , the right side of politics ( passing it will destroy the GOP ) , the right side of history .
Delivering genuine health care reform will be the biggest Democratic policy and political victory in five decades .
Failing could very well open the door to President Palin .
Progressives , Liberals and other Real Democrats have nothing to lose by fighting to the death for the public option .
And that 's exactly what 's happening .
This morning , Anthony Weiner confirms it on CNBC : WEINER : The President does seem like he 's moving away from the public plan , and if he does , he 's not going to pass a bill .
Because there are just too many people in Washington who believe that the public plan was the only way that you effectively bring some downward pressure on prices , and if he says well we 're not going to have that , then I 'm not really quite sure what we 're dong here .
BECKY QUICK : So you would not vote for a bill that made it through , if it got through ...
WEINER : Not only I but I think there 's probably a hundred members of the House , who believe for various reasons that you need to have something to bring down prices .
Otherwise you 're basically , what you 're doing , you 're keeping the cost arc . . . the CBO agrees with that .
You know as it was , I think the public plan had been watered down so much .
So if the President thinks he 's cutting a deal to get Senate votes , he 's probably losing House votes .
SNIP
There was one final amusing moment : JIM QUINTIANILLA :
So you think he will lose the liberal wing of his own party , and you do n't think he can make it up by attracting Blue Dogs , Republicans , anyone on the other side of the aisle .
Yes , Blue Dogs are " on the other side of the aisle . "
And everyone but Rahm seems to know it .
( via The Hill )
As Brian Beutler at TPM reminds us : Weiner has in recent weeks become a surrogate for the public option in the House .
As a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee , he called Republicans on their bluff , offering an amendment that would have eliminated Medicare - - a single - payer , government run health care system , which Republicans say , in principle , they oppose .
The amendment was defeated unanimously .
Firedoglake explains the math that gives the progressives the edge :
There are 435 seats on the House .
Of those , 257 are filled by Democrats and 178 by Republicans .
Which means a majority is 218 .
The Republicans have vowed to vote against health care , period .
The Democrats can pass health care on their own , but if they lose 40 of their own , they only have 217 votes .
There are 57 Democrats who signed the July 30 letter saying that they " simply cannot vote " for a bill that " at minimum " does not have a public plan ( PDF ) .
There are 7 more not listed on the letter who have pledged to vote against any bill that does not have a robust public plan .
That makes 64 Democrats who wo n't vote for the " co-ops " that both Kathleen Sibelius and Robert Gibbs say the White House is " open " to .
Do the math : 257 - 64 = 193 .

So thanks to the progressive members of the House who have pledged to vote against any health care bill that does not have a public plan .
They represent 76 % of Americans who want a public plan , and coming from heavily Democratic - leaning districts as they do , an even greater percentage of their own constituents .
One of those who took the strong - public - option - or - nothing pledge , by the way , is Kentucky 's own Proud Liberal John Yarmuth , although Page One reveals he might be wobbling .

Everton have agreed a fee of around £ 24 million with Manchester City for defender Joleon Lescott .
Man City have bid of around £ 24 m accepted by Toffees
Attitude
Eastlands stars
Everton have agreed a fee of around £ 24 million with Manchester City for Joleon Lescott , with a switch expected to be completed on Monday .
Cash - rich side City have already seen two offers for the England international rejected by their Premier League rivals .
Toffees boss David Moyes appeared defiant that Lescott would remain at Goodison Park , despite the defender recently handing in a written transfer request .
However , Lescott was not included in Everton 's squad for their previous two matches , increasing speculation that a move could be in the offing .
A statement on City 'ssaid : " Manchester City can confirm that agreement has been reached with Everton for the transfer of Joleon Lescott .
"
The move is subject to the player agreeing personal terms and passing a medical . "
Everton added : " Moyes has revealed there was a noticeable change in the player 's attitude and as a result decided that it is in the best interests of the Club if he allowed Lescott to leave .
" Chairman Bill Kenwright has worked tirelessly to get the best deal for Everton , achieving a substantial increase on Manchester City 's initial offer .
" Lescott will now meet with Manchester City and will sign subject to him successfully negotiating personal terms and passing a medical .
" Lescott signed on Merseyside from Wolves for a fee of £ 5 million in 2006 and has since made 113 Premier League appearances for the club , scoring 14 goals .
The versatile stopper 's solitary appearance this campaign came when Everton lost 6 - 1 to Arsenal on the opening day of the season .
City boss Mark Hughes has made no secret of his wish to further bolster his defensive ranks , having already brought in Kolo Toure from the Gunners .
Lescott now looks poised to join the likes of Toure , Roque Santa Cruz , Gareth Barry , Carlos Tevez and Emmanuel Adebayor in signing at Eastlands this summer .

Congress has passed a $ 2 billion extension of the popular “ cash for clunkers ” program , clearing the legislation for President Barack Obama ’s signature .
The Senate passed the extension Thursday evening .
The House approved the measure last week .
Lawmakers made sure to keep the popular program alive before heading home for a monthlong vacation .
Acting with unusual haste , the Senate readied a $ 2 billion fill - up Thursday night for “ cash for clunkers , ” the economy - boosting program that caught the fancy of car buyers and instantly increased sales for an auto industry long mired in recession .
Supporters of the program hailed its effect on the auto industry — which had its best month in nearly a year in July — as well as its claimed environmental benefits .
“ The reality is this is a program that has been working .
Consumers believe it ’s working .
Small business people believe it ’s working .
People who make steel and aluminum and advertisers … and everyone who ’s involved in the larger economic impact of the auto industry believe it is working , ” said Sen.
Debbie Stabenow , D - Mich .
The legislation had its share of critics , though , most of them Republicans .
And I dearly hope that some of the folks who already bought a new car through the program drop in and pay a little visit on the priests of ideological purity who think they should not have had help getting that car .
Even my enviro buddies come in for criticism for whining that the program did n’t set requirements for fuel efficiency high enough .
Americans have learned a little bit about saving money [ recently ] .
The average replacement car gets almost 10 mpg better than the clunker it replaced .
All but one were compact and medium - size cars – and the trade - ins were almost all SUV’s and trucks .
No one knows why some lucky folks thrive on five or six hours of sleep per night , while the rest of us suffer if we do n't get eight hours of shut - eye .
But now scientists have discovered a genetic mutation that could be responsible for the eternal perkiness of short - sleepers .
Combing through a database of sleep - study volunteers , the researchers found two people who needed far less sleep than average .
Both had abnormal copies of a gene called DEC2 , which is known to affect circadian rhythms and oxygen regulation in mammals .
When the scientists bred mice to have the same mutation , the mice slept less and were more active than their regular rodent peers .
So far , the researchers do n't know why swapping a single base pair in the DEC2 gene makes mammals need less sleep .
But unlike most people who skimp on sleep for long periods of time , subjects with the mutation do n't experience the negative health effects of sleep deprivation , such as mood or metabolic changes .
" Finding the mutation is just the first step , " said sleep researcher Ying - Hui Fu of the University of California , San Francisco , who co-authored the paper in Science Thursday .
" To understand the mechanism is really what 's important for us .
We want to understand the how , what and why of sleep — how does it affect our health ? "
Scientists say the average adult needs eight to 8.5 hours of sleep each night to function optimally , but the short - sleepers reported feeling great on a lifetime average of only 6.25 hours per night .
And unlike most of us , who catch up on sleep whenever we take vacation , the mutation carriers stuck to their short sleep schedule even when they had no responsibilities .
But unfortunately for those of us who'd like more time in our day , the short - sleep mutation appears to be very rare .
Out of 70 families in the UCSF sleep study database , only one carried the mutation .
And Fu said she does n't know how many people worldwide might be affected .
A commentary about the research , also in Science , calls the discovery " a starting point for studying the regulation of timing and organization of sleep . "
But because only two people with the mutation have been identified thus far , the authors said the research needs to be replicated in independent studies of other short - sleep individuals .
Fu agrees that more research on the mutation is needed .
She 's especially interested in understanding how the mutation decreases the need for sleep , and whether it might eventually be used to help others get by on less sleep .
" My fantasy is that as we understand more about how sleep quantitatively affects other health pathways , and we understand more about the mechanism of sleep and how it 's regulated in terms of how much we need , someday we'd be able to modulate it in a safe way , " Fu said .
" So people could sleep less without it affecting their health . "

It 's a good thing we did n't travel all the way to Germany just to watch somebody hold a PlayStation 3 Slim up on stage from a hundred feet away .
We would 've been out of town when one showed up right on our own doorstep earlier this morning .
Yup , we 've got one , and Nick Chester and I have spent the better part of the day manhandling it .
In more ways than one , it was n't exactly what we expected .
We 've got a full unboxing video on the way for you tomorrow ; but while that 's in the oven , we 'd like to hurry up and give you a closer look at this thing .
Hit the jump for photos , our impressions , and a detailed rundown of just what you 'll be getting when you first pull Sony 's new console out of its box on September 1st .
Sony PlayStation 3 Slim
Release Date : September 1 , 2009
MSRP : $ 299.99
Ta-da .
I do n't know what you want me to tell you here .
It 's a box .
One thing you will notice , however , is that the word " Slim " is actually nowhere to be found .
Sony seems to want to make it very clear that this now IS the PlayStation 3 .
One and only .
If you 're fascinated by the packaging for some reason , there are more photos of the box in the gallery to give you a full 360 - degree look .
Personally , we were more interested in what was inside of it .
Spoiler :
It was this .
The first thing we noticed was that it looked bigger than we expected it to be .
Maybe the hype had gotten to us and we were looking for something truly diminutive , but as you 'll see in tomorrow 's unboxing video , that was our initial reaction .
However , that only lasted until we dragged out the original PS3 and put them side by side .
Yeah , it 's smaller .
If you 've never owned or had much interaction with the original , you 're not going to be blown away by the difference .
But if the monster you see on the right already lives in your house , this is quite a change .
Compared to something like the Wii , this is definitely still the fat kid .
Next to the 360 , on the other hand , it 's a much different story .
While the Slim measures larger from front to back and will stick out from your shelf a bit more , there 's no arguing that it 's smaller in overall volume .
It 's still a bit heavier , but in terms of taking up space in the universe , we would n't say it 's much more of a hog than your launch - era PS2 was .
Keep in mind also that the Slim 's power brick is internal , so when it 's all said and done , this will be taking up a hell of a lot less room in your entertainment center than your Xbox 360 .
Comes with everything you see here !
Console , power cord , one DualShock 3 controller with USB charging cord , manuals , and one ... composite cable .
* forced smile *
The new logo appears on both the top and bottom , and beats the hell out of that Spider - Man font no matter which side you 're looking at .
The unit stands reasonably stable when positioned vertically like this , but if you 've got kids or feisty cats running around the house while this is out in the open , the optional $ 24 stand might not be a terrible idea .
Otherwise , unless you 're keeping it on top of a tall bookcase in a region that 's prone to the occasional earthquake , we think you 'll be okay .
The only difference you 'll notice with the included accessories is the new AC power cord .
It 's much smaller and more akin to what you used to plug in your fat PlayStation 2 with .
The smaller connection also makes it much easier to unplug and work with if you need to move the console around or take it with you somewhere -- an idea that wo n't sound so ridiculous from now on .
The back of the unit is more or less what you 'd expect .
An Ethernet port , kept company by HDMI , optical and multi-AV outputs , respectively .
One of our biggest complaints with the Slim is the location of the USB ports and indicator lights .
If you already own a PS3 , you know what a pain in the ass it is to plug anything in or see what 's going on with your hard drive or Wi-Fi connection unless you 're lying on the floor looking up .
The lip that sticks out over the base portion of the console seems even bigger with this new model , so that annoyance is , unfortunately , still something you 'll have to deal with .
The recess where the disc drive and power / eject buttons are located now has a dark , shiny , titanium - like finish .
It does n't come out too well in photos or tomorrow 's unboxing video , but you 'll notice a difference when you see it in person .
Not silver , not glossy black , but somewhere in between .
It 's a slick new look , and we actually had a very hard time trying to get fingerprints to show up on it .
That may have just been the lighting in the room we were in , but either way , it 's a great improvement over whatever you 've currently got .
Speaking of those buttons , that 's just what they are this time around .
Buttons .
Gone are the silly " touchpad thingies that nobody asked for , I hope we 're not paying extra for this , why did you do that " controls .
The PS logo no longer rotates .
Gasp .
Fire , brimstone , etc .
You 'll get over it when you hear how incredibly quiet this thing is .
Or , rather , when you do n't hear it .
This was the one thing that Nick and I were most impressed with .
This thing is quiet .
Scary quiet .
" WTF , is it even on ? " quiet .
Nick thinks the optical drive makes just a bit more noise than the original when inserting or ejecting a disc , but it did n't seem any louder to me .
Either way , once your game or movie is in there , the thing is virtually silent .
Keep in mind we were pretty busy with this today and did n't exactly get to jump into any eight - hour gaming sessions , but we certainly played it .
You 'll probably be as impressed with its inaudibility as we were .
I 'd venture to say it 's even quieter than the Wii .
Final verdict ?
Shit 's tight , son .
Not exactly the most breathtaking piece of technology we 've ever laid eyes on , but it 's enough to make you want to trade in your now - fatass original PS3 once you 've seen it in person .
Will it be the smallest console in your setup ?
No .
But it makes its predecessor look like a hulking beast , and it 's lighter , far quieter , and less expensive to leave on all day .
There 's plenty more where this came from in the gallery below , so feel free to browse through for some more photos and close - ups of the finer details .
And again , be sure to check back tomorrow for our unboxing video to see the PS3 Slim in action , and probably Nick and me making asses of ourselves on camera as well .
We 'll give you a look and listen at what to expect .
Nice job , Sony !
Now get back in the kitchen and publish some more games for us to play on it .

Michael Laine ( at right ) has spent every penny he has chasing the space elevator dream .
Steps toward space View photos NASA has put up $ 4 million in prizes for inventors who create the building blocks for an aerospace breakthrough .
Meet 4 teams competing in this year 's Space Elevator Games .
LaserMotive team members at work on their power beaming system .
LaserMotive hopes to land NASA 's $ 2 million prize this year .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
On an April day in Boulder , Colo. , Michael Laine sat onstage in front of a large audience , struggling to hold back tears .
That afternoon he was supposed to be presenting to the attendees of the Conference on World Affairs , but at the moment , Laine was finding it hard to concentrate .
" Two hours ago I lost a $ 3 million building , " he declared to the room .
" And now I do n't have a place to live . "
It was the seventh time Laine had gone into foreclosure in just five years , all in pursuit of an entrepreneurial dream .
Always before , he 'd managed to raise the cash to buy his office building -- also his home and only source of income -- back at auction .
This time , he was out of luck , as was the nine - employee company , LiftPort , that Laine financed almost entirely by leveraging his property .
Two years later , Laine still does n't regret the obsession that led him to repeatedly default on his mortgage and gamble the $ 140,000 he received in rental income each year .
" I could have retired at 35 with a lifetime income , " he says .
" Or I could build an elevator to space . "
Laine is one of the most devout proponents of the sci - fi phenomenon known as the space elevator -- an as - yet hypothetical alternative to rockets -- but he's not the only entrepreneur inspired by the idea .
This week 's fifth annual Space Elevator Conference , sponsored by Microsoft ( MSFT , Fortune 500 ) , is bringing a host of academics , space enthusiasts and small business owners to Redmond , Wash . , to discuss everything from the technology to the regulatory framework required to build a giant elevator to space .
The conference will be closely followed by the Space Elevator Games , parts of which take place at NASA 's Dryden Flight Research Center in the Mojave desert .
Teams of scientists , tinkerers and entrepreneurs will gather to test out technologies that could one day lift riders through the Earth 's atmosphere toward the stars .
Space elevators may sound like the stuff of science fiction , but there 's cold , hard cash attached to the race to build one .
NASA 's Centennial Challenges program has put up $ 4 million in prize money for teams that successfully conquer the Games ' two key engineering competitions , and large companies are keeping a close eye on the innovative technologies created by competitors in the power beaming challenge , which requires teams to remotely power a robotic vehicle using a laser .
" The Games push the envelope .
We 're intrigued by power beaming , which could provide new market development opportunities for us , " says David Marcotte , customer relations manager at Trumpf , the giant German laser manufacturer that is providing high - powered lasers for the Games .
Since as far back as the late 19th century , scientists and science fiction writers have theorized about building a structure that reaches from Earth into geosynchronous orbit .
But it was a young Russian engineer , Yuri Artsutanov , who first described the science and imagined a space elevator in a 1960 article : " The electric train gives a last whistle , slowly picks up speed and darts vertically upward on the web of delicate threads . "
Put simply , the contraption would be made of an incredibly strong yet thin cable anchored to the Earth 's surface near the equator and attached to a counterweight in space .
The Earth 's rotation would keep the cable taut , in much the same way as if you were to spin around while holding a piece of string attached to a ball .
An electric carriage powered by a laser and the sun ( liquid fuel or batteries are too heavy ) would move up and down cable , carrying people or equipment more than 22,000 miles into space .
The space elevator is thought to be theoretically possible , but the practice of actually building one is n't so straightforward .
Carbon nanotubes , synthetic carbon molecules thought to be light and strong enough to form the cable , have yet to be produced on a large scale .
Power beaming technology -- using lasers and solar cells to transfer electricity across a large distance -- is still in its infancy .
But the potential of those nascent technologies was enough to inspire Laine , a former Marine , to create Bramerton , Wash . - based LiftPort in 2003 .
His goal : to coordinate research on all the technologies required to build a space elevator .
" I did n't want to do anything else , " he says .
In the four years before Laine lost his building and main source of funding , LiftPort worked with various universities to research high - altitude balloons , robotics and nanotechnology .
His case may be extreme , but Laine is n't the only entrepreneur willing to throw time and money into developing the futuristic technologies required for the space elevator .
In 2005 , Silicon Valley nonprofit The Spaceward Foundation ( motto : " The future is closer than it appears ! " ) launched the Space Elevator Games to advance research on power beaming and on new materials such as carbon nanotubes .
This year 's competition will have two parts .
The Power Beaming Challenge in Mojave , Calif. , requires teams to build a laser - powered robot that can climb one kilometer up a cable at a minimum speed of two meters per second .
( The competition was scheduled for early August , but when the cable snapped off the underside of the helicopter holding it up , the event was postponed until a safer attachment could be found . )
In late August , another set of contestants is expected in Seattle for the Tether Challenge .
To win , they 'll need to produce a cable that is at least 50 % stronger than the " house " tether , made of Zylon , the trademarked super fiber used to protect drivers in Formula One racing cars .
In the three prior Games , the last held in 2007 , no team succeeded in either competition .
But each year , the performance requirements become more demanding and the quality of the entries gets better .
" When this thing started in 2005 , the [ power beaming ] teams were using parts you could buy off the shelf , " says Ted Semon , a space elevator enthusiast and blogger .
" Those teams are now having to push their suppliers to do more cutting - edge stuff . "
A testing ground
LaserMotive , one of the few for - profit companies competing in the Games , is among those pushing the boundaries .
Made up of a motley crew that includes physicists and small business owners , the Kent , Wash . , startup plans to use the competition to show off its innovative system for transferring electric power through a laser beam .
It 's a system team members say could soon be used in everything from aerospace work to mobile electronics .
After a disappointing debut in 2007 , when last minute tweaks caused LaserMotive 's system to fail a final qualification test , the team is hoping that years of hard work and tens of thousands of dollars of personal investment will finally pay off .
LaserMotive has already qualified this time , and its members are optimistic about their chances of winning the $ 2 million prize for conquering the power beaming challenge .
" I see the space elevator games as a business opportunity , " says Jordin Kare , a rocket scientist and cofounder of LaserMotive who serves as a staff inventor at Bellevue - based Intellectual Ventures Laboratories .
" It provides a high visibility kick - off for a startup like us . "
LaserMotive has some heavy - hitting sponsors behind it .
Its high - efficiency solar cells were designed on spec by Boeing ( BA , Fortune 500 ) subsidiary Spectrolab , and the two high - powered diode lasers it uses to power its robot were provided by German laser manufacturer Dilas at a significant discount .
But many of the system 's parts had to be developed from scratch by the team members , including a patent - pending photovoltaic technology invented by Kare .
The result is a series of remote - controlled mirrors and lenses that guide a laser beam so that it hits a kind of solar panel , which is attached to a small , lightweight robotic vehicle .
The solar cell converts the laser beam into electricity , which is used to power the motor of the robot so that it can climb the cable .
Kare believes technology based on this system could revolutionize the aerospace industry , powering unmanned aircraft and even rocket launches from the ground , without the need for liquid fuel .
Before LaserMotive can seek significant outside funding , however , it needs to prove its technology .
For that , it 's banking on the Games , which provides a unique opportunity to use high - powered lasers over FAA - approved long ranges .
" Being able to demonstrate our system in a highly publicized context helps get us in front of large aerospace companies , " says co-founder Tom Nugent .
Technology breakthroughs
Even before the Games , LaserMotive 's work is already paying off for some team members .
Carsten Erickson , CEO of Seattle - based supply - chain software maker Coolearth Software , invested in LaserMotive and joined the team in October 2006 after seeing a talk about the space elevator at a robotics conference .
Since then , Erickson has worked evenings and weekends to develop a computer - based tracking system that can follow LaserMotive 's robot as it climbs the cable and steer the system 's laser to make sure the beam stays trained on the robot 's solar panels .
Erickson had never worked with laser - tracking systems before , but he quickly saw how similar technology could be used to great effect at his own $ 2 million company .
He used his LaserMotive prototype to design a computer - based quality inspection system that can identify and reject defective products on an assembly line -- a system he is already busy marketing to his clients .
" Working on LaserMotive has been inspirational , " Erickson says .
Steve Burrows of Twintec , an Auburn , Wash. , machine - parts manufacturer , built the mechanical components of LaserMotive 's robotic vehicle .
Working on the project inspired Burrows to develop a new product that his company now sells : a miniature version of the large ' T - slot ' aluminum framing used to build everything from workbenches to assembly lines in factories .
Burrows hopes that his new product , MicroRax , which he describes as a more robust version of an Erector Set , will appeal to scientists and tinkerers looking to build small structures .
He expects MicroRax , which he sells in kits starting at $ 89 , to more than double his company 's $ 500,000 annual revenue within two years .
As for the space elevator itself , the folks at LaserMotive do n't pretend to be true believers .
They certainly do n't expect to devote much time to the as - yet imaginary contraption beyond the Games .
" I do n't see how you can make a profitable business related to the space elevator anytime in the next quarter century , " says Nugent , who formerly worked at Laine 's LiftPort .
Other Games participants agree .
" The space elevator is n't feasible , but the Games are a good exercise for generating new materials , " says David Lashmore , chief technology officer of Nanocomp Technologies of Concord , N.H. Lashmore 's company used its carbon nanotube yarn in the tether strength contest in 2007 in partnership with MIT , and plans to do so again this year .
Even the Games ' organizers think it 's early days to be talking business .
" I can make the business case for carbon nanotubes and for power beaming .
But until we get these pieces together , it 's not quite the time to have a commercial space elevator company , " says Ben Shelef , co-founder of the Spaceward Foundation .
Nonetheless , Laine just can't shake his entrepreneurial conviction about the space elevator .
He spent last summer at an International Space University graduate program in Barcelona and is now researching the use of tethered high - altitude balloons for communications , observation and weather monitoring , which he says will contribute to the development of the space elevator .
He 's also hoping to create a venture capital firm that will fund the elevator 's precursor technologies .
" The [ value of the ] intellectual property that will come of building this elevator is enormous , " he says .
Most Space Elevator Games participants have set their sights closer to Earth .
Says LaserMotive 's Nugent : " We all agree that it 's more important to get up the kilometer [ of cable ] than to worry about the future . "

Just when you think you ’ve seen so much hypocrisy that nothing can shock you , along comes Megan McArdle .
McArdle , who blogs for the Atlantic Monthly , presents herself as a principled libertarian , fiercely denouncing any attempt to provide any sort of government - funded health care , because as she argues , big government is bad , bad , bad .
She ’s written some truly appalling things over the years as a shill for big corporate interests , recently defending Goldman Sachs because , as she wrote , “ financial meltdowns offer no villains . ”
Last week , McArdle posted an encyclopedia - length article on the Atlantic Monthly ‘s site , denouncing Obama ’s health care plan in a rambling piece that essentially boiled down to this : big government is a bad thing , and free markets are the medicine you need , even if you do n’t like it , and even though you ca n’t afford it .
McArdle ’s post sparked a series of smackdowns , including Ezra Klein in the Washington Post , and Jane Hamsher at Firedoglake .
What Megan McArdle does n’t mention is that her own privileged upbringing was funded by public money .
That ’s right , Megan McArdle is just a second - generation product of the sleazy NYC construction business , which has been using public money for private gain since the Tammany Hall era .
Even more galling is that Megan ’s father got his start in the public sector working in taxpayer - funded health care programs .
If it were n’t for her father ’s employment as a public health care official in the 1970s , Megan McArdle ’s life might have turned out completely different from the privileged one she enjoyed .
Megan McArdle is the daughter of one Francis X. McArdle , who built his career as a public servant in the New York City administration , then moved over to the private side , where he could leverage his contacts with the government — and finally moved back onto the public payroll in 2006 , when Mr. McArdle was appointed by then - Sen .
Hillary Clinton to advise the federal government how public funds should be spent , and on whom .
Earlier this year , Mr. McArdle was reportedly in Albany lobbying the New York state government for a job as the “ stimulus czar , ” appropriating President Obama ’s federal spending money .
Megan was born in 1973 , a few years after Francis got his big fat job on the public payroll in the New York City administration , where he stayed for 11 years .
Among the first big jobs Megan ’s daddy took while climbing up the public payroll career ladder were jobs as Inspector General for the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation , and Director of Program Budget for the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation .
So Megan McArdle ’s entry into this world was literally greased by taxpayer funds .
But of course , it would n’t stop there .
Francis McArdle , rose up the Big Government ranks in the New York city .
His public - funded career reached its peak in 1978 when then - Mayor Ed Koch named him as Commissioner of the New York City Department of Environmental Protection , where he served until 1981 .
That job put McArdle in control of all sorts of public works : water supply , waste water , sewage infrastructure .
It ’s kind of fitting that McArdle ’s privileged childhood was funded by taxpayer ’s shit and urine — a Freudian might say that this is the source of her inexplicable hatred of the same Big Government that pissed dollars and shat gold on the McArdle household .
Megan ’s dad moved from the public sector overseeing public works to a job with real estate developer Olympia & York — just in time to take advantage of the huge Battery Park City project that Olympia & York was developing under contract .
The success of the project relied on huge taxpayer subsidies — at least $ 65 million in 1981 dollars — as well as major public works projects to make the development attractive , including the disastrous Westway road project , which drained at least $ 85 million of federal subsidies until it was finally mothballed in the mid-80s , due to environmental concerns and public protests — the kinds of protesters whom grown - up Megan McArdle would later attack .
No matter , though , because by the time the Westway was canceled and all that public money was wasted , Olympia & York , Megan ’s daddy ’s company , had catapulted into one of the top real estate moguls in the world , and Megan ’s daddy was ready to move on to even bigger things .
In 1985 , F . X. McArdle had moved from the private sector to a position that Megan understands better than any other : a lobbyist who manipulates Big Government on behalf of private companies .
Francis X. McArdle was named to head the General Contractor ’s Association of New York .
He stayed in that lucrative position for the next 20 years .
In 1987 , as the budding libertarian Megan was enjoying an expensive private - school education , McArdle ’s business was investigated by a new Organized Crime Task Force set up by the state of New York to combat the mob ’s control of the contracting business , which led to enormous waste of taxpayer money .
Here ’s a New York Timesarticle on that investigation , featuring Megan ’s dad representing the scary people :
Anti-Crime Unit Urged for New York Builders by Selwyn Raab — Tuesday , January 6 , 1987 Corruption is so embedded in New York City ’s multibillion - dollar construction industry that a permanent investigative agency may be needed specifically to uproot it , a top state investigator said .
The investigator , Ronald Goldstock , director of the state ’s Organized Crime Task Force , also asserted that construction practices in the city must change .
Mr. Goldstock , whose agency is investigating the industry , said the elimination of organized - crime racketeering would not alone solve such problems as payoffs to municipal inspectors , bid -rigging among contractors and bribes to union officials for special contract favors and the hiring of lower - paid nonunion workers .
‘ Even if you indict and convict every mobster involved in corruption , ” Mr. Goldstock said in an interview , ” under current conditions , someone else will come along , recognize the potential and become the new predators . ”
Commenting on Mr. Goldstock ’s findings , the managing director of the General Contractors Association , Francis X. McArdle , said he was ” unaware of any pervasive patterns of corruption ” regarding his group .
The association represents more than 100 contractors primarily engaged in construction of public buildings and plants .
Mr. McArdle also disputed the need for a new investigative agency .
” We do n’t need more people tripping over each other in search of glory , facts or whatever , ” he said .
What ’s frightening is that Mr. McArdle won the day : the new investigative agency was shelved in favor of the kind of self - policing “ solution ” that Wall Street is pushing for today .
Because you know , those big government inspectors with their fact - finding missions only get in the way of innovation !
Here ’s where things get a little scarier : the story about the mob running Megan ’s daddy ’s area of work shortly afterwards became the subject of a Fortune magazine feature , replete with famous names from New York ’s organized crime world , titled : “ THE MAFIA ’S BIT OF THE BIG APPLE : Byzantine building codes and horrendous logistics help the mob control New York City construction — at a price that the big developers have been all too willing to pay . ”
In it , we find out that the world of New York City construction and contracting is controlled by A - list mobsters like the Gambinos , Luchesses , and Anthony Salerno , who eventually went to jail .
The report put together by the investigator estimated that mob corruption added 20 % to the costs of construction in Manhattan at the time Megan ’s daddy was the head of the General Contractor ’s Association :

“ The McArdle girl ?
She calls herself a libertarian ?
You really are a funny guy ! ”
By 1991 , Megan was on her way to Penn U. , where she would pupate into the free - market libertarian dung beetle we have all grown to loathe , thanks to her public - funded privileged upbringing , with a wink to that 20 % mafia margin .
Also 1991 , the Megan ’s daddy appeared again in The New York Times , this time as the key lobbyist trying to keep the public funds flowing to the association ’s clients , at the expense of taxpayers :
Council Allows Asphalt Factory Dinkins Wanted
by William Glaberson — March 23 , 1991
A dispute over an asphalt plant that New York City wants to build in Queens has provided a major test of how the City Council will handle intense lobbying both from special interest groups and the Mayor .
The city has moved to develop its own asphalt source because of a long history of charges of corruption and bid-rigging in the industry .
Francis X. McArdle , managing director of the General Contractors Association of New York , which has historically given campaign contributions to many Council members , spearheaded the lobbying for eight asphalt producers in New York .
Mr. McArdle is a former commissioner of the City ’s Department of Environmental Protection .
Megan showed how much she owes to her dad ’s way of doing business when she admitted in a blog post that she owes her success to personal contacts “ I sent out about 1400 resumes blind after my firm failed .
I got not one response .
All the jobs I interviewed for came from personal contacts . ”
We learn just how useful these personal contacts are for Megan McArdle thanks to a gushing profile on her published in early 2007 in a rightwing magazine called “ Doublethink ” — put out by a corporate - funded advocacy group with ties to Tom Delay and Cato , whose mission is to “ identify and develop future conservative and libertarian leaders . ”
In the profile , we learn that Megan ’s first job in 2001 , after graduating from the University of Chicago ’s graduate business program as a committed Ayn Rand libertarian , was canceled due to the market drop in 2001 .
So instead of flipping burgers to make ends meet , the libertarian moved back home into her parents ’
Upper West Side digs — a home that taxpayer money helped to fund .
There , in the hard knocks of the Upper West Side , the 28 - year - old MBA seethed in libertarian anger at all the welfare queens and wasteful government spending programs she saw all around her .
But it was n’t until bin Laden created an opportunity that Megan finally got a job — as an “ executive copy girl ” for a post - 9/11 cleanup crew near the site of the WTC .
It was exactly the sort of job that those “ personal contacts ” can help you get in the “ byzantine ” world of construction in NYC .
It was at this time , living in her parent ’s swank Manhattan pad and working a job in her daddy ’s line of business , that Megan McArdle ’s blogging career as a right - wing libertarian crusader was born .
Instead of admitting that she got her first job thanks to daddy ’s shady connections with the corrupt construction trades , Megan pretended that she took the WTC - cleanup job as a sort of personal penance , a gift to the people of her stricken city : “ [ I}t was easier to bear it all than it would be working somewhere else , and worrying , and unable to do anything about it . ”
Really Megan , you should n’t have born that cross for us .
Her answer to 9/11 and all subsequent economic problems , including the health care fiasco , is simple : more free markets of the sort that have absolutely nothing to do with her own family ’s way of making a living .
And the gullible readers of her blog were so impressed that Megan moved to Washington and found work with the Atlantic Monthly , shilling for Wall Street , health care firms , and spending her entire career arguing for the total repeal of all corporate taxes .
Washington is also where she found her dream man , Peter Suderman , a former FreedomWorks lobbyist .
It was a natural match ; like Megan , Suderman was a veteran of the deeply hypocritical world of free - market shills who make their money playing the murky world where big government and big business overlap .
As part of his anti-government crusading for FreedomWorks , Suderman once helped run a fake - grassroots campaign , creating a front group , Angryrenter.com , that posed as regular joes fighting big government programs to bailout distressed homeowners .
The real backers were the corporations who fund FreedomWorks — they did n’t want to have a dime of their tax dollars going to help out poor suckered American homeowners who needed some help to avoid getting thrown out on the street .
Suderman ’s scam , pretending that the anger came from regular joe renters and not billionaires , was so sleazy that it was exposed by another rightwing publication , the Wall Street Journal .
This did n’t bother Megan , because her employer , the Atlantic Monthly , has already been outed as the very embodiment of corruption , the journalism world ’s equivalent of the General Contractors Association .
Thanks to TalkingPoints Memo , we know of at least 100 instances in which the Atlantic Monthly allowed interest groups , including health care companies , to pay large sums in order to gain access to the magazine ’s editorial staff :
The Atlantic has held approximately 100 of them since 2003 , according to Zachary Hooper , a spokesman for the magazine .
“ The corporate sponsor …comes to us and says , ‘ We ’re interested in having a discussion on a certain topic . ' ”
The magazine ’s business staff , said Hooper , takes things from there .
The Atlantic flier makes clear that the “ salons ” are paid for by corporations and focused on a public - policy issue in which the corporate sponsor has a major stake .
It offers the following “ sampling of salon dinner sponsors and topics ” : AstraZeneca on “ Healthcare Access and Education ”
Microsoft on “ Global Trade , ”
GE on “ Energy Sustainability and the Future of Nuclear Power ”
Allstate on “ The Future of the American City ”
Citi on “ The Challenge of Global Markets ” Hooper declined to say how much these corporations put up to sponsor the events .
And just as with the Post , the Atlantic dinners are strictly off - the - record , and not open to the public .
The flier describes them as : Private , custom , off - the - record conversations of 20 - 30 key influential individuals , moderated by an Atlantic editor , designed to bring a thoughtful group together for unbounded conversation on key issues of the day .
From birth , Megan McArdle has been the beneficiary of public funds : taxes paid for her upbringing , paid her father to venture into a corruption - ridden business world based on using public money for private gain , and paid her wages in her first breakthrough job .
Her response is to revile government intervention as an employee of the most notoriously corrupt magazine on the market .
It goes a long way to explaining so many of her attacks — including her failed attempt to discredit an article I co-wrote earlier this year , an article which exposed the stealth role her fiancee ’s former employer at FreedomWorks played in setting up the Tea Party protests .
Back then , I and many of Megan ’s readers demanded she account for this blatant conflict - of - interest and breach of basic journalism ethics — defending her future - fiancee ’s ex-employer by trying to discredit another journalist ’s investigation ( which proved correct , I should add ) .
At the time , last March , I wrote to Megan ’s editor at Atlanticmonthly.com , Ben Cohn , asking him if the Atlantic Monthly barred its writers from covering subjects in which the writer had a clear conflict - of - interest .
Cohn ’s answer to me was a bizarre evasion : he instead answered a critique I never leveled about transparency , avoiding my question about conflict - of - interest :
I ’ve looked carefully at her post and find that the disclosure of her relationship with Peter Suderman , which was right there in the original item , was clear and forthright .
Transparency is an important value for us , and I see every evidence of transparency in Megan ’s work here .
I did n’t ask Ben Cohn about transparency , I asked about conflict - of - interest .
So I followed up with a second email insisting he tell me what the Atlantic ‘s editorial policy is on conflict - of - interest issues .
He never replied .
Now we know : conflict - of - interest is the very basis of the Atlantic Monthly ‘s business model .
And rank hypocrisy and Marie Antoinette privilege is the basis of the Megan McArdle ideology , in which we ’re supposed to swallow free market solutions , while she basks in the comfort of taxpayer - subsidized privilege .
So when it comes to health care , Megan McArdle has the worst solution of all , a solution designed to protect her privilege : inaccessible free market innovations for us , and corruption on the taxpayer dime for Megan and her brood .
Remember this the next time Megan McArdle defends the corrupt and broken system that ’s worked so well for her , and so disastrously for the rest of us .

The White House described Baitullah Mehsud as " a murderous thug " A close associate of Pakistan 's most wanted man , Baitullah Mehsud , who was reportedly killed in a US drone attack , has told the BBC he is alive .
Commander Hakimullah Mehsud said reports of the Taliban leader 's death three days ago in an attack on a house in South Waziristan were " ridiculous " .
The US said on Friday it was increasingly confident its forces had managed to kill Mr Mehsud .
Neither side has provided evidence to back up their claims so far .
Pakistan 's foreign minister said on Friday he was " pretty certain " Baitullah Mehsud had been killed .
But Commander Hakimullah Mehsud - who some analysts suggest may be positioning himself to succeed Baitullah Mehsud - told the BBC the reports of his death were the work of US and Pakistani intelligence agencies .
" The news regarding our respected chief is propaganda by our enemies , " he said .
" We know what our enemies want to achieve - it's the joint policy of the [ Pakistani intelligence service ] ISI and FBI - they want our chief to come out in the open so they can achieve their target . "
He said the Pakistani leader had decided to adopt the tactics of Osama bin Laden and stay silent .
He said he would issue a message in the next few days .
' Safer '
The missile fired by the US drone hit the home of the Taliban chief 's father - in - law , Malik Ikramuddin , in the Zangarha area , 15 km ( 9 miles ) north - east of Ladha , at around 0100 on Wednesday ( 1900 GMT Tuesday ) .
On Friday , another of Baitullah Mehsud 's aides told the Associated Press by telephone that his leader had been killed along with his second wife in the attack .
The White House spokesman , Robert Gibbs , described Baitullah Mehsud as " a murderous thug " , saying the Pakistani people would be safer if he was dead .
" There seems to be a growing consensus among credible observers that he is indeed dead , " he told reporters .
South Waziristan is a stronghold of the Taliban chief , who declared himself leader in late 2007 , grouping together some 13 factions in the northwest of the country .
Believed to command as many as 20,000 pro-Taliban militants , he came to worldwide attention in the aftermath of the 2007 Red Mosque siege in Islamabad - in which the security forces confronted and forcibly ejected militant students who were mostly loyal to him .
He has been blamed by both Pakistan and the US for a series of suicide bomb attacks in the country , as well as suicide attacks on Western forces across the border in Afghanistan .

The temporary structure , a centrepiece of the 100th anniversary celebrations of the publication of Daniel Burnham and Edward Bennett ’s groundbreaking plan for the American city , was nearly two months late when it was opened in early August .
Delays were caused by complications with the pavilion ’s manufacture - the structure is made of 7,000 pieces of aluminum covered in a skin of fabric - as well as the replacement of the contractor .
Meanwhile a ‘ sister ’ Burnham pavilion by Ben van Berkel and UNStudio had to be ‘ pulled for repairs ’ due to excessive wear and tear .

‘ Too complicated ’ Zaha Chicago pavilion delayed yet again
Already behind schedule , Chicago pavilion suffers further setback as current contractor is replaced
As a result , at least six weeks of its four - and - a - half month public display have been lost .
The pavilion was one of two contemporary structures designed to mark the 100th anniversary of Daniel Burnham and Edward Bennett ’s plan of Chicago , and the leaders of the Burnham Plan Centennial Committee have been left sorely disappointed .
Fabric Images has now replaced TenFab Design as contractor .
The structure will be made up of 7,000 pieces of aluminum covered in a skin of fabric - the intricate design proving too much of a challenge for TenFab .
‘ We ’re pleased that we ’re able to find somebody local who could take it over and still give us a good part of the summer and fall .
It does n’t close until the end of October , ’ said Emily Harris , executive director of the Burnham Plan Centennial Committee .

Harris said the contract with Fabric Images calls for completion by 1 August , with penalties to be extracted if delays occur .
Rove Implicated in Prosecutor Firings Political adviser Karl Rove and other officials inside George W. Bush ’s White House pushed for the firing of a key federal prosecutor because he was n’t cooperating with Republican plans for indicting Democrats and their allies before the 2006 election , according to internal documents and depositions .
Email

The evidence , which House Judiciary Committee chairman John Conyers released Tuesday and turned over to a special prosecutor , contradicts claims by Rove and other senior Bush administration officials that the White House played only a minimal role in the firing of David Iglesias and eight other U.S. Attorneys , who were deemed by a Justice Department official as not “ loyal Bushies . ”
In a recent interview with the New York Times and Washington Post , Rove downplayed his role in the firings , saying he only acted as a “ conduit ” for complaints that Republican Party officials and GOP lawmakers sent to him about the federal prosecutors .
But the documents tell a different story .
The documents reveal that Rove , his White House aides and then - White House counsel Harriet Miers actively participated in the decision to oust New Mexico U.S. Attorney Iglesias because Republicans wanted him to bring charges against Democrats regarding alleged voter fraud and other issues .
According to Miers ’s closed - door testimony to the House Judiciary Committee , a “ very agitated ” Rove phoned her from New Mexico , apparently in September 2006 , and told her that Iglesias was “ a serious problem and he wanted something done about it . ”
At the time of the phone call , Rove had just met with New Mexico Republican Party officials angry at Iglesias , who was refusing to proceed with voter fraud cases because he felt the evidence was weak and because pre-election indictments would violate Justice Department guidelines .
Miers said she responded to Rove ’s call by getting on the phone to Deputy Attorney General Paul McNulty and passing along the message that Rove " is getting lots of complaints . "
Miers added , " it was a problem . "
About one month later , Iglesias was added to the list of U.S. Attorneys to be removed .
But the documents show that White House dissatisfaction with Iglesias over his resistance to bringing politically motivated cases against Democrats had been building for more than a year .
On June 28 , 2005 , Scott Jennings , one of Rove ’s aides , sent an e-mail to Tim Griffin , another Rove aide , asking what could be done to remove Iglesias .
“ I would really like to move forward with getting rid of NM US ATTY , ” Jennings wrote , complaining that “ Iglesias has done nothing ” on prosecuting voter fraud cases and adding : “ We ’re getting killed out there . ” ‘ Driving Force ’
In a statement on Tuesday , accompanying release of more than 5,000 pages of documents , including transcripts of the recent interviews with Rove and Miers , Conyers said the revelations warrant further inspection by special prosecutor Nora Dannehy , who has spent nearly a year conducting a criminal probe into the firings .
" After all the delay and despite all the obfuscation , lies , and spin , this basic truth can no longer be denied : Karl Rove and his cohorts at the Bush White House were the driving force behind several of these firings , which were done for improper reasons , ” Conyers said .
A Justice Department watchdog report concluded last year that a majority of the prosecutor firings were politically motivated .
The U.S. Attorney in Little Rock , Arkansas , was pushed out , so Rove 's aide , Tim Griffin , could be given the job .
But -- in the face of the growing scandal -- Griffin bowed out .
For months , Rove and Miers had dodged congressional subpoenas seeking their testimony in the matter , citing George W. Bush ’s broad claims of executive privilege .
But the Obama administration brokered a deal that had Rove and Miers testify behind closed doors .
Besides the Bush White House pressure for ousting Iglesias , powerful New Mexico Republicans also weighed in .
In October 2006 , a month before the midterm elections that cost Republicans control of the Congress , an e-mail chain started by Rep. Heather Wilson , R - New Mexico , faulted Iglesias for not using his office in a manner that would help Wilson in her reelection campaign .
Wilson ’s e-mail included a news report about an FBI probe of Rep. Curt Weldon , R - Pennsylvania , as an example of criminal investigations proceeding close to election day .
Steve Bell , chief of staff to New Mexico Sen .
Pete Domenici , forwarded the e-mail to Jennings at Rove ’s White House shop , with a note , saying it " seems like other U.S. attorneys can do their work even in election season .
And the FBI has already admitted they have turned over their evidence [ in a federal corruption probe ] to the [ U.S. Attorney ] in [ New Mexico ] and are merely awaiting his action . "
Jennings then passed along the e-mail to Rove , saying Iglesias was “ shy about doing his job on [ Patricia ] Madrid , ” a Democratic congressional candidate who would lose the 2006 election to Wilson by only 800 votes .
Last year , Wilson told Justice Department watchdogs investigating the U.S. Attorney purge that the context of her e-mail was more of a " heads up " to the recipients .
She said that if she were asked by reporters about an FBI investigation into Madrid , she would confirm it .
Madrid was New Mexico's former attorney general who was involved with a political action committee that was allegedly under scrutiny .
Domenici ’s Intervention Domenici also intervened , personally lobbying Bush ’s top aides to fire Iglesias , according to the documents .
Between September 2005 and April 2006 , Domenici called Attorney General Alberto Gonzales three times to complain about Iglesias ’s handling of voter fraud and corruption probes and to ask that he be fired .
Gonzales testified to Congress that he did not recall Domenici ever making such a request .
Gonzales resigned in August 2007 amid the political fallout from the prosecutor - firing scandal .
On Oct. 4 , 2006 , Domenici also called Deputy Attorney General McNulty “ expressing concern about Iglesias ’s lack of fitness for the job of U.S. Attorney . ”
At one point , according to Rove ’s testimony , Domenici wanted to speak with President Bush to press his case , but Rove talked him out of it .
However , in October 2006 , the senator personally asked Bush ’s chief of staff Josh Bolten to replace Iglesias , according to White House phone logs and e-mails .
In congressional testimony , Iglesias said he also received telephone calls from Domenici and Wilson in October 2006 inquiring about the timing of an indictment against former state senator Manny Aragon , a Democrat , and other Democrats who were involved in a courthouse construction project .
Domenici ’s interventions prompted a Senate Ethics Committee investigation , which resulted last year in a letter of reprimand for creating an “ appearance of impropriety . ”
Special prosecutor Dannehy is probing possible obstruction of justice charges against Domenici and his former aide Bell .
Dannehy secured the testimony last April of Scott O’Neal , the assistant FBI special agent in charge of the Albuquerque field office , who reportedly informed Domenici or his aide Bell about the status of the FBI ’s investigation of alleged Democratic wrongdoing , according to legal sources who requested anonymity because of the secrecy surrounding the probe .
In an interview , former U.S. Attorney Iglesias said the briefing to Domenici and / or Bell , if it did take place , would be significant because it would have required approval from himself or his former colleagues who never received a formal request from O’Neal or his FBI superiors .
The U.S. Attorney ’s manual states that “ personnel of the Department of Justice shall not respond to questions about the existence of an ongoing investigation or comment on its nature or progress , including such things as the issuance or serving of a subpoena , prior to the public filing of the document . ”
Rove ’s Fingerprints
Regarding Tuesday ’s revelations , Iglesias said he had long suspected that Rove ’s “ fingerprints were all over this . ”
In an interview with me two years ago , Iglesias said he believed “ somewhere on an RNC computer – on some server somewhere – there ’s an e-mail from Karl Rove stating why we need to be axed . ”
He added that he believed a “ smoking gun ” would eventually surface and lead directly to Rove and blow the scandal wide open .
“ The e-mail timing [ in October 2006 ] corroborates what I suspected , ” Iglesias said Tuesday .
Domenici and other New Mexico Republican Party officials “ wanted me to file indictments and [ Wilson ] would benefit .
They wanted to use me and my office as a political tool . ”
Iglesias said Dannehy has access to “ a lot of the facts ” and “ there still may be obstruction of justice charges ” filed .
He added , “ I ca n’t believe Gonzales did not know what was going on , ” suggesting that the former attorney general may be one of Dannehy ’s targets .
Domenici retired from the Senate and Wilson also left Congress in 2009 after unsuccessfully seeking the Republican nomination to fill Domenici ’s seat , which is now held by Democratic Sen .
Tom Udall .
Deputy Attorney General McNulty testified before Congress in February 2007 that the prosecutor firings were “ performance related , ” though that testimony also now appears to be in question .
Documents released by the Justice Department showed that Gonzales and McNulty participated in an hour - long meeting with Gonzales ’s chief of staff Kyle Sampson , who compiled the list of prosecutors to be fired , a group he famously designated as not “ loyal Bushies . ”
The documents , along with Rove 's and Miers ’s testimony , contradict numerous public statements made by White House spokespersons Tony Snow and Dana Perino in the aftermath of the December 2006 firings .
Snow and Perino insisted that the White House did nothing wrong and did n't oust prosecutors for political reasons .
Yet , upon being informed in November 2006 via e-mail of the plan to fire the U.S Attorneys , Perino responded : “ Someone get me the oxygen can ! ”
When told the firings included some U.S. Attorneys who were actively investigating GOP lawmakers who were alleged to be involved in corruption , Perino added : “ Give me a double shot — I ca n’t breathe . ”
The newly released documents also show that Kansas City U.S. Attorney Todd Graves was removed in a deal between the White House and Sen. Kit Bond of Missouri that appears to have been personally approved by Rove .
According to the documents , Bond agreed to lift his hold on an Arkansas judge nominated to the Eighth Circuit federal appeals court in exchange for Graves ’s firing .
A White House e-mail sent to Miers stated that “ Karl is fine ” with the proposal .

VANCOUVER --
Thirteen years after Washington state 's environmental agency found a creek severely polluted , the contamination has been traced back to the agency 's regional office .
City workers discovered this week that a sewer line from the building housing the regional offices of the state Department of Ecology and Department of Fish and Game , and a small U.S. Army Corps of Engineers contingent , was mistakenly connected to a storm water runoff system , rather than a municipal sewer main .
As a result , sewage from the building has been entering Burnt Bridge Creek and eventually Vancouver Lake for an unknown number of years .
Workers in the leased offices were stunned when they got the word Wednesday , The Columbian newspaper reported .
" As a person who loves her area and the environment , it was like , ' Holy crap , let 's get this taken care of , ' " said Laura Sauermilch , a spill response specialist .
Jay J. Manning , Ecology director in Olympia , said the discovery was " embarrassing and upsetting . "
Employees immediately closed the men's and women 's restrooms , and portable toilets and hand - washing stations were brought to the site .
City officials have agreed to fix the problem at the building owner 's expense by next week .
In 1996 , the Ecology Department determined that Burnt Bridge Creek was severely polluted with fecal coliform bacteria .
For 21 / 2 years , city workers have been using a probe mounted with a small television camera to survey 300 miles of underground storm water pipes .
Municipal public works director Brian Carlson said this is the first time an old sanitary sewer has been found mistakenly hooked into a storm water pipe .
" The irony is not lost on us , " Carlson said .
State officials believe the problem dates from the opening of the building in the early 1970s as a garden center for a Fred Meyer outlet across the street .
The garden center was closed in the mid-1990s and in 1997 the building was reopened with offices for 80 Fish and Wildlife employees , 14 from Ecology and three from the Army engineers .
Melinda Merrill , a Fred Meyer spokeswoman in neighboring Portland , Ore. , said the retailer intends to cooperate in sharing information but no longer owns the property .
Local and state agencies have yet to sort out questions of legal liability and potential penalties , said Kim Schmanke , an Ecology spokeswoman in Lacey .
The current owner , Watumull Properties of Honolulu , just wants it fixed .
" I 'm just horrified , " said J.D. Watumull , company vice president .
" We 're just trying to get it rectified and back to the way it was . "

Oleg Kiselyov and Chung - chieh Shan. 2009 Workshop on Normalization by Evaluation .
Many loops in probabilistic inference map almost every individual in their domain to the same result .
Running such loops symbolically takes time sublinear in the domain size .
Using normalization by evaluation with first - class delimited continuations , we lift inference procedures to reap this speed - up without interpretive overhead .
To express nested loops , we use multiple control delimiters for metacircular interpretation .
To express loops over a powerset domain , we convert nested loops over a subset to unnested loops .
The paper is a bit hard to follow , but there are enough little tricks here to merit attentive reading .
Or better yet , read the code .
The basic PLT idea might be summed as doing abstract interpretation on a shallowly embedded DSL using delimited continuations .

â€ œStackedâ€ gene varieties are those containing GE traits for both herbicide tolerance ( HT ) and insect resistance ( Bt ) .
Table from ERS / USDA .
The inclusion of genetically engineered crops and feed additives in livestock and poultry feed , in pet foods , and directly into the human food chain , especially in processed foods and beverages containing corn and soy ingredients , is a major health concern for reasons that I will document .
Genetically engineered ( GE ) and genetically modified ( GM ) plants — â€ œFrankenfoodsâ€ to critics — contain artificially inserted genes from viruses , bacteria , other plant species , and insects , humans , and other animals .
This process can result in the production of entirely novel chemicals that were never before present in our foods or those of farmed and companion animals .
Alien gene insertion can cause a deficiency of normal nutrients in GE / GM crops , while other naturally occurring plant substances may become so concentrated as to become toxic .
GE plants are created primarily to increase their resistance to herbicides and insect pests .
Both the U.S. government and the multinational corporations patenting and selling these seeds of potential destruction to farmers to plant crops that go to human , pet food and livestock feed manufacturers would have us believe that GE crops and food ingredients are safe , and that to believe otherwise is to not trust in science and progress .
In 2006 , an estimated 136 million acres of U.S. cropland were used to grow GM crops .
Some 89 percent of soybeans and 61 percent of corn crops are now genetically engineered .
Canola is also genetically engineered , and vegetable oils ( canola and corn ) along with soy protein and lecithin , are used widely in a variety of prepared foods for people and their pets .
Genetically engineered sugar beet will soon be planted widely as a source of sugar for the food industry .
Beet pulp is a common ingredient in pet foods .
GM wheat is also on the horizon .
Commodity producers ’ adoption of GE crops in the United States , prohibited in many other countries , has been dramatic , according the U.S. Department of Agriculture ( see graph at top of article ) .
This adoption by contracted producers is not unexpected , since a handful of powerful pharmaceutical and agrichemical multinational corporations like Bayer and Monsanto , have gained a monopolistic control over the major commodity crop seed stocks , making available to farmers only their highly promoted , patented varieties of GE seeds .
Farmers then sell these commodities to livestock feed companies and to the food , beverage , candy , and cosmetic industries — companies like Mars , NestlÃ©. , Colgate - Palmolive , and Procter Gamble .
These four multinationals monopolize the pet food industry , selling such familiar and widely advertised brands as Hillâ€™s Science Diet , Purina , Pedigree , Iams , and Eukanuba .
It is no coincidence that pet health insurance plans are being marketed by one of these companies .
In essence , the mainstream pet food industry , a subsidiary of agribusiness , profitably recycles human food and beverage industry by - products , and livestock and poultry parts considered unfit for human consumption , into pet foods .
( For details see Not Fit For a Dog : The Truth About Manufactured Dog and Cat Food , reference below . )
Some of the Risks
Numerous issues and unanswered questions surround the safety of these GE / GM crops and foods .
In their recent review , Dona & Arvanitoyannis ( 2009 ) conclude , “ The results of most of the rather few studies conducted with GM foods indicate that they may cause hepatic , pancreatic , renal , and reproductive effects and may alter hematological , biochemical , and immunologic parameters the significance of which remains unknown .
The above results indicate that many GM foods have some common toxic effects .
Therefore , further studies should be conducted in order to elucidate the mechanism dominating this action .
Small amounts of ingested DNA may not be broken down under digestive processes and there is a possibility that this DNA may either enter the bloodstream or be excreted , especially in individuals with abnormal digestion as a result of chronic gastrointestinal disease or with immunodeficiency . ”
The insecticidal poison Bt ( Bacillus thuringiensis ) is present in most genetically engineered U.S. commodity crops that go into animal feed and pet foods .
High levels of Bt toxin in GM crops have made farmers ill and poisoned farm animals eating crop residues .
Bt toxin harms microorganisms in the soil vital to plant health , high levels being created when GM crop residues are mulched or ploughed into the soil .
Genetic material in GM herbicide - resistant soybeans can be transferred to bacteria in our digestive systems .
This means that foreign proteins could be manufactured in our own digestive systems by such bacteria , turning them into pesticide factories .
So called â€œoverexpressionâ€ can occur when spliced genes that manufacture chemicals such as Bt become hyperactive inside the plant and result in potentially toxic plant tissues .
These are lethal not just to meal worms and other crop pests , but also to , birds , butterflies , other wildlife , and possibly to humans and their pets .
The herbicides glufosinate and glyphosate are liberally applied across the U.S. and in many other countries to millions of acres of crops genetically engineered to be resistant to these herbicides .
These poisons are actually absorbed by the crops , while all else growing in the fields and much of the surrounding aquatic life in rivers and lakes , are wiped out .
These widely used herbicides and additives therein have caused kidney damage and other health problems in animals , can cause endocrine disruption and birth defects in frogs and is lethal to many amphibians .
Glyphosate has been linked with non-Hodgkin lymphoma , miscarriages and premature births in humans .
These herbicides and other agrichemicals , along with the insecticide Bt , are found in pet foods and the crops and crop by - products fed to cattle , pigs , poultry , and dairy cows .
Many nutritionists and health experts are linking the rise in human food allergies — skin problems and inflammatory / irritable bowel syndromes — to the increased consumption of GM foods and food additives , especially genetically engineered soy products that contain novel proteins .
The high incidence of skin and food allergies , and other suspected allergies associated with digestive disorders and inflammatory bowel disease in dogs and cats may well be caused or aggravated by these novel proteins and other chemical contaminants in GM crop byproducts .
I have seen a dramatic increase in these problems over the past decade in the thousands of letters I receive from cat and dog owners who read my syndicated newspaper column Animal Doctor .
It is surely no coincidence that the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported , in October 2008 , an 18 percent increase in allergies in children under the age of 18 between the years 1997 and 2007 .
Some 3 million children now suffer from food or digestive allergies , with symptoms including vomiting , skin rashes , and breathing problems .
They take longer to outgrow milk and egg allergies and show a doubling of adverse reactions to peanuts .
Almost every independent animal feeding safety study has shown adverse or unexplained effects of GM foods , including : Inflammation and abnormal cell growth ( possibly pre-cancerous ) in the stomach and small intestines ; abnormal development , inflammation , and cellular changes in the liver , kidney , testicles , heart , pancreas , brain ; and poor growth and higher mortalities than normal .
Researchers have found that unlike conventionally bred crops , GM varieties are intrinsically unstable and prone to spontaneous mutations .
When mutations occur , you can never know if what is being grown , harvested , processed , and consumed is really safe and nutritious .
The inserted genes can have unforeseen consequences , so - called multiple pleiotropic effects .
These unpredictable consequences of introducing a new genetic trait or quality include alterations in existing gene function and relationships with other genes .
A dramatic example of this in animals is in the genetically engineered pigs that were created to carry human growth genes at the U.S. governmentâ€™s research facility in Beltsville , Md .
These pigs became crippled , suffering from multiple health problems including arthritis and bone - growth deformities , and had impaired immune and reproductive systems .
Multiple pleiotropic effects in GM soy include excesses of certain phytoestrogens , and the presence of anti-nutrient substances , some of which could be a consequence of genomic interaction with mutagenic agrichemicals compounded by the poor nutrition ( and nutritive value ) of conventionally grown , rather than organically grown , crops .
GM seeds are genetically unstable because they are more prone than normal to undergo spontaneous mutations .
This can mean that GM crops could produce novel , harmful proteins , excessive , even toxic amounts of normal nutrients , or become extremely deficient in same : Spontaneous mutations = genetic roulette .
The delicate bacterial balance in the digestive systems of man and beast alike is disrupted by herbicide food residues and possibly by the mutagenic , unknown consequences of transgenic DNA segments ( from the genes of all GM foods ) becoming incorporated into the bacterial DNA .
My advice to consumers and pet owners alike is to look for the USDA Organic certification label on foods , since the government has resisted attempts to have GE / GM products appropriately labeled .
Read the labels on prepared foods and avoid those that contain corn and soy products ( including cooking oils ) , since these are most likely to have come from GE / GM crops .
Corn and soy ingredients have no place in pet foods , especially in cat foods , even if they are from conventional , non-GE / GM varieties , because of their association with a variety of health problems in companion animals .
These include allergies , skin problems , periodontal disease , inflammatory bowel disease , and cystitis .
But they are widely used because of their low cost as cheap sources of calories and protein .
( See discussion and references at Advocacy for Animals , “ Conflicts of Interest in the Veterinary Profession . ” )
Organically certified foods of both animal and plant origin contain more essential nutrients , notably antioxidants , than conventionally grown produce , and of course cause less environmental harms and are pesticide and GE / GM free .

It must be creative pipe week here at Gizmodo , because people keep sending in their awesome creations .
And this might be the best one yet : a functioning TI - 83 calculator with a pipe built into it .
In high school , I made a pipe out of a TI - 83 Plus calculator .
the calculator still works , even now , as well as the pipe .
Even though the tube is made of duct tape , it works fine .
I cut into the bowl itself so it can be flat and still allow airflow , and put another piece of metal under it so the tape will not heat up .
The stem can be separated and placed into the calculator to be more hidden .
Inside the calculator , there are also compartments for matches , toothpicks ( pokers ) , and screens .
There is also enough room on the inside for a small bag of whatever is going to be smoked .
It has been named the TI - 420 Tokeulator .

It 's hard to avoid the sense that Mr. Obama has wasted months trying to appease people who can't be appeased , and who take every concession as a sign that he can be rolled .
Indeed , no sooner were there reports that the administration might accept co-ops as an alternative to the public option than G.O.P. leaders announced that co-ops , too , were unacceptable .
Only a few hours left to Double your gift
Editor ’s note :
This post originally focused on NPR ; but we ’ve since found that the Monsanto ads run on Marketplace , produced by American Public Media , which is n’t directly affiliated with NPR .
We regret the confusion .
For years my alarm has been set to public radio so I can lie in bed for five minutes and have a grasp on the day ’s news before I even get up .
I , like many other Americans , rely on NPR and other public - radio shows for news that is what I deem to be as unbiased and fair as possible .
But this morning my ears burned as I listened to an on the American Public Media show Marketplace sponsored by Monsanto , the world ’s largest corporate agribusiness chemical firm , touting how its genetically modified ( GM ) seeds are going to save the world from environmental catastrophe and human hunger .
It left me wondering , particularly in tough economic times , how do media ethics hold up ?
( The GMO seed giant has been bombarding liberal - minded publications with similar propaganda , see image to the right , for months . )
The Monsanto ads are quite simply false .
The premise of the ad is more or less that Monsanto ’s genetically modified ( GM ) seeds are going to save the world from environmental catastrophe and human hunger .
All while the corporation made more than 11 billion dollars in 2008 amidst a world food crisis .
The catch phrase , “ Produce more , conserve more ” even has its own website , which conveniently links directly to Monsanto ’s website section on “ sustainable agriculture ” .
But the reality of Monsanto ’s seeds and the company ’s ethics and commitment to fighting world hunger have nothing to do with producing more or conserving more .
Let ’s get a few facts on the table .
Eighty - five percent of all GM seeds are engineered for herbicide tolerance .
Most of these crops are Monsanto ’s “ Roundup Ready ” cotton , corn , soy , and canola seeds .
What this tolerance means is that the plant can actually withstand significant amounts of pesticides being sprayed on it–in effect promoting pesticide use .
In the past farmers were motivated to spray judiciously since their crops could be adversely affected .
Farmers growing GM seeds do n’t worry about this , and as a result there has been an increase in pesticide use in the United States since the introduction of GM seeds .
The most comprehensive independent research done utilizing USDA data demonstrates that since the introduction of GM crops in the United States , more than 120 million pounds of additional pesticides were used .
This seems to be a growing trend as well , as the active ingredient in Roundup Ready crops–glyphosate–s becoming less efficient and creating scores of resistant weeds , resulting in increased use .
Help Grist raise $ 20,000 by 9/30 .
Just click the image above ☝️
In 2008 Monsanto ’s total sales for Roundup and other glyphosate - based herbicides was more than $ 4 billion –up 59 percent from 2007 .
Perhaps more importantly , its gross profit from such sales was nearly 2 billion dollars - up 131 % from 2007 .
So , what is Monsanto conserving more of ?
Certainly not biodiversity , human health , wildlife , pollinators or the soil , which are all adversely affected by pesticide use .
The claims of “ producing more ” that Monsanto touts in the NPR ads are also completely unfounded .
Not a single GM crop has been commercially introduced that is intended to increase yield .
Agronomists and plant scientists made far greater advances in yields through conventional breeding methods in the 20th century than they ever have with GM crops .
In fact , there have been several studies which show that there are actually yield losses associated with Monsanto ’s Roundup Ready soybeans .
What biotech companies have been effective at doing is crafting media messages that persuade the average person to believe that their crops increase yield and that without GM crops we simply could n’t feed the world .
In fact , GM crops account for less than 3 % of total agricultural acreage globally .
Five countries in North and South America account for more than 90 % of total global acreage , with the United States , Argentina and Brazil making up 80 % of total global GM crop acreage .
In Africa , only two countries - South Africa and Burkina Faso - allow the commercial planting of GM crops , which are minimally grown .
Less than 3 % of the cropland in India and China is planted with GM crops , and in India most of that is cotton - not food .
This leads me to my next point - four cash crops - soy , maize , cotton and canola make up almost 100 % of GM crops planted worldwide .
Of these commodity crops , most are used to make biofuels , processed foods , animal feed , and vegetable oils - they are not fed directly to people in their whole form .
The bottom line ?
GM crops are not feeding the world , and they are not enabling us to produce more .
Perhaps the most important consideration for Monsanto ’s ads on Marketplace is the unethical implications behind their words .
They want us to believe their crops are feeding hungry children in Africa and that they are allowing farmers to use fewer chemicals .
But their actions demonstrate that their concern lies otherwise - in their profits .
In 2008 , the International Assessment of Agricultural Knowledge , Science and Technology for Development ( IAASTD ) a global group of scientists , NGOs , private sector officials , and country governments initiated by the World Bank and the United Nations released its long awaited report , “ Agriculture at a Crossroads ” .
The report painted a grim picture for food security and described the harsh reality of the challenges that agriculture and food systems must overcome to ensure food security in the future .
What made the IAASTD report so groundbreaking was its unprecedented questioning of the role of GM crops to aid in food security and environmental improvement .
IAASTD authors paraphrased the conclusions of the report in Science stating , “ The assessment found GM crops appropriate in some contexts , unpromising in others , and unproven in many more .
No conclusive evidence was found that GM crops have so far offered solutions to the broader socioeconomic dilemmas faced by developing countries . ”
This was certainly not the golden ticket for GM crops that Monsanto hoped for from the IAASTD .
So , what did they do ?
They bailed .
The failure of biotech corporations to influence the IAASTD led Monsanto and Syngenta to withdraw from meetings and collaboration just a few months before the final release of their report .
According to the journal Nature , which published a story on the issue titled “ Deserting the Hungry ? ” , such actions resulted after drafts devoted more space to biotechnology ’s risk than its benefits and failed to recognize that GM crops produced higher yields .
In a year with unprecedented world hunger , Monsanto pulled out of the most comprehensive international attempts to examine the problems and solutions of the situation .
And , they made 11 billion dollars the same year , mostly from their Roundup chemicals and biotech seeds - both which they increased in price at the height of a global food crisis .
So , producing more and conserving more , or deserting the hungry ?
I encourage American Public Media and all other news media services to think about their principles , ethics , and mission statements and consider applying these principles to the ads they are running .

Based in Charlotte , we represent clients in communities such as Gastonia , Monroe , Concord , Kannapolis , Hickory , Winston - Salem and Fayetteville .
With more than 35 years of legal experience , Paul Hefferon has a well - earned reputation for plain talk , aggressive representation and outstanding results .
Providing Skilled Representation in Injury and Accident Claims
Our law firm represents people who have suffered catastrophic injuries in all types of accidents , including :
Our experience has taught us that in order to give our clients the best possible chance to reach a successful result , we must be fully prepared to take a case before a jury .
To that end , our lawyers have successfully settled thousands of cases and tried more than two hundred jury trials involving life - changing personal injuries .
We also provide compassionate representation to families who tragically lost loved ones in wrongful death accidents .
If we accept your case , you can depend on our attorneys to seek the maximum amount of compensation to cover pain and suffering , lost wages and medical bills associated with the accident .
In addition to our personal injury practice , we have extensive background helping clients resolve business , real estate and estate disputes .
We also represent clients who have been victims of professional malpractice such as legal malpractice or construction malpractice .
There is a long list of expenses that can pile up when you sustain an injury resulting from an auto accident , workplace incident or slip and fall .
And when someone else is responsible for that injury , they need to be held responsible .
That means having them pay for all the expenses incurred as a result of your injury and that goes beyond just the medical costs .
Here is a look at some of the additional expenses that we help you get covered after you have sustained an injury of a personal nature .
Rehabilitation cost
Lost wages
Inability to perform prior work duties
Diminished quality of life
Pain and suffering
If you experience any of those occurrences , we can help get you compensation .
This may help ease your life as you attempt to transition back to the way it was prior to sustaining your injury , or injuries .
Motor Vehicle Accident Lawyer
One of the most common reasons to hire an injury lawyer is to deal with auto accident cases .
One of the most integral parts of these personal cases is how to deal with insurance companies .
The team of attorneys at Hefferon Law has years of expertise in dealing with all different insurance companies .
It is important to know that these insurance companies are not looking out for your best interest and they frequently utilize tactics with the intention of paying out as little compensation as possible .
This is where you need a lawyer fighting for to get you the most compensation possible for your injury .
With an injury lawyer at Hefferon Law by your side , you can be assured that insurance companies will not be able to take advantage of you .
We are well aware of their methods and know precisely how to counter .
And in the aftermath of a motor vehicle accident , there are specific steps to take .
One of our personal attorneys can walk you through that process to ensure every facet is accounted for .
Workplace Accident Lawyer
The most common type of injury sustained in the workplace is a slip and fall .
However , there are a variety of other reasons that cause workers to become injured .
Workers may be hit with a falling objector suffer from repetitive motion injuries .
Workers do not have to be employed at a construction site or be around heavy machinery to experience a workplace accident .
This is why it is important to have a lawyer who understands the personal nature of your workplace injury .
Hefferon Law has represented workers in all types of professions as none are completely safe from the threat of injury .
We will work to get you the highest amount of compensation for your injury .
Premises Liability Lawyer
A slip and fall on someone else ’s property is not always a reason to file a lawsuit .
However , there are plenty of instances when a slip and fall does result in the filing of a lawsuit .
But it is up to you to prove that a property owner was at fault for your injury .
Hefferon Law can help prove your case by showing that the faulty party is the owner or controller of the area where you sustained an injury and that he / she was negligent .
When those factors are working in your favor , you may be entitled to sizeable compensation .
Here is a look at some legitimate reasons for filing and winning a premises liability lawsuit .
Faulty stairs or absence of railings
Lack of security
No “ wet floor ” signs posted
Unlabeled hole in ground
Building code violations
Ice on sidewalks
Insufficient wiring
Falling object
Floor gives out or ceiling collapses

This is what the neocon right believe in , even as they prattle on about extending human rights as an American value .
They say they believe in democracy .
What they also believe in is what we saw done to innocent human beings at Abu Ghraib :
Nudity .
The HVD 's clothes are taken from him and he remains nude until the interrogators provide clothes to him .
Sleep deprivation .
The HVD is placed in the vertical shackling position to begin sleep deprivation .
Other shackling procedures may be used during interrogations .
The detainee is diapered for sanitary purposes , although the diaper is not used at all times .
The diapers are necessary because when you shackle someone in the same position for hours and hours on end and feed him Ensure , he will shit himself .
All torturing regimes deal with shitting torture victims .
The US followed other regimes in both diapering prisoners or , better still , forcing them to lie in their own excrement , as was discovered by horrified FBI agents at Gitmo .
Other torture regimes capture piss and shit in bowls beneath the torture victims .
Various forms of nude shackling , sleep deprivation and dietary manipulation ( all barred under Geneva and the UN Convention ) are then supplemented by constant bombardment with light , loud noise , water - dousing and walling .
These techniques can be used in combination .
Some more details :
An HVD may be walled one time to make a point or twenty to thirty times when an interrogator requires a more significant response to a question .
In an interrogation designed to be intense , an HVD may be walled multiple times in one session ...
Current OMS guidance on cramped confinement limits confinement in the large box to 8 hours at a time for no more than 18 hours a day and confinement in the small box to two hours ...
Interrogators will often use one technique to support another .
As an example , interrogators would tell an HVD in a stress position that he [ HVD ] is going back to the walling wall for walling if he fails to hold the stress position until told otherwise by the HVD .
This places additional stress on the HVD who will typically try to hold the stress position for as long as possible to avoid the walling wall .
John McCain will remember these techniques and variants of them from his time in the Hanoi Hilton .
If this is not torture , then torture does not exist .
And if this is America , and there is no accountability for these war crimes , then core American values have ceased to exist as well .

The Pros and Cons of Falling Down a Flight of Stairs
The negatives of falling down a flight of stairs are well - documented .
You could break your neck , for instance , and maybe die .
Or you might hit your head on the edge of a step , and go full - vegetable .
Or you could snap your sternum , blow a lung , or mash a kidney .
And even if you ’re lucky enough to escape serious injury , the damage to your home can be significant .
If , say , you go cannonballing down the basement steps and your skull gets driven straight through a credenza and section of drywall , you ’re looking at several hundreds of dollars in repair costs .
So , on balance , it ’s NEVER a good idea to fall down a flight of stairs .
However , there are some benefits which rarely get mentioned .
By acknowledging the positives , I believe , many experts are afraid they ’ll be accused of endorsing the activity .
Of course , that is not our intent .
It is our strong opinion that safely navigating stairs , escalators , and ramps is always the most prudent course of action .
However , we ’re going to go where few will tread , and list some of the pros of falling down a flight of stairs .
‘ Cause that ’s the way we roll .
… Get it ?
Lose weight Cascading down a flight of stairs burns approximately five times as many calories as walking the same route .
The muscles tend to tighten and flex , in anticipation of the searing pain they know is right around the corner , and the exercise is beneficial .
If the tumbling body happens to take out a length of banister , it could burn as much as ten times the normal number of calories !
And that , I ’m sure you ’ll agree , is significant .
So , theoretically , a person could greatly ratchet - up his or her weight - loss campaign by going to a large government building , or perhaps a lighthouse , and repeatedly hurling their bulk down the stairs .
Move faster A person falling down the steps moves at a higher rate of speed than their upright cousins .
They cover more ground , in less time .
And time is money !
Indeed , it could be argued that an employee who routinely goes end - over - end down a long flight of stairs is more conscientious and focused on the bottom line than the average worker .
Falling down stairs can be a boost to your career !
You might consider it the next time you attend a job interview , or are vying for a promotion .
It could very well provide the extra edge you need in today ’s highly competitive market .
Organizations are always looking for go - getters !
And few things set a person apart from the crowd like stumbling around an office , falling down stairs , and leaving the competition in the dust .
Gain attention Many people are excruciatingly dull .
They ’re plain - looking , are n’t very witty , and have interests and opinions that are predictable and boring .
This is an unfortunate fact .
But the moment they go down a flight of stairs , and blow a hole in the side of their neck ( or whatever ) , they become interesting .
Crowds form around them , they ’re the absolute center of attention , and the “ victim ” almost always receives an enormous amount of sympathy .
Depending on the severity of the injuries , this attention can last for several day , or even weeks .
For the excruciatingly dull , this can be the most glorious time of their life !
Better dentistry
Most insurance companies will not pay for elective procedures .
But if you go crashing down a flight of stairs and break all your teeth off at the stumps , you ’ll have a new set of chompers in no time .
And at bargain prices , too !
Expand your mind A sharp blow to the head is almost always a negative .
But in rare cases it can unlock previously unrealized potential .
Take , for instance , the remarkable case of one Jonas Salk .
All his life he ’d been a day - laborer , moving from one physically demanding job to the next .
He ’d picked bananas , painted houses , and sucked cess .
By his own admission he was n’t the most ambitious person in the world .
Years later he would write a memoir of those years , and used one of his favorite phrases from the era as the title : Fuck It .
But one day in 1938 Jonas Salk was walking along reading a newspaper , not paying close attention , and fell down some cellar steps .
He hit his head on a cinder block that morning — and went on to cure polio !
This is a rare occurrence , of course , but illustrates the fact that a head injury sustained during a fall down a flight of stairs does n’t necessarily have to be a bad thing .
… Sometimes it can change the world .
So , you see , falling down a flight of stairs is n’t ALL bad .
There ’s a definite upside to it , which is rarely covered in the media .
Today we ’ve only touched on a few examples , and perhaps you can think of more ?
Use the comments link to tell us how a person could very well benefit from violently crashing down a full flight of stairs .
Not that we ’re endorsing it , of course .

District 9 asks us to imagine that a massive interstellar spaceship might show up and park itself over not the usual New York or Washington , D.C. , location , but over Johannesburg .
The aliens are a cross between humans , insects and crustaceans .
Wary earthlings quickly dub them " prawns " and isolate them in the festering shantytown of District 9 .
Twenty years pass , during which crime and squalor soar in District 9 while humans practice a sort of alien apartheid .
The movie is directed and co-written by the South African filmmaker Neill Blomkamp and shot in Johannesburg and the New Zealand studios of producer Peter Jackson .
( You may remember him as the director of the Lord of the Rings movie trilogy . )
Jackson had originally picked Blomkamp to direct the movie version of Halo .
Will I like it ?
District 9 has a great story , action and special effects .
The movie also draws a picture of race , military contractors and humanity colliding in a bad way .
Using the big test for parents , was it worth getting a babysitter to see the movie ?
Yes .
Will my kids like it ?
It 's Rated R for bloody violence and pervasive language .
Keep the little geeklets far away .
If you let your teenagers see violent action movies , then they would be Ok with this .
Are there any big name actors in the movie ?
None .
This was a small budget movie .
( I heard it cost $ 30 million to make . )
It looks like all of that was put into special effects and action sequences .
It seems like little of the budget was spent on camera mounts .
Will I get motion sickness ?
Most of movie was shot using handheld cameras .
That means lots of jerky movements .
I appreciated the visual impact of the camera movements during some sequences .
It got stomach wrenching after a while , leaving that giant Slushee uncomfortable in my belly .
They really should have spent some of that budget on a few more camera mounts .
But what about Halo ?
Blomkamp was originally supposed to direct the big - screen version of the hit game Halo .
Jackson was going to produce the movie .
That fell apart .
District 9 is Blomkamp 's consolation prize for losing the movie .
If you want to get an idea of what that might have looked like you can see a short video of a Halo combat sequence that he put together .
It 's really good .
Do I need to sit through the credits for some sort of bonus at the end ?
As you might expect there is a long list of special effects people in the end credits .
It seems like they must have employed half of the population of New Zealand .
The ending of the movie leaves you wondering if there might be a little extra coming .
But there is n't anything .
Are there any good trailers ?
The trailers were mediocre .
The Final Destination – been there , done that .
Legion – looks promising with a combination of Tremors and The Seventh Sign .
Jennifer 's Body – Megan Fox as an evil demon .
Law Abiding Citizen – vigilante torture porn .
* 9 * – promising animated apocalypse movie from Tim Burton , sort of Wall - E meets The Terminator .
What ’s the best time for a bathroom break ?
There is a short lull after an hour .
It comes shortly after a big reveal by an alien and his son .
RunPee.com has a recommendation to go after 49 minutes .
Will I want to see it again ?
There was a lot going on , with vivid imagery .
You will want to see * District 9 * again .
After your stomach settles back down .
Earlier this month , we reported that Debian had announced a new release schedule ; a freeze during December , a release some time in the first half of the following year .
After outcries from the Debian community , the December freeze aspect of the plan was reversed .
Since most of the ire about this situation seemed to be directed towards Ubuntu , Mark Shuttleworth decided to step in and offer to put several Canonical employees to work on Debian instead of Ubuntu .
A lot of the ire within the Debian community about the release cycle decision seems to stem from a “ Ubuntu vs. Debian ” mentality that only works to the detriment of both projects .
In an email to the debian - project mailing list , Shuttleworth detailed why coordinating releases between not only Debian and Ubuntu , but also upstream and other distributions , can only work to better the Linux ecosystem .
“ We ’re already seeing a growing trend towards cadence in free software , which I think is a wonderful move , ” Shuttleworth writes in the email , “ Here , we are talking about elevating that to something that the world has never seen in proprietary software ( and never will ) – an entire industry collaborating .
Collaboration is the primary tool we have in our battle with proprietary software , we should take the opportunities that present themselves to make that collaboration easier and more effective . ”
In order to meet the upcoming December freeze , Shuttleworth is willing to commit several Ubuntu developers to the Debian project .
“ If the Debian community is willing to consider a December freeze , then Ubuntu ( and Canonical ) will commit resources to help Debian meet that goal , ” he writes , “ It means we ’ll get less done in Ubuntu , but the benefits of having a schedule which could attract many other distributions would outweigh that . ”
He believes other distributions will join the December freeze .
He added that if the December freeze is not possible , he ’s also willing to disrupt Ubuntu ’s release cycle to make it all work better – but he wo n’t commit to both developers and a change in cycle .
He closes his long email by adding : “ This is a good faith offer of help and support in order to reach a tough but noble and achievable goal .
It wo n’t be easy , the first time or the next , but it will kickstart a process that will bring dividends to Debian , and to the whole broader ecosystem .
Ask upstreams what they think , and whether they would want to participate , and you ’ll hear a very positive response . ”
I think this is indeed a golden opportunity for the Linux world to show that by being open , they can collaborate openly to make not only the lives of users easier , but also of distributors and upstream developers .
A release cadence is a great idea that fits the Linux world well , and will improve the experience for all involved .
As California ’s State Senate OK ’d making Harvey Milk Day official ( the bill now heads to the Assembly ) , it was no surprise all 23 Democrats voted for it .
But what ’s this about Republican Sen .
Abel Maldonado changing his mind ?
Voting no only last year , Maldonado crossed party lines yesterday — and already knows the heat is coming from conservatives .
Why ’d he do it ?
Because he decided to become a responsible elected official and actually read the piece of legislation he was voting on .
And now he ’s sorry he did n’t do it last year .
Turns out , establishing Harvey Milk Day wo n’t bring Armageddon !

By most accounts , the Obama administration ’s “ Cash for Clunkers ” program is a resounding success .
You ’ve heard the sound bytes : “ good for consumers , good for dealers / the auto industry / the economy , good for the environment . ”
There was some embarrassing attention focused on the program during its second week as consumer response overwhelmed everything from the dealer interface system to the rebate financing that the government initially allocated .
As the program ’s future hung in the balance , some dealers were left holding clunkers without a guarantee that the rebates would ever be paid , and as administration officials promised a hollow - sounding “ good faith effort ” to pay off all the deals already made , those dealers began to call customers to claw back the new cars or request cash payments to offset the rebate .
But , when the Senate approved an additional $ 2 billion before heading home for summer recess , it seemed that the narrative could revert back to praise for a program that worked .
Dealership showrooms are humming again .
Americans are driving snazzy new wheels and claiming as much as $ 4,500 in rebates for their old cars , actually worth much less .
And then there are the environmental benefits of getting all of those clunkers off the road…or , are there ?
Green critics have been circling the program since it began in late July , focusing mostly on concerns that ‘ Cash for Clunkers ’ does not require high enough fuel economy for the new vehicles that are eligible for the program .
Now comes Harvard economist Edward L. Glaser with a criticism from the behavioral economics camp in his weekend Boston Globe op - ed .
Glaser ’s point ?
If Americans derive more pleasure from driving newer cars , they are likely to drive more .
Not to mention that they will be getting better gas mileage that will make leisure drives , long road trips and the daily commute much more affordable .
As a result , even if they are driving more fuel efficient vehicles , “ Cash for Clunkers ” might not have a net GHG - lowering impact .
There goes one leg of the economy / consumer / environment stool .
Economists have been taking the hacksaw to the other two legs as well .
They contend that the program is probably not stimulating automobile purchases as much as accelerating and temporally confining them .
In other words , what would have been fall or winter purchases became late July buys .
So much for genuine stimulative economic effect .
As for consumer benefit , some critics argue that the program takes tax dollars to subsidize the purchase of new vehicles by people who can otherwise afford them but were just waiting for the right push while doing nothing to enable the poorest Americans to buy new cars because they still cannot afford or get financing for a new car , even with the rebates .
That criticism flows back into the questionable environmental benefit of the program since those poor Americans are likely to be driving the worst of the clunkers .
Further , the so - called clunkers that others are trading in may be more fuel efficient than the vehicles that these low income drivers will keep on the road , but under the program ’s rules , dealers have to disable those vehicles ’ engines .
This all dovetails with Glaser ’s criticism of what he calls the programs “ clunky reasoning . ”
As Glaser notes , the program ’s rationale seems to depend on “ the mistaken view that the number of miles traveled is independent of the price or pleasure of driving . ”
Glaser cites the increase in public transit ridership during last year ’s gas price spikes and proposes public transit subsidies as a better way to control GHG emissions since increased use of the subsidy ( by increased ridership ) does nothing to increase emissions , instead filling otherwise empty seats on already - operating buses .
As we have heard from the $ 20 a gallon movement , Glaser makes the uncomfortable if obvious point that “ a better way to reduce emissions is to make driving more , not less , expensive . ”
This is a recurring problem in the explosion of energy - environment policy .
For example , in Texas , utility green power programs are under - subscribed , leading to the possibility of a rate hike across the board to cover the loss .
Similar problems are facing policy makers across the country and across the green tech spectrum .
How do we move toward large - scale integration of plug - in EVs ?
By placing charging stations in highly visible public spaces .
But , who will pay for the electricity required to charge the vehicles in these public installations ?
There are a whole bunch of things that technology has now made doable , but that does not mean we have policy , legal and regulatory regimes in place to make those things manageable .
It does not seem likely that the US will slow its headlong rush into clean energy conversion as new killer aps emerge from the green tech side daily .
What we need now are some minds on the policy side – politicians , regulators , technocrats – to match the technological innovation with political will and inventiveness .

" We want to hear from anyone with information about the robber or may have seen him lurking in the area before the attack or saw him running away . "
It must surely rank as the most mundane business launch in history .
Jawed Karim , one of the founders of YouTube , shuffles timidly in front of a video camera while standing in front of a group of elephants at San Diego zoo , with precious little idea of what he was starting .
" The cool thing about these guys , " he says , nervously gesturing behind him , " is that they have really long trunks .
And that 's pretty much all there is to say . "
This 19 - second video clip , uploaded to the brand - new website later later that day , 23 April 2005 , may have been insubstantial , but it certainly was n't inconsequential .
Within 18 months , Karim and his partners Steve Chen and Chad Hurley had sold YouTube to Google for $ 1.76bn , and in doing so became one of a select band of online entrepreneurs who managed to grab our attention – and keep it .
Innumerable jaded web entrepreneurs will tell you how easy it is to get thousands of people to glance at a site , but how tortuous it is to get people to stick around or even come back again the following day .
Not only do you have to fulfil a desire that people did n't even realise that they had , but it has to be done with such style and panache that your service becomes indispensable .
While the internet may have dismantled many of the traditional barriers to reaching us , the general public , if your idea is anything less than sensational , we will flatly ignore it .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
But YouTube was sensational .
Prior to its launch , creating a videoclip for someone else to watch online was an arcane and deeply frustrating procedure of digitisation , encoding and embedding that was way more trouble than it was worth – not least because incompatible technologies meant that many people would n't be able to watch it .
But from humble beginnings in a room above a pizzeria in San Mateo , California , Hurley , Chen and Karim made the process simple , they made it relatively quick , and above all else , they made it free .
By mid-2006 , the site was fizzing with activity as we started using our YouTube channel as a jukebox , a blogging service , a promotional tool for our bands , a home video vault , a repository of famous film and television moments – sometimes with the blessing of the copyright owners , more often without it – and just occasionally , it provided an unexpected route to stardom .
YouTube entered the lexicon and became synonymous with online video ; the former Secretary of State for Local Government , Hazel Blears , dropped the phrase " YouTube if you want to " into an attack on Gordon Brown 's style of Government .
Blears making a feeble joke about YouTube is just one small measure of its phenomenal success .
But while its staggering popularity is without question – some 345 million visitors worldwide descend upon the website every month – it is haemorrhaging cash .
The question of exactly how unprofitable it is continues to be the source of fierce debate online ; back in April , analysts at Credit Suisse estimated that its operating losses for this year would reach $ 470 m , while San Francisco - based IT consultants RampRate were more optimistic , but still put the figure at just over $ 174 m .
Google are n't rushing to put an end to speculation over the scale of the debt .
One thing is abundantly clear from both studies :
Google is n't making money by letting everyone and their aunt share videos with each other for free .
And the news last week that founder Steve Chen was leaving YouTube to work on other projects at Google kicked off another flurry of rumours as to its possible fate .
***
Music , television , sport , gaming : the flow of free entertainment to our computer screens seems almost the result of a magical process , and there 's been little need for us to consider the costs that might have been incurred by those making it all happen .
It 's broadly accepted that YouTube will receive around $ 240 m of revenue from advertising this year , but that sum does n't even cover their general overheads and the cost of acquiring premium video content ( such as TV shows ) from copyright holders .
In addition , there are the huge fixed costs from the supply side – data centres , hardware , software and bandwidth – that have to cope with the 20 hours of video clips that we upload to YouTube every minute of every day .
Again , no - one knows the true total of these costs – the Credit Suisse and RampRate reports put it between $ 83 m and $ 380 m this year – but Google 's Chief Financial Officer , Patrick Pichette , would only reveal one thing : " We know our cost position , but nobody else does . "
Or , in other words , we 're not telling you .
This typifies the slightly secretive but ultimately sanguine position of Google even as phrases like " financial folly " are bandied about to describe the YouTube business model .
With Google 's overall profits reaching some $ 1.42 bn for the first quarter of this year alone , the king of online search is certainly a position to support a loss - making venture that also happens to be the third - most - popular website on the internet .
( Google , naturally , is the first . )
But Keith McMahon , senior analyst for the Telco 2.0 Initiative , a research group that studies business models in the digital economy , believes that YouTube is not the albatross around Google 's neck that it 's widely imagined to be .
He sees the search company as deriving massive indirect benefits from operating YouTube and believes that estimates of its losses obscure the true picture .
" There are many urban myths surrounding the way that companies extract value from the internet , " he says .
" Google 's spin - off benefits from owning YouTube include the accumulation of our data and strengthening of their network design – and the more time people spend watching online video , the more advertisers will pour into marketing on the internet as a whole .
There 's no doubt that Google can afford YouTube . "
McMahon also believes that by keeping quiet about YouTube 's hidden benefits and by allowing the misconception of it as a deeply unprofitable business to circulate , things work very nicely in Google 's favour when it comes to negotiating with copyright holders in the world of TV , movies and music .
Copyright holders can't demand money that is n't there , and it would certainly take no more than a hint of profitability at YouTube for lawyers to descend , threatening court cases and demanding higher royalties .
In the new , topsy - turvy world of online economics , it seems astonishing that losses on paper have actually made YouTube a more powerful online force .
But while Google 's pockets may be deep enough to operate a phenomenally popular online service at no cost to its users , what about the countless other internet startups whose operations scarcely extend across a dingy office , let alone several continents ?
With the free model slowly establishing itself , how can businesses sustain their activities ?
Sadly , the most common answer is : they can't .
The traditional way to generate revenue and offset losses has been to sell some form of advertising space on the website .
But an increasing number of industry commentators believe that the internet advertising model is broken – and what better proof than YouTube itself , whose advertising revenues do n't even cover their overheads , and who might be dead in the water if it was n't for their multinational sugar daddy ?
In a piece this year for the insider 's technology blog , TechCrunch , entitled " Why Advertising Is Failing On The Internet " , Eric Clemons , Professor of Operations and Information Management at the University of Pennsylvania , argued that the way that we 're using the internet has shattered the whole concept of advertising .
We need no encouragement to share our opinions online regarding products and services and offer them star ratings ; as a result , we 're much more likely to look for personal recommendations from other customers than wait for a gaudy advert to beckon us wildly in the direction of a company website or online store .
He claims we do n't trust online advertising , we do n't need online advertising , but above all we do n't want online advertising .
There 's certainly a huge weight of evidence to support the latter theory ; extensions for web browsers that block advertisements from displaying on the screen have proved to be incredibly popular , and we seem increasingly resentful of attempts by companies to compromise our free online experience by pushing marketing messages in our direction .
Spotify , the online jukebox launched this year , has won countless plaudits for its innovative , free and legal approach to online music , but you do n't need to look far online before finding users who bitterly complain about the brief audio adverts that play every 20 minutes , interrupting the flow of the new Kasabian album .
One comment on a story about the possible expansion of YouTube 's advertising is typical : " If advertising is made one iota more intrusive , I shall use other video sites instead . "
Small wonder that YouTube only dare feature advertising in less than 5 per cent of the videos on the website , along with a few subtle ads in the sidebar of their search results .
But while Google continues to finesse its YouTube model , with click - to - buy links and sponsored competitions , it 's contended by Professor Clemons that no matter how innovative the advertising industry might become , " commercial messages , pushed through whatever medium , in order to reach a potential customer who is in the middle of doing something else , will fail " .
If this is true , it obviously has implications for Google , even though they 're sitting very pretty at the moment as the overwhelmingly dominant force in online advertising .
But other companies dependent on ad revenue are n't so fortunate .
Joost , another ad - funded online video service , announced last week that it would be reinventing itself as a provider of white - label – generic – video for other businesses , and would be cutting jobs in the process .
" In these tough economic times , " said its chairman Mike Volpi , " it 's been increasingly challenging to operate as an independent , ad - supported online video platform . "
But even taking the effects of the recession into account , Keith McMahon is unsurprised .
" All those startups have burned through their initial venture capital money , and they 've seen that the business model that they were originally planning for – this landgrab for advertising – just is n't there any more . "
As a leader in The Economist entitled " The end of the free lunch " put it earlier this year , " Reality is asserting itself once more ... Silicon Valley seems to be entering another ' nuclear winter ' . "
***
We are uninterested , verging on contemptuous , of the marketing strategies that were supposed to pay for us to enjoy online services for free .
We 've become totally unwilling to pay for them directly , either ; we simply figure that someone , somehow , will pick up the tab .
Rupert Murdoch recently announced plans to " fix " the current newspaper business model by charging for access to News Corporation 's newspaper web sites , stating that " the current days of the internet will soon be over " , but Chris Anderson , the editor of Wired magazine , spends 288 pages in his new book " Free : The Future Of A Radical Price " explaining why this is ultimately impossible .
He contends that information wants to be free , and that there 's an unstoppable downward pressure on the price of anything " made of ideas " , adding that the most worrying long - term problem for internet businesses is that the Google Generation are now growing up simply assuming that everything digital is free .
They 've internalised the economics of the free model " in the same way that we internalise Newtonian mechanics when we learn to catch a ball " .
In other words , the fact that most people over the age of 30 doubt that online businesses can survive by offering free services is irrelevant , because most people under the age of 30 are demanding them .
On messageboards and forums across the internet you can see them calling for record companies , film studios , newspapers and television channels to come up with a solution that will extend their entertainment utopia , and quick ; if they do n't , well , they 'll find a way around it .
And while many see this as a selfish , unrealistic attitude , the onus is on businesses to get themselves out of this mess because the digital medium exercises unstoppable power .
However much Rupert Murdoch and others may wish to control it , it 's Anderson 's contention that the beast is way , way too slippery .
Anderson , along with other digital visionaries , tends to display a sunny optimism that new business models will inevitably step into the breach , while leaving speculation about what those models might actually be to others .
But while Anderson says it 's " head spinning – and exhilarating – to watch an industry reinvent itself in the face of a new medium " , those working in the online economy are n't quite so thrilled .
The news regarding YouTube 's losses have caused such consternation because people simply can't believe that the third - most - popular website on the web is unable to stand alone and turn a profit .
And suddenly , the magical web , whose supposed capacity to revolutionise business has attracted and continues to attract waves of ambitious entrepreneurs , may slowly be revealing itself as an arena in which only a few large companies can survive .
This was illustrated by a tale recounted by the publisher of the Dallas Morning News , James Moroney , who recently told the US Congress about Amazon 's proposal for licensing his newspaper 's content to be read on Amazon 's e-reading device , the Kindle : he was informed that 70 per cent of revenue would go to Amazon , with only 30 per cent to the Morning News for providing the content .
It seems both unhealthy and deeply disappointing that Amazon , Microsoft , Google and the like are beginning to wield so much power ; it 's even something over which even Google CEO Eric Schmidt has expressed concern .
But Keith McMahon says that we should n't be surprised .
" Remember in the 1980s when the home computer boom started ?
The country was full of young kids coding games and selling them on cassette , " he says .
" But from that rose a gaming industry that 's controlled by a small number of very wealthy organisations .
Cottage industries that can't survive on their own will either fail , or get swallowed up . "
McMahon 's message to online businesses is essentially one that 's remained the same ever since humans first started making transactions : business is business .
For all the cries of foul by entrepreneurs or copyright holders in the face of " unfair " behaviour by multinational corporations or websites such as The Pirate Bay , if you can't find the money to make your business work , that 's the end of your business .
Because ultimately , the market can't be fought .
YouTube 's lack of profitability other than as part of a colossal global multinational may signal the end of a dream that has somehow managed to extend past the bursting of the dotcom bubble back in 2001 , and the options for new online ventures seem to be as follows : either produce something that people are willing to pay for , or come up with an idea for a free service that 's so ingenious that a benevolent multinational is willing to take it off your hands .
But remember : that trick of making a home video of yourself in front of a few elephants has already been done .

Google Removes Triforce From Logos
As it fits a good conspiracy , Google now removed the triforce from the logo doodles ( I did not check for every logo , but it ’s gone for at least the two which I did check ) .
I wonder why ?
For instance , here ’s the old Tesla logo , and the new one :
The triforce can be seen to the right of the “ l ” , near the bottom .
( See Search Engine Roundtable ’s July 10 post , they made a copy of the logo . )
And now it ’s gone .
( See Google ’s live version of the logo , and hit refresh if you got the old version cached . )
The triforce is also gone from Susie Sahim ’s showcase of the logos – she was suspected to be behind this ( I do n’t know for sure ) , and can be seen posing dressed as Link from the game Zelda in different photos * .
( At least she says it ’s her .
Susannah was not available for other comments , and the only thing Google told me in regards to the logos was “ Users can infer any one Link or another in our doodles . ” )
Please comment in the existing thread .
[ Thanks Hebbet ! ]

A Soyuz craft has three seats versus the shuttle 's seven
Europe is seeking to maintain flight opportunities for its astronauts by buying Soyuz spacecraft from Russia .
The European Space Agency ( Esa ) has asked Moscow if it is possible to increase the production of the craft from four to five a year .
Esa could then buy its own vehicle , perhaps with the Canadians who are also looking for more seat opportunities .
The expected retirement of US shuttles in 2010 / 11 means fewer humans will be going into space in the coming years .
The venerable Soyuz craft will be the only way of getting to the International Space Station ( ISS ) , certainly in the short term .
Simonetta Di Pippo , the director of human spaceflight at Esa , told BBC News she was hopeful a deal on Soyuz could be put in place for 2013 .
" From ' 13 on , we would like to have at least one European astronaut per year flying and this can be done in various ways .
One of the proposals we are putting on the table is to buy a full Soyuz , " she said .
Frank De
Winne is set to take command of the space station Discussions with the Russians on the subject took place at the recent International Aviation and Space Salon , MAKS 2009 .
Various technical aspects would need to be studied , including the feasibility of ramping up production at manufacturer Energia and how the additional flight would be accommodated at the station 's docking ports .
" The feeling with the Russians was really good , " Mrs Di Pippo said .
" We had a great meeting and I think in two or three months , we will be able to come out with a firm proposal . "
Europe 's astronauts are in the middle of an excellent run of opportunity at the moment .
Leopold Eyharts and Hans Schlegel flew to the station with the European Columbus science module in 2008 .
Christer Fuglesang and Frank De Winne are flying this year , with De Winne set to take command of the ISS in October .
Paolo Nespoli and Roberto Vittori will both launch next year .
Vittori is set to fly on what presently looks to be the very last shuttle mission .
And Andre Kuipers has been selected for a six - month tour of the ISS which he will take up at the end of 2011 .
Beyond Kuipers , the European schedule is empty .
But Europe has just appointed six new candidates to its astronaut corps .
Although the rookies must complete at least three years ' basic training before even being considered for a mission , Esa has to plan ahead now to find them rides .
Additional ' room '
Mrs Di Pippo also said Esa was close to an agreement with the Americans on adding an extra European " room " to the International Space Station .
The intention is to leave one of the Multi-Purpose Logistics Modules ( MPLMs ) at the ISS .
The Italian - built MPLMs are the large cylindrical " packing boxes " put in a shuttle 's payload bay when the orbiter flies logistics missions to the orbiting platform .
They hold about 7 - 10 tonnes of supplies .
Once in orbit , the pressurised module is picked up by the shuttle 's robotic arm and attached to a station docking port .
The astronauts then unload its contents .
Normally , the MPLMs return home immediately with the shuttle , but with the orbiter fleet 's retirement , the intention now is to leave the module known as Raffaello in space to provide extra volume .
Raffaello would be left permanently berthed at the space station " It 's a great idea , " said Mrs Di Pippo .
" The issue though is that an MPLM was designed to stay in orbit for 15 days , so we would need to reinforce the protection from meteorites and debris .
Nasa wants to consider it mainly as a storage compartment . "
This role would allow volume to be freed up elsewhere on the station for science activity , principally in Columbus .
Mrs Di Pippo said she expected European engineers to arrive at Nasa 's human spaceflight HQ in Houston , Texas , next month to begin the design work on upgrading Raffaello .
The MPLMs were manufactured by Thales Alenia Space ( TAS ) .
Its contribution to the orbiting project has been remarkable : more than half of the pressurised volume on the ISS has come from TAS .
Raffaello , however , will not need to return to Italy for the upgrade ; the strengthening work can be done in the US .
Mrs Di Pippo said she hoped the idea could proceed under a barter arrangement with the US , whereby the European work would represent an " in kind payment " to replace equivalent cash purchases Esa currently makes for ISS services provided by the Americans .
" The launch is scheduled for September next year so we need to start work right now , " said Mrs Di Pippo .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Researchers have found specific nerve cells responsible for itchiness , a discovery that could lead to better treatments for skin conditions .
A mouse scratches an itch in an undated handout photo .
REUTERS / Science / AAAS / Handout
Experiments on mice show they have nerve cells that convey only an itch sensation -- contradicting common wisdom that itch and pain are closely related .
Reporting in the journal Science , researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis and Peking University Third Hospital in Beijing said they created itch - free mice by killing their itch - specific neurons .
“ This finding has very important therapeutic implications , ” Washington University ’s Zhou - Feng Chen , who led the study , said in a statement .
“ We ’ve shown that particular neurons are critical for the itching sensation but not for pain , which means those cells may contain several itch - specific receptors or signaling molecules that can be explored or identified as targets for future treatment or management of chronic itching . ”
Eczema , psoriasis , allergies , infections and other conditions can cause chronic itching and various treatments are often only partially effective .
In 2007 the researchers identified the first itch gene called gastrin - releasing peptide receptor , or GRPR .
It was active in the spinal cord .
“ But the identification of an itch receptor in spinal - cord neurons did n’t mean those neurons were itch - specific because it was possible that they also could have pain - related genes , ” Chen said .
So they destroyed nerve cells that had active GRPR , using a toxin that attaches to GRPR and injecting it into the spinal cords of mice .
When the mice then were exposed to things that caused itching , they did not scratch .
But they felt pain .
“ This is a very striking and unexpected result because it suggests there is an itch - specific neuronal pathway in the spinal cord , ” Chen said .
“ We ’ve shown that these GRPR neurons are important for itching sensation and not for pain , but we really do n’t know much more about them , ” Chen said .
“ We still have a lot of questions , and we are very interested to find more answers . ”

The software agents use simple rules to negotiate for a buyer Artificial intelligence technology could soon make the internet an even bigger haven for bargain - hunters .
Software " agents " that automatically negotiate on behalf of shoppers and sellers are about to be set free on the web for the first time .
The " Negotiation Ninjas " , as they are known , will be trialled on a shopping website called Aroxo in the autumn .
The intelligent traders are the culmination of 20 years ' work by scientists at Southampton University .
" Computer agents do n't get bored , they have a lot of time , and they do n't get embarrassed , " Professor Nick Jennings , one of the researchers behind the work , told BBC News .
" I have always thought that in an internet environment , negotiation is the way to go . "
Price fixing
The agents use a series of simple rules - known as heuristics - to find the optimal price for both buyer and seller based on information provided by both parties .
Heuristics are commonly used in computer science to find an optimal solution to a problem when there is not a single " right answer " .
They are often used in anti-virus software to trawl for new threats .
" If you can't analyse mathematically exactly what you should do , which you can't in general for these sorts of systems , then you end up with heuristics , " explained Professor Jennings .
" We use heuristics to determine what price we should offer during the negotiation - and also how we might deal with multiple negotiations at the same time .
" We have to factor in some degrees of uncertainty as well - the chances are that sellers will enter into more negotiations than they have stock . "
Fixed pricing is a relatively recent phenomenon
Nick Jennings
To use one of the intelligent agents , sellers must answer a series of questions about how much of a discount they are prepared to offer and whether they are prepared to go lower after a certain number of sales , or at a certain time of day .
They are also asked how eager they are to make a sale .
At the other end , the buyer types in the item they wish to purchase and the price they are willing to pay for it .
The agents then act as an intermediary , scouring the lists of sellers who are programmed to accept a price in the region of the one offered .
If they find a match , the seller is prompted to automatically reply with a personalised offer .
The buyer then has a choice to accept , reject or negotiate .
If they choose to negotiate , the agent analyses the seller 's criteria to see if they can make a better offer .
The process continues until either there is a sale or one of the parties pulls out .
Aroxo will be trialling the Negotiation Ninjas from the autumn , and plans to have the system fully operational in time for Christmas shopping this year .
The site currently offers mainly electrical goods .
While the sellers will not have to pay to use the Ninjas , they pay to contact a buyer .
The charge from Aroxo is 0.3 % of the buyer 's original asking price .
For Professor Jennings , this application of his research marks a return to a more traditional retail model .
" Fixed pricing is a relatively recent phenomenon , " he said .
" Throughout history most transactions have been negotiated .
Only in the last 100 years have we gone for fixed pricing . "

Warning : Dangerous Curves
This entry presupposes you already know some math stats , such as how to manipulate joint , marginal and conditional distributions using the chain rule ( product rule ) and marginalization ( sum/ integration rule ) .
You should also be familiar with the difference between model parameters ( e.g. a regression coefficient or Poisson rate parameter ) and observable samples ( e.g. reported annual income or the number of fumbles in a quarter of a given American football game ) .
Examples
I followed up this post with some concrete examples for binary and multinomial outcomes :
Bayesian Inference is Based on Probability Models
Bayesian models provide full joint probability distributions over both observable data and unobservable model parameters .
Bayesian statistical inference is carried out using standard probability theory .
What ’s a Prior ?
The full Bayesian probability model includes the unobserved parameters .
The marginal distribution over parameters is known as the “ prior ” parameter distribution , as it may be computed without reference to observable data .
The conditional distribution over parameters given observed data is known as the “ posterior ” parameter distribution .
Non-Bayesian Statistics
Non-Bayesian statisticians eschew probability models of unobservable model parameters .
Without such models , non-Bayesians cannot perform probabilistic inferences available to Bayesians , such as definining the probability that a model parameter ( such as the mean height of an adult male American ) is in a defined range say ( say 5 ’ 6 ″ to 6 ’0 ″ ) .
Instead of modeling the posterior probabilities of parameters , non-Bayesians perform hypothesis testing and compute confidence intervals , the subtleties of interpretation of which have confused introductory statistics students for decades .
Bayesian Technical Apparatus
The sampling distribution , with probability function , models the probability of observable data given unobserved ( and typically unobservable ) model parameters .
( The sampling distribution probability function is called the likelihood function when viewed as a function of for fixed . )
The prior distribution , with probability function , models the probability of the parameters .
The full joint distribution over parameters and data has a probability function given by the chain rule ,
.
The posterior distribution gives the probability of parameters given the observed data .
The posterior probability function is derived from the sampling and prior distributions via Bayes ’s rule ,
by the definition of conditional probability ,
by the chain rule ,
by the rule of total probability ,
by the chain rule , and
because is constant .
The posterior predictive distribution for new data given observed data is the average of the sampling distribution defined by weighting the parameters proportional to their posterior probability ,
.
The key feature is the incorporation into predictive inference of the uncertainty in the posterior parameter estimate .
In particular , the posterior is an overdispersed variant of the sampling distribution .
The extra dispersion arises by integrating over the posterior .
Conjugate Priors
Conjugate priors , where the prior and posterior are drawn from the same family of distributions , are convenient but not necessary .
For instance , if the sampling distribution is binomial , a beta - distributed prior leads to a beta - distributed posterior .
With a beta posterior and binomial sampling distribuiton , the predictive posterior distribution is beta- binomial , the overdispersed form of the binomial .
If the sampling distribution is Poisson , a gamma - distributed prior leads to a gamma - distributed posterior ; the predictive posterior distribution is negative - binomial , the overdispersed form of the Poisson .
Point Estimate Approximations
An approximate alternative to full Bayesian inference uses for prediction , where is a point estimate .
The maximum of the posterior distribution defines the maximum a posteriori ( MAP ) estimate ,
.
If the prior is uniform , the MAP estimate is called the maximum likelihood estimate ( MLE ) , because it maximizes the likelihood function .
Because the MLE does not assume a proper prior ; the posterior may be improper ( i.e. , not integrate to 1 ) .
By definition , the unbiased estimator for the parameter under the Bayesian model is the posterior mean ,
.
This quantity is often used as a Bayesian point estimator because it minimizes expected squared loss between an estimate and the actual value .
The posterior median may also be used as an estimate — it minimizes expected absolute error of the estimate .
Point estimates may be reasonably accurate if the posterior has low variance .
If the posterior is diffuse , prediction with point estimates tends to be underdispersed , in the sense of underestimating the variance of the predictive distribution .
This is a kind of overfitting which , unlike the usual situation of overfitting due to model complexity , arises from the oversimplification of the variance component of the predictive model .

“ I think it ’s fun for them , ” said Dr. Kohlbrenner , 58 , a psychologist in private practice , who found out later that his son did not approve .
“ If you ca n’t do it when you ’re a kid , when can you do it , you know ? ”
Dr. Kohlbrenner ’s son , Justin , 30 , said he and his wife felt that their oldest son was too old to be naked .
“ He was getting a little too big to be doing it , you know , especially in front of his brother and sister , ” he said .
Experts like Sharon Lamb , a professor of mental health at the graduate college of education at the University of Massachusetts , Boston , said it ’s all but inevitable that children will want to spend time wearing only their birthday suits , especially in certain situations .
“ Clothes can be uncomfortable , ” said Dr. Lamb , a co-author of the forthcoming book “ Packaging Boyhood : Saving Our Sons From Superheroes , Slackers , and Other Media Stereotypes . ”
“ For some kids , getting dressed gets associated with something they do n’t want to do , like eating their veggies . ”
Around the age of 3 or 4 , children begin to differentiate between what ’s private and what ’s public , experts say , and they usually begin to feel modesty soon after .
But parents ’ attitudes play the largest role in determining whether children are comfortable being naked at home , said Lawrence Balter , a psychologist at New York University and the editor of “ Parenthood in America , ” an encyclopedia .
“ If someone has what appears to be an overly strong reaction to seeing young children running around naked , it tells us about their own hang - ups , their own inner conflicts , ” Dr. Balter said .
Cultural norms are another factor .
Katarzyna Psujek , 38 , an administrator at Tiffany & Company and a mother of two sons who lives in Greenpoint , Brooklyn , said her son Sebastian , who turned 3 in May , often frolics at home naked and spent nearly an entire weekend naked last September at a rented house in upstate New York where the family celebrated a friend ’s wedding with about 30 other overnight guests .
“ Ninety - nine percent of the people who were there were Polish , ” said Ms. Psujek , whose last name is pronounced SUE - yek .
“ I remember thinking , if there were more people around , and if they were Americans , would they accept him running naked as he was ? ”

The Pre is widely seen as a rival to other popular smartphones Palm has responded to claims that its recently - launched Pre smartphone abuses owners ' privacy .
The company issued a statement after one owner discovered his phone was sending data every day back to Palm .
The information included the current location of the phone and how long each application was used for .
In its statement , Palm said it took users ' privacy " seriously " and said it gave phone owners ways to turn features on and off .
The discovery was made by software developer and Pre owner Joey Hess , who found that his phone was reporting his location over a secure connection back to Palm .
It also sent back information about application crashes - even those not seen by a Pre owner .
Also in the daily update sent to Palm was a list of the third party applications installed on the phone .
In its privacy policy , Palm does explain that it will gather geographical data to help with location - based services .
However , commentators were puzzled as to why it needed to gather so much data and why owners were not told about what it had gathered .
Mr Hess found a way to disable the reporting by editing the phone 's software .
Palm issued a statement about Mr Hess ' discovery and said it " offers users ways to turn data collecting services on and off " .
It added : " Our privacy policy is like many policies in the industry and includes very detailed language about potential scenarios in which we might use a customer 's information , all toward a goal of offering a great user experience . "
" We appreciate the trust that users give us with their information , and have no intention to violate that trust , " said Palm .

Our gold standard money did n’t fail us in 1913 ; it was murdered .
Did it deserve to die ?
What was its crime ?
It had provided us with nothing less than relative peace and prosperity over a span of 136 years .
It had not only retained one hundred percent of its value , it had gained eleven percent .
That ’s right .
The dollar we started with in 1776 bought us eleven percent more after almost seven generations .
Then , J.P. Morgan ’s creatures picked a quiet 23rd of December in 1913 to suffocate our sound money system .
Since that manslaughter , the purchasing power of a dollar has plummeted over 95 % .
We now pay twenty times more than J.P. Morgan did for any item .
Morgan and his henchmen had global plans for the state .
Their vision was of a state , under their direction , that would supplant the failing British Empire .
This state would support and create wars , marshal powerful and intimidating forces over foreign and domestic affairs , dispense military contracts to political favorites , grow a professional bureaucracy , seize central powers while diminishing individual liberties , and fund any welfare plan designed to deliver votes .
Importantly , Morgan ’s bank would be the state ’s bank for all of this activity .
So , under the guise of stabilizing the dollar , the Federal Reserve Act destabilized it , causing booms and busts while proliferating and prolonging conflicts everywhere .
The new Central Bank designed for the state the secret paper door to all the money it could dream of spending , at the bald expense of unsuspecting , trusting citizens .
Morgan did not originate the concept of this taxation by stealth inflation .
In Colonial times , Massachusetts had needed money and simply printed it , also .
One Bostonian had seen the consequent harm clearly ,
William Douglas understood that paper issues were a form of taxation on the public … that increasing the quantity of money only depreciates the value of each unit , so that a larger supply of money does no better or greater work for society than a smaller .
Hardest hit by the severe depreciation of all the notes were nondebtors , especially creditors , fixed - income groups , charitable endowments , and laborers , whose wages rose less than prices .

A military historian , Martin van Creveld , also sees clearly why and how the state grabs total monetary control .
He tells the full story in The Rise and Decline of the State .
Van Creveld reveals that ,
" [ the ] states having finally succeeded in their drive to conquer money , the effect of absolute economic dominance on the states themselves was to allow them to fight each other on a scale and with a ferocity never equaled before or since . …
The concentration of all economic power in the hands of the state would not have been necessary , nor could it have been justified , if its overriding purpose had not been to impose order on the one hand and fight its neighbors on the other .
( pp. 241—2 ) "
Thus , the murder of sound money became the most consequential death of the last one hundred years .
The Bretton Woods reform of 1944 was an acknowledged failure by August 1971 when Nixon closed the international gold window .
The state , having cast off its golden restraints , made the Twentieth Century a nightmarish bloodbath the world around .
Today , the state ’s fiat money theft and death machine wobbles .
It can no longer animate spirits or digitally create everlasting bubbles .
Observe the tremulous , palsied ravages of the wayward printing press :

The debt has to be rolled over every four years .
That ’s $ 240 billion a month to be skimmed off capital markets .

Manufacturing : China has officially become the leading manufacturer of the world .

Clearing this market seems an impossible task .
Yes , economic law will work its magic to match supply and demand , but can it plough through such an incredible economic global mess within our lifetimes ?
Will the frantic state stop intervening long enough for the economic body to heal itself ?
Since a sound money system has delivered peace and prosperity in our historical past , could it not be called upon to do so again ?
Is it an exercise in futility to spend any time even thinking about life after the Fed , embracing specie - backed money that is not the inflationary design instrument of the state ?
Gary North has written an article on replacing the dollar as the world reserve currency .
Few have written on the mechanics of getting back to sound money .
But , many are thinking that unthinkable .
Audit the Fed cries are turning into End the Fed demands .
That begs the question , " What then ? "
Repealing legal tender laws , generating competing currencies , denationalizing money , meeting the small change challenge of 100 % reserve money , letting the market select which commodity will be the specie basis , and a few zillion other considerations tickle the mind .
It ’s a fitting and proper time to be thinking of what such a free market monetary system could smell like , taste like , look like and be like .
Who knows ?
The shambles that the central bank has made with the power Congress sadly placed in its paws , calls for rigorous analysis of a free society ’s options .
As this empire collapses , creating a fresh monetary system wo n’t be an option for our future .
It will be a necessity .
We once again will need to navigate our communities out of the barter systems we will initially be thrown into .
No banker or politician or Keynesian economist will help us .
Sound money is suicide to them .
Literally , sound money is Bernanke ’s worst nightmare .
So , without those bankers , politicians , or most economists , we ’ll need to have given the creation of a sound monetary system in our twenty - first century serious thought .
It ’s time to get thinking .
It ’s time to prepare .
It ’s time to dream that impossible dream .

High - fructose corn syrup rose from obscurity to ubiquity starting in the late 1970s , borne up by an informal public - private partnership between grain - processing giant Archer Daniels Midland and the federal government .
For me , HFCS is at best a highly processed , lavishly subsidized , calorie - heavy , nutritional vacuum .
I recently visited a public high school in Boone , N.C.
The main hall literally hummed with machines peddling variations on Coca - Cola ’s formula for success : fizzy water with artificial flavor , artificial color , added caffeine , and a jolt of HFCS .
Other machines displayed snack “ foods ” tarted up with HFCS .
Why are we feeding our kids this crap , again ?
Now comes news that makes even an HFCS cynic like me do a spit - take over my home - brewed morning coffee .
Turns out that HFCS is commonly tainted with mercury — a highly toxic substance — according to a peer - reviewed report published by Environmental Health ( abstract here ; PDF of the must - read full text here . )
The Environmental Health study draws on samples of high - fructose corn syrup taken straight from the factory .
But no one drinks the stuff straight .
What about , say , cookies sweetened with HFCS ?
The Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy plucked HFCS - containing products from supermarket shelves and tested them for mercury .
The result ?
Overall , we found detectable mercury in 17 of 55 samples , or around 31 percent
Traces of mercury turned up in name - brand products from makers including Quaker , Hunt ’s , Manwich , Hershey ’s , Smucker ’s , Kraft , Nutri -Grain , and Yoplait .
That a ubiquitous industrial - food ingredient such as HFCS should be tainted by mercury is bad enough .
But it gets worse .
The FDA has apparently known about this since 2005 — and done nothing to publicize it or change it .
In 2005 , EH study lead author Renee Dufault was an FDA researcher .
At that time , she conducted the tests now cited in the EH report .
Her results found mercury in 9 of 20 HFCS samples — 45 percent .
She does n’t comment on why , but the FDA apparently did nothing with her results in the years since they emerged .
She retired from the agency in March 2008 — and evidently decided to go public .
She deserves praise for the decision to publish her work — essentially blowing the whistle on what looks like an egregious attempt to hide key information from the public .
So how does mercury work its way into our the food industry ’s favorite sweetener ?
It finds its way into Pop Tarts and the like through the stunning array chemicals required to transform corn into a cane sugar substitute .
( As you read the following list , marvel that the FDA recently ruled that manufacturers can label HFCS - sweetened foods " natural . " )
According the the EH study :
Several chemicals are required to make HFCS , including caustic soda , hydrochloric acid , alpha- amylase , gluco - amylase , isomerase , ilter aid , powdered carbon , calcium chloride , and magnesium sulfate .
Two of those charming - sounding chemicals — caustic soda and hydrochloric acid — can contain traces of mercury .
Caustic soda and hydrochloric acid are made through the same processes that produce chlorine .
It can be done in one of two ways .
The first involves pumping saltwater through a vat of mercury .
The stuff produced this way is known as " mercury grade . "
The second process involves no mercury .
The industry is shifting to the second process , but the mercury style has by no means been phased out .
According to IATP , " Today , the chlorine industry remains the largest intentional consumer ( end user ) of mercury . "
So you ’ve got this " mercury grade " caustic soda and hydrochloric acid floating around .
Guess who ’s using it ?
According to the EH study , " mercury grade caustic soda and hydrochloric acid are primarily used by the high fructose corn syrup industry . "
Not only did the FDA fail to inform the public of HFCS ’s mercury problem ; food manufacturers that use HFCS may have been in the dark , IATP reports .
There is one hopeful tidbit from the highly disturbing Environmental Health and Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy studies .
Several years ago , then - Sen . Barack Obama introduced legislation that would have forced the chlorine industry to phase out mercury .
That bill failed .
I hope the new Congress revives it .
And I hope the Obama FDA investigates precisely why the agency sat on information that could have saved consumers from mercury exposure .
The officials who made that decision — as well as the HFCS industry , led by Archer Daniels Midland — must be held to account .
Coloradans say they are doing less hard drinking than they did in the past few years but say they are more likely to smoke pot , according to a two - year federal assessment to be released today .
The National Survey on Drug Use and Health found Colorado was the only state to log a decrease in those who think they are at risk to binge - drink since the last study completed in 2006 , from 29.8 percent in the previous study to 25.8 percent in the most recent .
Meanwhile , Colorado is one of seven states that notched “ significant ” increases in teens and adults who say they are more likely to smoke pot at least once a month than those who participated in the last government survey .
“ We ’ve been saying for some time that many adults want a safer alternative to drinking , ” said Mason Tvert , executive director of the Denver - based pot-legalization group Safer Alternative for Enjoyable Recreation , which has passed two pro-pot public votes in the city since 2006 .
The increase in stoners could logically be tied to the rocky economy , said Tvert , co-author of a book to be released in August that measures the economics of getting buzzed , “ Marijuana Is Safer : So Why Do We Drive People to Drink ? ”
“ The price of pot is inflated because of criminalization , ” he said .
“ Still , people seeking to get intoxicated perceive they get a better deal sitting at home smoking a little pot than going out and spending $ 30 at a bar to get drunk . ”
Art Hughes , a statistician who worked on the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration study , cautioned against sweeping new characterizations from the most recent report , however .
“ This is n’t really new news to Colorado , per se , ” he said of the state ’s use of drugs and alcohol , with a growing favor toward pot .
The report also indicates Colorado leads the nation in the increase in people 12 or older who smoked a tobacco cigarette in the previous month , from 26.5 percent to 29.8 percent .
The report also puts Colorado among the top 10 states for :
• The highest illicit - drug use in every age category .
• Failure of teens and adults who need alcohol treatment to receive it .
• Survey takers using cocaine in the past year .
The survey indicates 8.1 percent of the U.S. population 12 or older used illegal drugs in the previous month , down slightly from the previous two - year measure .
Iowa had the lowest estimate , at 5.2 percent , and Rhode Island had the highest , 12.5 percent .
Marijuana is the most popular illicit drug nationwide , as an estimated 10.2 percent of teenagers and adults used it at least once in the previous year , the survey found .
Alcohol is still , by far , the vice of choice among Americans , however .
The survey found 51 percent had a drink in the past month , while 5.9 percent used marijuana during that span .
The findings are based on hour - long interviews with more than 135,000 randomly selected people nationwide .
The report does n’t offer advice but provides local , state and national policymakers and agencies data on the issues they are addressing , to make more informed decisions , Hughes said .
The report and raw numbers for each state , to be released today , will be posted at oas.samhsa.gov/2k7state/TOC.cfm .
China has for the first time given a timeframe for reducing its carbon emissions .
The world 's largest emitter of greenhouse gases says it will begin dropping emissions in 2050 .
The comments by top policy - maker Su Wei have been carried in the Financial Times newspaper , but they did not indicate at what level emissions would top out .
At a G8 meeting in July , China and India resisted calls to agree to a 50 % cut in global emissions by 2050 .
Mr Su has restated Beijing 's view that because China still needs to expand its economy to pull people out of poverty , it is too soon to discuss caps on emissions .
His comments come at the end of a week of talks on climate change in the German city of Bonn .
The talks , intended to help the world agree on the amount to cut greenhouse gas emissions by , by the year 2020 , appear to have made slow progress .
NZ ambassador says differences persist
New Zealand has put forward an offer of cuts of between 10 % and 20 % of 1990 levels .
Senior foreign affairs official Adrian Macey is New Zealand 's chief negotiator at the talks .
He says big differences persist between developing and developed countries .
The major developing economies are reluctant to commit themselves , he says , and consider the commitments made by developed countries to be inadequate .
" Developing countries are wanting lots of assurances about financing , so there 's quite a lot of things that have to happen before we can get a breakthrough . "
Mr Macey says another problem is creating a negotiable document from an unmanageable raft of conflicting and overlapping proposals from different countries .
Mr Macey says the talks have tried to simplify the proposals .
The process will be resumed at talks in Bangkok in September - October and Barcelona in November , ahead of a major conference on climate change in Copenhagen in December .
The head of the UN Climate Change Secretariat , Yvo de Boer , said after the Bonn meeting , that " selective progress " has been made towards trimming the huge 200 - page draft treaty text .
He warned participants that just 15 days of negotiations remain before the new United Nations pact to be agreed upon in Copenhagen , and talks need to accelerate or they risk failure .

What is strange about this monkey 's face ?
Enlarge Image
A visual illusion has provided clues about how monkeys recognise faces .
In a study , rhesus monkeys responded to the " Thatcher effect " , a strange phenomenon that makes it difficult to detect changes in an upside down face .
The study , in the journal Current Biology , is the first to show this effect in non-human animals .
The authors say this suggests that the ability to identify a familiar face may have evolved in an ancestor common to humans and rhesus monkeys .
The Thatcher effect is named after Margaret Thatcher , because images of the former UK prime minister 's face were used its first demonstration , in experiments with humans .
A " thatcherised " image of a face has its mouth and eyes inverted relative to the rest of the face .
A familiar face
To test the monkeys ' response to the effect , the team assessed their responses to photographs , observing how much attention the animals paid to the images .
" We showed monkeys pictures of other monkeys , either upright or upside down until they were bored ( and stopped paying attention ) , " explained one of the authors , Robert Hampton from Emory University in Atlanta , US .
" Then we showed them ' thatcherised ' faces , again either right side up or upside down . "
When the faces were right side up , the monkeys regained interest , indicating that they noticed the change .
" When the faces were upside down , they did not , " said Professor Hampton .
" They treated it as just another boring presentation of the same picture . "
" What is surprising is that , like humans , the monkeys detect these changes strongly in upright pictures of faces , but not in faces that are upside down , " explained Professor Hampton .
" This shows that monkeys , like humans , are especially sensitive to the relationship [ between ] facial features in upright faces .
This sensitivity is likely necessary for discriminating between different faces . "
Because faces share many common features , with subtle differences in their layout , Professor Hampton explained that " detecting these differences in the layout is the key " to recognising a familiar face amongst many others .
Humans often describe upright " thatcherised " faces as gruesome , and the team are planning future studies taking physiological measures such as pupil size , to begin to address whether monkeys also find the images alarming .

Editor 's note : Dr. Vance Harris is a primary care physician in Redding , California .
An earlier version of this commentary was posted on SERMO.com , a private , physicians - only online community .
Dr. Vance Harris says primary care doctors get minuscule payment for saving the system huge sums of money .
( CNN ) --
Health policy experts agree that any reform in our health care system must include a well - educated , caring primary care doctor who is able to manage the health of his or her patients with an eye to using resources optimally to keep costs down .
That 's a tall order and it seems that few policy makers realize the value of primary care physicians .
People are making a huge assumption in this reform effort that as we extend coverage to millions who do n't have health insurance , there will be doctors there to actually provide the health care .
Fewer and fewer medical students are choosing primary care and many primary care doctors are leaving the field .
Let me share with you why we are losing so many primary care doctors .
What follows are a few examples I experience each week .
How many dozens of chest pain patients have I seen in the last month for whom I did n't order an EKG , get a consult , set up nuclear imaging or send for a catheterization ?
Only I have the advantage of knowing how anxious some are and that they have had similar symptoms over the last 20 years .
After a history and exam , I am willing to make the call that this is not heart disease .
In doing so , I save the system tens of thousands of dollars .
Most of these patients are worked into a busy day , pushing me even deeper into that mire of tardiness for which I will be chastised by at least six patients before the end of the day .
My reward for working these people in and making the call is at most $ 75 .
How many times has an anxious patient come in demanding an endoscopy who I examined and then decided to treat less invasively for three to four weeks first ?
Few of these patients are happy no matter how many times I explain that it is reasonable to treat their reflux symptoms for several weeks before endoscopy .
This delay in referral has led to many tense moments in the last 20 years .
The cost savings to the system is thousands of dollars each and every time I am willing to make the call and go with the treatment .
My reward is about $ 55 from Medicare and private health insurers .
How many low back pain patients have come to the office in agony knowing that there has to be something serious to cause this kind of pain ?
A good history and exam allows me to reassure the patient that there is nothing we need to operate on and that the risk of missing anything is low .
This takes a lot of time to explain as I teach them why they do n't need an MRI .
If someone else ordered the MRI , guess who gets to explain the significance of bulging disks to an alarmed patient ?
Setting realistic expectations on recovery and avoiding needless imaging helps saves the system thousands of dollars .
My reward is another $ 55 .
How many diabetics do I struggle with , trying to get them to take better care of themselves ?
How many hours have I spent with teenage diabetics who will not check their blood sugar and forget half of their insulin doses ?
Hundreds of hours seem wasted until one day they open their eyes and want to take care of themselves .
My reward for years of struggle is a few hundred dollars at best .
The savings to society for my hard work and never - give - up attitude is in the tens of thousands of dollars .
I am in my 22nd year in practice , now caring for 3,600 patients .
Having me in the system has resulted in savings in the hundreds of thousands of dollars each and every year .
My financial incentive to hang in there and work harder is that I now make less than half what I did 20 years ago .
This year I will make even less .
These are the reasons so many physicians have left medicine entirely and most of us who are left wonder how long can we continue to work like this ?
I have always served my fellow man out of a sense of love and compassion .
That 's why I went into medicine .
I have been richly rewarded by my patients over the decades as they have appreciated my judgment and skills .
Is n't it a shame that after all this time and with skills honed by decades of experience , many of us can no longer afford to work as a physician ?
No one is talking about this on the national level .
If they do n't address these issues , then good luck having physician assistants provide the safety net with two years of training .
Good luck getting newly trained physicians once they see our salaries .
Good luck finding internists in your community with only 1 percent of medical students going into internal medicine .
Good luck recruiting primary care specialists when we are projected to be short 39,000 by 2020 , according to the American Academy of Family Physicians .
And nearly half of all doctors surveyed by the Physicians ' Foundation have said that over the next three years they plan to reduce the number of patients they see or stop practicing entirely .
I know this is true because I am struggling to find a primary care doctor to take care of my wife and myself .
Now that is ironic .
Anyone know who is taking new patients in California ?

New Haven Independent reported :
Making parallels to the Nuremberg trials , U.S. Sen .
Chris Dodd told a gathering of liberal bloggers in New Haven he ’d support bringing charges against any Bush administration officials found responsible for the policy of waterboarding terrorism suspects .
“ I believe waterboarding is torture , ” Dodd responded .
Not only was it torture — it did n’t work , he said .
He noted that one suspect was waterboarded 183 times .
“ How effective could that be after the 90th ? ”
Dodd supported a call by Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont to have a select committee investigate the case .
Now that President Obama has released the memos , they should be put to use rather than ignored , he argued .
“ If people in fact did something that was illegal they should be pursued , ” Dodd said , no matter how high up in the Bush administration the trail leads .
He spoke of the Nuremberg trials of Nazi war criminals after World War II in making the case that people responsible for the torture should be prosecuted ; Dodd ’s father was a prosecutor at the trials .

The fields of barley , rice and wheat that feed much of India are running out of water , according to a new study based on satellite data and published online in Nature today .
The heartland of last century 's Green Revolution lost 109 cubic kilometers of water from its Indus River plain aquifer between August 2002 and October 2008 .
( Scientific American is part of the Nature Publishing Group . )
" By our estimates , the water table is declining at a rate of one foot per year averaged over the Indian states of Rajasthan , Punjab and Haryana , including the national capital territory of Delhi , " an area in northwestern India that covers more than 438,000 square kilometers , says NASA hydrologist Matthew Rodell , lead author of the paper .
" We are not able to estimate the total amount of groundwater in storage [ in the aquifer ] , so we can't say when it will be gone , but residents are already feeling the effects and it will only become worse . "
The consequences include wells that run dry , water shortages in India 's capital and , potentially , a decline in yields from agriculture .
India 's Ministry of Water Resources has long suggested that tapping the aquifer for irrigation was exceeding the limited regional rainfall that replenishes its water , and the World Bank has warned that the country faces a water crisis .
On a yearly basis , nearly 63 cubic kilometers of water are drawn from the aquifer , whereas the Indian government estimates that roughly 45 cubic kilometers of water recharge the aquifer annually .
The scientists relied on data from the pair of GRACE satellites — NASA 's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment orbiters launched in 2002 — that measure subtle changes in Earth 's gravitational field , which are often the result of shifting water , whether on the surface or deep beneath it .
In addition to large - scale water losses detected in Greenland and other polar regions by the GRACE satellites , northwestern India stands out as another area of rapid water loss .
" Basically , it is like we weigh Earth every month and we look at the changes , " explains geophysicist Isabella Velicogna of the University of California , Irvine , part of the research team .
The primary reason for such groundwater depletion is irrigation , which has fed the Green Revolution that transformed cereal production in the region and helped sustain a growing population that has reached 114 million people .
Between 1970 and 1999 irrigated fields in India tripled in overall extent to cover more than 33 million hectares .
That irrigation now looks unsustainable : " The problem is that groundwater consumption was not capped at a sustainable level and now it will be difficult to curb demand , " Rodell notes .
It is also clear that global warming 's accelerated melting of the nearby Himalayan glaciers is not the primary culprit in the region 's water deficit .
These meltwaters feed the rivers of northwestern India and beyond , but that water soon flows out of the area and is lost to it .
Even with a generous assumption that all Himalayan glacial melting since 1962 ( roughly 13.4 cubic kilometers per year ) was concentrated in the 150 - kilometer stretch of land closest to the study zone rather than spread across the entirety of the Himalayas , the scientists could explain , at most , 15 percent of the water loss in northwestern India .
And the arid region 's rainfall levels were above the average of 50 centimeters per year from 2002 to 2008 .
The water contained in the Indus River plain aquifer , once pumped , is lost to the region via evaporation from irrigation or transpiration from irrigated plants .
And GRACE has detected similar depletion in the U.S. , as well , including the Ogallala Aquifer under the western plains and the groundwater in the California 's Central Valley .
" Groundwater resources are being rapidly depleted in many regions of the world , " says U.C. Irvine hydrologist James Famiglietti , another team member .
" These signals of groundwater loss , in particular in the Central Valley , are very strong . "
The solution may be to impose limits on pumping aquifer water — particularly in the case of northwestern India , which uses it to fill seasonal rice paddies covering some 38,000 square kilometers .
" If farmers would shift away from water - intensive crops , such as rice , and implement more efficient irrigation methods , that would help , " Rodell says .
As population growth continues and food production increases , however , demand for groundwater will only increase , Famiglietti warns .
Nevertheless , this research , he says , " suggests that we can keep track of rates at which groundwater reserves are dwindling the world over . "
It was only a matter of time : Jammie Thomas - Rasset has asked the federal judge overseeing her file - sharing lawsuit to toss the $ 1.92 million damage award , reduce it to the statutory minimum of $ 18,000 , or grant her a new trial .
The motion , filed today in Minnesota federal court , is blunt .
" The verdict in this case was shocking , " it begins .
" For 24 songs , available for $ 1.29 on iTunes , the jury assessed statutory damages of $ 80,000 per song — a ratio of 1:62,015 .
For 24 albums , available for no more than $ 15 at the store , the jury assessed statutory damages of $ 80,000 per album — a ratio of 1:5,333 .
For a single mother 's noncommercial use of KaZaA , and upon neither finding nor evidence of actual injury to the plaintiffs , the judgment fines Jammie Thomas $ 1.92 million .
Such a judgment is grossly excessive and , therefore , subject to remittitur as a matter of federal common law . "
These shocking ratios — 1:62,015 and 1:5,333 — appear throughout the filing , though they 're largely irrelevant .
Thomas - Rasset was n't sued simply for violating the " reproduction right " found in the Copyright Act ; she was also accused of violating the " distribution right " by putting the songs up on KaZaA for millions of others to download .
How many people did so ?
No one knows — which is one sort of situation that statutory damages were created to address .
The real ratios can never be known .
That does n't change the fact that the jury 's verdict was nuts — or , in the words of the filing , " excessive , shocking , and monstrous . "
( Richard Marx , who wrote and performed one of the 24 songs at issue in the case , agreed . )
Thomas - Rasset 's lawyers argue that the $ 1.92 million damage award is , on its face , an unconstitutional breach of the Due Process clause and should be thrown out or reduced to the $ 750 per song minimum .
In their view , the award was quite obviously punitive in nature , and that 's a problem .
" The targets of her conduct are the largest recording companies in the United States and are hardly financially vulnerable relative to those plaintiffs — maimed children , for examples — who we think of as most deserving of punitive damages , " says the filing .
Calling the statutory damages " punitive " allows Thomas - Rasset 's lawyers to link her case to BMW v. Gore , a 1996 case that said massive punitive awards beyond a certain ratio were unconstitutional ( anything over 1:10 is generally suspect ) .
It 's hard to imagine Judge Michael Davis wanting to enter the bigtop for this circus a third time , though Thomas - Rasset 's lawyers do suggest a new trial as a possibility .
But Davis did author an extraordinary opinion after the first trial , one in which he implored Congress to change the law and expressed clear dissatisfaction with the $ 222,000 award .
With the award in the second trial nearly 10 times greater than that in the first , Davis might well be looking for some reason to cut the amount down to size — though we'd be shocked if he altered the award to a " take - nothing judgment , " as Thomas - Rasset suggests .
The third option , reducing the award to the statutory minimum of $ 18,000 ( $ 750 x 24 songs ) , would n't seem to help Thomas - Rasset much ; the labels have made clear they remain willing to settle , and past settlements ( even of cases that have gone to trial ) are generally much lower than this amount .
Finally , the lawyers make clear that Thomas - Rasset will move to exclude RIAA investigator MediaSentry 's evidence on appeal .
While Judge Davis allowed the evidence , pointing out that the company could hardly violate Minnesota 's private detective rules when it had never operated in the state , Thomas - Rasset 's team argues that MediaSentry broke private investigator rules in the states where it did operate ( New Jersey and Maryland ) , and all of its evidence should be thrown out .
For their part , the record labels also filed a motion today , asking the judge to alter the judgment against Thomas - Rasset to include a permanent injunction against future copyright infringement .
One suspects , however , that if a $ 1.92 million award is n't enough to make Thomas - Rasset stop sharing files , a permanent injunction wo n't be any more effective .
Deep in a remote desert valley , where rattlesnakes lurk in the scrub , Stephane Dreyfus and several dozen other Buddhists are preparing to undergo a mind - altering journey :
Three years , three months and three days of silence .
There will be no word from the outside world in the Great Retreat , only the deafening quiet of rock and cactus , with seemingly endless time to ponder the emptiness of life .
Dreyfus and his fellow adherents hope to find enlightenment in the silence , a gift they plan to share when they emerge from their long seclusion .
Advertisement
They know that outsiders might dismiss them as eccentrics on a strange utopian trip , but their resumes suggest otherwise .
Among them are an airline pilot , a dermatologist , a retired biochemist and a former television editor .
They ’re jettisoning the trappings of their middle - class lives to carry on a Buddhist tradition that traces its lineage through the Dalai Lamas of Tibet .
For many in the group , that means leaving behind six - figure incomes , young children or aging parents for the solitude of cramped retreat cabins made of adobe , wood -- even hay bales .
Prolonged silence , they explain , is the only way to reach the deep level of inner awareness required to bring true happiness to the world .
“ If I can get to the position of being perfectly free of suffering and develop high levels of mental clarity that cause enlightenment , I can show others how to get there perfectly , quickly , ” said Dreyfus , 32 , who left a job as an assistant editor on the prime - time show “ The Bachelor ” to teach yoga and prepare for his undertaking .

Dreyfus , a Berkeley native , will be joined by his fiancee , Jessica Kung , a Yale graduate and also a yoga teacher .
When they start the retreat late next year in this corner of southeastern Arizona , they will be newlyweds , sharing a 500 - square - foot cabin , communicating only through gestures and facial expressions , and refraining from physical intimacy .
Such pleasure , they both say , would dissipate prana -- inner energy -- distracting from the important karmic work at hand .
“ I feel a desire to have some serious PhD - like study in yoga [ and ] meditation , ” said Kung , 27 .
“ There is nothing better to do with my youth . ”
Such talk provokes bewilderment , skepticism and even anger from the family members of many of those who will join the retreat .

Hubert Dreyfus , a professor of existential philosophy at UC Berkeley , worries that his son Stephane is wasting his talent for writing and filmmaking to pursue ideas he sees as irrational .
The elder Dreyfus conceded his son is happier than ever .
Still , he can’t understand why anyone would leave loved ones behind to disappear into the desert -- in this case , for 1,190 days .
“ I ’m just torn , ” said Dreyfus , 79 .
“ I want grandchildren . ”
Enlightenment is n’t cheap .
Each retreat participant will need $ 60,000 to $ 75,000 to build a cabin and pay for three years of food and supplies ( the menu will probably include such staples as lentils , rice , beans , potatoes and other fresh vegetables ) .

Some already have set aside the money .
A few are searching for sponsors at yoga and meditation seminars , or relying on the generosity of others on the retreat .
“ I ’m waiting for a miracle , ” Ben Kramer , a 33 - year - old Floridian , said recently as he practiced yoga poses with his girlfriend inside an adobe temple not far from the retreat site .
Those on retreat will cook for themselves in cabins equipped with kitchens and bathrooms .
Power will be supplied by solar panels or propane tanks , and members will probably have air horns to summon help if something goes wrong .
Volunteer caretakers , fellow Buddhists who live nearby , will help by growing or shopping for food and dropping it off twice a week .
David Stumpf , a retired plant biochemist from the University of Arizona who is planning to join the retreat , is in charge of installing a water supply system in the valley .

Stumpf has nearly finished building the 600 - square - foot cabin he and his wife , Susan , will share on a small patch of earth surrounded by paddle cactus and ocotillo plants , whose red blooms shoot from the ground like Fourth of July fireworks .
Surveying the rolling landscape and cloud - streaked sky one recent day , the 56 - year - old proclaimed the setting ideal for deep meditation .
“ This place is stunning at sunrise , ” he said .
“ The lighting on the hillside is just magical . ”
To reach “ retreat valley , ” drive 107 miles east from Tucson on Interstate 10 through empty stretches of desert to the small town of Bowie , then head south on a narrow asphalt road .
From there , a rutted dirt roadway leads to Diamond Mountain University , a nonprofit Buddhist campus where footpaths connect an adobe temple , a tented student lounge and round Mongolian - style yurts .
Another short road from the university to retreat valley is even more primitive , coursing through brush - covered hillsides once home to a cattle ranch .

In the heart of the valley is a single yurt within sight of several cabins under construction .
This is the home of Geshe Michael Roach and Lama Christie McNally , the university ’s founders .
Roach and McNally were born in Los Angeles , two decades apart .
Both grew up as Episcopalians .
An altar boy in his youth , Roach , 56 , thought he might become a minister .
Then he traveled to India while studying religion , Sanskrit and Russian at Princeton University .
He was driven by a question he believed Christianity did not address :
If God existed , why did people suffer and die ?
It was a poignant query ; Roach ’s mother and father had died of cancer about the time he was finishing high school , and his brother had committed suicide -- all within a year of one another .

Buddhism offered him answers : Life and death had no intrinsic meaning .
Instead , reality depended on perception .
Through meditation , yoga and other practices , negative thoughts could be replaced with positive ones , allowing karmic seeds planted in the heart to ripen into happiness .
The idea of karma was key :
How people acted in the past determined what they experienced in the present .
Roach spent two decades studying at monasteries in India and the United States .
He was ordained a monk in his early 30s and later earned a Geshe degree , the equivalent of a doctorate of divinity , one of the first Westerners to do so .
McNally , 36 , who studied philosophy and literature at New York University and then traveled to Tibet and Nepal , met Roach at one of his teachings in New York in the late 1990s .
They have been spiritual -- though celibate -- partners for a decade , they say , an arrangement that has provoked criticism from some Tibetan Buddhists and scholars , who point out that monks are barred from relationships with women .
In 2006 , the office of the Dalai Lama , the spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism , cited Roach ’s “ unconventional behavior ” in rebuffing his effort to teach in Dharamsala , India , seat of the Tibetan government in exile .

“ The older lamas are disapproving , ” said Robert Thurman , a professor of Buddhist studies at Columbia University , who considers Roach a friend .
“ People have their fingers crossed that he will turn around and eventually do the conventional thing . ”
Roach and McNally respond that their stream of Buddhism encourages such partnerships , and that other Buddhist teachers have done the same , if privately .
The difference , they say , is that they publicly acknowledge theirs .
The two devote themselves to disseminating Buddhist teachings .
They have written several books on meditation and yoga , and have preserved ancient manuscripts in an extensive online database .
In 2000 , they led four other Buddhists in three years of seclusion on a ranch not far from retreat valley .
Each day , they rose at 3:30 a.m. for the first of four extended meditation sessions , which were often conducted in 120 - degree heat .
Several times , they emerged briefly from their yurts -- and Roach from his silence -- so that he could share insights .
The members wore blindfolds to help them maintain their solitary states .

“ We believe that everybody is in pain right now , because they have all these negative thoughts running in their heads all the time , ” Roach said recently .
“ If you can figure out how to stop your own pain , then you can teach other people how to stop theirs . ”
The retreat participants were so isolated that they did not learn about the Sept. 11 attacks until they came out of seclusion nearly 21 months later .
“ We still have n’t seen the footage , ” Roach said .
The project was not without mishap .
One member was bitten by a rattlesnake and had to be taken by ambulance to a Tucson hospital .
The same woman left briefly to care for her dying father after she received a letter informing her of his failing health .
Her departure was disruptive to the others , they say .
But she returned to finish the retreat , and went on to complete another .
Roach and McNally say they believe the first Great Retreat produced a concrete result : the birth of their university in the dusty flats just below the valley ’s gates .

Now , hundreds of students converge on Diamond Mountain throughout the year , supporting the university with donations and taking classes in such subjects as the nature of omniscience and the purification of negative karma .
Classes are free , but luxuries are scarce .
Student housing consists of yurts , pup tents or mobile homes stationed in the dirt parking lot .
Wasps dart overhead and the heat is ever present .
Despite the harsh conditions , Bill McMichael of Chicago jumps at every opportunity to visit Diamond Mountain , sometimes bringing along his daughter and son , ages 7 and 9 .
The 42 - year - old American Airlines pilot said he intends to quit his job flying DC - 9s to enter the three - year retreat .
He also will take a lengthy leave from his children , who will live with his former wife .
Friends will bring the kids to retreat valley two or three times a year , but McMichael will not be allowed to speak to them , communicating only through gestures or notes .
“ Leaving the kids is the most difficult part , ” he said .

McMichael has tried to explain the retreat in terms the youngsters can understand , telling them that he is going to become an angel and reach heaven , and that he will show them how to become angels too .
He sees a rare opportunity to bequeath them ancient wisdom .
“ I can give them something that death ca n’t take away , ” he said .

A High School in Maine is to be taken over by the National Guard today for the purposes of a drill that will see Guardsmen deal with unruly citizens begging for swine flu vaccines .
Oxford Hills Comprehensive High School in Paris , ME , has been chosen as a distribution site for the H1N1 flu vaccine by state officials .
Today ’s drill will enact a riot scenario after Gov. John Baldacci and Gen. John Libby , adjutant general of the Maine National Guard , agreed that measures should be in place to deal with a possible public rush for inoculations against swine flu .
“ On Thursday morning , four or five National Guard Humvees will travel from Augusta to Paris with vials of fake serum . ” reports the Maine Sun Journal .
“ The National Guardsmen will take on the roles of panicked citizens and military police and practice what they would do , such as using tear gas , in the case of a riot . ”
The article continues .
Local police will also liaise with the National Guard on the school grounds .
The school itself will remain open , according to the report .
Center for Disease Control figures state that there are 323 confirmed cases of H1N1 in Maine .
One man has died from the disease , though he was said to have “ underlying health conditions ” that were worsened by the flu .
This story dovetails with reports from late July indicating that the U.S. military is gearing up to get involved in the H1N1 swine flu outbreak promised to strike in the Fall .
“ The U.S. military wants to establish regional teams of military personnel to assist civilian authorities in the event of a significant outbreak of the H1N1 virus this fall , according to Defense Department officials , ” a proposal that is currently on the desk of Defense Secretary Robert Gates , according to a CNN report .
The report indicates that the troops could be drawn from either active duty forces or the National Guard and Reserve forces , or both .
“ As a first step , Gates is being asked to sign a so - called ‘ execution order ’ that would authorize the military to begin to conduct the detailed planning to execute the proposed plan . ” the report states .
Gates ’ overtures to usurp control of the Guard in a national emergency , and even to eventually merge the Guard and the Army Reserves into the “ Total Force ” of the U.S. military , under management of the DoD , has riled state authorities .
Last week The National Governors Association wrote to the Pentagon condemning the military ’s open plans to effectively seize domestic control of National Guard and federal forces deployed in the event of a disaster or terrorist attack .
The NGA noted that the military ’s agenda amounted to a dilution of governors ’ constitutional responsibilities .

In addition to these ongoing proposals , the Pentagon has announced that at least 20,000 more active duty soldiers will be placed inside the United States under Northcom to “ help state and local officials respond to a nuclear terrorist attack or other domestic catastrophe . ”
According to Northcom itself , the move also encompasses “ civil unrest and crowd control ” .
The ACLU has warned that the deployment represents an expansion in presidential and military authority and a militarization of homeland security .
This trend has n’t gone unnoticed on Capitol Hill either .
Georgia Congressman Paul Broun warned attendees of a town hall event Tuesday that the Obama administration is planning to use a pandemic or a natural disaster to implement martial law in the United States , in the wake of increased political unrest and plunging approval ratings .
The use of the National Guard for law enforcement duties and confrontation of the American people is becoming increasingly commonplace throughout the US .
National Guard troops were used to control the public during the Boston Marathon , the Kentucky Derby , and during New Year celebrations in Times Square last year .
As we reported last week , the sheriff of Alabama ’s most populous county has announced he will probably have to bring in National Guard troops to perform law enforcement duties due to budget cuts .
Such a move has been replicated in other parts of the country , including in Schenectady New York , where budgetary constraints were not even cited as a reason for the changeover .
Back in April of this year , The Maryland National Guard was put on alert under an anti-terrorism program in anticipation of nationwide Tea Party protests .
A “ Force Protection advisory ” document stated that Guardsmen and Guard facilities might become “ targets of opportunity . ”
One month earlier in March , the United States Army Reserve Command published a Force Protection Advisory recommending “ situational awareness ” and “ mitigation measures ” in response to End the Fed protests .
Other National Guard outfits have recently undergone training to engage in combat with “ militia ” groups , and held door to door gun confiscation drills .
Meanwhile , the Army National Guard is advertising for qualified personnel to work as Corrections Officers and Internment / Resettlement Specialists .
The use of military assets in civilian law enforcement is still illegal under Posse Comitatus , unless a clear state of emergency exists .

Thanks to Jeff for finding the video .
Jason Calacanis , of Mahalo , Weblogs , and TWIT fame , recently penned an article titled “ The Case against Apple in 5 parts ” where he details why his long love affair with Apple is coming to an end .
From what I ’ve seen and heard of Calacanis , he seems like an alright guy , but much of the reasoning in his most recent article is completely off - base and flawed , if not downright idiotic .
Chief among Calacanis ’s complaints is that Apple is in violation of anti-trust regulations for “ destroying MP3 player innovation through anti-competitive practices . ”
There is no technical reason why the iTunes ecosystem should n’t allow the ability to sync with any MP3 player ( in fact , iTunes did support other players once upon a time ) , save furthering Apple ’s dominance with their own over - priced players .
Quickly answer the following question : who are the number two and three MP3 players in the market ?
Exactly .
Most folks can’t name one , let alone two , brands of MP3 players .
Just because there ’s no technical reason does n’t mean that there ’s no reason at all .
Apple ’s goal with the iPod was to create an easy to use MP3 player via a seamless integration with iTunes .
Why , then , should Apple be forced to support a multitude of third party MP3 players when the tight integration with iTunes is what made the iPod so popular in the first place ?
And as for not being able to name the number 2 and 3 MP3 players in the market , who the hell cares ?
MP3 players existed long before the iPod came around , and if third party players were n’t able to create a dent in the market place on their own , why should Apple be blamed for actually manufacturing a product that people enjoy ?
It ’s not Apple ’s responsibility to ensure that competing products from rival companies do well in the market place , especially when you consider that the assortment of MP3 players pre-iPod were pretty shitty .
Just because Xbox Live is a great service , for example , does n’t mean Microsoft is under any obligation to make it compatible with the Sony Playstation .
Seriously .
On my trips to Japan , China and Korea over the past couple of years , I made it a point to visit the consumer electronics marketplaces like Akihabira .
They are filled with not dozens , but hundreds , of MP3 players .
They are cheap , feature - rich and open in nature .
They have TV tuners , high - end audio recorders , radio tuners , dual - headphone jacks built - in and any number of innovations that the iPod does not .
You simply will not see those here because of Apple ’s inexcusable lack of openness .
Seriously ?
If a phone comes with a TV tuner and a radio tuner , is access to iTunes really that important ?
And did n’t Calacanis say that iTunes was stifling innovation right before he mentions how amazing the MP3 players in Japan are ?
There are many MP3 players that work just perfectly without iTunes , and it ’s perplexing that Calacanis views the dearth of these feature rich MP3 players in the US as being the result of Apple keeping iTunes closed .
A more compelling reason would be that the majority of consumers do n’t want gadgets tricked out with all sorts of extras like TV - tuners and radio tuners .
They want a simple and easy to use device that plays music , and that ’s what the iPod delivers .
If the features mentioned by Calacanis were really so great , and thoughtfully implemented , consumers would n’t care about not having access to iTunes .
Think for a moment about what your reaction would be if Microsoft made the Zune the only MP3 player compatible with Windows .
Calacanis is comparing apple ’s and oranges here .
Windows is an operating system with 90 % of the OS market .
iTunes is a piece of software available for both PC ’s and Macs .
Why , then , does Steve Jobs get a pass ?
Steve Jobs gets a pass because we are all enabling him to be a jerk .
We buy the products and we say nothing when our rights are stripped away .
We ’ve been seduced by Steve Jobs : he lifts another shiny object over his head with a new eco-friendly feature and we all melt like screaming schoolgirls at Shea Stadium in ‘ 65 .
This is a common misconception often held by the technologically inclined .
Truth be told , the masses do n’t care one iota about Steve Jobs .
What they care about are products that enrich their lives and work as advertised .
For as much as people talk about Steve Jobs and his reality distortion field , the fact of the matter is that if the iPhone , for example , was an average smartphone , it simply would n’t sell .
If the iPod experience was n’t the best there was , it would n’t have become the top MP3 player on the market .
Next , Calacanis address ’s what he calls Apple ’s “ monopolistic practices in telecommunications ” industry .
Telecommunications choice is gone for Apple users .
If you buy an Apple and want to have a seemless experience with your iPhone , you must get in bed with AT&T , and as we like to say in the technology space , “ AT&T is the suck . ”
AT&T does suck , and I ’ll be the first to admit it , but the reason why the iPhone is as “ revolutionary ” as Calacanis mentions is because Apple had to agree to exclusivity in exchange for an un-precedented amount of control over the device .
From the sign - up process on iTunes , to visual voicemail , and even to the fact that there ’s no AT&T logo on the iPhone , Apple wanted to make the iPhone a uniquely Apple product , and in order to do that , it had to make certain concessions to AT&T .
This does n’t speak to Apple , but is rather a reflection of just how much control carriers were used to wielding in the pre-iPhone era .
Moreover , carrier exclusivity is common in the cell industry – just take a look at the BlackBerry Storm and the Palm Pre , available exclusively on Verizon and Sprint , respectively .
Besides , it ’s in Apple ’s interest to have the iPhone working on as many carriers as possible , and they probably can’t wait until their exclusive contract with AT&T expires and Verizon gets their 4G network rolled out .
Carrier exclusivity is n’t Apple ’s doing , and has absolutely nothing to do with monopolistic practices .
And also , does anyone really say “ AT&T is the suck ” ?
Simple solution and opportunity : Not only let the iPhone work on any carrier , but put * two * SIM card slots on the iPhone and let users set which applications use which services .
( Your phone could be Verizon and your browser Sprint ! )
Imagine having two SIM cards with 3G that were able to bond together to perform superfast uploads and downloads to YouTube .
Unless
I ’m missing something here , and I do n’t think I am , this is an absurdly horrible idea .
How in the world does managing 2 SIM cards , and paying 2 monthly bills ( 1 to Sprint and 1 to Verizon ) make any sort of sense ?
Nevermind the fact that CDMA phones do n’t use SIM cards .
Does Calacanis actually think this is a good idea , or is he just looking for publicity at this point .
Next , Calacanis complains about the lack of third party browsers in the app store and demonstrates an inability to actually research the topics he ’s writing about , or at the very least , fact - check an article he admittedly began writing months ago .
Opera ’s mobile browsers are “ full of WIN , ” as the kids like to say these days .
If you ’re a Windows Mobile or Blackberry user , you ’ve probably downloaded them and enjoyed their WINness .
The company started an iPhone browser project but gave up when faced with Apple ’s absurd and unclear mandate to developers :
Do n’t create services which duplicate the functionality of Apple ’s own software .
In other words : “ Do n’t compete with us or we will not let you in the game . ”
Another misguided point .
There are actually a number of third - party browsers in the app store that have been available since January .
And as for Opera , it ’s been reported by the well - connected John Gruber of Daring Fireball that while Opera developed an app for the iTunes App Store , it was never “ even submitted .. to Apple , let alone [ rejected ] . ”
Next up , Calacanis sets his sites on Apple ’s admittedly confusing app store policies .
Like lemmings , we fell for your bar charts extolling the openness of the iPhone App platform and its massive array of applications .
We over - paid for your phone–which you render obsolete every 13 months , like clockwork–and then signed our lives away to AT&T .
The way you pay us back is by becoming the thought police , deciding what applications we can consume on the device we over - paid for !
First , since when it is a bad thing for a company to come out with new products that render previous iterations “ obsolete . ”
Is n’t that what we want from our high - tech companies ?
Otherwise we ’re left using products like Internet Explorer .
Second , there are tens of thousands of available apps on the iTunes app store , and not every banned or rejected app falls on Apple ’s shoulders .
While Apple ’s handling of the app store has been far from perfect , it has contractual obligations with AT&T that often get ignored by the media .
Yes , every application on the phone has to approved by Apple , and if you were interested in something adult in nature … well … you ca n’t do that .
Come on now , this is just absurd .
I do n’t see adult oriented apps available for the Wii either , and lord knows the possibilities would be endless ! , so who cares about not having a full breadth of available apps on the iPhone .
I can more than manage without Slingplayer and iBoobs as the iPhone ’s functionality extends far beyond a handful of apps that Apple and / or AT&T has chosen not to support .
That said , Apple ’s handling of the app store approval process leaves much to be desired , and there ’s a ton of room for improvement , but lets not get carried away and talk about how Apple is stripping our rights away .
Perspective , people .
Imagine for a moment if every application on Windows Mobile or Windows XP had to be approved by Microsoft–how would you react ?
Exactly .
Once again we ’ve enabled Steve Jobs ’ insane control freak tendencies .
This relationship is beyond disfunctional–we are co-dependent .
Imagine for a moment if the app store instantaneously doubled in size and every other app on the iTunes app store was sex related .
Imagine how users would react .
Imagine how Calacanis and other tech pundits would react .
Apple does n’t have to draw a line in the sand , but it chose to , and I do n’t think that it ’s acting unreasonable in not allowing every and anything under the sun into iTunes .
If Apple does n’t want to support adult or violence themed apps , who ’s to say that it has to ?
And again , Apple is partnered up with AT&T and must take their interests into consideration as well .
Moreover , since all iPhone apps are sold exclusively on iTunes , Apple must be more vigilant as to what it allows on the iPhone since it ’s Apple ’s name and reputation on the line .
Think about it – are there any restrictions for developers coding apps for the Mac ?
No , because third party software may run on a Mac , but is not in any way affiliated with Apple .
Software downloaded from Apple , on the other hand , is a different story .
Also , ever notice how the people who lambast Apple for not allowing everything into the app store are often the same people who criticize Apple for allowing questionable apps into the app store ?
Calacanis continues ..
Apple took Google ’s innovative and absurdly priced phone offering , Google Voice , out of the App Store and is currently being investigated by the FCC for this action .
This point is similar to the browser issue , in that Apple wants to own almost every extension of the iPhone platform .
How long before Apple decides to ban a Twitter client in favor of an Apple Twitter - like product ?
Seems crazy , I know , but by following Apple ’s logic you should not be able to use Firefox or Google Chrome on your desktop .
For the ten billionth time , the removal of Google Voice apps was most likely a move demanded by AT&T .
So even if it ’s later determined that Apple was the guilty party , it seems a bit premature to of a sudden start accusing Apple of rejecting “ almost every extension ” on the iPhone until we have more information .
Seriously , in a sea of thousands of apps , how many app rejections from Apple are that significant and noteworthy ?
That ’s the joke of this : you ’re paying for the data services that Apple is blocking .
You pay for the bandwidth and Apple does n’t let you use it because , you know , they know better than you how you should consume your data minutes .
The joke is on Calacanis .
You ’re actually paying Apple for the iPhone , and AT&T for the bandwidth , which is just more of a reason to assume that AT&T is behind any app rejections ( Slingplayer , Google Voice ) that involve either bandwidth or carrier issues .
Calacanis finishes with this :
Apple will face a user revolt in the coming years based upon Microsoft , Google and other yet - to - be - formed companies , undercutting their core markets with cheap , stable and open devices .
Apple ’s legendary comeback ability will be for naught if they do n’t deeply examine their anti-competitive nature .
People do n’t care about open devices if that openness comes at the expense of the user experience , and there ’s no reason to believe that Apple will face a user revolt anytime soon , aside from a few self righteous tech folks like Michael Arrington who try to make ill - conceived “ statements ” by publicly declaring their intentions of switching cellphones due to “ moral ” concerns .
Like anyone cares about their phony and publicity seeking “ causes ” .
In the end , Calacanis ’ diatribe against Apple was a poorly thought out , if not typical , anti-Apple article that seeks to lay blame for all problems at Steve Jobs ’ doorstep .
Apple is a company like any other , and from time to time , it makes idiotic mistakes .
That ’s not in dispute .
But jumping from that to “ Apple is destroying innovation and stripping away my rights ! ” is lunacy , and quite frankly , odd coming from someone as into the tech scene as Calacanis .
Ridiculous .
Marco Ament has his own teardown of Calacanis ’ attempt to sound like he knows what he ’s talking about over here .

Doing it wrong
Three tenuously - related pieces of news have caught my eye recently .
Firstly : NDNAD , the UK's National DNA Database , run by the Forensic Science Service under contract to the Home Office contains DNA " fingerprints " for lots of folk — 5.2 % of the population as of 2005 , or 3.1 million people .
Some of them are criminals ; some of them are clearly innocent , but were either charged with a crime and subsequently found not guilty , or had the misfortune to be detained but not subsequently charged ( that is : they 're not even suspects ) .
The Home Office takes a rather draconian view of the database 's utility , and objects strenuously to attempts to remove the records of innocent people from it — it took threats of legal action before they agreed to remove the parliamentary Conservative Party 's Immigration spokesman from the database ( which he'd been added to in the course of a fruitless investigation into leaked documents that had embarrased the government ) — so if senior opposition politicians have problems with it , consider the prospects for the rest of us .
In use ...
Whenever a new profile is submitted , the NDNAD 's records are automatically searched for matches ( hits ) between individuals and unsolved crime - stain records and unsolved crime - stain to unsolved crime - stain records - linking both individuals to crimes and crimes to crimes .
Matches between individuals only are reported separately for investigation as to whether one is an alias of the other .
Any NDNAD hits obtained are reported directly to the police force which submitted the sample for analysis .
Now , this in itself is merely a steaming turd in the punchbowl of the right to privacy : but its use as a policing intelligence tool is indisputable .
While there are some very good reasons for condemning the way it 's currently used ( for example , its use in the UK has sparked accusations of racism ) , I can't really see any future government forgoing such a tool completely ; a DNA database of some kind is too useful .
So what interests me here is the potential for future catastrophic failure modes .
I 'd like to note in passing that the cost and effort required to conduct DNA sequencing is dropping like a stone , following a path faster than Moore 's Law — the price of sequencing has fallen off a cliff , and an exhausting personalized genome sequence can now be had for around $ 50,000 and a couple of weeks ' work .
For comparison , back in 1998 or thereabouts the same job had taken several years and $ 100 M .
We 're en route to hand - held realtime sequencers within the very near ( 5 - 10 year ) future .
And , aside from medicine , the consequences will be interesting ...
This week sees the publication of a paper that suggests that standard molecular biology techniques such as PCR , molecular cloning , and recently developed whole genome amplification ( WGA ) , enable anyone with basic equipment and know - how to produce practically unlimited amounts of in vitro synthesized ( artificial ) DNA with any desired genetic profile .
See also : faking up a crime scene .
Because of the nature of DNA evidence it 's actually physically easier to distribute it around a location than it would be to fake conventional forensic evidence such as fingerprints .
Meanwhile , in Australia ... oh , this one almost beggars belief :
Police computer security experts claimed responsibility for taking over the r00t - you.org cybercrime forum as part of a sting operation on ABC's Four Corners TV programme ...
The Feds had reportedly configured their own systems as a honeypot designed to track and trace denizens logging into the forum .
Police gained access to the forum not through infiltration but after raiding the Melbourne home of the forum 's alleged administrator last Wednesday .
...
Unfortunately the wheels fell off the scheme , because the officers involved failed to set a password on the database behind the honeypot site .
Yes : they tried to guddle a bunch of hackers and forgot to set the root password on the MySQL database they were using to store the evidence .
Combined with other instances of mind - boggling stupidity this is beginning to convince me that policing and IT security work are incompatible ; that is , that the culture , training , and career structure of policing is generally inimical to understanding IT security .
The vast majority of police work is about tracking down and apprehending lawbreakers after a crime has been committed ; the vast majority of offenses are committed on the spur of the moment by not - terribly - bright folks with poor impulse control : and police are frequently expected to multi-task and deal with multiple cases in parallel .
But in the INFOSEC sector the paradigm is turned on its head — it 's necessary to carefully consider and plan to defend against attacks that have n't happened yet and to work on the assumption that the attacker is intelligent , tenacious , and has invested a vast amount of effort in advance planning .
Even if they have n't , even if the attacker is merely a script kiddie playing with a tool someone else invented , you 're up against the inventor 's brain rather than the idiot attacking you — the rifle designer rather than the trigger man .
What are the risks of a national DNA database maintained for policing intelligence purposes , once DNA evidence faking becomes possible ?
Well , one possibility is that , if sequence information for a named individual can be obtained from the database , your upper class of criminal might well use it to frame rivals — spreading it around the site of a bank robbery or wholesale drug distribution hub , for example .
Another possibility is that if the database is inadequately secured — and with cops waving handheld scanners with live broadband connections around , that 's not a wild stretch — we might see some alarming injection attacks on the database , along the lines of short tandem repeat sequences tied to the name and other details of extremely violent criminal .
If you really hate someone and want to fuck them up , stick their DNA in such a database , tagged as belonging to a violent serial rapist or armed robber .
Why do I think this is a problem ?
Well , the NDNAD is a single , fat , juicy target for hackers : to do its job it must remain accessible to police officers all over the country , which in turn means it has to be online , and therefore difficult to secure .
To a wily hacker it's a priceless target : one they can use to both mislead ongoing police investigations and assault their rivals ( using the police as a proxy ) .
And the singular nature of the database makes it a single point of failure for the forensic science service .
This leads me to a fairly important conclusion : the can of worms — the hackable , fakable , fallible DNA database — is already here , and the law of bureaucracy says it is n't going away .
But it needs to be secured .
To do so , it 's essential that it not be used as an authentication tool for identifying individuals .
Moreover , DNA evidence can no longer be seen as sufficient on its own to secure a conviction in court .
Online checks will still have a place — but only if they 're used to match individuals against evidence found at crime scenes , and even then , only as an indicator ( not as evidence in its own right ) .

The re-release of the entire Beatles album catalogue has unleashed another wave of veneration for the 60s pop band .
But could there really be anyone who actively dislikes their music ?
James Bond apparently hated The Beatles .
In Goldfinger , he advises Jill Masterson that " drinking Dom Perignon ' 53 above the temperature of 38 degrees " is " as bad as listening to The Beatles without earmuffs " .
The Bond girl 's own verdict on the Fab Four , unfortunately , is not recorded before her untimely demise on the inside of a coating of gold paint .
That was 1964 , when 007 may have felt threatened by that year 's global success of The Beatles ' first movie , A Hard Day 's Night .
Beatles for Sale - the new Rock Band game could net $ 40 m for the Beatles Two years into their recording career and with Beatlemania raging on both sides of the Atlantic though , Bond was going characteristically violently against the prevailing mood .
Forty - five years later , four decades after the Fab Four parted ways , his remark would be considered even more extraordinary , almost sacrilegious .
The devotional , feverish excitement over this week 's release of re-mastered versions of all 13 UK Beatles albums highlights the band 's unique , enduring appeal .
The first 50,000 box sets of mono versions of the discs , priced at £ 170 , have already sold out , according to record company EMI .
Saturation media coverage to mark the release of the albums , of which an estimated billion copies already reside in record collections worldwide , has been led by the BBC's " Beatles Week " series of programmes .
The Beatles seem to occupy a uniquely unassailable position in popular culture - everybody loves them .
Do n't they ?
What year did Paul McCartney write Silly Love Songs ?
1963 , 1964 , 1965 , 1966 , 1967 ...
I Hate the Beatles website Not Robert Elms .
The author and broadcaster is one of a tiny minority who seem willing to stick their heads above the parapet and rubbish this most sacred of British institutions .
" They did a few things that lots of people liked , " says Elms .
" Everybody can like them , from grandma singing along to When I'm Sixty - Four to the little girl singing Yellow Submarine . "
But he adds : " I just think they are either childlike and simple or rather leaden and pompous - one or the other all the time . "
Theirs is a sanitised and anaemic version of American blues - inspired rock and roll , he complains .
" For me they turned something that was once sexy and raw and had roots , into something that was totally soulless , playground sing - along music . "
It 's the sort of talk which risks a midnight knock on the door from Britain 's popular culture thought police .
Guaranteed a place on every Beatles fan 's dartboard - Robert Elms
While he concedes that they did write some good songs , he can list rather more of what he calls The Beatles ' " crimes against music " - Ob - La - Di , Ob - La - Da , Maxwell 's Silver Hammer , Octopus 's Garden .
Elms will not play
The Beatles on his BBC London daily radio show , and says feedback from listeners suggests " there is a perhaps relatively small but vociferous group of people " who share his opinion of the band .
In an article for the Glasgow paper The Herald some years ago , author and music critic David Keenan set out to find musicians who shared his dislike of The Beatles - and could find no - one .
" It is a canon that you cannot question , " he says .
" Most people actually think you are just doing it for effect , putting on a front , playing the devil 's advocate . "
That this is the usual response is confirmed by Elms , who insists : " I do mean it ; it 's not made up . "
Yoko lovers
However , occasionally mocking the supposed greatest band of all time can be " quite fun " as well , he admits .
David Keenan 's favourite Beatle ?
Yoko Ono " I think everything that is over - inflated deserves a pin-prick in it occasionally , " Elms says .
" How can they be above criticism ?
That 's ludicrous . "
Nor are the band any more sacred to Keenan , who says : " There is something so incredibly prissy about their music . "
He adds : " I am in such a minority that my favourite Beatle is Yoko Ono ; without Yoko 's influence I do n't think there would be any Beatles music I could listen to . "
The avant - garde artist 's influence in the latter stages of The Beatles ' career inspired John Lennon , and in turn Paul McCartney , to new extremes of sonic adventure , he argues .
However , it is the slick pop of the band 's early years that is to blame for the tameness of most UK guitar music today , he insists .
" The Beatles are the absolute curse of modern indie music , " Keenan says .
" Anyone who says they are influenced by The Beatles , alarm bells start to go off ; it means they are going to be completely ordinary .
It 's about writing this perfectly - crafted music , the classic song - in inverted commas .
It 's not about being adventurous . "
Branded a moron Keenan 's search for likeminded dissenters finally found success , inevitably , on the internet .
' Phoney Beatlemania ' - Comrade Strummer before entering re-education
The scattered online outposts of anti-Beatles sentiment include Suckmybeatles.com - tag - line : " Let it be ...over . "
Sean , who runs the site , says fans ' reactions range from " disbelief " to considering him " downright offensive " .
" At first I 'm accused of not knowing their material - usually while it 's being played behind them in Muzak form , " he says .
" After I 've proved that I 'm familiar with the music , and that I can spout just as much useless trivia , I 'm branded a moron who does n't understand music and a dangerous lunatic who should be avoided . "
" Q : What year did Paul McCartney write Silly Love Songs ?
A : 1963 , 1964 , 1965 , 1966 ... " is typical of the witty tone of the I Hate The Beatles !
Why do n't you ?
web page .
But the hate mail these sites apparently attract suggests many Beatles fans fail to see the funny side of having their great heroes abused .
A rare fan Suckmybeatles.com 's Sean , of Toronto , Canada , even refuses to give his full name , owing , he says , to past death threats .
" I 've been told the Beatles are all about ' peace ' and ' love ' ( gimme a break , they 're just a rock and roll band ) and in the next sentence [ they ] threaten me with death , " explains the home page of the site , Help !
The Beatles Suck .
Cuddly mop tops with acute pop sensibilities ... or insipid pop imperialists
Elms confirms : " On the internet , I can find some people who will hate me to the ends of the Earth because I do n't like their favourite pop group . "
Daily Telegraph music critic Neil McCormick , who calls The Beatles ' work " the most extraordinary musical journey in pop history " , is among those fans sceptical of an opposing view .
" It is a position people adopt because of the universal high regard for them , " he says .
" Popular music was in its infancy - with the talents compressed into that group they pulled it in every possible direction . "
The resulting musical diversity to be found between 1962's Love Me Do and 1970's The Long and Winding Road includes something for everybody to enjoy , McCormick argues .
" There is a lifetime of music in The Beatles . "
He adds : " If you like popular music of the modern day , to say that you do n't like The Beatles is kind of absurd .
" It is the fount of popular culture . "
Below is a selection of your comments :
At the time I can remember plenty of people who were not Beatles fans .
They were Rolling Stones fans instead .
Like Blur vs Oasis , you were meant to take sides .
Lawrence , Crowthorne , UK Kudos to Elms et al for being intellectually honest .
No -one can dispute the impact they had on pop culture ; but was their music really any good ?
The crazed responses these bloggers have received for voicing honest opinions simply shows the true legacy of the Beatles : rather than being truly " Revolution " ary , they have merely brought generations of mindless sheep into the useless pop culture fold .
Tom , Red Hook , New York Music is a personal thing - what makes one person smile can sound like nails on a blackboard to someone else .
But you cannot argue with the fact that if there were no Beatles , popular music today would be very different !
I am proud to be a fan !
Theresa , London
I think that the majority 's view of The Beatles is clouded by the fact that they are considered to be a national institution .
If we were able to remove all of the glitter and hype that surrounds them , all that would be left is a slightly above average band ... please do n't kill me !
Jose Yossarian , London
Put simply , there are some Beatles tunes I like , and some I do n't .
Does that make me a non-music - loving moron ?
I think not .
Just honest .
I respect everything that they achieved , but do n't worship the ground they walk on and love every track by default .
That said , I would challenge anyone who is a member of one of these " The Beatles Suck " websites to , honestly , and I think that is the key word here , " honestly " , say that there is n't a single Beatles track that they do n't like in some way .
If they can answer yes to that , then I would imagine they do n't like any music at all .
Stuart , High Wycombe I grew up in Liverpool in the 70s and 80s .
This was before the city decided that The Beatles were the route to economic salvation and so I did n't pay too much attention to them .
I 'll never forget , though , a playground encounter with one of the many school bullies that populated the school .
Asked what my opinion was of The Beatles , and thinking that this character was unlikely to be a fan , I replied that they were a bit rubbish .
For that I received a punch in the mouth .
I learned my lesson then and there .
Geoff , Louth , Lincolnshire I 've always disliked * most* of the Beatles music .
Lennon 's voice always sounded so " nasally " and the music was generally IMHO overrated .
" Eleanor Rigby " and a couple of other tracks stand out as quite good , but mostly as soon as I hear a Beatles song , I switch it off .
Tym , Clitheroe
It is not sacrilege to have musical preferences .
Even John Lennon said , " I do n't believe in Beatles . "
Perry Callas , Astoria , Oregon I 've never liked The Beatles , but I do like Oasis .
Is that weird ?
Rich , Plymouth I can relate to the reactions the guys in this article get .
I was treated much the same when I pointed out that Michael Jackson was just a normal human being ; that he had n't cured cancer , walked on water or done anything else similarly amazing , just lived a very public life , and then died a very pubic death .
The Beatles are the same .
They had some popular music that people agree to say they like so as not to look uncool - notice a pattern with the Arctic Monkeys anybody ?
James B , Sheffield
To say that you do n't like The Beatles is the same as saying that you do n't like non-classical music .
There is far too much diversity in their music for all their songs to be disliked .
Such people either genuinely think that She Loves You , etc is all they did and probably have n't even heard of the White Album , or they are just trying to be controversial for the sake of it .
David Kelly , Woodbridge , Suffolk I deeply resent paying time and time again for music already paid for countless millions of times over by Beatles fans across the globe .
£ 200 during a recession is just pure greed and the cynics amongst us might think that Paul McCartney 's stock must have taken a knock during the recent market crash .
Give us back our heritage , Paul .
You can't take it with you .
John and George must be turning in their graves !
Carl Eley , Cardiff I had the entire Beatles back catalogue on my iPod for a while and found myself skipping tracks constantly .
I maybe like a quarter of their stuff .
We should n't forget , though , that they were true pioneers in a time when most artists did n't even write their own songs , let alone use studio effects , orchestras and , let 's not be coy , drugs , to push the boundaries of popular music .
Even their style of dress and the way they wore their hair influenced a generation .
Without them we'd have had another 40 years of the 12 - bar blues by men in leather jackets .
Their impact cannot be underestimated .
For that much they deserve their adulation .
Gruff Jones , Wrexham The Beatles are hugely overrated .
That does not mean that they were bad , just that they were overrated .
While they have a body of work that is not without interest and not without a few gems , the music of today would be far better off if they had never formed .
Their legacy , aside from the music , is bland drumming , average bass - playing , and cliched pop songs lacking in passion - the sort of music which might have fitted in perfectly at a small club in the hometown of skiffle .
The Beatles ' music lacks the passion and raw emotion that proper rock and roll / blues has , and it lacks the meaning of folk music .
Decidedly average .
Anthony Lazarus , London I view The Beatles in the same way I view the Ford Model T car .
There 's no doubt it was revolutionary at the time and had a big influence on subsequent automobiles .
However , it was n't the best car ever made and I certainly would n't want to drive one today .

Olá amigo seguidor !
Se você está costumado a acompanhar nosso trabalho aqui no blog , sabe que somos dedicados a apresentar as melhores soluções para você levar uma vida mais plena , ativa e transbordando de saúde .
Pois bem .
Depois da minha recomendação do curso Queima de 48h , eu recebi muitas perguntas a respeito de se vale a pena ou não buscar uma academia .
A verdade é que isso depende muito de você , do seu estilo de treino , de horário e de facilidade em adaptação .
Por exemplo , se você busca praticar pilates em são roque , não adianta você comprar um curso online .
Pois o pilates é um tipo de exercício que se você não souber o que está fazendo e não tiver uma supervisão , os resultados podem ser altamente prejudiciais ao invés de devolverem todos os benefícios que esses exercícios podem trazer .
É claro que você pode fazer pilates na sua casa , fazendo uso dos exercícios de chão e de alguns apetrechos como a bola .
A diferença é que você não irá usufruir todos os benefícios de se fazer com aparelhos e , qualquer erro é por sua conta .
Veja , o pilates é um dos tipos de exercícios físicos mais completos que existe .
Ele é capaz de abranger todos os músculos do seu corpo e , quando feito corretamente , sem acarretar em desgaste de articulação ou sobrecarregar algum outro músculo ou membro .
Todas as pessoas , de qualquer idade , inclusive grávidas podem fazer o pilates .
A diferença de se buscar uma academia em são roque e de fazer uma sequência de exercícios em casa .
Veja… alguns cursos promovem aulas bastante didáticas sobre sequências de exercícios para se fazer em sua própria casa , o que facilita demais na hora de você pratica - los em sua residência .
Esses cursos , elaborados com muita cautela , permite que somente de assistir , você consiga repetir todas as sequências , sem sair de casa ou precisar de um personal trainer .
Agora , se você tem zero experiência com qualquer tipo de atividade física , o ideal é começar devagar e de preferência , com auxílio e supervisão especializada de um profissional .
Pelo menos para você conseguir pegar a mecânica correta de como se faz exercícios .
E assim , você evitará qualquer problema com seu corpo .
Inclusive , eu fortemente recomendo que você busque sempre uma opinião médica de qualidade para saber se você está apto para começar uma sequência de atividades físicas e quais são as mais indicadas para você .
Não é todo mundo que pode sair levantando peso por aí .
Você pode ter algum problema de articulação .
As vez , o seu caso é melhor fazer natação mesmo e não forçar nada além do seu próprio limite .
Quando você adquiri um curso online , é de extrema importância verificar a procedência dele .
Nem todos são super - recomendados , conceituados e feito com muito carinho , como é o caso do Queima de 48 horas .
Fique atento !
Lembre - se procure seu médico , veja o que é melhor para você , academia , pilates , natação … e se for possível comece a pensar em adaptar essa sequência para fazer em casa , se for viável e fácil para você .
Espero que tenham gostado de mais essa recomendação para vocês .

Microsoft Live Labs has launched Seadragon.com , a site that allows you to share virtually any size image on the web .
Microsoft 's Seadragon technology aims to make browsing images , no matter how large , a speedy , seamless , and smooth experience .
As of version 2 , Silverlight includes a feature called Deep Zoom , which in essence is Seadragon converted for use across multiple browser and platforms .
Seadragon.com is built entirely on top of Windows Azure , with the same Community Technology Preview that is available to the public .
There are three steps to using the service :
Find : the URL to an image on the web .
Make sure it's to the image directly , not to a page that contains it .
Paste : the URL into the textbox above and hit " Create " We 'll need some time to prepare it if we have n't seen it before .
Share : the resulting Seadragon experience with your friends , or embed the viewer directly into your own site .
For example , if you take this image of the Seattle skyline and hand it over to Seadragon , the site will give you this URL as well as a script that lets you embed the new image wherever you 'd like :
As you can see , the embedded viewer adjusts dynamically to the layout of the page .
However , it can also be customized to a specific size by simply changing the size numbers in the code .
In short , no matter how big the image is , it can easily fit on your site .
The beautiful part is that your readers do n't need to have Silverlight installed .
Seadragon.com will use Silverlight ( smoother experience and better performance ) if it 's available , and otherwise will use an AJAX control if it is n't .
Pretty nifty !
I was a sears employee , before they wrongfully accused me of embezzling money from a company that I put my heart and soul in to for the past 6 months .
I can assure you that I am a well kept and honest person .
To have my character attack so , hurt me very much mentally and emotionally .
Why was I chosen to have such allegations put on my table I guess I will never know but I can tell you one thing I was the best the had .
I was taught that good things happen to good people but I know now that good things never happen to those people they just got lucky .
I was very unlucky to have spent all my time and effort in a company that can give two craps about who you are .
Personally I will never work for sears or kmart again all they do is scam people out of there money and whom ever maybe reading this do n't apply for a sears card and if you have one cancel it because they are going to boost the interest rates and start charging you even when you do n't use it .
So take my advise from the other side of that evil rotten phony company of theirs and tell them to shove it .
Did you know that when you apply for a credit card they get $ 1000.00 for each one as an individual I made them the month of july $ 81 , 000 dollars and I got fired because a friend gave me a gift card for $ 0.94 that I used for my purchase .
That 's how low down they are so whether you are a customer or an employee they will and I do mean will # you over ...

" Wir sind letztlich dabei , uns selbst zu erfinden " Nico Nissen
Thorsten Wirth , Mitglied des Bundesvorstandes der Piratenpartei , über das Wahlprogramm , Verschwörungstheoretiker und die Verbindung der Internet - und Parteikultur
Die Piratenpartei hat es geschafft .
Sie wurde in 15 Bundesländern zur Bundestagswahl zugelassen .
Freitheit statt Angst ist einer der Wahlkampfslogans .
Über das Programm , das Verhältnis zu den anderen politischen Parteien und das Selbstverständnis der Piraten sprach Nico Nissen für Telepolis mit Thorsten Wirth , Informatiker , Spitzenkandidat der Piratenpartei in Hessen und Mitglied im Bundesvorstand .
Thorsten Wirt
Am 18 .
Juli teilte die Piratenpartei mit , dass sie Bodo Thiesen seines Amtes als stellvertretender Schiedsrichter enthoben habe und ein Parteiausschlussverfahren einleitet .
Er hat vor über fünf Jahren abwegige Ansichten zum Holocaust vertreten und sich offenbar nicht weitreichend genug davon distanziert .
Dennoch bleibt der Makel , dass er überhaupt zum Ersatzmitglied des Bundesschiedsgerichtes gewählt wurde , nachdem er auf dem Bundesparteitag eine kritische Frage beiseite wischte .
War die Piratenpartei zu blauäugig was Thiesen anbelangt ?
Thorsten Wirth : Ich glaube nein .
Der Hype für die Piratenpartei fing erst nach der Europawahl und dem Zensursula - Gesetz richtig an .
Erst danach sind die Leute in großer Zahl auf uns aufmerksam geworden und eingetreten .
Von daher wussten sie auch nicht , dass wir die Diskussion letztes Jahr in Hannover bereits geführt hatten .
Damals ist über Indymedia an die Öffentlichkeit gelangt , was Bodo Jahre zuvor von sich gegeben hat .
Die Situation war dann natürlich sehr angespannt , weil behauptet wurde , er wäre ein wahnsinnig Rechtsradikaler oder ähnliches .
Von der Tiefe der Diskussion , die wir letztes
Jahr schon geführt hatten , können die neuen Mitglieder nichts gewusst haben .
Wenn man sich das Forum der Piratenpartei ansieht , liest man viel von Leuten , die offenbar abstrusen Verschwörungstheorien anhängen .
Zieht die Piratenpartei solche Leute an ?
Thorsten Wirth : Ich glaube nicht mehr als andere Parteien auch .
Die unterdrücken aber solche Stimmen , indem sie alles , was sie machen , moderieren .
Das machen wir grundsätzlich nicht .
Über unserem Forum steht dick geschrieben , dass es ein offenes und öffentliches Medium ist , mit dem keine offiziellen Stellungnahmen der Partei verbreitet werden .
Es wird auch nicht überprüft , ob derjenige , der sich registriert , überhaupt Pirat ist .
Jeder kann sich registrieren und einloggen und dann von sich geben , was er meint , von sich geben zu müssen .
Mitunter hat das auch überhaupt nichts mit dem zu tun , was die Piratenpartei ist .
Macht die Piratenpartei sich dadurch nicht unnötig angreifbar ?
Gerade bei Leuten , die gar keine Ahnung von Internet und Foren haben , könnte es Vorurteile erzeugen , wenn berichtet wird , im Forum der Piratenpartei hätte man sich so oder so geäußert .
Thorsten Wirth : Damit müssen wir wohl leben .
Diese Angst vor der Angreifbarkeit hat bei uns auch kein überwiegendes Moment , wenn wir uns bereits einen Namen gegeben haben , der uns angreifbar macht .
Problemfall Jörg Tauss
Zu einem weiteren Problem könnte sich Jörg Tauss entwickeln .
Der ehemalige SPD - Abgeordnete , gegen den wegen des Verdachts , kinderpornografisches Material gesammelt zu haben , ermittelt wird , trat zur Piratenpartei über und wurde dort euphorisch empfangen .
Die SPD ist den Schwarzen Peter somit los .
Der ermittelnde Staatsanwalt hat angekündigt , die Aufhebung seiner Immunität zu beantragen , um Klage erheben zu können .
Die Piratenpartei , die betont , Internetsperren nicht wegen des leichteren Zugangs zur Kinderpornografie abzulehnen , sondern weil sie den Einstieg in die Internetzensur fürchtet , würde im Falle seiner Verurteilung von ihren Gegnern als Pädophilen - Partei dargestellt werden .
Was wird die Piratenpartei tun , wenn es zur Anklage kommt und er vielleicht sogar verurteilt wird ?
Thorsten Wirth : Die Staatsanwaltschaft hat ja schon in ihrem unsäglichen " Bild " - Interview angekündigt , dass sie Anklage erheben wird .
Von daher ist uns klar , dass das kommen wird .
Herr Tauss ist zweifelsfrei die schillerndste Persönlichkeit , die die Bürgerrechte im Internet verteidigt .
Dass die SPD ihn verliert , ist ihre eigene Schuld .
Herr Tauss hat seine Verfehlungen zugegeben und seine Gründe dafür genannt .
Soweit ich informiert bin , wurden nur wenige Bilder bei ihm gefunden , auf seinem Computer gar nichts .
Wir halten die Aussagen von Tauss für absolut glaubwürdig , weil ein wirklicher Pädophiler nicht nur 10 oder 20 Bilder hat , sondern wesentlich mehr Material horten würde - so stand es zumindest in einem Artikel zum Thema .
Sollte er dennoch verurteilt werden , hängt es für uns davon ab , wozu er verurteilt wird und wie die Urteilsbegründung lautet .
Dazu können wir aber im Vorfeld noch nichts sagen .
Wir müssen abwarten .
Die Presse wird aber schon ihr eigenes Urteil fällen , auch ohne Richter .
Wurde je darüber nachgedacht , dass der Übertritt in die Piratenpartei zu Tauss ' Verteidungsstrategie gehören könnte ?
Thorsten Wirth : Niemand kann die Absichten eines anderen ergründen .
Man kann nicht in sein Gehirn hineinschauen .
Aber was wäre für uns für ein Schaden entstanden , wenn sich das tatsächlich herausstellen würde ?
Wir betreiben Lobbyarbeit für diejenigen , die vorher keine Lobby hatten
Befürchten
Sie nicht , dass
Sie den liberalen Parteien , die im Gegensatz zu ihnen über die Fünf - Prozent - Hürde kommen , wie der FDP und den Grünen , so viele Stimmen nehmen werden , dass sie eher zum Wahlerfolg der CDU beitragen ?
Also der Partei , die ihr eigentlicher politischer Gegner ist ?
Im Grunde würden Sie dadurch den Zielen Ihrer Mitglieder und Wähler schaden .
Thorsten Wirth : Wenn man seine Themen und Interessen dafür opfert , irgendwelche politischen Konstellationen zu verhindern , kann man auch fragen , warum die Grünen nicht der SPD den Rücken stärken , oder man kann danach fragen , weshalb es überhaupt Die Linke gibt .
Wir verfolgen aber ureigenste politische Themen und Interessen , die von keiner Partei abgedeckt und behandelt werden .
Wir betreiben Lobbyarbeit für diejenigen , die vorher keine Lobby hatten .
All das gibt uns eine Lebensberechtigung .
Wenn wir anderen Parteien wegen ihres Unvermögens Stimmen wegnehmen , dann ist das nicht zu ändern .
Die Piratenpartei hat nach eigenen Angaben mehr als 5000 Mitglieder .
Mit dieser Mitgliederzahl hätte man locker einen Parteitag der Grünen oder der FDP dominieren können .
Weshalb ist man nicht einfach diesen Parteien beigetreten und hat ihnen den überfälligen Modernisierungsschub verpasst ?
Thorsten Wirth : Die vielen Freunde , die ich in anderen Parteien , beispielsweise bei den Grünen , habe , leiden ohne Ende darunter , dass sie eine Bundestagsfraktion haben , die ganz anders agiert und abstimmt , als sie es sich wünschen .
Dort sind eingefahrene Strukturen , die wir knacken müssten , und das würde nicht einfach dadurch gehen , dass wir mit 5000 Leuten z. B. die FDP kapern .
Wir bauen unsere eigenen Strukturen und unsere eigene Identität , und gerade um eine eigene Identität geht es .
Wir haben auch Ziele , die unabhängig von denen der Grünen und der FDP sind .
Zwar werden wir auch von anderen Parteien dazu aufgefordert , ihnen beizutreten , aber da sage ich nur : Nein !
Das ist keine Alternative .
Die Alternative sind wir selbst .
Aber zumindest die offiziellen Ziele der Grünen z. B. im Datenschutz liegen gar nicht so weit von denen der Piratenpartei entfernt .
Sie haben z. B. das Gesetz zu den Internetsperren stark kritisiert .
Thorsten Wirth : Nichts desto trotz haben 15 Abgeordnete ihrer Fraktion sich enthalten , mit sehr zweifelhaften Argumenten .
Das macht die Grünen in meinen Augen unglaubwürdig .
Bei ihnen fehlt es an einer entsprechenden Geisteshaltung - anders als bei uns .
Obendrein ist das Gesetz zur Internetzensur in allen Bereichen fragwürdig , was z .
B. die Gewaltenteilung anbelangt , oder wer die Sperrlisten einsehen darf .
All dieses Missbrauchspotential ist mit Grundrechten nicht vereinbar .
Als damaliger Vorsitzender des Landesverbandes Hessen äußerten Sie stolz die Vermutung , dass die 7000 Stimmen , die die Piratenpartei bei den hessischen Landtagswahlen 2008 erhalten hat , die waren , die Andrea Ypsilanti zum Wahlsieg fehlten .
Ist das nicht eine destruktive Politikauffassung ?
Wenn die nicht wollen wie wir , klauen wir ihnen halt die Stimmen .
Thorsten Wirth : Nein .
Ich muss noch dazu sagen , dass zu der Zeit , als ich das gesagt habe , die Euphorie groß war .
Es war die erste Wahl außerhalb Schwedens , bei der eine Piratenpartei angetreten ist , und letztendlich war es nur ein Rechenexempel beziehungsweise eine Behauptung , die so überhaupt nicht nachprüfbar ist .
Ob es denn wirklich unsere Stimmen waren , die ihr gefehlt haben , müssen Wahlforscher feststellen .
Als destruktiv würde ich das nicht bezeichnen - eher als übermütig .
Auch die Grünen haben mit nur einem
Thema angefangen
Die Piratenpartei spricht mit ihrem Programm nur eine kleine Gruppe Wähler an und wird daher sicherlich unter der Fünf - Prozent - Hürde bleiben .
Das Programm ist allerdings absichtlich so schmal gehalten , weil man sich auf den größten gemeinsamen Nenner einigen wollte , und soll erst nach den Wahlen weiter verfeinert werden .
Das Ungefähre im Programm hat ja bisher den regen Zulauf von Rechts und Links ermöglicht .
Thorsten Wirth : Ich weiß nicht , worin da grundsätzlich das Problem besteht .
Dass wir ein überschaubares Programm haben , ist ja hinlänglich bekannt .
Die Frage ist , wie viel Musik dahinter steckt .
Wenn man sich die Themen mal anschaut , z. B. die Patentrechte , muss man eben auch feststellen , dass sie viele Einflussmöglichkeiten haben und viele weitere Aussagen hergeben , z .
B. zu wirtschaftlichen oder sozialen Themen oder zur Frage , wie mit Eigentum umgegangen wird , die durchaus einen philosophischen Hintergrund hätten .
Wer will , kann dort Tiefe finden .
Wer sie nicht finden will , und das wollen eben viele nicht , findet keine Tiefe , weil er keine finden kann , egal was man schreibt .
Wir haben zwar keine Aussagen darüber , wie wir Grauwale oder das Klima retten können , aber wir haben Aussagen darüber , wie wir Informationen austauschen , wie wir mit der " Struktur Menschheit " generell anders umgehen können .
Und diese Aussagen haben auch eine fundamentale Bedeutung für unser Zusammenleben .
Den Leuten , die das " Weltverbesserungspotential " darin erkennen können , reichen wir die Hand .
Dass wir nicht für jede Frage im Leben eine Antwort haben , liegt darin , dass wir eine noch junge Partei sind , die erst mal sehen muss , wie sie solche Einzelfragen mit ihrem Grundprogramm vereinen kann .
Aber das ist eine Sache , die über kurz oder lang kommen wird .
Schließlich haben die Grünen auch mit nur einem Thema angefangen .
Die Piraten interessieren sich für die Frage , wie unsere Gesellschaft mit dem Informationszeitalter umgeht
Über weitere Programmpunkte wird im Forum auf der Homepage der Piratenpartei bereits heftig diskutiert , wobei ein linker und ein rechter Flügel versuchen , die Partei für sich zu vereinnahmen .
So wünschen sich einige Mitglieder Stellungnahmen zur Agenda 2010 und Hartz IV .
Viele Unterstützer der Piratenpartei und auch einige Vorstandsmitglieder , einschließlich Ihnen , halten das alte Links - Rechts - Schema jedoch für überholt .
Besteht nicht die Gefahr , dass die kommenden Programmdiskussionen zu Streitigkeiten führen und die Partei sprengen werden ?
Thorsten Wirth : Selbst wenn wir eine Stellungnahme zur Agenda 2010 oder Hartz IV herausgeben würden , könnte man die Piratenpartei immer noch nicht klar links oder rechts einordnen .
Denn Links und Rechts sind nur Konstrukte .
Wo steht beispielsweise heute die SPD ?
Ist das die Mitte ?
Wo liegt denn die Mitte ?
Wenn ich frage : " Ist die CDU rechts ? " , was bedeutet dann eigentlich " rechts " ?
Bei der DVU ließe sich klar sagen , die sind ganz rechts , und Die Linke , die ist links , die haben es ja schon im Namen .
Aber weshalb müssen wir uns in so ein Schema einordnen ?
Nur weil es vorgegeben worden ist ?
Ist das ein Naturgesetz ?
Aber ihre Wähler wünschen sich das offenbar ...
Thorsten Wirth : Es gibt
Wähler , die sich das wünschen , aber ob alle es sich wünschen , wage ich zu bezweifeln .
Sie wünschen es sich , weil sie es brauchen , und weil sie sich wünschen , dass wir so oder so sind .
Aber wir sind letztlich dabei , uns selbst zu erfinden , und das tun wir verhältnismäßig häufig .
Jedes neue , engagierte Mitglied formt und prägt die Piratenpartei etwas anders .
Andererseits wollen wir zunächst unser Wertefundament legen , mit dem wir unser Tun begründen .
Daraus leitet sich unser Tun im Weiteren ab .
Jetzt ein konservatives oder soziales Schema anzuwenden , halte ich für falsch .
Wir suchen uns die Werte , die passend sind zu dem , was wir leben .
Und da ist alles dabei .
Der Begriff " konservativ " beispielsweise wird ja auch sehr gerne in Stücke gerissen und hat ein schlechtes Ansehen .
Wenn man sich aber vornimmt , an bestimmten Werten festzuhalten und keine Veränderung zu wollen , gilt das als konservativ , ist aber in Bezug auf z .
B. die Natur eine brauchbare Haltung .
Wenn man aber fortschrittlich oder modernisierend denken will , sind wir , in Bezug auf das Internet , fortschrittlich und kritisch zugleich , weil wir die Technik verstehen und nicht nur die positiven , sondern auch die negativen Potenziale erkennen können .
Es ist ein Kampf zwischen Erneuerung und Festhalten an alten Werten .
Warum sollte man diesen Pluralismus nicht auch innerhalb einer Partei leben .
Ich kann mich auch ganz gut mit CDU - oder SPD - Wählern unterhalten .
Das andere Problem ist , dass die Piratenpartei es schwer haben wird , sich einen Stammwählerschaft aufzubauen , da die Unterstützer und Mitglieder der Partei eine weitgehend homogene Gruppe sind : junge Männer ohne Kinder .
Was macht die Partei , wenn ein Großteil von ihnen zu Papis wird und ihnen ganz andere Themen wie kostenfreie Kindergartenplätze wichtig werden ?
Wird sie thematisch mit ihren Mitgliedern wachsen ?
Thorsten Wirth : Die jungen kinderlosen Männer gibt es natürlich , aber es gibt so viele Familien , die bei uns Mitglied sind , dass ich das einfach nicht bejahen kann .
An unseren Stammtischen trifft man auch Eltern .
Ich selbst bin 41 , und wir haben noch jemanden , der ist 70 , und der sehr aktiv mitarbeitet .
Es ist im Prinzip alles dabei , alle Gesellschaftsschichten , alle Altersgruppen und Geschlechter .
Verstärkt sind natürlich junge Männer dabei , aber die würde ich eher zwischen 20 und 35 schätzen .
Fragen nach kostenfreien Kindergartenplätze stehen für unsere Wähler nicht im Zentrum , jedenfalls habe ich das noch nicht wahrgenommen .
Die Piraten , die sich bei uns engagieren , interessieren sich gerade für die Frage , wie unsere Gesellschaft mit dem Informationszeitalter umgeht .
Diese Frage kann von keiner anderen Partei wirklich beantwortet werden .
Die hauen eher mit dem Knüppel drauf , wenn sie etwas vom Informationszeitalter sehen .
Die Familienväter oder - mütter , die sich bei uns engagieren , sind eher daran interessiert , ihren Kindern für die Zukunft z.B. den kostenlosen Zugang zum Wissen zu sichern .
Halten
Sie es denn für denkbar , dass viele Wähler die Piratenpartei wegen einzelner Programmpunkte gern wählen würden , aber davor zurückschrecken , weil ihnen die Ausrichtung der Partei zu unklar ist ?
Verschenken Sie Wählerpotential ?
Thorsten Wirth : Wenn wir unser
Tun danach ausrichten würden , ob wir jetzt Potential verschenken oder nicht , müssten wir zu jeder Frage eine Antwort haben .
Aber ich glaube , wenn man sich allein anschaut , wie viel Potential wir dadurch haben , dass wir neue Fragen aufwerfen und Antworten geben , ist das viel bemerkenswerter als darüber zu spekulieren , wie viele Leute wir nicht erreichen .
Wir sind momentan auf Platz 13 aller deutschen Parteien und machen aktuell einen Durchmarsch .
Wir bekommen alle zwei Wochen 1000 neue Mitglieder .
In allen sozialen Netzwerken stehen wir an Platz 1 und haben alle anderen Parteien überholt .
Wir haben 30000 Leute allein bei MeinVZ , die uns toll finden .
Das ist weit mehr , als jede andere Partei hat .
Man kann feststellen , dass es Leute gibt , die unsere Ziele für so wichtig halten , dass sie eine Berechtigung sehen , dass wir existieren .
Wenn man nach den Meinungen im Internet geht , gibt es bereits einen eindeutigen Wahlsieger : die Piratenpartei !
Davon ist sie in der Realität jedoch noch weit entfernt .
Trotzdem sind einige Piratenparteianhänger siegessicher .
Geht das Weltbild der Piratenparteianhänger nicht über das Internet hinaus ?
Thorsten Wirth :
Wir basteln uns alle ein Weltbild , und wer das nicht tut , hat irgendwas nicht kapiert .
Jeder bastelt sich aus seiner Realität sein Weltbild zusammen .
Das zum Thema Weltbild .
Das andere ist , dass es ganz klar schön , aber nicht repräsentativ ist , wenn wir im Internet die Foren dominieren und Umfragen gewinnen .
Wir weisen die Leute aber darauf hin , dass z. B. Datenschutz auch ein Thema ist , wenn man kein Internetnutzer ist .
Daten werden über jeden und über alles gesammelt .
Das Thema Datenschutz ist sehr in der reellen
Welt verwurzelt .
Wenn
Sie nur über den Bahnhof gehen , werden Sie dabei von mindestens zehn Kameras aufgenommen .
Wenn sie mit der EC - Karte einkaufen oder mit ihrem Auto über Maut - Scanner fahren : Überall werden Daten erhoben .
Überall sind sie personalisiert .
Neuerdings sollen die Bankdaten mit EU - Genehmigung nach Amerika ausgeliefert werden .
Wenn Sie aus dem Schengener Raum ausreisen , werden Sie gemeldet , und wenn Sie wieder einreisen werden sie ebenfalls gemeldet .
Finden
Sie nicht auch , dass das ein Szenario ist , das nach absoluter Kontrolle aussieht , und wogegen man sich auflehnen kann , ganz gleich , ob man im Internet ist oder nicht ?
Sympathisanten nutzen die Piratenpartei , wie sie das Internet nutzen
Ihre Unterstützer stammen aber in erster Linie aus der Internetszene ...
Thorsten Wirth :
Es ist so , dass wir die Leute im Netz und in der Gamekultur , beispielsweise nach diesem unsäglichen Killerspielverbot , wie es die Politik gedenkt einzuführen , wirklich abholen , weil es sich auch um unsere Kultur handelt .
Bloggen , Schaffen von Wissen , Spielen im Internet : Das ist auch unser zu Hause .
Dort erreichen wir viele , die mit uns dann in Kontakt treten .
Die nutzen die Piratenpartei , wie sie das Internet nutzen , und das finde ich großartig :
Die spielen mit der Piratenpartei und testen , welche Möglichkeiten sie haben , so wie sie es gewohnt sind .
Das macht uns für sie wesentlich attraktiver als konservative Parteien , wo so etwas nicht gehen darf .
Die Piratenpartei probiert Dinge aus , während die anderen Parteien das überhaupt nicht mehr wagen , weil die ihre Strukturen bereits einzementiert haben .
Die Piratenpartei ist da viel offener und sagt : " Lass uns das ausprobieren ! "
Gerade darum geht es uns .
Wir müssen mehr Kommunikation schaffen und näher zusammenrücken , Möglichkeiten schaffen , uns gegenseitig zu verstehen .
In der Piratenpartei entsteht sehr viel von ganz alleine .
Niemand braucht etwas zu sagen .
Jemand hat eine Idee und zeigt sie , und die anderen sagen : " Wie geil ! " , und die Idee beginnt zu fliegen .
Sie fliegt durch die Piratenpartei , bis sie an irgendeiner Straßenecke klebt .
Das macht die Piratenpartei aus und ist für die jungen Leute ungeheuer attraktiv .
Denn sie haben das Internet auch dadurch erlebt , dass sie es sich erspielt haben .
Man ist neugierig , geht auf die Dinge zu und probiert sie aus .
Für Leute , die ein starres , unflexibles Weltbild haben , ist das nur schwer fassbar .
Die wollen etwas haben , was sie mal kennengelernt haben , und wollen damit immer weiter arbeiten .
Bei uns ist das grundlegend anders .
Wer will , kann im Forum posten , andere gehen auf die Mailingliste , wieder andere chatten , und wieder andere treffen sich " normal " und trinken ein Bier zusammen .
Dadurch , dass ganz viele Leute Ideen in die Sache einbringen , erfinden wir uns immer neu .
Wie wird denn Ihr Wahlkampf aussehen ?
Thorsten Wirth : Wir werden versuchen , viel zu plakatieren und viele Infoveranstaltungen durchzuführen .
Aber wir werden mit Sicherheit wieder durch einige bunte Aktionen brillieren , bei denen uns unsere neuen Mitglieder sehr helfen können .
Bis zur Wahl sind auch viele Demonstrationen geplant , auf denen wir präsent sein werden .
Und wir werden weiterhin und bessere Pressearbeit machen als zuvor .
Wir werden auch versuchen , ganz klassisch über Infostände an die " Off - linies " heranzutreten .
Aber wir sind eine arme , liebe , nette , kleine Partei und haben nicht so viele Mittel wie beispielsweise die Grünen , schützen so aber auch die Umwelt , weil wir nicht so viel plakatieren wie die .

Let 's hope he does n't blow it !
' Bubbleologist ' creates world 's largest free - floating bubble
Advertisement
You could n't blow one this big with a wand and some soapy water , no matter how long you huffed and puffed .
The shimmering giant , thought to be the world 's largest free - floating soap bubble , was created with a piece of rope between two sticks and a top secret bubble solution .
It is the work of ' bubbleologist ' Samsam Bubbleman , 37 .
Forever blowing bubbles : Samsam Bubbleman with what is thought to be the world 's largest free - floating soap bubble
Samsam ( real name Sam Heath ) was aiming to pop the Guinness World Record set in 2005 in Minnesota , U.S. , for a bubble of 105.4 cubic feet .
He is not sure of the precise volume of his attempt in Finsbury Park , North London , but it stretched to 20 ft by 5 ft by 5 ft at its biggest .
He is now waiting for official confirmation .
' I 'm confident it has obliterated the former record , ' he said .
Samsam , pictured with his creation , refused to reveal the recipe for his bubble mixture , saying it is the secret to his success .
' With the right stuff you can make big bubbles with anything - a coat - hanger or even just your hands , ' he said .
He developed the top - secret mixture over 20 years of trial and error .
The professional bubble - maker has been described as ‘ the Willy Wonka of Bubbles ’ by DJ Chris Evans .
Floating on air :
The bubble expert made the wobbly giant using a top - secret mixture he has developed over 20 years
Resembling something out of 90's hit movie The Abyss , Samsam 's incredible creation floated above Finsbury Park , London .
The 37 - year - old , who has made bubbles for celebrities across the world , is now waiting for the amazing achievement to be officiated .
' I'm confident it has obliterated the former record , ' he said .
' This one dwarfs the American effort . '
To make this enormous orb he used just a piece of rope attached between two sticks .
' It 's all about having the right bubble solution , ' said Samsam .
' If you have the right mixture then your tools do n't matter .
' Being a bubbleologist is almost as much about being a wind catcher as it is a bubble maker .
You become quite sensitive to changes in direction and you have to move at the right time to keep the bubble together . '
Ready to pop : Samsam is described as ' the Willy Wonka of Bubbles ' by DJ Chris Evans
Once confirmed the new record will add to Samson ’s tally of two standing world firsts .
In November 2007 he managed to place 50 people inside one of his bubbles .
A year later he earned the award for putting the most bubbles inside a bubble - 66 .
Samsam first started his love affair with bubbles in 1989 and now earns a living doing what he loves best .
' It all started with just a single bubble , ' he said .
' I was sitting in a field and a bubble just floated past .
' I took the word away from the object and just looked at it for what it was .
I captured my imagination and I just thought what an amazing thing that was .
' It 's like one of those anomalies of nature that just should n't exist .
Like a bumblebee being too big for its wings . '
Blowing up :
The 37 - year - old , who has made bubbles for celebrities across the world , is now waiting for the amazing achievement to be officiated
He eventually formed company Bubbleinc and now sells mixtures , equipment and performs shows for big name audiences .
Over the years he and his team of 10 bubbleologists have performed bubble shows for the Dubai Royal family .
Stars like Paul McCartney and Peter Gabriel have also brought him in for private shows .

They were all hypochondriacs .
Brian Dillon examines the relationship between creativity , illness and the imagination
NEW YORK ( Fortune ) --
The Federal Reserve has spent the past year cleaning up after a housing bubble it helped create .
But along the way it may have pumped up another bubble , this time in stocks .
To head off the worst downturn since the Great Depression , the central bank has slashed interest rates while funneling money to banks .
The Fed has mostly won praise for its efforts .
The pace of job losses has slowed , and there has been a modest recovery in output .
At the same time , stocks have bounced back with startling speed .
Since global markets hit their bottom in March , the S&P 500 has jumped 51 % -- even as the outlook for economic recovery remains dim .
" This is the most speculative momentum - driven equity market since the early 1930s , " Gluskin Sheff economist David Rosenberg wrote in a note to clients Monday .
Of course , stocks have rallied in part because investors perceive the worst - case scenario -- a 1930s - style Depression -- is off the table .
And while the gains have been remarkable , they come after an even bigger decline .
The S&P is still down 16 % since Lehman Brothers collapsed in September .
But while most people take the rise in stocks as a hopeful sign for the economy , some see evidence that the Fed has been financing a speculative mania that could end in another damaging rout .
Recent weeks have brought huge rallies in some of the lowest - quality stocks -- including firms such as AIG ( AIG , Fortune 500 ) , Fannie Mae ( FNM , Fortune 500 ) and Freddie Mac ( FRE , Fortune 500 ) that are being propped up by the government and are unlikely to return to health any time soon .
What 's more , this year has brought an 80 % surge in emerging market stocks , while the dollar has posted a 10 % decline since March .
A declining dollar and surging emerging markets were the hallmarks of the credit - fueled bull run earlier this decade .
" We have put the band back together on a lot of this , " said Howard Simons , a strategist at Bianco Research in Chicago .
" That could n't have happened without liquidity . "
Though liquidity is admittedly a nebulous concept , there 's no question that central bankers around the globe have poured huge amounts of money into the markets to ease the financial crisis .
Given free money , investors ' appetite for risk shoots higher and they gobble up stocks .
That 's good , except when the outlook for economic growth does n't seem to support the higher stock values .
" Many observers are wondering whether the strong stock market rebound since mid-March is already a forerunner of the next recovery or simply driven by a reflux of liquidity into riskier asset markets , " Deutsche Bank Research analyst Sebastian Becker wrote in a report last month .
Rosenberg , who notes that consumer credit has dropped an unprecedented five straight months , said it 's far from clear the recession is over .
He says the risk of a market relapse later this year is high .
Simons said another factor that could work against recovery is that short - term interest rates could soon head higher , judging by action in futures markets .
That could raise companies ' borrowing costs at a time when policymakers have committed to holding rates near zero to restore economic growth .
Fed officials have stressed that they will start to unwind their financial support programs at the earliest sign of inflation .
Given the cost of cleaning up after the last bubble , Becker writes that " this time , policymakers are unlikely to remain inactive should they suspect the formation of another asset price bubble . "
But it 's clear that bankers are loath to pull back on their support for the financial system before it 's clear the economy has staged a stronger recovery .
And the Fed has a long and painful history of ignoring asset price inflation .
" The central bankers have this textbook belief that the only inflation is the kind that appears in consumer price indexes , " said Simons .
" They do n't believe what they 're doing could cause an asset price bubble . "
For now , Fed chief Ben Bernanke and other central bankers can console themselves for now with stable consumer price inflation readings in major economies .
But comparing the bankers with a driver pulled over for speeding for the umpteenth time , Simons said , " At some point , you have to say maybe your speedometer 's broken . "

While looking for the missing friend , Claudia and Sandro develop an attraction for each other .
When they get back to land , they continue the search with no success .

Funguses have caused some of the greatest human tragedies in history – but they have also been behind some of the greatest scientific discoveries .
This list looks at ten significant funguses .
Some have helped man , some have hindered man , and some are just plain awesome .
If you wish to add to the list , be sure to do so in the comments .
Note : Funguses and fungi are both equally valid plural forms of the word “ fungus ” .
If you wish to see the fact verified , go here .
10 Claviceps Purpurea
Incredible Because :
It makes you dance , it makes your legs drop off , and is the source of LSD
Claviceps purpurea is a fungus that grows on the ears of rye and related cereal and forage plants .
Consumption of grains or seeds contaminated with the fruiting structure of this fungus , the ergot sclerotium , can cause ergotism in humans and other mammals .
The common name for ergotism is “ St. Anthony ’s Fire ” , in reference to monks who cared for victims as well as symptoms , such as severe burning sensations in the limbs .
These are caused by effects of ergot alkaloids on the vascular system due to constriction of blood vessels , sometimes leading to gangrene and loss of limbs due to severely restricted blood circulation .
The convulsive symptoms that can be a result of consuming ergot tainted rye have also been said to be the cause of accusations of “ bewitchment ” that spurred the Salem witch trials .
9 Omphalotus Olearius
Incredible Because :
It is so tasty that you want more even though it makes you sick .
Oh – and it glows .
The Jack o’ Lantern mushroom ( Omphalotus olearius ) is an orange - to yellow - gill mushroom that to an untrained eye appears similar to some chanterelles , and is most notable for its bioluminescent properties .
Previous names include Omphalotus illudens and Clitocybe illudens .
Unlike the chanterelle , the Jack o’Lantern mushroom is poisonous .
While not lethal , consuming this mushroom leads to very severe cramps , vomiting , and diarrhea .
Complicating its toxicity is the fact that it smells and looks very appealing , to the extent that there are reports of repeat poisonings from individuals who were tempted to try them a second time .
8 Cordyceps Sinensis
Incredible Because :
It invades , mummifies , and grows from caterpillas
Caterpillar fungus is the result of a parasitic relationship between the fungus Cordyceps and the larva of the ghost moth .
The caterpillar prone to infection by the fungus lives underground in alpine grass and shrublands on the Tibetan Plateau and the Himalayas at an altitude between 3000 m and 5000 m .
Spending up to five years underground before pupating , the caterpillar is attacked while feeding on roots .
The fungus invades the body of the Thitarodes caterpillars , filling its entire body cavity with mycelium and eventually killing and mummifying it .
The caterpillars die near the tops of their burrows .
The dark brown to black fruiting body ( or mushroom ) emerges from the ground in spring or early summer , always growing out of the forehead of the caterpillar .
The long , usually columnar fruiting body reaches 5 - 15 cm above the surface and releases spores .
The fungus is a medicinal mushroom which is highly prized by practitioners of Tibetan medicine , Chinese medicine and traditional herbal Folk medicines , in which it is used as an aphrodisiac and as a treatment for a variety of ailments from fatigue to cancer .
7 Trametes Versicolor
Incredible Because :
It is stunning to look at and is used in cancer therapy
Trametes versicolor , formerly known as Coriolus versicolor and Polyporus versicolor , is a common mushroom of the genus Trametes .
Versicolor means ‘ of several colors ’ and it is true that this mushroom is found in a wide variety of different colors .
It is commonly called the “ Turkey Tail ” in the United States because of its resemblance to the tail of the turkey bird .
In Europe and Japan , polysaccharide - K ( brand name Krestin ) , a chemical derived from Trametes versicolor , is an approved adjuvant for cancer therapy .
This means that while it does n’t specifically affect cancer cells itself , consumption of the fungus enhances and increases the potency and ability of certain cancer drugs .
Recent testing has shown that it may also have anti-HIV properties .
6 Penicillium Roqueforti
Incredible Because :
It turns a lump of curdled milk curds into one of the tastiest delights around
The major industrial use of Penicillium roqueforti is the production of blue cheeses , flavoring agents , antifungals , polysaccharides , proteases and other enzymes .
The fungus has been a constituent of Roquefort , Stilton and other blue cheeses eaten by humans since about 50 AD ; blue cheese is mentioned in literature as far back as AD 79 , when Pliny the Elder remarked upon its rich flavor .
Penicillium roqueforti is found in the soil of the caves of Mont Combalou in Roquefort - sur - Soulzon .
Traditionally cheesemakers extracted it by leaving bread in the caves for six to eight weeks until it was consumed by the mold .
The interior of the bread was then dried to produce a powder .
Nowadays the mold can be produced in a laboratory , which allows for greater consistency .
The mold may either be added to the curd , or introduced as an aerosol , through holes poked in the rind .
5 Aspergillus Niger
Incredible Because :
It toppled the Italian lemon industry and is used in the production of high fructose corn syrup
Industrial - scale citric acid production began in 1890 based on the Italian citrus fruit industry .
But a mere 27 years later ( in 1917 , ) the American food chemist James Currie discovered that certain strains of the mold Aspergillus niger could be efficient citric acid producers , and Pfizer began industrial - level production using this technique two years later , followed by Citrique Belge in 1929 .
This caused the toppling of the Italian citrus industry .
Aspergillus niger is also used in the production of high fructose corn syrup ( HFCS ) .
In the United States , HFCS is typically used as a sugar substitute and is ubiquitous in processed foods and beverages , including soft drinks , yogurt , cookies , salad dressing and tomato soup .
4 Neurospora Crassa
Incredible Because :
It led to significant advances in the study of genes and DNA
Neurospora crassa was used by Edward Tatum and George Wells Beadle in their experiments for which they won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1958 .
Beadle and Tatum exposed N. crassa to x-rays , causing mutations .
They then observed failures in metabolic pathways caused by errors in specific enzymes .
This led them to propose the “ one gene , one enzyme ” hypothesis that specific genes code for specific proteins .
Neurospora is actively used in research around the world .
It is important in the elucidation of molecular events involved in circadian rhythms , epigenetics and gene silencing , cell polarity , development , as well as many aspects of cell biology and biochemistry .
3 Saccharomyces Cerevisiae
Incredible Because :
It is used to make bread , wine , and beer
Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a species of budding yeast .
It is perhaps the most useful yeast owing to its use since ancient times in baking and brewing .
It is believed that it was originally isolated from the skins of grapes ( one can see the yeast as a component of the thin white film on the skins of some dark - colored fruits such as plums . )
Saccharomyces cerevisiae is the microorganism that is responsible for fermentation in beer .
It metabolizes the sugars extracted from grains , which produces alcohol and carbon dioxide , and thereby turns wort into beer .
In addition to fermenting the beer , it influences the character and flavor .
2 Phytophthora Infestans
Incredible Because :
It changed the face of Ireland and the face of modern America
The Great Famine was a period of starvation , disease and mass emigration between 1845 and 1852 during which the population of Ireland was reduced by 20 to 25 percent .
Approximately one million of the population died and a million more emigrated from Ireland ’s shores .
Many of those leaving fled to America and other parts of the New World .
By 1850 , the Irish made up a quarter of the population in Boston , Massachusetts ; New York City ; Philadelphia , Pennsylvania ; and Baltimore , Maryland .
The famine was caused by the fungus Phytophthora infestans .
How and when it arrived in Europe is still uncertain ; at least one of the sources of the infection suggests it may have originated in the northern Andes region of South America , Peru in particular .
It was then conveyed to Europe on ships carrying guano , where it was in great demand as a fertilizer on European and British farms .
1 Penicillium Chrysogenum
Incredible Because : Life - saving penicillin come from it
Penicillin antibiotics are historically significant because they were the first drugs that were effective against many previously serious diseases such as syphilis and Staphylococcus infections .
It was discovered in 1928 when Alexander Fleming ’s lab assistant left a window open overnight and had mold spores cover his Staphylococcus bacterial specimens in a Petri dish .
At first he was very irritated at the contamination but as he was about to throw the specimens away , he noticed something interesting .
He looked under the microscope at the bacteria surrounding the blue - green mold and noticed that many were dead or dying due to the mold preventing the bacteria from making new cell walls and reproducing .
He identified the mold as Penicillium notatum ( now known as Penicillium chrysogenum ) , which releases the antibiotic penicillin G into the medium .
After this he did some testing on humans and animals and discovered that not only did it kill bacteria , but that it was suitable for use in humans and animals .

In the vein of the breathalyzer , Philips has developed an on - the - go drug test , that can be used by the side of the road to test suspected imbibers for cocaine , heroin , cannabis , amphetamines and methaphetamine .
Unlike the standard alcohol testing equipment , this one is used by having the suspect spit into a small receptacle , which is then inserted into the measurement chamber which contains magnetic nanoparticles coated with ligands that bind to one of five different drug groups , delivering color coded test results in about 90 seconds .
Philips , which has been developing the device since 2001 , built it as an optical device that would be easy to mass produce for law enforcement .
The company expects to ship them by the end of the year , though there 's no word on exactly which markets will employ them as of yet .

You can use the built - in magnifier to zoom in on your screen , click on a color value to copy it directly to the clipboard , and even keep ColorPix on top of all other apps and out of the way .
You can use the colorpix in the following ways ;
1.ColorPix Window
This is the actual size of the ColorPix window .
When you move your mouse over your screen the color values on the left and the color swatch on the right will change color depending on the pixel under your mouse .
2.ColorPix Window with Magnifier
Expanding the ColorPix window to show the magnifier lets you zoom in on your screen underneath your mouse .
Screenshot :
Color codes are show as the cursor is moved in the ColorPix window .
A cursor click displays the color code in web Hex and decimal Red , Green , Blue , along with the color compliment .
Sucessive clicks save the pixel colors in a list with user descriptions for review or printing .
ColorPix is an essential utility for web page development .

Paul O'Grady was held in the USA suspicion of being an illegal alien from Cuba - because of his " funny " accent .
The Liverpudlian chat show king was dragged into a holding room at Miami airport and detained for two hours .
Last night furious O'Grady , 54 , revealed how he was made to feel like a criminal by rude officials , who confiscated his passport .
He said : " Every time I said , ' Excuse me , can you tell me why am I here ? ' , they just ignored me .
It was so rude . "
Quizzed on when he had last visited Cuba , O'Grady replied : " I said , ' You 've been studying my passport for the last hour and you can see I 've never been to Cuba in my life ' .
" Then this guy said to me , ' He thinks you 're a Cuban immigrant ' .
I said , ' cos I look Cuban , do n't I ? ' "
The Channel 4 host , who was on his way home from a holiday in Peru , added : " I 've just been to hell folks and it 's called Miami airport . "
Today , the Southeastern Conference ( SEC ) is expected to release a final version of its new media policy .
For the sake of sports fans everywhere , let ’s hope it has some significant changes from the current version , because at the moment , it can best be described as a ban on all social media usage at SEC games .
Earlier this month , the conference informed its schools of the new policy , which reads : “ Ticketed fans can't " produce or disseminate ( or aid in producing or disseminating ) any material or information about the Event , including , but not limited to , any account , description , picture , video , audio , reproduction or other information concerning the Event . ”
Translated , that means no Twitter , Facebook , YouTube , TwitPic , or any other service that could in any way compete with authorized media coverage of the event .
In the case of the SEC , authorized media coverage rights belong to CBS , who has a $ 3 billion deal with the conference over the next 15 years according to The St Petersburg Times .
While it ’s understandable that the SEC wants to protect the value of the CBS contract , banning all social media seems not only unenforceable , but also counter - productive .
I ca n’t count the number of times I ’ve turned on a sporting event after seeing friends update their status or upload a picture .
By barring social media , much of that would be lost ( though couch - side commentators would still be tweeting of course ) .
The SEC ’s move is not unprecedented in the world of sports , however .
One could debate what ’s implied about social media when Major League Baseball says during telecasts that “ any rebroadcast , reproduction or other use of this game without the express written consent of Major League Baseball is prohibited , ” though so far it seems that tweeting and photo uploads remain permissible .
Meanwhile , at this year ’s US Open , I was rather surprised to learn that both phones and cameras were n’t allowed on premises , making any form of social media inaccessible .
For the moment , these policies seem a lot more grounded in fear than reality .
Sure , these days someone could theoretically live stream a game from their camera phone .
But a shaky , low resolution video from the upper deck of Yankee Stadium is n’t exactly the same as watching FOX ’s telecast on your big screen TV .
Social media should be viewed a fantastic compliment to sports that is good for both fans and the TV networks , but at the moment , it seems that ’s anything but how it ’s being perceived .
8/18 Update : Common Sense Wins : Social Media to Be Allowed at SEC Games
This question is logically problematic .
If everything needs a creator , then no matter what exists , it must have been created .
Furthermore , to be created means that someone or something had to create it .
But then , who created the creator and so on ?
Logically , this would mean there would be an infinite regression of creators ( prior causes ) , and we would never be able to find the first uncaused cause since by definition ( the question says that " everything needs a creator " ) there would n't be any uncaused cause .
This would mean that the sequence of creations is eternal .
But , if it exists that there is an eternal regression of creators , then who created the infinite regression of creators ?
Remember , the question presupposes that all things need a creator -- even the eternal sequence of creators -- which becomes logically absurd .
Furthermore , if there is an eternal regression of creators that are eternal , then the question is not answered .
In fact , it can not be answered since its weakness is that " all things need a creator . "
Of course , this only begs the question in that how did the process begin ?
Therefore , the question only raises the same problem it asks , and it is a question that , by its own design , can not be answered .
Therefore , it is invalid .
The question is better phrased as a statement : " Everything that has come into existence was brought into existence by something else . "
This is a more logical statement and is not wrought with the difficulties of the initial question .
In the revised statement , " Everything that has come into existence " implies that the thing that " has come into existence " did not already exist .
If it did not already exist but then came into existence , then something had to bring it into existence because something that does not exist cannot bring itself into existence ( a logical absolute ) .
This pushes the regression of creators back to what we would call the theoretical " uncaused cause " since there cannot be an infinite regression of creators as discussed above and since an infinite number of creators would mean there was an infinite number of creations and created things , including things that cannot be destroyed since they would constitute things that exist .
If that is so , then the universe would have had an infinite number of created things in it ; and it would be full .
But it is not full .
Therefore , there has not been an infinite regression of creations .
By definition , the Christian God never came into existence ; that is , He is the uncaused cause ( Psalm 90:2 ) .
He was always in existence , and He is the one who created space , time , and matter .
This means that the Christian God is the uncaused cause and is the ultimate creator .
This eliminates the infinite regression problem .
Some may ask , " But who created God ? "
The answer is that by definition
He is not created ;
He is eternal .
He is the One who brought time , space , and matter into existence .
Since the concept of causality deals with space , time , and matter and since God is the one who brought space , time , and matter into existence , the concept of causality does not apply to God since it is something related to the reality of space , time , and matter .
Since
God is before space , time , and matter , the issue of causality does not apply to Him .
A 54 - year - old Sydney Catholic priest has been arrested and charged after allegedly attempting to groom detectives who were masquerading as a 13 - year - old girl , sending them a series of sexually explicit chat - room messages .
Police allege they posed as a 13 - year - old girl on the internet to catch Robert Fuller , a priest of three decades standing and the parish priest of All Saints at Liverpool for six years .
Prior to that he was the parish priest at a Punchbowl parish .
Accused ... Robert Fuller .
They allege he sent chat - room messages between July and August , and even tried to arrange a meeting to engage in sexual activity .
Police arrested Father Fuller in a car park at Parramatta , in western Sydney , at 12.30 pm yesterday , and later charged him with grooming a person under the age of 16 .
I recently ran across a new visual debugger for C64 emulators called ICU64 , written by Mathfigure .
It will be released later this year and provides some amazing visualizations of both memory access and memory - mapped devices like the video and sound chip .
See the video below for how it works .
There is also another video showing how the classic game Boulder Dash can be expanded to span multiple screens .
He implemented this by grabbing graphics from the same RAM areas the game uses and displaying them on a custom screen .
On this forum thread , the author discusses his goal of allowing more graphical expandability for classic games .
Learning to program on a small machine with a full view of every memory location is something I ’ve always seen as a great way to start .
I got a lot of insight into how my computer worked by running a background task that continually copied pages of RAM to screen , so you could “ scroll through ” memory .
For example , the tick counter showed up as a blur .
I ’ve always said that my kids would have to learn to program a C64 before they got a more modern system .
Would n’t this be a great tool for teaching anyone new to low - level computing how assembly language and memory - mapped devices work ?
What about adapting some of these techniques to fuzzing or modern debuggers ?

Conspiracy theories have been a constant in Rep. Michele Bachmann 's political career since she first ran for the Stillwater school board in the late 1990s .
She made her initial foray into politics by claiming that the Profile of Learning amounted to social engineering .
Her anti-gay - marriage ideas were rooted in notions of sinister forces bent on destroying traditional marriage .
Her bizarre rants within the past year against " anti-American " members of Congress , a global currency and government - mandated youth " reeducation camps " all exhibit the same disturbing tendency .
She sees threats that few other elected officials perceive , let alone describe on national television .
Another example came this week as Bachmann sounded a shrill alarm against an American institution : the U.S. Census .
In yet another TV talk show appearance , the telegenic Republican decried the population survey as " government intrusion , " then warned darkly that census information was used to round up Japanese - American citizens during World War II .
The implication , of course , was that it could be used to round up Americans again .
Bachmann 's backpedaling " I 'm not saying that is what the administration is planning to do ' ' did nothing to squelch those fears , especially considering that she was appearing on the Fox TV show of Glenn Beck , who has spent the months since the presidential election painting apocalyptic visions of the future .
This is hard - core conspiracy theory , the likes of which are rarely seen outside the most extreme parts of the blogosphere .
Even Beck seemed taken aback by the government round - up rhetoric .

NEW YORK , Aug. 4 ( UPI ) --
A park bench featuring a sculpture of a nude Angelina Jolie with her infant twins is to be unveiled in Oklahoma to promote World Breastfeeding Week .
The Oscar - winning actress is the mother of six young children , the youngest of whom are twins who turned 1 this summer .

Phantom - Financial announced Tuesday the sculpture by New York artist Daniel Edwards will be installed just minutes away from the birthplace of Jolie 's partner , Brad Pitt , in the Oklahoma City Metro area in September before its fall exhibition in London .
" Landmark for Breastfeeding " was inspired by last year 's cover of W magazine , featuring Jolie breastfeeding one of her babies .
The sculpture depicts a seated nude Jolie double - breastfeeding twins .
" We believe the statue sends a beautiful message by promoting the acceptance of public breastfeeding .
Mothers should be encouraged to nurture their babies anywhere , " Sandy Wilson of Phantom - Financial said in a statement .
" La Leche League International and Loretta McCallister have been very helpful , " said project coordinator Cory Allen .
" We are applying for approval to put ' Landmark for Breastfeeding ' on permanent display in a Metro area park . "
The Jolie monument is to be unveiled Sept. 11 at MAINSITE Contemporary Art in Norman , Okla .
In just a few days The Pirate Bay will be passed onto its new owners , marking the end of an era but not the end of BitTorrent .
The nostalgic torrenters among us might want to download a copy of the site for archival purposes .
It never hurts to have a backup of important data in place , especially when it 's free .
massive torrent amounting to 21.3 Gigabytes of data .
The anonymous uploader who compiled this huge torrent told TorrentFreak that he wanted to have a backup of the site in case all torrents mysteriously disappear after the site is sold .
“ I suppose I want us to have assurances .
If the TPB deal disappoints us , we can just put it up again , ” he said .
The backup includes a mockup site and all of the 873,671 torrent files hosted on The Pirate Bay ’s servers .
As the uploader also notes , not all of the 2 million torrents tracked by The Pirate Bay are hosted on the site itself .
With this backup everyone can have their own Pirate Bay up and running in a few minutes .
“ The basic website supplied in the torrent is a working site , where you can browse the index .
You just need a lot of hardware to run a database of this size at a decent speed .
And thanks to openbittorrent.com , you do n’t even need a tracker , ” the uploader told us .
Those interested in grabbing a copy of the site have to be warned : patience is required .
It might take a few days before the download completes with the seeder ’s limited upload capacity , but good things come to those that wait .

With both the Pirate Bay and OpenBitTorrent trackers down at the moment , many people are unable to download torrents unless they enable DHT .
Luckily there are a few backup trackers that people can use , and thanks to Google 's free App Engine , everyone can setup a tracker of their own in a few minutes .
In their defense , operators of BitTorrent sites often argue that they do nothing more than Google does .
They offer a search platform for people to find content on the web , specifically torrent files .
To a certain extent they are right , Google can be used to find torrent files in several ways .
For example , the mother of all search engines has a special search command that allows you to find torrent files scattered across the Internet .
Google ’s custom search also allows everyone to create their own torrent search engine , and Google ’s App Engine enables users to start a free torrent search engine for free by using Google ’s servers .
It is quite clear that there are several ways to find torrents through Google .
However , just finding torrents is not enough .
In order to download content through BitTorrent successfully , one also needs a working tracker in order to locate those all - important peers .
Luckily Google can help here too .
By using Google ’s App Engine , everyone can run a tracker without having to invest a single dime in hardware or bandwidth .
The only problem is making the tracker compatible with the App Engine , but thanks to the newly released Atrack software it is a piece of cake to set one up .
The Atrack Bittorrent tracker is designed to run on Google App Engine and its main goals are a minimal memory use , speed , low bandwidth usage and efficient CPU use .
On top of this the tracker wont store any data at all , making it as secure as possible for its users .
“ Atrack also aims to respect your privacy : other than what is needed for the most basic tracking , Atrack gathers no information whatsoever .
Beyond that no aggregate statistics are kept of anything , and nothing is stored permanently anywhere , not even hashes and ip / ports , ” the Atrack team writes .
So now everyone can set up a standalone BitTorrent tracker at no cost aside from the the time it takes to set things up .
The Atrack software is released into the public domain , and a test tracker is up and running on Google ’s App Engine .

The fashion , the style , the way of leaving , all this looks so fascinating , so interesting , so charming and unusual .
The vintage ads should be proudly put among the greatest masterpieces , they are so simple , so naive , so touching and inspirational !
At least for me .
I was so excited reviewing hundreds of vintage car ads for the last couple of days to choose the ones I would like to share with you !
All the retro car ads presented today have interesting captions which describe in a very simple manner what ’s so great about the car , so be sure to take a few seconds to read the text on the ads .
Well , no more talk – you ’ve got to see that !
Below is the collection of retro cars ads , both nostalgic and inspirational .

Oscar is now fully recovered
Oscar Parry has had leukaemia twice , three bone marrow transplants and five brain haemorrhages .
His doctor says it is a " miracle " that the 10 - year - old Essex boy is still alive and is back at school as well as fundraising for the hospital that saved him .
His mother Yvonne said : " Even by Great Ormond Street Hospital standards he is doing well . "
Oscar was born with a genetic syndrome called Noonan 's Syndrome which left him with a minor heart condition and slightly small for his age .
Treatment regime Doctors thought these were the only side effects , but no one knew that the condition had also made him vulnerable to leukaemia and at the age of three he developed acute lymphoblastic leukaemia ( ALL ) - one of the most common forms of the disease
To begin with , Oscar was treated with low doses of chemotherapy , which worked well .
However , after three years of treatment his blood counts dropped and he was diagnosed with a rarer , more aggressive , type that could only be cured by a bone marrow transplant .
A lot of special stuff goes on here and a lot of sick children get better , but he is probably at the top of our list
Dr Paul Veys
After three months a good match was found and Oscar had his first transplant .
But his blood counts remained low and he needed an operation to remove his spleen .
For some time this made a difference .
But just as he was set to go home , his leukaemia came back and a second , more experimental , type of transplant was needed .
Oscar 's doctor at Great Ormond Street , Paul Veys , head of the bone marrow transplant unit , said they gave him just a 10 % chance of survival .
His mother said this was one of the worst times for the family .
More battles But Oscar 's battles were not over as he then developed a very virulent version of graft - versus - host disease , where the new donor cells start to fight the patient 's body .
This is not uncommon following a transplant , but Oscar was very ill and spent weeks in intensive care with infections .
" There were times when Oscar was in intensive care and we thought he would n't make it , " said his mother .
" It was numbing .
Oscar had leukaemia twice " The first time he went into intensive care and had brain haemorrhages I was making his funeral arrangements . "
Dr Veys agreed that things had been fraught .
" He had one genetic disease and two , or possibly three , leukaemia at various times , " he said .
" He needed three transplants , the third with slightly specialised cells - he was the first child to be treated in the UK with this treatment .
" The bottom line is you do a transplant to try and cure the leukaemia , it comes back , you do the second transplant in a different way making the new cells fight like crazy but then they fight too much so we have to switch them off and that is the the reason for the third specialised cells , and the chances of his coming through that were extremely small .
" The horrible irony is that it 's often not the leukaemia that gets you , it 's the heavy treatment or the after - effects of it , either the infections or the graft - versus - host disease . "
Yvonne said things are now looking very rosy , although Oscar does have osteoporosis due to two years on steroids .
His growth also halted while he was taking the drugs , and his teeth were not replaced as he lost them .
This is all starting to improve and Oscar , aged 10 is now even boasting that he 's taller than his four year old brother , Finn .
" We came home June 2007 and have not been back since and his immune system is running at about 75 % , " said Yvonne .
" He went back to school in February 2008 and is absolutely loving it and joining in with everything .
" He is great and we have a normal family life now . "
' Not a dry eye ' Dr Veys , said Oscar is a star .
" A lot of special stuff goes on here and a lot of sick children get better , but he is probably at the top of our list .
Oscar is now back at school " Not many children survive three procedures , but his outlook is very good now and he is helping fundraising by giving presentations to major donors .
" He is very good and will stand up in front of a crowd .
" He looks younger than he is , and when he tells his dramatic story there is not a dry eye in the house . "

Earlier this month I had the pleasure to tell you about the Chronologium Academicus , a remarkable poster that a man named Guy Cutrufo has devised in the hopes of helping to restore academic knowledge to its rightful place against the onslaught of mindless celebrity culture —
“ An Antidote for Trivia , ” it says .
Well , now Guy has done us all the favor of sending a review copy so I can examine it more closely and report back to KtB -land .
First things first : make room .
This heavy - stock , fully - laminated poster is big .
I already stated the dimensions , 53.25 ″ x 73.25 ″ , but many of you probably not quite aware of how much room that will really take on your wall .
A lot .
Fortunately , the poster comes complete with sheet on “ suggestions for mounting , ” which include wood lattice , Styrocore , framing , and double - sided tape methods ( for me , 45 1 - inch pieces of single - sided Scotch tape failed to suffice ) .
Until you get your Chronologium Academicus mounted on a wall , with the top no more than a foot above eye - level , you wo n’t be able to get much of anything out of it .
Once mounted , stand back , and observe the sheer vastness of human accomplishment ; then , come close , and prepare for an onslaught of knowledge .
The main body of the poster consists of 14 separate columns of chronologically - arranged milestones in almost microscopic text , each column belonging to a particular discipline .
The columns all list something like 400 dated milestones .
Milestones are for the most part events ( “ Earliest known use of zero was made in India … 876 B.C. ” ) and influential works ( “ Troeltsch : The Idea of German Freedom … 1916 ″ ) .
So that ’s in the neighborhood of 5,600 milestones total .
As if that were n’t enough to take in , surrounding the columns are 700 portraits of the people mentioned therein .
Yes , the vast , vast majority are white men , but just when you think that ’s all there are in a given patch , you ’ll be delighted to discover an admirable ( almost certainly white ) woman among them .
Along the bottom , in small print — though no smaller than the rest — are image credits for the entire roster of them .
Just looking at the thing and thinking about the exactitude that went into it can make one dizzy .
For this reason I recommend leaving at least half an hour after a meal before looking at your Chronologium Academicus , just in case .
The columns are not only chronological ; they ’re synchronized .
Across all 14 , a given year is at approximately the same level .
That means it ’s quite easy to discover that during the reign of the Mogul emperor Akbar in India ( 1556 -1605 ) , Montaigne was writing his essays , Michaelangelo ’s dome at St. Peter ’s was underway , religious wars against the French Hugenots were being fought , and Mayan civilization was first being discovered in the Yucatan by the Spaniards .
It ’s quite astonishing , since in some cases these momentous , world - historical things were happening without being aware of each other .
Only a Chronologium Academicus can bring them together , it seems .
Since this is Killing the Buddha , let ’s pay special attention to the column on religion .
It begins , dated c. 40,000 B.C. , with “ Belief in the supernatural sprang from fear of the unknown . ”
Of course this is a very particular view , one closest to the views of Victorian English anthropologist Edward Burnett Tylor , and it has weathered more than a century of criticism since .
But fair enough — it was so long ago that nobody really cares .
The list that follows does a good job of catching the founders of major religions , from Zoroaster to Mary Baker Eddy .
It may seem like an affront to some that Jesus is simply the “ founder of Christianity , ” while Mohammad is both the “ founder of Islam ” and the “ Prophet . ”
Two entries among them give exact dates : Luther ’s big coming - out in Wittenberg and the Nazis ’ proclamation of the persecution of the Jews .
The vast majority , though , cite the authors and titles of works , some of which you ’ll know and most of which you probably wo n’t .
At the bottom — naturally the densest century is the most recent one — there is a pretty diverse selection of the most abstruse titles by theologians , philosophers , and scholars of religion .
Lots of Tillich .

As far as goes plain ease of use , yes , I would say , certainly .
It ’s hard to get very far with it anyway without breaking out Wikipedia in order to look up some title or other ( the entries are so many and specialized it is doubtful that any print encyclopedia ever created would suffice ) .

The firm projects that banks will lose $ 112 billion on option ARMs written from 2005 to 2007 .
The respite for option ARMs recently is that interest rates have dropped , so loans take longer to reach their cap and do not recast to as high a rate , said Chandrajit Bhattacharya , a mortgage analyst at Credit Suisse .
Loans that would have recast this spring will remain at low rates until next year , Mr. Bhattacharya said .
Banks are using the reprieve to help some owners refinance into more conventional loans , said Michael Fratantoni , vice president of single family research for the Mortgage Bankers Association .
But the loans have had extraordinarily high rates of failure even before reaching their reset dates .
Ron Dzurinko , 62 , who lives on a fixed income in Sacramento , took out an option ARM five years ago without understanding it , knowing only that he could afford the initial payments of $ 900 a month .
“ The mortgage person said , ‘ It could adjust , but we do n’t foresee any major bumps , ’ ” Mr. Dzurinko said .
“ It sounded good to me . ”
When his payments shot up to $ 1,400 last fall , he said , he defaulted on credit cards , took in a tenant and started a vegetable garden , but still could not make the payments .
Meanwhile , his home ’s value fell below his $ 260,000 balance .
Finally , through a lawyer at Legal Services of Northern California , he was able to get the loan modified to $ 800 a month  but only after months of calls and rejections .
Mr. Clavon has not had this relief .
Sam Hussein , a housing counselor at the nonprofit Clearpoint Credit Counseling Solutions , who has been trying since February to help Mr. Clavon modify his loan , said that even for his eligible clients , lenders have agreed to modifications only about half the time  “ and then it ’s usually on the lender ’s terms , ” with payments often increased , at least temporarily , he said .
Amid the wreckage , though , option ARMs have been a boon for some borrowers .
Gary Kopff , 64 , a retired financial manager , took an option ARM on his Washington home in 2006 , increasing his balance to $ 1.2 million from $ 800,000 .
Mr. Kopff chose the minimum payments so that all of his payments were interest , allowing him the greatest tax deduction , and because he had no desire to pay off his home .
But a surprising thing happened .
His rate went down .
Mr. Kopff ’s rate is tied to a figure called the London interbank offered rate , or Libor , a measure of the rates banks charge one another to borrow money .
As the 30 - day Libor fell to less than one half of 1 percent , the rate on Mr. Kopff ’s loan fell below 3 percent .
Still in its inaugural year , the project led by Cambridge University 's Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology , has already handed out around 10 grants to tribes from Mongolia to Nigeria - and the researchers admitted traditional British languages such as Cornish and Gaelic are also at risk .

The coal - industry group Families Organized to Represent the Coal Economy , which does n’t actually allow families to join , has a wonderfully crappy coloring book for children .
Let ’s have a look !
Plot , character development , and drawings that kids would actually want to color do n’t seem to be priorities for “ Eyes for Frosty . ”
At least it picks a relevant topic in snowmen — they wo n’t be around for long if the coal industry succeeds in stomping all over climate change legislation .
And kids will be stuck with the consequences of our fossil - fuel pollution , so it sort of makes sense to at least leave them with a coloring book .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) -
The death of composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart at the age of 35 may have been caused by complications stemming from strep throat , according to a Dutch study published on Monday .
Since the composer ’s death in 1791 , there have been various theories about the cause of his untimely end , from intentional poisoning , to rheumatic fever , to trichinosis , a parasitic disease caused by eating raw or undercooked pork .
On his death certificate it was officially recorded that the cause of death was hitziges Frieselfieber , or “ heated miliary fever , ” referring to a rash that looks like millet seeds .
But researchers from the University of Amsterdam in the Netherlands said studies on his death have generally been based on less - than - reliable evidence , like accounts from people who witnessed Mozart ’s final days , written decades after his death .
Their new study , reported in the Annals of Internal Medicine , was based on information from official death registers for Vienna in the winter of 1791 that places Mozart ’s death in a wider context .
He died in Vienna .
“ Our findings suggest that Mozart fell victim to an epidemic of strep throat infection that was contracted by many Viennese people in Mozart ’s month of death , and that Mozart was one of several persons in that epidemic that developed a deadly kidney complication , ” researcher Richard Zegers , of the University of Amsterdam in the Netherlands , told Reuters Health .
Zegers and his colleagues said this “ minor epidemic ” of step throat , or streptococcal pharyngitis , may have begun in the city ’s military hospital .
According to witness accounts , Mozart fell ill with an “ inflammatory fever , ” which is consistent with strep throat , Zegers and his colleagues wrote in their report .
The composer , who wrote more than 600 works during his life , eventually developed severe swelling , “ malaise , ” back pain and a rash , consistent with a strep infection leading to kidney inflammation known as glomerulonephritis .
Zegers said it was also possible that Mozart had scarlet fever , which , like strep throat , can be caused by infection with streptococcal bacteria , but this was less likely because witnesses said Mozart developed a rash near the end of his illness and with scarlet fever , the rash appears early on .
Hacks
For whatever reason , the links seem to have been mixed up .
This should fix it .
The Christian right did n't murder George Tiller , said James Kirchick in The Wall Street Journal .
The killing of the late - term abortion doctor in a Wichita church was the work of a lone gunman .
The Left is using the attack to smear religious conservatives as a sort of American Taliban , but the truth is that " every anti-abortion group in the country " has denounced the violent methods of " Judeo - Christian extremists . "
It 's not enough that " most — though not all — of the anti-abortion movement 's leaders were quick to condemn Tiller 's murder , " said Tim Rutten in the Los Angeles Times .
The man accused of gunning down Tiller , Scott Roeder , had the phone number of a leader of anti-abortion protest group Operation Rescue in his pocket .
Everybody who has ever said that voluntarily ending a pregnancy is murder can now see " the influence their inflammatory rhetoric " can have on an " unstable " fanatic .
Like it or not , said Kathleen Parker in The Washington Post , right - wing " wackos " taint the conservative cause .
" The man who pulled the trigger " killed George Tiller , but " fire - breathers on the Right " — including anti-abortion leader Randall Terry , founder of Operation Rescue — also alienate the mainstream .
And if the Republican Party does n't want its image to be stained by fringe elements , it has to do more to " marginalize those who belong in the margins . "
After scouring book reviews and Wikipedia , a list of the Top Ten Best Apocalyptic Novels was born .

World War Z
Documenting the war on zombies , “ World War Z ” takes you through horific times with some of the most vivid writing this genre has ever seen .
The book is told from a narative perspective of several different characters , sharing their versions of the Zombie war .
The outbreak , which started somewhere in China , spread throught the world , causing distruction and chaos .
While the zombies are never completely irradicated , some symblance of life does appear to go on , after an eventual move of the US Capital , several barriers against the undead , and millions of lives lost .
“ World War Z ” paints such a realistic picture of a world after Zombies that even skeptics would find themselves engrossed in the novel !
Blindness
Forget world wide pandemics of flesh eating bacteria or a zombie illness !
Portugese author Jose Saramago took one of the most common afflictions , loss of sight , and turned it into my worst nightmare ! in “ Blindness ” , a mass epidemic of sight - loss sweeps an unidentified city , causing a break down in society , civilization , and everyday function .
The books main characters band together , forming a family unit , comprised of a doctor and his wife and his patients .
The wife has somehow been spared from the epidemic and helps the unit function .
They are placed in an asylum where the infected are being contained , which eventually detiriorates to filth , due to everyone ’s lack of sight .
The family unit escapes and attempts to build a new life in the outside world , just as sight is returned , just as quickly as it was taken away .
I do n’t know who I felt worse for reading this book .
The people who lost their sight , who began living in their own filth and scrounging for food , or the doctor ’s wife who had to take care of them all and see everything that was happening around her .
The Road
If you are a parent , or a person who does n’t wish harm upon children , you might find this book slightly disturbing .
‘ The Road ’ focuses on the journey of a father and son , after an unnamed apocalyptic event wipes out a majority of the earth ’s population , as well as the ability to grow plants .
The father and son , only identified as the “ Man ” and the “ Boy ” , are attempting to make it to the coast , to an undetermined hope .
The pair encounter several disturbing sights along the way , including a cannibalistic “ army ” , a baby roasting on a split , and humans who are being kept locked away and used for limb - harvesting ( for food obviously ) .
There are some high points in the book , but overall , it paints a pretty grim picture .
Towards the end of the novel , the father gets ill and dies , leaving the boy to be taken in by a couple who has been observing the pair for some time .
It is n’t a happy ending , but it does keep you from wanting to kill yourself !
The Postman
This post - apocalyptic novel is about a drifter who finds himself taking shelter in an abandoned postal van .
Gordan Krantz , the protagonist , takes the uniform of a postman only to keep him warm , but when he begins carrying mail on his journey , he begins to restore hope to survivors .
Eventually , Krantz encounters a small community led by Cyclops , an artificial intelligence created at Oregon State University that managed to survive .
Krantz learns however that the machine was destroyed and that it ’s appearance is being maintained by a group of scientists who are trying to “ keep hope , order , and knowledge alive ” .
Krantz eventually pairs up with the Cyclops scientists in their war against the hyper - survivalists , who have begun and extreme version of life .
By the end of the novel , the impression is given that the three groups rally together to help revive civilization .
Oryx and Crake
This novel begins after yet another collapse of civilization , with the protagonist , Snowman , living as a hermit .
He lives near by a community of what he calls “ Crakers ” , which appear to be strange human like creatures .
It is revealed in the story that the crakers , as well as beasts like wolvogs , piggons , and rakunks , are the products of genetic engineering .
Through flashbacks , the reader learns that Snowman grew up as Jimmy in the mid-21st century .
His parents were both scientists who lived in privileged compounds that separated them from commoners , or pleeblands .
When Jimmy ’s family moves to a compound , he meets Glenn , or Crake as he is referred to through out the story .
The boys play games , smoke weed , as well as other slightly disturbing activities such as watching live executions and child pornography .
Jimmy and Crake eventually become obsessed with a young asian girl they see in a child porn video .
Jimmy seeks the girl out and eventually meets
Oryx , who could be the same girl , but it is never clarified .
Orxy becomes highly involved in the lives of both young men .
As time goes on , Crake becomes a bio engineer while Jimmy focuses on the arts and literature .
Crake soon embarks on an endeavor to create peaceful human - like creatures which he calls Crakers .
Crakers are leaf - eating herbivores who only have sex during a mating period , therefore eliminating several “ human ” disputes .
Eventually , Crake releases a world wide virus , which wipes out a huge percentage of the population , except Jimmy , who was unknowingly vaccinated .
Crake is soon painted as a “ Mad Scientist ” , and eventually kills Oryx .
The reader is transported through out an incredible series of events and begins to feel sympathy towards all characters , including the “ villain ” , Crake .
The book ends leaving the reader wondering whether Snowman will return to life with humans , or continue to look after the Crakers , as he promised Oryx before she died .
A Canticle for Leibowitz
“ A Canticle for Leibowitz ” spans thousands of years set in a Roman Catholic monastery .
After a devastating nuclear war , the novel follows along while civilization makes attempts at rebuilding itself .
The monks of the Albertian Order of Leibowitz take on the mission of preserving and protecting the pieces of human ’s scientific knowledge until the world is ready for that kind of information again .
The apocalyptic event in this story is a backlash against advanced technology and knowledge .
During a time that is referred to in the book as “ simplification ” , any one who had any learning , and eventually anyone who could even read , was killed by angry mobs , with books being destroyed and illiteracy taking over the world .
Isaac Leibowitz had been a Jewish engineer working for the US Military , but converts to Catholicism and begins the Albertian Order .
Their mission becomes to protect , memorize , and preserve any books , from before the Simplification .
The novel is separated into three different parts , “ Fiat Homo ( Let There Be Man ) ” , “ Fiat Lux ( Let There Be Light ) ” , and “ Fiat Voluntas Tua ( Let Thy Will Be Done ) ” .
The novel is an interesting look into what our world would become if communication , science , technological advances , and knowledge were suddenly cut off from every day people .
Alas , Babylon
Published in 1959 , “ Alas , Babylon ” was one of the first post - apocalyptic novels of the nuclear age .
The story focuses on the small town of Fort Repose , Florida and the effects that a nuclear war had on it .
The protagonist , Randy Bragg , is a former Korean War vet who becomes a hero after the Soviet Union starts a nuclear war with the US .
Several towns in Florida , including Jacksonville , Tampa and Miami are reported as being destroyed , leaving the citizens of Fort Repose to their own measures .
Communication is limited , and the city is quickly emptied of money and supplies .
People in the town quickly learn how to survive , with Bragg leading the way .
In the end , the Air Force offers to move the remaining families of Fort Repose out of their survivalist world , however , non accept .
Alas , Babylon shows how quickly the world could deteriorate if a Nuclear war started .
Do n’t be alarmed if after you read it , you feel the need to go to Costco for bottled water and dry goods !
Lucifer ’s Hammer
If you ’re one to quickly oppose scientists , then Lucifer ’s Hammer might be just the post - apocalyptic book for you !
Even after several reassurances by astronomer Tim Hamner that a new comet wo n’t be crashing into the earth , people still begin hoarding and collecting food .
Scientists realize that they have mis-tracked the trajectory of the comet , which eventually breaks into several smaller pieces and devastates the earth with its collision .
The strike causes volcanoes , earthquakes , tsunamis and endless weeks of rain , which cause food and other survival necessities to be lost .
After the “ Hammerfall ” , Hamner steps up from a quiet astronomer to a “ determined survivor ” .
He fights to keep he and his new wife , Eileen safe , in such a tumultuous world .
This book particularly got me thinking , just because we rely so much on what scientists tell us .
What if they really did get it wrong ?
Swan Song
Swan Song does n’t start out on a particularly happy note .
The world is in turmoil , with the U.S. and USSR fighting all around the world .
When all of the bombs are launched , the world is covered in mushroom shaped clouds .
The novel follows several main characters , including a NYC bag lady called Sister Creep , Josh , aka Black Frankestein , a 7 foot tall wrestler with a heart the size of Texas , and Roland Croninger , an incredibly smart kid .
Of course good vs. evil is prominent through out the novel .
The bad lies within “ The Man With the Scarlet Eye ” , who is a shape shifter , always up to no good .
The very refreshing good however is a blonde girl named Swan , who possesses the ability to replenish the earth .
The book is pretty big ( 950 pages ! ) , and if you can get through it , its probably the most terrifying post apocalyptic novel out there !
On the Beach
“ On the Beach ” does n’t only qualify as one of the best Post - Apocalyptic novels , it qualifies as one of the most depressing .
If you ’re looking for sunshine and rainbows , this is n’t one you ’ll want to check out !
The novel starts in the mid-sixties , after the air in the Northern Hemisphere has been polluted with nuclear fallout , killing all animal life , including humans .
Air currents are slowly carrying the fallout to the southern hemisphere , where the only humans live , slowly succumbing to radiation poisoning .
The Australian government makes arrangements for its citizens , providing free suicide pills and injections , allowing the people to avoid the slow and painful death of radiation poisoning .
A submarine crew is dispatched to Seattle to respond to a signal , only to discover that the wind was blowing a coke bottle onto a telegraph machine .
The crew then realizes that the results of the nuclear war are n’t dissipating , and that the people living in the south will die shortly .
The characters in the novel then try to happily live out their final days , some returning to their hometowns , others taking classes and staying busy .
In the end , the characters do n’t continue to run , but accept their death once the radiation reaches them .
Probably the most depressing point in the book is when one Australian officer must explain to his wife how to euthanize their baby daughter and then kill herself , should the radiation reach them .
Like I said , not all sunshine and rainbows .
Z for Zachariah
“ Z for Zachariah ” starts by introducing the reader to Ann Burden , the protagonist , who has been living alone in a valley for over a year after a nuclear war , which has rendered all other places inhabitable .
One day , Ann sees a stranger in a protective suit entering the valley , which changes her life forever .
When he determines that the valley is safe , he takes off his suit and swims , but unfortunately , the water is contaminated by water being brought in from the outside .
Once he is sick , Ann decides to try to help him .
Once he is better , he introduces himself as John R. Loomis , a scientist who was helping to design the protective suits underground when the war began .
The sickness soon takes over his body completely , sending him into a coma , during which Ann continues to look after him .
He begins to recover and becomes highly possessive of Ann .
One night , he attempts to rape her , and Ann decides she must leave the comfort of her home .
She attempts to coexist in the valley with Loomis , but he makes it difficult , cutting her off from food and supplies , and even shooting her in the leg .
Eventually ,
Ann tells him she is taking the suit and the cart and leaving .
She tells him that if he kills her , then he ’ll truly be alone .
Ann sets of in the direction of birds , hoping to continue her life .
This novel is popular among young adults , because the main character is a strong willed young person .
There are obviously sad portions , but there are also light , almost comical moments that keep you turning the page .
I Am Legend
If the only opinions you have of ‘ I am Legend ’ come from the horrible movie adaptation starring Will Smith , erase them all .
Probably one of the greatest pieces of fiction ever written , much less in the “ post - apocalyptic ” category , “ I am Legend ” deals with the idea of becoming obsolete , which plagues so many people .
After a bacterial pandemic wipes out the entire human race , Robert Neville , the novel ’s main character , is the only human left in a world of vampires .
Neville attempts to study and cure the disease , to which he became immune after a bite from a bat that was infected .
Neville eventually discovers that the strain of bacteria is able to infect both the deceased and the living , leaving the living slightly human , although exhibiting signs of vampirism .
Robert comes across a woman who appears to be uninfected and captures her .
He becomes suspicious of her after her reluctance to kill the vampires .
She finally agrees to a blod test and just when Neville realizes she is infected , she knocks him out .
She leaves him a note , sharying the adaptations that the infected have made towards sunlight and how they have even developed pills that keep their desires at bay .
She tells him that they are attempting to rebuild society .
Eventually the vampires come for him , and he is wounded and captured .
When he knows death is near , Ruth comes to visit and gives him some pills that will make his death easier .
He asks Ruth not to let society get heartless and after a kiss , she leaves .
Neville finally realizes that he is the only survivor and is therefore feared by this new race .
As he realizes that life with infection could be normal again one day , he chuckles before he dies , thinking “ [ I am ] a new superstition entering the unassailable fortress of forever .
I am legend . ”
When eight British soldiers were killed in Afghanistan the second week of July , bringing the total lost to 184 , the country ’s media exploded in debate .
The deaths meant that Britain had lost more troops in Afghanistan than in Iraq .
And from the front pages - where the soldiers ’ public funerals were prominently covered - to deep inside , the Independent , the Times , the Guardian , the Telegraph and other newspapers took a serious look at the policy of Gordon Brown ’s government in Afghanistan .
Television programs were likewise engaged .
As well as the parliamentary opposition .
One complaint provoking widespread ire was something familiar to Americans , a lack of adequate equipment for those sent into harm ’s way .
In this case , it was not having enough helicopters used to extract soldiers in tight spots .
But , in spite of the government ’s inadequate reply , that was n’t the primary issue explored in the media page after page , day after day .
What underpinned all of the tens of thousands of words devoted to the subject boiled down to why are we there ?
and when are we coming home ?
Ian , Nigel and Donald , soldiers of the First Battalion of the Prince of Wales Own Regiment , just returned from Kosovo , stand in front of the York Minster on July 21 .
Asked if they expected to go to Afghanistan , Nigel said , " I hope not . "
Donald interjected , " We go where we ’re sent . "
[ Photo by MB ]
As of today , 206 British soldiers have been killed in Afghanistan , and the debate has intensified .
Not least because General Sir David Richards , who takes over Friday as the Chief of the General Staff , said of Afghanistan in an interview August 8 : " This is nation - building — not the starry - eyed type , but nation - building none the less .
It is not just reconstruction ; jobs and simple governance ...
The army ’s role will evolve , but the whole process might take as long as 30 or 40 years . "
That statement brought on fresh media outbursts .
And while other British generals say the mission requires more troops , however long it lasts , there was also buzz over Brown apparently seeking to bring home as many as 1500 of Britain ’s troops by the end of the year .
In the United States , however , there has been comparatively little coverage of Afghanistan , a bare whisper of debate .
Funerals of the scores of Americans killed in the Afghan surge have not made it to the front page .
Worse , most of the left blogosphere , once alive with fierce daily discussion of war , has had only brief flurries of commentary and analysis on Afghanistan since President Obama ’s speech about his new policy in March to " dismantle , disrupt , and defeat " al - Qaida .
It ’s become the invisible war .
That ’s in spite of the fact that far more Americans are now dying there than in Iraq , and this year the Pentagon is slated to spend $ 65 billion there , as opposed to $ 61 billion in Iraq .
Part of this inattention may be chalked up to the on - going fight over health care , a subject which has , quite understandably , sucked most of the oxygen out of the room as activists try to salvage a reform that has been sabotaged by dilution , capitulation to insurance interests , poor messaging and officious sneering at the people who have objected to all three .
Nonetheless , with a couple of weeks or so remaining before the commanding general in Afghanistan , Stanley McChrystal , publicly delivers his strategic assessment of the situation , the silence is , as the cliché has it , deafening .
McChrystal 's assessment will not specifically ask for more troops , according to Secretary of Defense Robert Gates .
But shortly after it ’s released we can almost certainly expect the general to request thousands more soldiers and billions more dollars .
Under the circumstances , the near silence from progressives is deplorable .
A good leader , as our new President said during the campaign , must multitask .
Nothing gives us immunity from that admonition .
Given that 70 % of Democrats polled now say the war is n’t worth fighting , and a plurality of 45 % of Americans say the number of troops should be reduced , while only 24 % say they should be increased , what 's stopped our tongues ?
Surely it is n’t because we ’re afraid of an argument among ourselves .
Or with President Obama .
Those have never been obstacles before .
Is it because so many progressives are internally conflicted about this war ?
Is it because so many believe it is a righteous war , a just and legitimate war botched and left unfinished by the Cheney - Bush cabal and amenable to corrective action ?
Is it the belief that we broke it so we must fix it ?
That we must catch or kill Osama bin Laden ?
Is it because we fear calling it a dumb war ?
Of giving the brigades of armchair warriors and McCarthyists an excuse for once again calling us weak on defense ?
Of leaving the women of Afghanistan to their fate under fundamentalists even though we have n’t invaded Saudi Arabia to liberate them there ?
Of leaving Pakistan ’s nukes to their fate under the same fundamentalists ?
Is it because we think the U.S. can make life better for Afghans and safer for Americans ?
Or that fraudulent elections run by a corrupt president who calls warlord war criminals such as Rashid Dostum back into the country to help deliver votes will actually work to bring peace ?
Does the departure of Dick Cheney from the main stage make us shy away from the word empire ?
What about any of this makes us jabbermouths on so many profoundly divisive issues so hesitant to speak on this one ?
The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , Admiral Mike Mullen , said Sunday that the situation is not good in Afghanistan and that it must improve in the next 12 to 18 months or there will be congressional and popular pressure against the policy .
But what would mark improvement ?
Fewer killings ?
Better delivery of services ?
A smaller poppy crop ?
Improved infrastructure ?
Even the Bush administration conceded rhetorically that there was no wholly military solution in Afghanistan .
The Obama White House has taken that idea a good deal more seriously .
" Civilian surge " and " it ’s not about how many enemies we kill ; it ’s about how many civilians we protect " have now become the mantra .
But as all good reporters have been told since the dawn of investigative reporting : follow the money .
At the city council level or in Washington , policy follows budget .
If you want something to work , you spend dollars on it .
The Pentagon budget for Afghanistan this year is $ 65 billion .
The USAID budget of civilian aid for winning hearts and minds in Afghanistan and Pakistan is $ 4.4 billion .
The words deliver one message , the dollars another .
It ’s not that the administration does n’t have worthwhile ideas about how to improve life for the average Afghan – electricity and clean water and a $ 12,000 school would make the typical rural village a far better place .
It ’s the implementation that is n’t happening .
While 17,000 more troops have been making their way to Afghanistan , only 92 of the State Department ’s promised 313 new civilians have been hired .
Many of those civilians are doing terrific humanitarian work .
But most of the billions they are supposed to be sinking into worthwhile projects are being sucked away by corruption long before it reaches the locales where it is supposed to be spent .
This , accompanied with the slowness with which the civilian end of things has been delivered since the Bush administration , is cause for much understandable grumbling by the Afghan people .
Meanwhile , apparently without the slightest backward glance , the Pentagon is considering putting private security companies on the front lines in Afghanistan with even broader authority than they had in Iraq where mercenaries killed unarmed civilians with impunity .
The assault on the drug lords in areas of Afghanistan held by that loose confederation of insurgents inaccurately called " the Taliban " conveniently leaves alone the drug lords of the old Northern Alliance associated with or supportive of the Karzai government .
Assuming that the massive training of tens of thousands of Afghan police and troops actually succeeds , nobody has yet determined where the money will come from to fund an army that will cost more to operate than Afghanistan ’s total government revenue .
Atop everything else , there is no exit plan and , of course , not even a hint of an exit date .
Is Sir Richard right ?
Are we talking not years , but decades ?
Thomas H. Johnson and M. Chris Mason write in Foreign Policy :
" For those who say that comparing the current war in Afghanistan to the Vietnam War is taking things too far , here 's a reality check :
It 's not taking things far enough .
From the origins of these North - South conflicts to the role of insurgents and the pointlessness of this week 's Afghan presidential elections , it 's impossible to ignore the similarities between these wars .
The places and faces may have changed but the enemy is old and familiar .
The sooner the United States recognises this , the sooner it can stop making the same mistakes in Afghanistan .
" Even at first glance the structural parallels alone are sobering .
Both Vietnam and Afghanistan ( prior to the US engagement there ) had surprisingly defeated a European power in a guerrilla war that lasted a decade , followed by a largely north - south civil war which lasted another decade .
Insurgents in both countries enjoyed the advantage of a long , trackless , and uncloseable border and sanctuary beyond it , where they maintained absolute political control .
Both were land wars in Asia with logistics lines more than 9,000 miles long and extremely harsh terrain with few roads , which nullified US advantages in ground mobility and artillery .
Other key contributing factors bear a striking resemblance : Almost exactly 80 per cent of the population of both countries was rural , and literacy hovered around 10 per cent .
" In both countries , the United States sought to create an indigenous army modeled in its own image , based on US army organisation charts .
With the ARVN [ Army of the Republic of Vietnam ] in South Vietnam and the ANA [ Afghan National Army ] in today 's Afghanistan , assignment of personnel as combat advisors and mentors was the absolute lowest priority .
And in both wars , the US military grossly misled the American people about the size of the indigenous force over a protracted period .
In Afghanistan , for example , the US military touts 91,000 ANA soldiers as ' trained and equipped , ' knowing full well that barely 39,000 are still in the ranks and present for duty .
" The United States consistently and profoundly misunderstood the nature of the enemy it was fighting in each circumstance .
In Vietnam , the United States insisted on fighting a war against communism , while the enemy was fighting a war of national reunification .
In Afghanistan , the United States still insists on fighting a secular counterinsurgency , while the enemy is fighting a jihad . "
Peter Baker looks at the Vietnam scenario in a slightly different way .
Recently , director Robert Greenwald of Brave New Films has been putting together a documentary on Afghanistan .
It ’s now in six parts that you can view on - line for free .
It ’s not the be-all , end - all of the Afghanistan story .
There are contrary voices .
But it provides an excellent place to begin what should be an everyday discussion .
Here is part 6 .
You can see the other parts here .
Violent clashes erupted Thursday in downtown Tehran between thousands of defiant protesters chanting “ Death to the dictator ” and security forces wielding truncheons , as the political crisis over Iran ’s disputed presidential election stretched into its fourth week .
Contingents of uniformed and plainclothes security forces flooded the city ’s central squares and managed with batons and tear gas to eventually disperse the demonstrators , many of whom wore black and held up their fingers in V - for- victory salutes .
Demonstrators in and around Enghelab ( Revolution ) Square set fire to trash bins to ward off the effects of the tear gas , witnesses said , but mostly avoided engaging security forces in the rock throwing and running street battles that characterized the protests held just after the June 12 election .
There were reports of clashes in other Iranian cities , but they could not be confirmed .

Demonstrators said they were determined to defy the authorities , led by supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , who have demanded an end to rallies and acts of civil disobedience .
Tracts distributed online and as leaflets called on protesters to borrow the nonviolent tactics of the U.S. civil rights movement , avoid rifts within their ranks and do nothing that would hamper morale .
Protesters chanted in support of Mir-Hossein Mousavi , who authorities say was defeated by incumbent Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in the presidential vote , and they urged security forces to join them .
“ Mojtaba , may you die , so that you do n’t get the supreme leadership , ” went one chant , referring to Khamenei ’s son , who is said to be behind the crackdown and angling for his father ’s job .
Though the number of protesters was nowhere close to the hundreds of thousands who took to the streets soon after the election , organizers showed that they could quickly assemble a crowd despite the efforts of security forces .

Thursday was also the anniversary of a student uprising that was violently crushed by the government 10 years ago -- a perennial occasion for confrontations between demonstrators and police .
“ It is going to continue , ” vowed a marcher in his 60s , big drops of sweat on his forehead .
“ They have killed our dear youth .
How can we forgive them ? ”
Many of the demonstrators wore surgical masks to conceal their identities from cameras positioned on nearby buildings .
They could be seen fleeing into side streets and regrouping as shops were quickly shuttered .
Some witnesses said pro-government Basiji militiamen also wore masks , to hide their faces from protesters ’ cameras .
Passing drivers and motorcyclists honked their horns and flashed the victory sign in support of the clusters of demonstrators .
Business owners could be seen hustling protesters into their buildings to shield them from police .
One witness described at least 10,000 demonstrators gathered in one spot , but there was no independent confirmation .

Uniformed security forces on motorcycles and plainclothes officers had blocked off streets around Enghelab Square , near the Tehran University epicenter of the protest .
One witness said shots were fired in the air near Vali Asr Square , another downtown crossroads where demonstrators had planned to gather if Enghelab was inaccessible .
As militiamen would try to drag away demonstrators , a witness said , protesters would join together to overpower them .
He also said he saw women with their head scarves pulled off being forced into police vans .
One woman taking pictures with her cellphone camera was dragged away .
One witness said five Basiji militiamen pummeled an elderly lady who loudly warned them that they would receive their comeuppance on Judgment Day .
Police managed to quell the demonstrations within three hours , witnesses said .
“ We will wait to see the reflection of today ’s event in the local and international media and the responses of the authorities .
Then we get together with our fellow demonstrators and decide another contingency plan for further struggles , ” said Farzad , a 28 - year - old who asked that his last name not be published .

Early in the day , Tehran Gov. Gen. Morteza Tamaddon had vowed that any protest would receive a “ crushing ” response .
“ No request was made for any permit for rallies on Thursday and no permit has been issued , ” Tamaddon said , according to the official Islamic Republic News Agency .
“ The enemies of the Iranian nation are angry with the postelection calm in Iran and try to damage it through their TV channels . ”
State television did not mention the unrest .
Speaking to a gathering of provincial governors , whom he appoints , Ahmadinejad described the unrest as a Western attempt to pressure Iran .

“ The enemies of Iranians are very angry because despite their propaganda and efforts , a government that has the support of 40 million votes has come to power , ” the president said , according to the semiofficial Iranian Students News Agency .
“ We will not give these oppressive powers any advantage , and they are forced to deal with this government . ”

Henry Surtees , the son of 1964 Formula 1 world champion John Surtees , has died following an accident in a Formula 2 race at Brands Hatch on Sunday .
During the second of the weekend 's races , the 18 - year - old was struck on the head by a wheel and tyre from the car of Jack Clarke , who had spun into the wall exiting Westfield Bend .
Surtees was knocked unconscious in the accident and his car failed to negotiate the following Sheene Corner , running straight off the track and into the barrier .
Medical crews were swiftly on the scene to extract Surtees from the car , before he was taken to the track 's medical centre .
He was stabilised at the circuit 's facility before being airlifted to the Royal London hospital .
A spokesperson for the hospital this evening confirmed that Surtees had died from his injuries .
Surtees graduated to F2 this season from Formula Renault and had taken his first podium finish in the series with third place in Saturday 's race at Brands Hatch .
His step up to the category came after several seasons in karts , which included victory in the Junior Gearbox Championship in 2005 , before a graduation to car racing in the Ginetta Junior Championship in 2006 .
He switched to single seaters in 2007 , taking a race victory in Formula BMW UK for Carlin Motorsport en route to seventh overall in the standings - and second in the rookie cup .
He also made a brief foray into the Formula Renault UK championship that year , contesting the final two rounds at Thruxton as well as the Winter Series .
In 2008 he remained in Formula Renault , taking 12th in the final standings before finishing runner - up in the Winter Series with one victory and three podiums from four races .
He also contested last year 's British Formula 3 season finale in a National Class car for Carlin , taking one victory and one podium .
AUTOSPORT sends its sincere condolences to Henry 's family and friends .
I do n't generally post strategy advice on my blog since it would effect my win rate negatively .
However , what I can do is give advice / stats on things such as variance and table selection .
That 's what I 'm going to do in this entry since 95 % + of poker players seem to be pretty clueless in these areas .
It will be long but if you read the whole entry & use it correctly it will probably be the most useful blog entry I 've ever made .
Let 's start with variance since it kind of tied into table selection .
We 'll start w/ some stats that I 've posted on my blog numerous times already :
After 500 games you 're 50 % likely to be within 5 % of your true ROIAfter 1,000 games you 're 67 % likely to be within 5 % of your true ROIAfter 3,000 games you 're 90 % likely to be within 5 % of your true ROIAs you can see , these samples do n't tell you a whole lot .
5 % 1 way or the other can be the difference between being a winning player or a losing player at the high stakes games these days .
If your true ROI is 5 % and you play 1,000 SNGs , your ROI can range from - 8 % to 25 % .
Only around 1/5th to 1/4th of the time when you play 1,000 SNGs will your ROI actually come within 1 % of your true ROI .
In over 10 % of a 5 % players ' 1,000 game sessions they will experience a negative ROI .
In about 1/7th of 1,000 game sessions you will experience an ROI that is more than double your true ROI .
Your ROI can be 3 to 4 x your true ROI over 1,000 games .
In over 10 % of sessions a 5 % player will experience a 60 buy - in or greater downswing .
The vast majority of 1,000 game sessions ( 90 % or so ) will contain a downswing of at least 25 buy - ins .
Although very rare , downswings can be as big as 300 + buy - ins for a 5 % ROI player .
After playing 18,000 games , your ROI can be as much as 50 % off your true ROI .
For example , if your ROI over 18,000 games was 10 % then your true ROI could range anywhere from 5 % to 15 % .
Now I 'm not saying this is likely , but it can happen , & it should be pretty eye opening for you guys .
I 've seen players run at 5 - 6 % over 20,000 games , only to break - even or lose over their next 20,000 games .
Now part of this was that the games got a lot tougher & they did n't stay ahead of the curve , but you get the point .
Now that you 're educated in variance , let 's move on to table selection .
A recent study was done to see how winning players effect your ROI .
Here 's how much each type of player lowers your ROI when they sit in your game : Good player : - 4.5 % Decent player : - 2.8 % Barely winning player : - 2 % We 'll assume we play $ 100 SNGs , in general I 'd say each type of player would have the following ROI range : Good player : 5 % + , maybe 4 % Decent player : 2 - 3 % , maybe 4 % Barely winning player : 1 % Now you need to use judgement in assessing ROIs .
For one , there 's good players who practice poor table selection .
They might have a 2 % ROI at $ 100s , but actually lower your ROI 4.5 % .
We 'll assess some stats / player types & I 'll tell you how I think they would effect my ROI in a $ 100 turbo : Player 1 : 10,000 games , $ 250 avg. stake , 3 % ROI .... Without knowing how they play I 'd probably assume he lowers my ROI 4.5 % ... although his ROI is only 3 % he has a higher avg .
stakePlayer 2 : 500 games , $ 100 avg.
stake , 6 % ROI , has numerous glaring leaks .... this player might even be a losing player , depending on how bad those leaks are , but you do n't want to give your opponents too little of credit .... despite the ROI , he has a small sample size & glaring leaks ... I 'd put him as a 2 % ROI dropperPlayer 3 : 15,000 games , $ 50 avg . stake , 5 % ROI ..... this player has a pretty decent sample size , but his downside is his average stake , his ROI in $ 100s is probably closer to 2 - 3 % , so I 'd assume he drops my ROI 2.8 % Player 4 : 10,000 games , $ 65 avg . stake , 8 % ROI .... he has a decent sample , his avg .
stake is lower again , but his ROI is high enough where I 'd probably assume he drops my ROI 4.5 % until he shows me otherwisePlater 5 : 20,000 games , $ 100 avg . stake , 6 % ROI , regular speed SNG regular , seems to have leaks in turbos .... despite this players ' high ROI at $ 100s , he plays primarily regular speeds , where you can usually get at least 1 to 2 percentage points higher in ROI , if not a lot more .... many of these players also usually have a large portion of their sample size being from when games are much softer , since regular speed SNGs do n't fill very well & they can't play that many per year .... because of all this I 'd assume he drops my ROI 2.8 % , rather than the 4.5 % that his stats suggestPlayer 6 : 25,000 games , $ 150 avg . stake , 2 % ROI , high stakes regular , seems to register for any game without looking at the lobby , has a solid understand of SNG strategy & you rarely seem him make a mistake .... this player does n't have the stats to make him a 4.5 % dropper , but he does have the game ... it's pretty likely that his poor table selection has significantly lowered his ROI ... if he read this blog entry maybe he'd boost that ROI up to the 4 - 6 % range ....
I 'd assume he drops my ROI 4.5 % Player 7 : 20,000 games $ 20 avg .
stake , 12 % ROI .... many people will make the mistake of underrating this player because of his avg .
stake ... do n't make that same mistake ... spacegravy & sizzlinbetta went from being low stakes players to 2 of the best SNG players around within a year ... his ROI is high enough to garner a lot of respect , despite the low avg .
stake .... I think 4.5 % might be a little too high since it usually takes low stakes players some time to adjust to the high stakes , however , I think 2.8 % might be a little too low ... somewhere in the middle like 3.6 might be most appopriatePlayer 8 : 10,000 games , $ 78 avg . stake , 32 % ROI ... however , through an advanced search you see that his 6 - 10 seated stats are 1,000 games , $ 100 avg . stake , 1 % ROI .... Despite his low 6 man stats it's also over a very small sample & it's pretty clear this player understands poker concepts pretty well & probably crushes MTT SNGs , many of the same concepts can be applied to single table SNGs ... I 'd give him the benefit of the doubt & assume he drops my ROi at least 2.8 % .
Ok you get the point , the next thing we need to realize is that some of these players are already in our games .
Therefore , if we have a 5 % ROI then a decent player does n't automatically make our ROI only 2.2 % .
What we need to do is find our base ROI , which is basically our ROI against only break - even & losing players .
One thing you need to realize is that in this day & age even the break - even & losing players are n't all that bad , at least at the high stakes .
One way of figuring this out is doing an advanced search ( for ex. a particular month ) & keeping a tally on how many of each particular player is in your game on average .
If you really want to go in depth you can do an advanced search on each month of last year , since the toughness of the games is different at particular times of the year .
However , that can be very time consuming .
If you do n't want to take that time you should find an average time like August or September .
This will ensure that the games are n't overly tough like the beginning & end of the year ( at least on pokerstars w/ many elite grinders ) or particularly easy like June & July when many top players are grinding WSOP events .
Personally , I just went through 50 games in August & figured that was close enough .
Nothing is going to be exact anyway .
Let 's say you tally your 50 games & you have 20 4.5 % droppers , 50 2.8 % droppers , & 30 2 % droppers .
You would take 0.4 ( 20/50 ) x 4.5 + 2.8 + 0.6 x 2 & get a total of 5.8 .
You would then add that to your ROI to get your base ROI .
Personally , I analyzed my Pokerstars games in which I had a 5 % ROI last year .
My base ROI came out to be 8.56 % .
If you practice reasonable table selection at $ 100 + & are too lazy to go through the calculations then you could just add 3.56 to your ROI to get your base ROI .
As I 've said , nothing is exact & it's all just an estimation anyway .
However , it 's going to be pretty damn close , & about as close as you can get .
Another thing you need to do is factor in sample size & what you 've learned about variance when using your " true ROI " to calculate your base ROI .
If you play $ 78 turbos , your true ROI is likely not higher than 8 % , no matter what your stats are .
If you play $ 100 - 200 turbos then your true ROI is likely not higher than 5 - 6 % , no matter what your stats say .
If you play $ 300 + turbos your true ROi is likely not higher than 4 % , no matter what your stats say .
If you did n't table select well in the past then those #s should be even lower .
If you play on a softer site then you MIGHT be able to get 1 to 2 % points higher .
The next thing you need to do is calculate the profitability of different games .
I prefer to make table selection charts , with the most profitable games at the top & the least profitable at the bottom .
Even with rakeback , I prefer to never play a game in which I have a negative ROI ( except on Cake because my rakeback is so high because of my deal ) .
This is because you can pretty much always find a game with similar profitability that will have much less variance .
When calculating the profitability of each game you also need to factor in how long each game takes .
To get the base profit per game you just take the ROI x the buy - in & then add rakeback .
Now you factor in how much time it takes .
In general , for 10 minute levels you should multiply this # by 1.2 .
For 5 minute blind levels , multiply it by about 1.5 .
For super turbos w 2 minute level , multiply it by around 3 .
You can't just assume that a game with half the blind level time will take half as long .
This is because these games usually go into higher blind levels than the ones w 5 - 10 minute levels .
You will probably be much better off using these #s than trying to figure something out on your own .
Now let 's look at some #s I estimate my rakeback on FTP to be about 33.5 % .
I get 28 % base rakeback + leaderboard bonuses .$ 236 turbo : 2 2.8 % droppers , 1 2 % dropper , 2 losing / break - even players ( 0.96 % ROI , 8.56 - 2.8 , - 2.8 , -2)0.0096 x 236 =$ 2.27 0.335 x $ 16 rake = $ 5.36 ( $ 5.36 +$ 2.27=$ 7.63 x 1.5 = $ 11.45 profitability ) $ 119 turbo : 1 4.5 % dropper , 4 losing players ( 4.06 % ROI ) 0.0406 x 119 = $ 4.83 0.335 x $ 9 rake = $ 3.02 ( $ 4.83 +$ 3.02 = $ 7.85 x 1.5 = $ 11.78 profitability ) As you can see , despite being almost half the buy - in , the $ 119 is actually more profitable .
This difference is not abnormal , & there 's many games w/ a lot bigger differences .
Let 's look at some more : $ 555 , 1 4.5 % dropper , 2 2.8 % droppers ( - 1.54 % ROI ) - 0.0154 x 555 = -$ 8.55 .335 x 30 = $ 10.05 ( $ 10.05 - $ 8.55 = $ 1.5 x 1.5 = $ 2.25 profitability ) $ 60 , 1 2.8 % dropper , 1 2 % dropper ( 3.76 % ROI ) 0.0376 x $ 60 = $ 2.26 0.335 x $ 5 = $ 1.68 ( $ 2.26 +$ 1.68=$3.94 x 1.5=$ 5.91 profitabilty ) Despite being over 9 x the buy - in , you would need to play more than 2 of the $ 555s just to match the profitability of the $ 60 !!!!!!
Hopefully this is very eye opening from some of you & will open up your mind .
These days more than ever , I see a lot of good players basically throwing money away by registering for high stakes games that just do n't have a shot of matching the profitability of lower stakes games .
I even see good players in games where they wo n't profit after rakeback long run .
That 's pretty stupid imo .
It 's time to put the ego aside & try to maximize your proftability .
Ignoring table selection is completely ignorant & hurts everybody , not just you .
These calculations should also show you just how bad people overrate supernova elite .
I see numerous players lose mounds of money at high stakes just to get supernova elite , when they would do much better for themself if they just table selected over numerous stakes , mixing in a lot of medium stakes games .
Not only is it a lot more profitable , but it also leads to much less swings , which in turn lead to less stress & just an overall better quality of life .
Ok , now that the instructional portion of this blof entry is over , let me give you a little update .
I went on a $ 45 K downswing .
Most of it was just bad variance , particularely at $ 500 + where I 'm down over $ 25 K this year ( over $ 11 K in just 22 $ 1Ks & $ 2Ks ) .
However , there were other factors .
One big factor was figuring out who is good on FTP .
There 's always a transition phase when starting on a new site .
You have to get good reads , not only to figure out how to play against those players in game , but to know which games to avoid when table selecting .
Because of this , & some new players on other sites , I was in a lot of games that were - EV or very low ROI games that I would not have played if I knew this .
The games right now are tougher than ever .
I suspect the economy has had some effect on this .
Numerous other top players started off the year on big downswings ( DDBeast , Kenny05 , Sparta45 , & BigJoe2003 just to name a few ) .
Some have since recovered , & others are still struggling .
When games are this tough you 're going to see shrinking hourly rates & increasing variance .
That 's just something you have to deal with .
I did some research on how much tougher the games are .
Last year I usually had about 50 % of my opponents be winning players .
So far this year it 's been more like 67 % winning players .
Not only that but the winning players in the games are much more comprised of the 4.5 % & 2.8 % droppers rather than the 2 % droppers .
Another thing that negatively effected me was I was getting cheated in high stakes games on Pokerstars .
I ended up getting a $ 7,200 collusion credit , which I listed under rakeback / bonuses .
Prior to the 16th of February I did all of the calculations I listed above .
I then made a new table selection chart , factoring in how tough the high stakes games have gotten .
I have since been mixing in a lot more medium stakes games , & been careful about registering too early & staying in when tough players enter , since too often some ignorant good player registers 5 th / 6th making the game not even worth playing .
I started using sharkscope hud on FTP & it 's been a huge help .
Since then I 've had better results ( sharkscope is missing $ 8 - 10 K profit during this time ) .
That said , I 'm not sure what kind of hourly rate is possible anymore .
Last year I averaged about $ 300 / hr .
When you factor in variance , my true hourly rate was probably somewhere between $ 225 & $ 375 for the year .
If I could sustain $ 300 / hr I 'd be pretty happy .
Maybe I can attain upwards toward $ 400 / hr , & maybe I can only attain in the lower $ 200s .
Only time will tell .
Either way , I 'll make a pretty good living .
The games could become easier .
Some of the elite grinders may get burnt out .
Maybe variance will take its toll on some the ignorant non table selecting mediocre high stakes players currently running like Gods & they 'll have to drop down .
Maybe they 'll be too ignorant to drop down & go busto .
On the other end , maybe people will continue to lose their jobs & the average casual gambler will be seen less frequent online .
Maybe players will continue to get better & better & the games will only get tougher .
Nobody knows .
What I do know is that you have to be a lot smarter about table selection to make good money at SNGs these days .
If I had waited til a month into the year to make my 09 goals I probably would have not made them so steep .
I suspected that the games would get tougher after many of good high stakes grinders returned from the PCA , but I could not have predicted that the effect would be this bad .
Time will tell if my goals are attainable .
I usually end up adjusting goals throughout the year anyway .
No SNGs are not dead , you just need to use your brain & put your ego aside .
Since the 16th I started a new tab in my excel spreadsheet .
This is because my selection of games is completely different & I 'd like my hourly rate to reflect the games I 'm currently playing , rather than the games I was playing .
My latest stint into the $ 1 K + was also pretty short lived .
Every time I start playing them again I remember why I quit them to begin with .
If you ever run normal in them they can be very profitable , but I just do n't think they 're worth the variance .
This is especially true since my bankroll is dispursed over 4 sites .
Even if I keep 100 times my average buy - in on each site I can still go bust on any given site w/ 1 bad run in $ 1 K + .
That 's pretty absurd .
Sure I could keep more on each site , but I think my money is much better off being invested than sitting in some offshore poker account just so I can play 3 $ 1 K +
a day & bubble every one to a 2 outer while trying to stay sane .
I 'm 90 % sure that HappyLucky on Cake is River Prayer / LuckBoxFromHell .
They usually sign in at the same time , they play similar , they 're both from San Fran , & neither chats .
Either way , he 's starting off 09 on 1 hell of a heater .
Recently 1 of the good players on FTP ( Good Night Baby ) asked me why I think top Pokerstars players are struggling on FTP .
He pointed out myself , Kenny , & sizzlinbetta , Little Kraut .
It was a pretty absurd question imo .
The numer one reason is variance .
None of us have big samples .
The 2nd biggest reason is probably what I talked about above .
When you move to a new site there 's an adjustment period in getting reads to play optimally & table select optimally .
Third , overall we are n't even struggling .
Kenny is crushing .
DDBeast is doing pretty good .
I 'm break - even .
Little Kraut played a lot of tough games , many of which were probably - EV & lsot the majority of his money at the highest stakes .
I 'm not sure how sizzlinbetta is doing but you get the point .
Also , FTP is a lot tougher than it used to be .
All of our samples are comprised of the new tougher FTP games , whereas old FTP regs have much of their sample comprised of the softer games , making their ROI look much better then what they could actually sustain in the current state of FTP SNGs .

A 20 - year - old Santa Maria man has been arrested on suspicion of an apparently random ax attack that decapitated a man out for his morning walk .
" We 're not sure what motivated this young man , " said Santa Maria police Lt. Dan Ast , who added that the ax had been stolen during a recent home burglary .
Nicholas Bendle was being held in Santa Barbara County Jail on Monday as police investigated the death of 69 - year - old Frederick Holgate .
The victim , who walked with a cane , was " attacked without warning " early Saturday and did not know his assailant , the police spokesman said .
The ax was found several feet from his body .
Bendle was arrested at his home after his mother called police to say he had just returned , covered in blood , after she had reported him missing .

また、10月の越後湯沢での講演で次のスライドを示した。
そして、今年の4月末のこと。「iPhoneにまで進出してくる」との危惧が、現実になっていた。
ニコニコ動画のiPhone OS 用アプリが登場したというので、さっそく入手し、アカウント設定の画面に進もうとしたところ、次の画面が現れた。
「 端末情報を取得します。よろしいですか？」という。iPod touchなのに？

とのことだった。そこで、続けて、 「私は iPod touch 使用しています。iPod touch は携帯電話ではありませんが 、 「 端末製造番号」なるものが、iPod touch にもあるのでしょうか？」と質問したところ、迅速に回答があり、
はい、iPod touchにも端末製造番号が存在しており、ログインアカウントに紐付ける形でユーザーを識別しております。
とのことだった。この間に自力で調べた（自分の無線LAN経由での通信内容を傍受して調べた）ところ、送信しているのは、iPhone OSに搭載されてい る「 UDID 」という文字列だとわかった。そこで、「これを送信することは、貴社のプライバシーポリシーに違反しているのではないでしょうか？」と尋ねたところ、すぐに回答があり、
端末製造番号については、その端末を識別する為の番号ですので、仮にお客様がその端末を第三者に譲渡した場合なども、端末製造番号を以って持主を特定することはできないものと存じております。
従いまして、現状のご利用方法が弊社のプライバシーポリシーに反したものであるという認識はございません。
という。ならばなぜ 「端末情報を取得します。よろしいですか？」とわざわざ確認するのだろうか。問題があると認識しているからこそ確認を出しているはずなのに、問題はないのだという。携帯電話がそういう流儀になっているので、なんとなく真似て出しているだけなのだろうか。
まあ、その件はいい。それよりも、携帯電話でもないのに「UDID」を使っているということは、セキュリティ上の脆弱性があると推定される。なぜなら、無線LAN経由でも使うのだから、携帯電話のように「IPアドレス帯域」でアクセス元を限定して対処することは不可能だからだ。
自分の通信内容を無 線LAN電波を傍受して調べたところ、図3のように、一部でHTTPSが使われていたが、その他はHTTPで通信していた。ニコニコ動画のiPhone
OSアプリは、図1の図のように、ニコニコ動画のユーザIDとパスワードを登録して使うようになっているので、このパスワード送信の際にHTTPSが使われているのだろう。
最初のHTTPの通信内容は図4のようになっていた。
「 udid= 」と「 ticket=」という2つのパラメタが渡されている。ticketの値は、ニコニコ動画の会員番号とランダムっぽい値の連結になっており、後者は、おそらく、HTTPSでパスワードを送信して認証成功した際に返されてきた、認証が成功したことを伝える一時的な値であろう。それと共に「UDID」が送信されている。
このHTTPリクエストで、サーバ側でこの「UDID」がニコニコ動画のアカウントと結びつけられるものと考えられる。このときのHTTPレスポンスには、メールアドレスやニックネーム、ニコニコ動画の会員番号等が含まれていて、これらはプライバシー情報にあたるが、このレスポンスはticketがないと得られないものになっているだろう。
しかし、 「マイリスト」機能にアクセスしたときは、図5の通信内容となった。
このHTTPリクエストでは、「 UDID 」だけを送っている。つまり、UDIDだけでログイン状態を維持していることが推定される。HTTPレスポンスには、私の非公開設定の「マイリスト」の内容が含まれている。
これはまずい。では 、 「 UDID 」というのは、どのくらい他人に知られ得る値なのだろうか。
日本のケータ イWebの場合、契約者固有IDはすべてのWebサイトに送信されるので、誰でも知り得る値であるが、iPhone OSの場合はそうではない。Safariがそのような値を送信するようになっているはずもない。
「 UDID 」 がどのようなものか調べてみたところ、iPhone
OSアプリ開発者らの間で広く使われているものだった。「UDID」は通常は目にすることがないが、iTunesの図6の画面で、シリアルナンバーの部分をクリックすると「UDID」が表示されるようになっている。
これがどんな目的で使用されているかというと、ひとつには、開発中のアプリのベータテスト用で、AppleのApp
Storeに登録される前の開発中のアプリを、ベータテスト目的で誰かに試用させる際に、試用者に「UDID」を提出させて、特定の「UDID」の機器だけで動作するように限定してベータ版を提供するということが行われているようだ。

つまり 、 「 UDID 」は他人に知られる場合があることを想定したものである。したがって、「UDID」の送信だけで「マイリスト」を閲覧できてしまうのは、他人にも閲覧できるということであり、「マイリスト」には非公開設定もあるので、これは、ニコニコ動画の脆弱性（Webサイト側のセッション管理上の脆弱性）である。
ただし、上の図4のように、アプリを起動する毎にパスワードによる認証があるので、一定期間だけ「UDID」だけでアクセス可能にするという制御が行われている可能性はある。そこで、翌日まで放置（ニコニコ動画アプリを使わないで）した後に、telnetで直接（自分の）「UDID」を指定してアクセスしてみたところ、「マイリスト」を取得できることが確認できた（図7）。
以上のようにして、実際的な問題のある脆弱性であることがわかったので、「ニコニコ動画お客様サポート」に対し、以下のように脆弱性の報告をした。
株式会社ニワンゴ 情報セキュリティ対応係 御中 ニコニコ動画のiPhone OS 向けサービスのセキュリティ脆弱性について iPhone OS 向け の 「ニコニコ動画」アプリを利用しておりましたところ、その実装手段に技術的な誤りがあり、他人に非公開マイリストを閲覧されてしまうなどの被害の生じ得る、セキュリティ脆弱性があることに気付きましたので、以下の通りお知らせします。
1 . ニコニコ動画アプリの挙動 iPhone OS 向けの 「 ニコニコ動画」アプリを、無線LAN経由のインターネット接続で使用し、その際の通信内容を自分で傍受して調べたところ、iPhone
OS の「 UDID 」が送信されていることに気付きました。
「 ニコニコ動画」アプリの「アカウント設定」でメールアドレスとパスワードを設定した状態で、たとえば、「マイリスト」のひとつを閲覧しようとすると、i.nicovideo.jp:80 に対し、以下のHTTPリクエストが送信されるようです。
GET /v1/mylistgroup.get?udid=88d0e4XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX&detail=1 HTTP/1.1 User - Agent : iPod touch Accept : */* Accept - Language : ja-jp Accept - Encoding : gzip , deflate Connection : keep - alive Host : i.nicovideo.jp ここで、「udid=」の右の40字の文字列は、私のiPod touchのUDIDです。このHTTPリクエストは、任意のIPアドレスから送信しても受け入れられるようで、携帯電話会社のゲートウェイ等にアクセス元を限定しているわけではないようです。そのため、iPhoneまたはiPod touchを用いずに、通常のパソコン等から上記のHTTPリクエストを送信した場合にも、レスポンスは通常通りに得られ、XML形式で記述された私のマイリストの内容が返信されてくることを確認しました。
2 . セキュリティ上の問題点 上記の挙動から、HTTPリクエスト上のいずれのパラメータにも秘密情報が含まれておらず、UDIDだけでユーザ固有の情報にアクセスできることがわかります。このことから、誰かのiPhoneまたはiPod touchのUDIDを知ることができれば、誰でもその人に成り済ましてアクセスできるはずであると推察されます。
iPhone OSにおいてUDIDは秘密情報ではありません。UDIDは、たとえば、iPhone OS用アプリの開発者が、ベータテストのためにテスターを募集する際に、テスターに提出を求める情報として使われており、開発者は他人のUDIDを知る立場にあります。また、他のWebサイトがUDIDを使うようになると、あちこちのWebサイトが人々のUDIDを保有することになります。UDIDは、ユーザIDの代替になることはあっても、パスワードの代替になるものではありません。
Apple Inc. の、 Developer Connection の文書「 iPhone Reference Library」にも、UDIDについて次のように記載されており、ユーザ認証の目的で使用できないものであることが暗に示唆されています。

Discussion
A unique device identifier is a hash value composed from various hardware identifiers such as the device ’s serial number .
It is guaranteed to be unique for every device but cannot publically be tied to a user account .
You can use it , for example , to store high scores for a game in a central server or to control access to registered products .
The unique device identifier is sometimes referred to by its abbreviation UDID .
3 . 生じ得る被害 私が調べた範囲では、非公開のマイリストが他人に閲覧される点を確認しました。他にも、他人に成り済ましてコメントを書き込まれる可能性、非会員に動画を閲覧される可能性、プレミアム会員に成り済まして利用される危険性などが考えられますが、確認はしていません。
4 . 正しい実装方法 現在 の 「 ニコニコ動画」アプリは、「アカウント設定」でメールアドレスとパスワードを設定して使うように設計されており、アプリを起動した際にメールアドレスとパスワードを送信して、アカウントの有効性確認の認証処理を行うよう作られているようですから、本来、UDIDを使う必然性は全くないはずです。
正しい実装方法は、ログイン毎に異なるセッションIDを用いることです。メールアドレスとパスワードでログイン認証した時点で、サーバ側でセッションID（暗号用乱数を用いた十分な長さの予測困難な文字列）を生成して「ニコニコ動画」アプリに渡し、アプリ側はそれをメモリ上に記憶して、アクセス毎にHTTPリクエストに載せて送信するようにすれば、サーバ側で、そのセッションIDを用いたセッション管理を実装できるはずです。
アプリとサーバ間のセッショ ンIDの受け渡しには、HTTPレスポンスのSet-Cookie:ヘッダと、HTTPリクエストのCookie:ヘッダを用いることもできるでしょうから、そうすることで、PHPの既存のセッション管理機構をそのまま使うこともできるのではないかと思います。
5 . プライバシーの保護 UDID はプライバシーに関わる情報であるとも言えます。もし、多くのWebサイトがUDIDを用いるようになれば、UDIDによって、誰が利用しているのかが他のWebサイト運営者にわかってしまう事態が生じます。 ニコニコ動画のiPhone OS 向けサービスが上記の通り正しい実装に修正され、ニコニコ動画の運営上UDIDが不必要なものとなれば、これまでに収集されたUDID情報は廃棄されることが望ましいと思います。 以上
そして 、7月13 日に「 ニコニコ動画 for iPhone Ver 1.05 」がリリースされ、7月31日をもって旧バージョンの使用が停止となり、この脆弱性は解消された。図8のように、旧バージョンでは動作しないことが告知されている。
修正された現在では 、「 UDID 」は送信されなくなり、図4のところでセッションIDが発行されるようになり（図9の「<session_id>」）、図5のところではそのセッションIDが送信されるようになった（図10の「sid=」）。
また、図7と同じことをしても図11のようにエラーとなり（何やらエラーメッセージが見えているが）、脆弱性は解消された。
というわけで、この事例のように、日本のケータイWeb開発者が、普通のWebアプリケーションの構築技法からかけ離れて、蛸壺化していることがうかがえる。
類似の話として、徳丸浩氏の7月14日の日記では、ケータイWeb開発は入門書籍からして蛸壺化しつつあり、その弊害としてCSRF対策もままならなくなっていることが指摘されている。
日本の携帯電話事業者の一部は、 「フルブラウザ」にさえ契約者固有ID送信機能を持たせて、蛸壺の維持を謀ろうとしているが、iPhoneのような国際的デファクト標準には通用しないのであって、今後も、他のスマートフォンの普及とともに、蛸壺的手法は通用しなくなっていくであろう。
そのときに、蛸壺の中の開発者らが、このニコニコ動画の事例と同様のミスをする可能性が高い。「IPアドレス帯域」による制限が通用しない機器では、アプリケーションの内容によっては特に危険な脆弱性となるので、関係者はこのことに注意が必要である。
なお、1年前に軽く触れたNAVITIMEのiPhone
OS 用アプリの件はどういうものだったかというと、NAVITIMEでは「会員登録」時に、図12のように、
「
http://www.navitime.jp/smartphone/EntryFacade_uid_XXXXXX……」というURLで、何やら固有IDを送信するようになっていた。おそらく、「UDID」を暗号化した（あるいは一方向性関数に通した）もの だったのだろう。
NAVITIME では、ニコニコ動画と違って、ユーザ名とパスワードの登録機能を持っていなかった。そのため、最初に「会員登録」をするときに、固有IDをSafari経由で送信して、そこで決済用のクレジットカード番号の入力をさせることで、この固有IDに直接クレジットカード番号を紐付ける構成になっていたと思われる。そして、NAVITIMEアプリが有料サービスを実行するときは、この固有IDだけで認証状態を維持していたものと推察する。
このような構造の場合、脆弱性を指摘されてもすぐには直せない。なぜなら、新たにユーザ名とパスワードの機能を用意して、既存のユーザに再登録を促さない限りどうともならないからだ。
NAVITIMEは元々、日本のケータイWebが発祥なので、ケータイ同様に作ればユーザIDとパスワードがなくても認証できると勘違いしてしまったのだろう。蛸壺方式をそのままiPhoneに適用しようとして破綻したのではないか。
このことからも、ケータ イWebで蛸壺化することのリスクが大きいとわかる。はじめから普通のインターネットでも使うことを想定してサービスを設計しないと、こういう事態になる。
2007 年の「モバイルビジネス研究会」が、「ユーザーIDの利活用の推進」としてユーザIDの統一化を謀っていたこと（「日本のインターネットが終了する日」参照）は、このような意味でも日本を駄目にする方向性だったと言える。幸い、2008年の「通信プラットフォーム研究会」では、関係者のご尽力により、この種の問題を指摘する声があがり、SAMLやOpenID（おそらくはOAuthも）を使用することが検討される方向性になった（「通信プラットフォーム研究会 傍聴録」参照）。
ニコニコ動画の事例が解決できたように、「ケータイの契約者固有IDがないと便利なサービスを実現できない」などということはないのであって、特に、Webブラウザではなく個別のアプリでサービスするときには、ニコニコ動画のようにユーザIDとパスワードを設定しておく構造にすればよいわけであるし、初回利用時にユーザIDとパスワードを作成することがケータイユーザにとって煩わしいのが問題であるのなら、SAMLないしOpenIDを活用すればよい と考えられるし、Webブラウザの場合であっても同様のはずだ。
Precej dobra in podrobna primerjava brskalnikov glede na podporo posamezni tehnologiji .
IE6 je po vseh pričakovanjih porazno obupen , me pa preseneča , da za IE7 velja enako !

HA -LO !!!
Po vseh teh letih povzročanja sivih las so se odločili narediti nov brskalnik , ki ne bo znal nič več kot prejšnji ?
Ampak ampak !

Kako so lahko spregledali 5 leta napredka na tem področju ?!
Možnosti sta lahko samo dve , da pri Microsoftu zaposlujejo debile , ali pa se jim ne splača v zadevo vlagat nobenega časa .
Ker vem , da prvo ne velja , se lahko samo čudim , kako je lahko nekdo tako nepošten do ljudi , od katerih živi .
Njegov odnos do strank lahko spremenijo samo konkurenca in stranke .
Konkurenca na tem področju deluje 1 - A izvrstno , na vrsti so uporabniki .
Na vrsti ste vi .
Ne samo , da uporabljate druge brskalnike , ampak tudi , da nalezete s tem še druge .
Po eni strani smo Slovenci carji , z 39 % uporabnikov Firefoxa smo celo prvi v Evropi .
Po drugi strani pa to pomeni , da še vedno levji delež uporabnikov slepo in zabito uporablja IE .
