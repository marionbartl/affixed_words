God the Father ; God the son ; God the Holy Spirit :
These three in One.
Very God of Very God being of one substance ( Homoousios ) , begotten not made , True God from True God .
This very same True God was born by the creature
He created ( Theotokos : God Bearer or when the Creator created the creature who , in turn , created the Creator in sinful flesh yet without sin ) :
Mary who herself was impregnated by her own Father God so He could be born into the very fallen world of sin the Creator so detested and cursed the created creatures with .
In so doing , He became flesh and dwelt among us , but to correct the very Fallen State the Creator cursed the creatures with , the Creator had Himself killed so He as Very God of Very God could shed His own sinless blood for Himself ( Creator - Creature atoning to Creator ) in order that He could finally accept the world the Creator created in His perfect mind which the Creator had fully planed with fore - knowledge before the foundations of the earth ( Gospel of John Chapter 1 ) .
The Creator is now seated at the right hand of Himself while making inter-secession to Himself for the fallen creatures of which he had foreknowledge ( Supralapsarianism ) of before
He created the foundations of the cosmos .
He , Himself , will now come again to receive this , His fallen creation , unto Himself by re-creating a New Heaven and a New Earth in which the redeemed fallen creatures will also rule with the Creator in a New Jerusalem filled with the very items ( Gold and Emeralds : Revelation 21 ) which produce the greed and lust of the fallen state of the creature the Creator condemned in the old eternal Covernant now replaced with the new eternal Covernant .
Now dear Christian , just which part of your salvation do you not understand ?
( Remember , your very soul hangs in the balance between orthodoxy and heresy or between eternal damnation and eternal salvation . )
May God have mercy on your mental state !
In the words of that famous Christian hymn : Only Believe .
Only Believe .
Only Believe !
For the most part , I do n’t live or die on the number of readers of this blog .
I ’m not making money off this , so extra readers do n’t have a direct effect .
Of course , I am gratified that people want to read this : since one of my goals is to make operations research more famous , it helps if there is a readership !
And I greatly enjoy it when people comment on my posts ( something that is happening much more often ) : that ca n’t happen without a readership .
Determining the readership of a blog is kinda tricky .
Some people wander by through the web , or have the page bookmarked , or search on a term that occurs in a blog post , or otherwise access the blog as a web page .
Somewhere around 150 or so people a day see the blog that way .
Of course a number of people are searching for “ sex market ” or some such , and hit a post from my past entries that includes those words .
In fact , now that I have included that phrase here , they may end up on this page .
If so , then welcome : this probably is n’t what you were looking for , but there are some fascinating posts , so browse around for a while !
Another group subscribes to the blog through RSS readers , like google reader .
They may not hit my website directly at all , but read the postings through their reader .
Feedburner tells me I have about 700 subscribers that way .
This number is an estimate , but presumably all of these subscribers are actually interested in operations research .
This is the way I access blogs : I subscribe to all of the operations research blogs listed in the right hand column of my front page , and I subscribe to an additional twenty - five blogs that are not operations research but have caught my interest .
I also subscribe to about dozen blogs on operations research that appear to be inactive : if a post comes through on one of those , then I can move it over to the active list .
Putting things all together , I put my readership at about 1000 people truly interested in operations research , which is a gratifying number .
I certainly have not given a technical talk in front of 1000 people ( the recent EURO conference was perhaps the largest , but it was not 1000 people ) .
Once in a while I get a spike , due to an entry on other sites .
I have never had a successful entry on Digg or Slashdot , which is probably just as well , since my poor server probably could n’t stand the strain .
But my recent posting on “ P=NP ( or not ) ” did get some play on Reddit ( thanks cavedave for the shoutout ) , which resulted in a spike in usage ( up by a factor of five or so ) .
It was great to see the spike , but it will be even better if this results in more permanent subscribers and more interest in operations research .
BIS Global Big Brother , Trading Financial Stability for National Sovereignty ?
Ellen Brown writes : Buried on page 83 of the 89 - page Report on Financial Regulatory Reform issued by the U.S. Administration on June 17 is a recommendation that the new Financial Stability Board strengthen and institutionalize its mandate to promote global financial stability .
Financial stability is a worthy goal , but the devil is in the details .
The new global Big Brother is based in the Bank for International Settlements , a controversial institution that raises red flags among the wary . . . .
“ Big Brother ” is the term used by George Orwell in his classic novel 1984 for the totalitarian state that would lock into place in the year of his title .
Why he chose that particular year is unclear , but one theory is that he was echoing Jack London ’s The Iron Heel , which chronicled the rise of an oligarchic tyranny in the United States .
In London ’s book , the oligarchy ’s fictional wonder - city , fueled by oppressed workers , was to be completed by 1984 .
Orwell also echoed London ’s imagery when he described the future under Big Brother as “ a boot stamping on a human face – forever . ”
In Secret Records Revealed : The Men , the Money , and the Methods Behind the New World Order ( 1999 ) , Dr. Dennis Cuddy asked :
“ Could the ‘ boot ’ be the new eighteen - story Bank for International Settlements ( BIS ) which was completed in Basel , Switzerland , in 1977 in the shape of a boot , and became known as the ‘Tower of Basel’ ? "
The boot - like shape of the building is strange enough to be thought - provoking ( see photo ) , but more disturbing is the description by Dr. Carroll Quigley of the pivotal role assigned to the BIS in consolidating financial power into a few private hands .
Professor Quigley , who was Bill Clinton ’s mentor at Georgetown University , claimed to be an insider and evidently knew his subject .
He wrote in Tragedy and Hope ( 1966 ) :
“ [ T ] he powers of financial capitalism had another far - reaching aim , nothing less than to create a world system of financial control in private hands able to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole .
This system was to be controlled in a feudalist fashion by the central banks of the world acting in concert , by secret agreements arrived at in frequent private meetings and conferences .
The apex of the system was to be the Bank for International Settlements in Basel , Switzerland , a private bank owned and controlled by the world ’s central banks which were themselves private corporations . ”
That helps explain the alarm bells that went off among BIS - watchers when the Bank was linked to the new Financial Stability Board ( FSB ) President Obama signed onto in April .
When the G20 leaders met in London on April 2 , 2009 , they agreed to expand the powers of the old Financial Stability Forum ( FSF ) into this new Board .
The FSF was set up in 1999 to serve in a merely advisory capacity by the G7 ( a group of finance ministers formed from the seven major industrialized nations ) .
The chair of the FSF was the General Manager of the BIS .
The new FSB has been expanded to include all G20 members ( 19 nations plus the EU ) .
The G20 , formally called the “ Group of Twenty Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors , ” was , like the G7 , originally set up as a forum merely for cooperation and consultation on matters pertaining to the international financial system .
But its new Financial Stability Board has real teeth , imposing “ obligations ” and “ commitments ” on its members .
The Shadowy Financial Stability Board
The Report on Financial Regulatory Reform issued by the Obama Administration on June 17 includes a recommendation that the FSB “ strengthen ” and “ institutionalize ” its mandate .
What is the FSB ’s mandate , what are its expanded powers , and who is in charge ?
An article in The London Guardian addresses those issues in question and answer format :
“ Who runs the regulator ?
The Financial Stability Forum is chaired by Mario Draghi , governor of the Bank of Italy .
The secretariat is based at the Bank for International Settlements ’ headquarters in Basel , Switzerland . ”
Draghi was director general of the Italian treasury from 1991 to 2001 , where he was responsible for widespread privatization ( sell - off of government holdings to private investors ) .
From January 2002 to January 2006 , however , he was a partner at Goldman Sachs on Wall Street , another controversial player .
As already noted , “ basing ” the FSB at the BIS is not a comforting sign , considering the dark and controversial history of the BIS .
Dr. Cuddy , writing in 1999 , quoted media sources describing the BIS and its behind - the - scenes leaders as “ this economic cabal . . . this secretive group . . . the financial barons who control the world ’s supply of money ” ( Washington Post , June 28 , 1998 ) ; “ some of the world ’s most powerful and least visible men . . . officials able to shift billions of dollars and alter the course of economies at the stroke of a pen ” ( New York Times , August 5 , 1995 ) ; men who can “ move huge amounts of money into and out of markets in a nanosecond ” and “ topple politicians with the click of a mouse ” ( ABC ’s “ Nightline , ” July 1 , 1998 ) .
“ What will the new regulator do ?
The regulator will monitor potential risks to the economy . . .
It will cooperate with the IMF , the Washington - based body that monitors countries ’ financial health , lending funds if needed .
. . . ”
The IMF is an international banking organization that is also controversial .
Joseph Stiglitz , former chief economist for the World Bank , charges it with ensnaring Third World countries in a debt trap from which they cannot escape .
Debtors unable to pay are bound by “ conditionalities ” that include a forced sell - off of national assets to private investors in order to service their loans .
“ What will the regulator oversee ?
All ‘ systemically important ’ financial institutions , instruments and markets . ”
The term “ systemically important ” is not defined .
Will it include such systemically important institutions as national treasuries , and such systemically important markets as gold , oil and food ?
“ How will it work ?
The body will establish a supervisory college to monitor each of the largest international financial services firms .
. . .
It will act as a clearing house for information - sharing and contingency planning for the benefit of its members . ”
In some contexts , information - sharing is called illegal collusion .
Would the information - sharing here include such things as secret agreements among central banks to buy or sell particular currencies , with the concomitant power to support or collapse targeted local economies ?
Consider the short - selling of the Mexican peso by collusive action in 1995 , the short - selling of Southeast Asian currencies in 1998 , and the collusion among central banks to support the U.S. dollar in July of last year – good for the dollar and the big players with inside information perhaps , but not so good for the small investors who reasonably bet on “ market forces , ” bought gold or foreign currencies , and lost their shirts .
“ What will the new regulator do about debt and loans ?
To prevent another debt bubble , the new body will recommend financial companies maintain provisions against credit losses and may impose constraints on borrowing . ”
What sort of constraints ?
The Basel Accords imposed by the BIS have not generally worked out well .
The first Basel Accord , issued in 1998 , was blamed for inducing a depression in Japan from which that country has yet to recover ; and the Second Basel Accord and its associated mark - to - market rule have been blamed for bringing on the current credit crisis , from which the U.S. and the world have yet to recover .
These charges have been explored at length elsewhere .
The suspicious might see these failures as intentional .
The warnings come to mind of Congressman Louis MacFadden , head of the House Banking and Currency Committee during the Great Depression : “ It was a carefully contrived occurrence .
International bankers sought to bring about a condition of despair , so that they might emerge the rulers of us all . ”
David Rockefeller , a key player in international finance , echoed this thinking in 1994 , when he said at a UN dinner , “ We are on the verge of a global transformation .
All we need is the right major crisis and the nations will accept the New World Order . ”
The Amorphous 12 International Standards and Codes
Most troubling , perhaps , is this vague parenthetical reference in a press release issued by the BIS , titled “ Financial Stability Forum Re-established as the Financial Stability Board ” :
“ As obligations of membership , member countries and territories commit to . . . implement international financial standards ( including the 12 key International Standards and Codes ) . . . . ”
This is not just friendly advice from an advisory board .
It is a commitment to comply , so you would expect some detailed discussion concerning what those standards entail .
However , a search of the major media reveals virtually nothing .
The 12 key International Standards and Codes are left undefined and undiscussed .
The FSB website lists them , but it is vague .
The Standards and Codes cover broad areas that are apparently subject to modification as the overseeing committees see fit .
They include :
Money and financial policy transparency
Fiscal policy transparency
Data dissemination
Insolvency
Corporate governance
Accounting
Auditing
Payment and settlement
Market integrity
Banking supervision
Securities regulation
Insurance supervision
Take “ fiscal policy transparency ” as an example .
The “ Code of Good Practices on Fiscal Transparency ” was adopted by the IMF Interim Committee in 1998 .
The “ synoptic description ” says :
“ The code contains transparency requirements to provide assurances to the public and to capital markets that a sufficiently complete picture of the structure and finances of government is available so as to allow the soundness of fiscal policy to be reliably assessed . ”
We learn that members are required to provide a “ picture of the structure and finances of government ” that is complete enough for an assessment of its “ soundness ” -- but an assessment by whom , and what if a government fails the test ?
Is an unelected private committee based in the BIS allowed to evaluate the “ structure and function ” of particular national governments and , if they are determined to have fiscal policies that are not “ sound , ” to impose “ conditionalities ” and “ austerity measures ” of the sort that the IMF is notorious for imposing on Third World countries ?
The wary might wonder if that is how the mighty United States is to be brought under the heel of Big Brother at last .
For three centuries , private international banking interests have brought governments in line by blocking them from issuing their own currencies and requiring them to borrow banker - issued “ banknotes ” instead .
“ Allow me to issue and control a nation ’s currency , ” Mayer Amschel Bauer Rothschild famously said in 1791 , “ and I care not who makes its laws . ”
The real rebellion of the American colonists in 1776 , according to Benjamin Franklin , was against a foreign master who forbade the colonists from issuing their own money and required that taxes be paid in gold .
The colonists , not having gold , had to borrow gold - backed banknotes from the British bankers .
The catch was that the notes were created on the “ fractional reserve ” system , allowing the bankers to issue up to ten times as many notes as they actually had gold , essentially creating them out of thin air just as the colonists were doing .
The result was not only to lock the colonists into debt to foreign bankers but to propel the nation into a crippling depression .
The colonists finally rebelled and reverted to issuing their own currency .
Funding a revolution against a major world power with money they printed themselves , they succeeded in defeating their oppressors and winning their independence .
Political colonialism is now a thing of the past , but under the new FSB guidelines , nations can still be held in feudalistic subservience to foreign masters .
Consider this scenario : XYZ country , which has been getting along very well financially , discloses that its national currency is being printed by the government directly .
The FSB determines that this practice represents an impermissible “ merging of the public and private sectors ” and is an unsound banking practice forbidden under the “ 12 Key International Standards and Codes . ”
Banker - created national currency is declared to be the standard “ good practice ” all governments must follow .
XYZ is compelled to abandon the “ anachronistic ” notion that creating its own national currency is a proper “ function of government . ”
It must now borrow from the international bankers , trapping it in the bankers ’ compound - interest debt web .
Consider another scenario : Like in the American colonies , the new FSB rules precipitate a global depression the likes of which have never before been seen .
XYZ country wakes up to the fact that all of this is unnecessary – that it could be creating its own money , freeing itself from the debt trap , rather than borrowing from bankers who create money on computer screens and charge interest for the privilege of borrowing it .
But this realization comes too late : the boot descends and XYZ is crushed into line .
National sovereignty has been abdicated to a private committee , with no say by the voters .
Was Orwell Just 25 Years Too Early ?
Suspicious observers might say that this is how you pull off a private global dictatorship : ( 1 ) create a global crisis ; ( 2 ) appoint an “ advisory body ” to retain and maintain “ stability ” ; and then ( 3 ) “ formalize ” the advisory body as global regulator .
By the time the people wake up to what has happened , it ’s too late .
Marilyn Barnewall , who was dubbed by Forbes Magazine the “ dean of American private banking , ” writes in an April 2009 article titled “ What Happened to American Sovereignty at G - 20 ? ” :
“ It seems the world ’s bankers have executed a bloodless coup and now represent all of the people in the world .
. . .
President Obama agreed at the G20 meeting in London to create an international board with authority to intervene in U.S. corporations by dictating executive compensation and approving or disapproving business management decisions .
Under the new Financial Stability Board , the United States has only one vote .
In other words , the group will be largely controlled by European central bankers .
My guess is , they will represent themselves , not you and not me and certainly not America . ”
A bloodless coup . . .
Again one is reminded of the admissions of David Rockefeller , who wrote in his Memoirs ( Random House 2002 ) :
“ Some even believe we are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States , characterizing my family and me as ‘ internationalists ’ and of conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure – one world , if you will .
If that ’s the charge , I stand guilty , and I am proud of it . ”
The Commitments Mandated by the Financial Stability Board
Constitute a Commercial Treaty Requiring a 2/3 Vote of the Senate .
Adoption of the FSB was never voted on by the public , either individually or through their legislators .
The G20 Summit has been called “ a New Bretton Woods , ” referring to agreements entered into in 1944 establishing new rules for international trade .
But Bretton Woods was put in place by Congressional Executive Agreement , requiring a majority vote of the legislature ; and it more properly should have been done by treaty , requiring a two - thirds vote of the Senate , since it was an international agreement binding on the nation .
The same should be mandated before imposing the will of the BIS - based Financial Stability Board on the U.S. , its banks and its businesses .
Here is a quick review of the law :
Article II , Section 2 of the United States Constitution grants power to the President to make treaties only with the “ advice and consent ” of two - thirds of the Senate .
The Constitution does not expressly provide for any alternative to the Article II treaty procedure .
However , historically the President has also made international “ agreements ” through congressional - executive agreements that are ratified with only a majority from both houses of Congress , or sole - executive agreements made by the President alone .
A congressional - executive agreement can cover only those matters which the Constitution explicitly places within the powers of Congress and the President ; while a sole - executive agreement can cover only those matters within the President ’s authority or matters in which Congress has delegated authority to the President .
A sole - executive agreement can be negotiated and entered into only through the President ’s authority ( 1 ) in foreign policy , ( 2 ) as commander - in - chief of the armed forces , ( 3 ) from a prior act of Congress , or ( 4 ) from a prior treaty .
Agreements beyond these competencies must have the approval of Congress ( for congressional - executive agreements ) or the Senate ( for treaties ) .
If an international commercial accord contains binding “ treaty ” commitments , then a two - thirds vote of the Senate may be required .
Even with a two - thirds Senate vote , before Congress gives its approval it should draft legislation ensuring that the checks and balances imposed by our Constitution are built into the agreement .
This could be done by implementing a legislative counterpart to the FSB with full oversight and corrective powers .
The legislatures of the member nations could be required to elect a representative body to provide oversight and take corrective measures as needed , with that body ’s representatives answerable to their national electorates .
Orwell ’s 1984 made the news again in April 2009 , when Queen Elizabeth chose the book as her ceremonial gift for visiting President Felipe Calderon of Mexico .
Calderon , who crushed riots with boot - like severity after he was accused of vote - rigging to steal the election from his populist opponent , was said to be an admirer of Orwell ’s work .
The event provoked suspicions that 1984 had been covertly chosen by a modern - day financial oligarchy as the inspirational model for implementing Big Brother globally .
The book ends with the protagonist Winston tortured and brainwashed into accepting the party line .
We need to act quickly and decisively to ensure that its historical counterpart has a happier ending .
Ellen Brown developed her research skills as an attorney practicing civil litigation in Los Angeles .
In Web of Debt , her latest book , she turns those skills to an analysis of the Federal Reserve and “ the money trust . ”
She shows how this private cartel has usurped the power to create money from the people themselves , and how we the people can get it back .
Her earlier books focused on the pharmaceutical cartel that gets its power from “ the money trust . ”

What would happen if the banks did lend out that money ?
Inflation would explode and the Chinese would spit the dummy :
China ’s government remains “ concerned ” about the value of its U.S. assets , a Finance Ministry official said on the first day of bilateral talks with his counterparts in Washington .
“ China has a huge amount of investment in the U.S. , mainly in the form of Treasury bonds , ” Assistant Finance Minister Zhu Guangyao said in a press briefing with reporters .
“ We are concerned about the security of our financial assets . ”
Zhu ’s comments follow repeated public assurances by Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner that the Obama administration is committed to reining in a record budget deficit once an economic recovery is secured .
China is the largest foreign investor in U.S. government debt , and any drop in its demand could threaten higher borrowing costs .
Zhu also said that China favors a “ stable ” dollar , indicating one source of concern is any collapse in the value of the U.S. currency .
The dollar has dropped about 3.5 percent against the currencies of major trading partners so far this year , according to a Federal Reserve index , and has depreciated about 18 percent in the past eight years .
And lookee here :
It ’s another week and another record debt offering by the U.S. Treasury .
The best overall metric to keep an eye on is the U.S. Dollar Index .
Reading the first sentence of Terry Eagleton 's review of The God Delusion in the October 2006 edition of the London Review of Books was not unlike watching a gunfighter kicking over a table of cards in an otherwise well - ordered saloon .
" Imagine , " fired Eagleton , " someone holding forth on biology whose only knowledge of the subject is the Book of British Birds and you have a rough idea of what it feels like to read Richard Dawkins on theology . "
And that was only the opening volley .
Further down the page Eagleton proceeds to shoot up Dawkins 's failure to do justice to the complexity of the God he sought to rout ( " He seems to imagine God , if not exactly with a white beard , then at least as some kind of chap " ) , his literality and lack of imagination ( " Dawkins occasionally writes as though ' Thou still unravish'd bride of quietness ' is a mighty funny way to describe a Grecian urn " ) and his belief in the progressive nature of history ( " We have it from the mouth of Mr Public Science himself that aside from a few local , temporary hiccups like ecological disasters , famine , ethnic wars and nuclear wastelands , History is perpetually on the up " ) .
Entertaining , even exhilarating stuff .
But no great surprise to those who 've followed Eagleton 's career in any detail .
He has a reputation for entering other people 's rooms and kicking over their cards .
He appears equally happy whether outraging conventional students of literature at Oxford with his vigorous espousal of critical theory , confounding his long - time Marxist allies with his periodic dabblings with spirituality , or lambasting Martin Amis for his suggestion that British Muslims " must suffer " for the actions of suicide bombers .
( These comments , said Eagleton , were " not unlike the ramblings of a British National Party thug " ) .
Neither does the degree of Eagleton 's intellectual aggression seem to be modified by past friendships .
In his new book Reason , Faith and Revolution : Reflections on the God Debate , he is not content with amplifying his LRB attack upon Dawkins .
He widens his target to include a new antagonist he calls Ditchkins , a composite of Dawkins and Eagleton 's old International Socialist drinking mate and author of God Is Not Great , Christopher Hitchens .
It was enough to make me think , as I made my plans to interview Terry Eagleton , that I might be unwise to try to gain his attention or interest by stressing our biographical affinities , our shared attendance at northern Catholic schools , our one - time virtual comradeship in the ranks of International Socialism , even our common interest in the work of such cultural theorists as Roland Barthes or Michel Foucault .
None of this , after all , was likely to obscure the considerably less acceptable news that I was to interview him for a magazine which not only laboured under the intellectually suspect title of New Humanist but was also a product of an organisation called the Rationalist Association .
( Eagleton is particularly exercised by the New Atheists ' tendency to conflate reason and rationality .
" We hold many beliefs that have no unimpeachably rational justification , but are nevertheless reasonable to entertain . " )
But when we finally sat down to talk in a Dublin hotel ( Eagleton currently divides his life between Dublin and Derry and a string of international universities ) he looked so relieved to be out of the torrential rain that was pouring down outside on St Stephen 's Green that I decided to take a chance and play the Catholic card .
As an ex-Catholic myself , I said , I could n't help but wonder why you were quite so generous about your Catholic schooling in your autobiography The Gatekeeper .
" I valued the way it taught me to think analytically , to not be afraid of analytic thought , however nonsensical some of the content surely was .
There was an opportunity to argue . "
But how could he square that relatively sanguine memory with the requirement at Catholic schools to memorise and recite the absurd one - line strictures contained in the standard catechism ?
" I agree that the catechism was a way of short - circuiting thought .
But it was n't all there was .
I also remember a religious teacher in the sixth form , a rational enlightened man , quoting from an awful textbook called The Fundamentals of Religion that we had to learn like a garage mechanic boning up on parts .
He came to a passage which dismissed Buddhism in two sentences , looked up , and said , ' That 's shoddy scholarship ' .
That phrase resounded in my ears .
It was n't typical .
But it did happen .
It was possible . "
And that had been enough to keep him within the fold at school ?
" It was n't so bad that I had to rebel .
No period of Joycean rebellion .
It was repressive but it was not aggressive or violent . "
But had n't he as an intelligent sixth - former sometimes wanted to kick against the awful certainty of Catholic doctrine , its sheer unreadiness to entertain the idea that there might be something in other religions or ways of thought ?
" Well , there is a bad side to certainty but there 's also a good side .
People with my background do n't automatically thrill to the idea that we do n't know what we think about anything .
I was taught by people at Cambridge who got an almost erotic frisson from the idea that they did n't know what they thought and could afford not to know .
Whereas I came from a background where it was thought that there were certain things you really had to get sorted out .
There 's a difference between reasonable certainty and dogmatism . "
But at Cambridge he 'd embraced Marxism .
How had he managed to tie that in with his old Catholicism ?
" It was a time when the Church was going through a massive renewal .
It was called the new theology and it gave me good reasons to stay in the church when most right , decent people would have left in disgust .
I was challenged head - on by a number of Dominican clergy who would say , ' Okay , so you 're joining the International Socialists .
Okay , so we quite agree with that revolutionary project .
But it 's just that Christianity from within its own revolutionary perspective can see that that project has certain limits to it . '
For the first time I was not only hearing an intellectually persuasive interpretation of Christianity but also one that made sense politically to me . "
Memories like this constantly inform Eagleton 's passionate criticism of the " New Atheists " .
Whereas he has spent months and even years of his life debating theology with clever believers , the likes of Dawkins and Hitchens suddenly arrive on the scene and sweep away the entire philosophical content of religion with a derisory wave of the hand .
Eagleton might now be ready to talk of religion as an allegory and to question along with Dawkins and Hitchens the literal truth of the Bible .
But what he can never overlook in his opponents is their failure to ever engage in intellectual debate with the likes of the Dominicans who changed the course of his own life at Cambridge .
It is because they never exposed themselves to this type of theological debate that they can now be indicted for having " bought their atheism on the cheap " .
They are , in the equally scathing words of other Eagleton enthusiasts , nothing more than " discount store atheists " or even " schoolyard atheists " .
But what precisely have these alleged cheapskates overlooked ?
In his LRB review , Eagleton provides a namecheck .
" What one wonders are Dawkins 's views on the epistemological differences between Aquinas and Duns Scotus ?
Has he read Eriugena on subjectivity , Rahner on grace or Moltmann on hope ?
Has he even heard of them ? "
This is good knockabout stuff but , as Anthony Grayling pointed out in his LRB letters page response , charging Dawkins with failing to read theology " misses the point that when one rejects the premises of a set of views it is a waste of time to address what is built on those premises " .
Or , as Richard Dawkins himself put it to me during my interview with him for New Humanist in early 2007 , " Somebody who thinks the way I do does n't think theology is a subject at all .
So to me it is like someone saying they do n't believe in fairies and then being asked how they know if they have n't studied fairy - ology . "
Eagleton can , of course , fight back against this kind of rebuttal if he can only show that there is something in theology which undermines the arguments against religion made by the new atheists .
And this indeed is what he is up to in Reason , Faith and Revolution when he seeks to show , with the use of the theologian Thomas Aquinas , that the God so readily dismissed by Dawkins and Hitchens is not a god that many theologians , or indeed believers , would recognise .
While God for Dawkins and his ilk is " some kind of mega - manufacturer or cosmic chief executive officer " who set the world in motion and now directs it from his home in the clouds , Aquinas was quite ready to entertain the possibility " that the world had no origin at all " .
Dawkins and Hitchens are equally theologically illiterate in their view of religion as a failed attempt to explain the world .
" Christianity was never meant to be an explanation of anything in the first place . "
God is not a mega - manufacturer .
" He is rather what sustains all things in being by his love and would still be this even if the world had no beginning . "
I quoted this passage back to Eagleton and asked for some elaboration .
Did Aquinas really reject the Biblical story of the creation of the world ?
" Oh yes .
He paid a great deal of attention to scripture but he was a mainstream Catholic and not a fundamentalist so he did n't take it literally .
For Aquinas , God the Creator is not a hypothesis about how the world originated . "
Indeed , religion can be seen a persistent rebuff , a no - go area , for all those rationalists who spend their lives in the search for causes .
God , Eagleton cheerfully concedes , is " every bit as gloriously pointless as Ditchkins tells us he is .
He is a kind of perpetual critique of instrumental reason . "
If this argument already seems " fanciful " ( Anthony Grayling 's preferred term for Eagleton 's theology ) then you will need to tighten your safety belt as we move on to Eagleton 's account of this " pointless "
God 's involvement with the world .
God , Eagleton tells us , may not have created the world like a mega - manufacturer but he is the reason why there is something rather than nothing .
He is what sustains all things in being by his love .
He made the world not for any instrumental reason but simply " for the love and delight of it " .
When I first encountered passages like this in Reason , Faith and Revolution I could n't help but remember a sketch from Beyond the Fringe in which Peter Cook ( and I think it was Jonathan Miller ) parodied the Bishop of Woolwich 's assertion that God was not an old man in the sky by pedantically discussing , with much waving of the arms , his actual whereabouts .
" Is he over here , then ? "
" No , not exactly over there . "
" More to the left , then ? "
" Yes , that 's right .
But down a little . "
Eagleton 's
God is equally elusive in these quasi-mystical passages .
What can it mean , for example , to say that God sustains all things by his love and that he made the world simply for " the love and delight of it " ?
Faced with such musings from Eagleton about the nature of God , some critics simply throw up their hands in dismay .
The biologist PZ Myers , for example , describes such vague definitions as " blathering pseudo - scholarship " and accuses Eagleton of basking in his lack of clarity : " his own contradictions are worn with pride as symbols of ineffable profundity . "
It is easy to sympathise with Myers 's irritation but perhaps there 's a danger in not persisting with Eagleton 's arguments , in not trying a little harder to understand the complex even devious manner in which he is trying to rescue religion from the strictures of the New Atheists .
For it's an uneasy truth that Eagleton 's counter - attack has been warmly welcomed by a range of people who might not otherwise seem like natural apologists for religion .
Part of the reason for this appreciation is undoubtedly stylistic .
Eagleton , as students of his books on critical theory will know , is a powerful and engaging writer , perhaps no more so than when , with bursts of comic vituperation which recall Kenneth Tynan at his best , he is seeing off those he regards as second - rate opponents .
But probably more relevant is the sense among many readers and critics that Eagleton is providing a welcome antidote to the rather simple - minded conception of religion that Dawkins and Hitchens selected for their demolition jobs .
He is rather like a wise old schoolmaster explaining to two eager young students that the significance of Hamlet is hardly exhausted by describing it as " a revenge drama " .
So literary theorist Stanley Fish rushes to praise Eagleton for puncturing " the complacency " of the New Atheists while movie critic Andrew O'Hehir describes Reason , Faith and Revolution as " one of the most fascinating , more original and prickliest works of philosophy to emerge from the post 9/11 era " , and Piers Paul Read allows in the Observer that Eagleton is more learned that his opponents and " broader in his thinking " .
But is the emperor really as well dressed as such critics allow ?
I decided to press him further about his theology .
" You say that God made the world simply for the love and delight of it .
But you do n't mean ' made ' in the usual sense of the word as you 've already insisted that God did not create the world . "
" That 's right .
Aquinas is saying that the relationship between God and the world is about the fact that the world is in some ways His .
Not in the sense that my shoes are mine because I manufactured them but because at the centre of the world lies his love and freedom .
God did n't create the world .
He loved it into being .
Now what that means ,
God knows , but that 's exactly what Aquinas was saying .
The concept of God is what will not let you go .
He will not let you slip through his fingers .
It 's that kind of unconditional love .
If you like , that 's impossible .
We can only know conditional love , but if you are to have some kind of authentic idea of God that 's the place from which you have to start , not seeing God as some kind of manufacturer . "
I was intrigued by Eagleton 's admission of uncertainty , his parenthetical " God knows " , in this piece of elaborate theology .
It prompted me to suggest that he was not so much accepting the details of Aquinas 's account as using it as one way to argue that religion was one domain of thought which was incompatible with science .
It occupied another register .
Science , for example , could n't even begin to answer the question of why there was a world in the first place , why there was something rather than nothing , why what we did have was intelligible to us .
But did this mean that we needed to call upon religion to provide to such fundamental questions ?
Was n't this more properly the domain of philosophy ?
" Yes , I think that 's fair enough .
It was Leibniz after all who raised the question of why there is anything at all .
If that is a coherent question , and some philosophers think it is n't , then it has received an answer from the theologians .
It is because of God .
Now that might not be right but it is a question that theology tries to deal with . "
But were such questions ever considered by the mass of believers who were the intended audience for Dawkins and Hitchens ?
Eagleton was conciliatory .
" I do n't want to deny that there are a lot of simplistic ways of thinking in religion .
And yes , maybe I do have a more sophisticated view of religion than many believers but , hey , most people 's understanding of evolution is not like Mr Dawkins 's understanding of evolution and most people 's understanding of Marxism is not one that you or I would want to defend . "
But he'd still want to insist that the average believer was more sophisticated than Dawkins and Hitchens allowed ?
He had , after all , spoken very passionately in defence of the religion of his forebears and his inability to accept that the creed to which they devoted their lives was worthless and void .
" Well , it 's not exactly a knock - down argument from reason but something that has been believed by millions of people for thousands of years is not just garbage .
It may not be right or true as Dawkins or Hitchens see it but there is something in it that has to be interpreted . "
And , of course , as Eagleton makes plain in his book , also something to be celebrated .
Even the " cruelties and stupidities that the Irish Church has perpetrated do not prevent me from recalling how , without it , generations of my own ancestors would have gone unschooled , unnursed , unconsoled and unburied . "
Dawkins , however , in a book of almost four hundred pages " can scarcely bring himself to concede that a single human benefit has flowed from religious faith . "
But was n't his complaint misplaced in that both Dawkins and Hitchens were committed to liberating all those who , far from benefiting from religion , had had their lives and their thoughts constrained rather than elevated or enlarged by dogmas ?
I had , I told Eagleton , been very impressed , in my own conversation with Dawkins , by his stories of those who had approached him after reading The God Delusion or hearing one of his public lectures , and expressed fervent thanks for the manner in which he changed their lives for the better .
" Listen .
If Dawkins has emancipated people , freed them from the religious closet as it were , then all credit to him .
Loath as I might be to compare Dawkins to Jesus Christ , in this he resembles the heroic figure in the New Testament who comes to sweep away all the fetishism and sickness and cynicism of the neurotic religionists . "
This was Eagleton 's first mention of the figure of Christ in our conversation even though much of the argument in Reason , Faith and Revolution is about how Christianity has betrayed its origins , how its original emphasis upon the transformational capacity of love makes common cause with socialism .
You want to save Christianity from the Christians ?
" Yes , I quote my father who insisted that Jesus Christ was a socialist and that any Christianity that is not on the side of the dispossessed against the arrogance of the powerful and rich is utterly untraditional .
Dawkins and Hitchens write about Christianity and never link the words God , justice and love .
That is either a sign of their obtuseness or a sign of the massive self - betrayal of the Christian movement .
It has got to the point where intelligent people like them do n't understand that Christianity is not about how many months you get in purgatory for adultery .
It 's about a love and a thirst for justice that will bring you to your death .
There 's nothing lovely about it . "
Eagleton believes in Jesus , or rather in the symbolic power of Jesus the revolutionary who urged his followers to feed the hungry , love their enemies , give away their possessions and visit the sick , and was finally tortured and killed for such advocacy .
If , he argues , we want an image , a signifier , that captures the ugly awful truth of human history then we could not do better than choose the tortured body of the innocent Christ - the crucifixion .
Even one of Eagleton 's sternest rationalist critics is prepared to allow the potency of this image .
PZ Myers , in a review which elsewhere describes a day spent reading Eagleton 's new book as frustrating , horrible and awful , admits that " the symbol of the crucified Christ is a powerful one .
It appeals because we can identify with suffering ... it resonates . "
But Myers quickly finds this merit cancelled out by the actions that have been carried out in the name of the suffering Christ .
Something more uplifting is required if we want a signifier for the human condition .
" Imagine the culture we would live in now if , instead of a dead corpse on an instrument of torture , our signifier was a child staring in wonder at the stars . "
Eagleton has no time for such uplifting images .
Our history , he believes , demands an image that constantly reminds us of our failures to set the world to rights .
This is not for Eagleton a fatalistic denial of the value of attempting to improve the world , or indeed a denial of the manner in which liberal endeavours have enhanced our various freedoms .
But it is a powerful iconic reproof to all those who have perverted liberalism - an ideology , asserts Eagleton , with its roots in Christianity - into a belief in unilinear progress .
And who subscribes most tenaciously to this story of universal moral progress ?
Eagleton looks no further than his familiar opponent .
" Dawkins , " he contends , " has a Panglossian vision of progress .
A view from North Oxford .
Indeed for all his self - conscious modernity he turns out to be something of an old - fashioned Hegelian believing in a Zeitgeist ( his own word ) involving every increasing moral progress with just the occasional ' reversal ' .
History is perpetually on the up .
Not even beaming tambourine - banging evangelicals are quite so pathologically bullish .
What is this but an example of blind faith ?
What rational soul would sign up to such a secular myth ? "
( When I confronted Dawkins in 2007 with his description of the Holocaust as " a temporary setback " , he at first insisted that it was still appropriate to believe in general moral progress .
He thought that the idea of such progress was " plausible " but agreed that my scepticism deserved attention .
It was , he finally said , " a fair cop " . )
It is Dawkins 's stated belief in the inevitability of progress that , according to Eagleton , marks him out as a particular kind of humanist .
" Dawkins deeply believes in the flourishing of the free human spirit which makes him a liberal humanist rather than a tragic humanist .
He believes that if only those terrible guys out there would stop stifling and shackling us , then our creative capacities would flourish .
I do n't believe that .
As a Marxist I reject that simple liberationism .
I 'm not again humanism .
I 'm for a humanism which recognises the price of liberation .
And that 's what I call tragic humanism .
The only idea of emancipation worth having is one that starts from looking at the worst , that starts from Swift 's race of odious little vermin .
If you 're the kind of humanist who can understand what Socrates meant when he said it would been far better if man had never been born , you 're on .
A humanism like Dawkins 's and possibly that held by Hitchens is n't worth all that much .
It 's too easy . "
As I checked my watch and saw that my time with Eagleton was up I reflected that while Christ had certainly taken a long time to enter the argument , poor old Marx had nearly missed his entrance altogether .
But it was only after I 'd manoeuvred an unwilling Eagleton into the arms of the New Humanist photographer in the hotel lobby that I began to recognise the import of Marx 's absence from our conversation .
Marx , of course , sees all religious ideas as social and historical products .
This does n't empty them of all significance , turn them into mere epiphenomena .
Marx readily allows that such ideas are vehicles for expressing suffering and the suffering they record is very real indeed .
Religion is " the heart of a heartless world , the soul of soulless circumstances " as well as being " the opium of the people " .
But oddly this appears to be a Marxism too far for Terry Eagleton .
He may readily draw our attention to the material facts of capitalism , imperialism and inequality , and may continue to criticise those who fail to recognise that Islamophobia has little to do with religion and almost everything to do with western material interests , but it seems that he cannot in the context of his argument with Hitchens and Dawkins , or indeed in the context of his own religious biography , go the whole hog and allow that all religious ideas are illusory .
Reason , Faith and Revolution is , after all , primarily an exercise in retrieving or resuscitating those religious ideas that are not " true " in some vulgar scientific way but that nevertheless have an intrinsic potency , a real value , for those who hold them .
As the Marxist critic John Molyneux has argued , this leaves Eagleton in an uncomfortable position .
" In demonstrating his understanding of the liberal theologians ' concept of an immaterial , impersonal god of love and tolerance in contrast to the Old Testament god of vengeance , Eagleton leaves decidedly open the possibility that this liberal god may actually exist , or be worthy of worship .
For a Marxist the loving , caring , impersonal god of Dietrich Bonhoeffer and radical Jesus of Terry Eagleton are both just as much human creations , illusory projections , as the unpleasant bigoted gods of Ian Paisley or Osama Bin Laden . "
There is , then , a fascinating double repression going on in the pages of The God Delusion and Religion , Faith and Revolution .
Dawkins , the thoroughgoing scientist , abandons a central tenet of science - testability - in order to proclaim his belief in moral progress , while Eagleton , the thoroughgoing Marxist , is forced to relinquish a fundamental tenet of Marxism - its materialism - in order to find religious ideas of sufficient intrinsic value to counter Dawkins 's alleged caricature .
In a last throwaway remark Eagleton told me that he was unhappy that Dawkins had never taken up his invitation to debate the subject of religion .
After this attempt to bring their views into some sort of alignment I can't help feeling that another sort of event might be more appropriate , a contest in which the protagonists ' insistence on playing by different rules was recognised from the start .
How about a match ?
I can see it now in all its wonderful confusion .
Oxford United FC versus Derry Hurling .

Remember the Pueblo ?
North Korea ’s leaders surely do , as they wait to see when Americans ’ humanitarian concern for two imprisoned reporters will overwhelm strategic policy considerations in Washington .
After the capture of the U.S. Navy spy ship Pueblo off the North Korean port of Wonson on Jan. 21 , 1968 , Americans ’ overriding interest proved to be the safety of the crew .
President Lyndon B. Johnson told an aide that the U.S. would “ do anything to get those men back — including meeting naked in the middle of the street at high noon , if that ’s what it takes . ”
It took something almost as humiliating : an official written apology , issued even though U.S. data showed the ship had been in international waters when attacked .
The North Koreans let the crew go — but they still keep the Pueblo .
The ship serves them both as a trophy propaganda stop on the typical itinerary of tourists visiting Pyongyang and as a reminder , whenever needed , of how far Washington may be tempted to veer from principle if American citizens get caught up in foreign intrigue .
Fast - forward to now .
Just as the Obama administration starts to crank up harder - line measures in response to North Korea ’s missile and nuclear test provocations , the two senators from California have called upon the president to send a special envoy to secure the release of their constituents Laura Ling and Euna Lee .
A North Korean court last week sentenced the two reporters for San Francisco ’s Current TV to 12 years hard labor for intruding illegally in order to film what the country ’s official news agency termed a “ slanderous ” expose of the trafficking of women .
What would a special envoy offer in return for the women ’s release ?
Money is one thing that North Korea , with its wrecked economy , would likely demand .
Should the U.S. pay ?
The United Nations Security Council has just agreed — following Washington ’s leadership — to choke off sources of funding that could help Kim Jong
Il develop his weapons of mass destruction , make North Korea even more threatening to its neighbors and proliferate weaponry and technology to U.S. foes in other parts of the world .
Perhaps it is useful first to contemplate the extent to which the two journalists might have brought this situation on themselves .
Did they ignore the predictable effects of their actions on larger U.S. interests and on other individuals — who , on their account , may have gotten into far worse trouble than they are in themselves ?
Consider , in other words , whether this was a case of reckless endangerment .
Start with the fact that we are not hearing denials from the women ’s family and supporters that they illegally intruded into North Korea , crossing a frozen border river .
Rather , we ’re hearing apologies for any inadvertent offense the two might have committed .
Journalists ’ groups , noting the harshness of the sentences , have appealed to the North Korean regime for clemency — I personally contributed to the language of one such appeal — but it ’s doubtful that many in our trade who have followed the issue are convinced Ling and Lee are entirely in the right .
Seeking and reporting the truth , however loathsome the reported truth shows the regime to be , is one thing .
We must do it , and that has been the goal of a number of journalists including myself who have devoted much of our careers to reporting on North Korea .
But it ’s quite another matter if these two women gave Kim ’s regime a new hold over their own country ’s strategic policy - making for the sake of getting merely a better camera angle — or , more questionable still , just to be able to boast of their fearlessness .
Further , assuming the North Korean authorities were able to use the women ’s captured notes , their testimony and the contents of their camera and cell phones to identify opponents of the regime who had helped the reporters on the Chinese side of the river , those helpers could now be in grave peril from North Korean agents who are tasked with hunting them down .
That ’s the sort of thing conscientious journalists would not like to have on their consciences .
We will hear protests that the two , besides being fearless , were simply naive .
While that may be true of one of them , Lee , who reportedly was on her first overseas assignment , Ling , the Current TV vice president in charge of organizing coverage of dangerous places , should have had ample warning of the risks of sneaking into North Korea — risks not only to herself but to others .
( Current TV had no comment for this story ) .
In an eerie precedent now three years old , viewers including myself wondered how Ling ’s own elder sister , celebrity journalist Lisa Ling , and a Nepalese medical mission she teamed up with could justify pretending she was a humanitarian aid worker so that she could sneak into the country and make a 2006 National Geographic documentary .
In a review on the National Geographic documentary ’s Amazon.com web page Aloysius O’Neill , a retired State Department official who worked on North Korean issues for large parts of his career , wrote of his concern for North Koreans whom Lisa Ling had duped and then in some cases filmed .
“ Even unwittingly contributing to a story that would be seen as criticizing the Kim cult of personality could have severe consequences for North Korean medical personnel and others who helped the visitors , ” O’Neill wrote .
“ It would be reprehensible if National Geographic took chances with other people ’s lives to get an eye - catching story . ”
Another reviewer , A.O. Sheepfielder of Chicago , raised a related issue : “ Did n’t it occur to Lisa Ling and National Geographic that , by cloaking themselves in the mantle of humanitarian aid to film a forbidden documentary , they might severely jeopardize any future humanitarian efforts ? ”
In the present case of Laura Ling and Euna Lee , there may well be good reason for former vice president Al Gore , one of the founders of Current TV , to go to Pyongyang in a private capacity and request their release — at high noon or any other time , clothed or unclothed .
Twelve years is a long sentence — even if , as I imagine will be the case , the women are kept in the nicest of the country ’s prisons so as to minimize the sensational revelations they might be in a position to make after their release .
But President Obama should resist the pressure for him to designate an official envoy , a move that would likely confuse broad national interests with the legitimate — but in the larger scheme of things , I ’m sorry to have to say , less important — concern for these two women ’s welfare .

America ’s extreme left tricked American moderates into supporting their candidate last November by campaigning on post - partisan cooperation and transparency in government .
Six months after the election of a freshman senator with a blank résumé , a laundry list of evil associates and a life more secret than your average CIA agent , Obama ’s entire history remains a mystery and his administration is the most hardcore partisan dictatorship ever experienced in the USA .
Washington DC partisanship has turned into outright Obama - Pelosi dictatorship .
The so - called “ Commander - in - Chief ” is fast losing control of his military , which is increasingly and viciously divided between those who are refusing to take orders from an overt enemy of the Constitution , and those who foolishly defend Obama ’s right to destroy that which they took an oath to protect and preserve .
Obama should have ended the divisions over his ineligibility long before it reached the ranks of American fighting forces .
He chose not to , and instead to allow the issue to fester into a powder keg that even Rahm Emanuel and David Axelrod are ill - prepared to extinguish .
The US Constitution is in FULL Crisis
The US Constitution is the contract between the people and their respective states , and the federal government established by it .
The document was written to form a representative republic limited in power and scope to the matters and authority delegated and ratified in the Constitution .
That contract has been breached by a runaway Fed …
Decades of outright destruction of the Constitution have left the nation on the brink of economic , political and social collapse .
The 2006 and 2008 election cycles placed the Constitution in full crisis and the people are growing increasingly desperate for a peaceful means to restore their Constitutional Republic .
An administration which does not meet constitutional standards is expected to protect and defend a contract which it does not even recognize , much less respect .
The contract either stands , or it does n’t .
Based on the 2008 election , and every policy put in place since , the contract does not stand at present .
If the Constitution no longer stands , then the federal government which it established , no longer stands in authority .
Tyranny reigns …
The States Take Action
Ignored by federal public servants and cut off from any access to peaceful means of redress in congress or the courts , the people and their states are forced to take matters into their own hands .
A “ constitutional ” interpretation of the Constitution is in order , as the people begin to demand that a runaway Fed blatantly acting against the best interest of its people , return to a constitutional foundation , or risk being stripped of all power and abolished .
The federal government is the product of the Constitution , the contract between the people and their states which established and assigned specific limited powers to the federal government , which is to serve at the pleasure of the states and the people .
If the Constitution no longer stands , then there is NO federal government .
The federal government exists only as a result of the Constitution .
A very real crisis is at hand …
As a result , more than 32 states are rushing to pass Tenth Amendment legislation intended to remind the federal government of this reality .
But the Obama regime is not listening .
Many of those states are also passing Second Amendment protections for their citizens , making it illegal for the Fed to threaten private gun rights , even in cases of “ Martial Law . ”
But the Fed has rejected all such state bills , claiming that “ federal laws supersede state laws . ”
Reacting to an “ unconstitutional ” letter from Obama ’s ATF , which puts Tennessee on notice that the Fed will not recognize laws passed by the individual states under Tenth Amendment rights , Tennessee State Rep. Matthew Hill points out , —“ Montana , Tennessee and all others , are SOVEREIGN states not subservient to the federal government .
The Fed can send us letters all day long and it does n’t change the fact that we are allowed to govern ourselves , under the 10th amendment of the US Constitution . ”
A “ constitutional ” interpretation of the Constitution
All constitutional text must be read within the context of Amendment Ten… which clearly states , “ The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution , nor prohibited by it to the states , are reserved to the states respectively , or to the people . ”
Does the Constitution delegate the power to “ confiscate and redistribute private wealth ” to the federal government ?
Does it delegate power to force “ Cap and Trade ” or so - called “ Universal Health Care ” upon the people and the states ?
Does it delegate the power over private industry , such as banking , auto manufacturing , energy and the likes ?
–
Or the power to disarm American citizens under any set of circumstances , real or imaginary ?
No such powers were delegated to the federal government under the US Constitution .
Unlike many ill - informed US citizens , Obama & Co. knows it .
But they do n’t care …
Since no clause exists in the Constitution which specifically assigns any of these powers to the Fed , Amendment Ten applies …
“ The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution , nor prohibited by it to the states , are reserved to the states respectively , or to the people . ”
The Second Amendment Example
Each clause of the Constitution must be read within the context of the Tenth Amendment .
Power and authority is either specifically delegated to the Fed in the text of the Constitution , specifically withheld from the Fed by way of the Bill of Rights , or in the absence of any such reference to power and authority , the Tenth Amendment applies .
In the case of gun rights , the Founders specifically denied the Fed any power via the Bill of Rights , specifically prohibiting the Fed from playing around with the people ’s right to keep and bear arms .
“ A well regulated militia , being necessary to the security of a free state , the right of the people to keep and bear arms , shall not be infringed . ” –
Yet , operating in direct contradiction to this Second Amendment language , the federal government has assumed a power not assigned to it by the states , to regulate the right of the people to keep and bear arms .
A case of the people ’s past silence , being intentionally misinterpreted as their consent , which allowed the fed to step across boundaries it is specifically prohibited from crossing in the Bill of Rights .
As a result , the states have been forced to restate their border sovereignty and state rights in new state sponsored legislation , including Second Amendment protections for their citizens who wish to keep and bear arms , whether anti-second amendment leftists in Washington DC like it or not .
“ The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution , nor prohibited by it to the states , are reserved to the states respectively , or to the people . ”
My home state of Tennessee passed both Tenth Amendment and Second Amendment legislation , supported in such number as to override our Democrat governor ’s attempts to veto .
But Obama ’s
Fed responded by issuing a letter , under his Justice Department headed by Obama buddy Eric Holder , on the letterhead of the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms signed by Assistant Director Carson Carroll , advising the state that “ federal laws supersede states laws . ”
Like hell they do !
The states DO NOT serve at the pleasure of the Fed .
The Fed exists and serves at the pleasure of the states , a FACT that most states seem in a rush to point out to Obamanation .
The US Constitution supersedes both state and federal laws .
Do n’t confuse the US Constitution with federal laws , passed by congress or passed by judicial fiat via the courts .
Federal laws take precedent over state laws ONLY in matters specifically delegated to the federal government in the Constitution .
If no such authority is assigned to the Fed , then no such power exists at the Fed .
When the federal government makes laws pertaining to matters NOT assigned to it under the US Constitution , which it has had a habit of doing for decades now , both in congress and in the judicial branch , the states are in NO WAY bound by those laws .
Those laws are by definition , unconstitutional , no matter how they were passed .
As the Second Amendment makes it quite clear that the federal government has NO power to regulate the people ’s right to keep and bear arms , and the Tenth Amendment clearly states that “ The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution , nor prohibited by it to the states , are reserved to the states respectively , or to the people . ”- Obama ’s Fed , Justice Department and ATF , have NO constitutional authority over the states in the matter …
Tennessee State Rep. Matthew
Hill is exactly right .
They ( the Fed ) can send threatening letters all day long and those letters are completely irrelevant , as they are at odds with the Constitution .
The ATF letter relates to federal laws written on matters NOT assigned to the federal government to begin with , matters therefore reserved to the states and the people under the Tenth Amendment .
Even the overly politicized US Supreme Court has recently defended Second and Tenth Amendment rights in its related rulings .
The Question of Enforcement
Clearly , Obama and Co. think they won the right to run roughshod over the states and the people last fall .
If our Founders had given us a pure democracy , they would be right .
But in a Constitutional Representative Republic , they are dead wrong !
Still , it ’s also clear that they intend to force their will upon the masses , regardless of public or state dissent , or constitutional limitations .
The “ silent majority ” has been silent for so long , that modern leftist think that they are now the new majority , free to run roughshod over the new “ silent minority . ”
Under this fantasy , they proclaim the right to ram their leftist agenda down everyone else ’s throat .
“ We won - you lost — so shut up and take it ! ” ... is the general sentiment displayed by O - bots on message boards across the blogosphere …
That sentiment has now reached within the ranks of the US Military , where a growing number of soldiers are beginning to challenge Obama ’s right to issue orders and Obama minions are publicly attacking them with a vengeance .
The heated chatter got so vicious on Military.com last week , that the publication removed ALL comments on the subject from its web site before the discussion could spin out of control .
Active duty soldiers are refusing Obama orders .
Reservists are refusing recall and deployment orders .
Retired Navy Commander Walter Fitzpatrick has filed criminal “ treason ” charges against Obama .
Flight Surgeon , Lt. Col. Dr. David Earl - Graeff has sent a letter to Sec. of Defense Gates , stating the following …
“ Enough is enough !
You must be aware at this point of the tempest brewing among the Rank and File .
I am writing you in an effort to appeal to your sense of concern for the Military ; a concern we share not only for the Military as a whole but for each and every individual who wears the Uniform in the Service of our Country .
I am in this regard specifically asking you for your help .
I implore you to not wait until the “ pot boils over ” and we find ourselves in total disarray .
– I am convinced , beyond any doubt , that the moral well being and efficiency of our fighting forces to defend our Country is soon to be hanging in a precarious balance if not already .
In my humble estimation this is NOT a theoretical possibility to construct a thesis or a contingency plan about .
It is a reality and is happening right now .
Resolution of this issue must be accomplished in the most expeditious manner available at your disposal to gain immediate relief to those of us who are struggling to fully comply with our sworn Oath to the Constitution while being conflicted by questions relating to the qualifications of the POTUS to hold the office in full and absolute compliance with the Natural Born Citizen Clause . ”
So , how does Obama plan to enforce his global vision upon the masses when the US Constitution which provides for a federal government , delegates no such authority and an increasing number of soldiers and law enforcement are taking a stand against a “ potential domestic enemy ” in an effort to uphold their oath to protect and defend the US Constitution ?
Once Silent running out of Tolerance
Convinced that the Constitution is under constant threat from within today , Americans normally happy to avoid the subject of politics altogether are building a head of steam to thwart the current constitutional crisis .
They are erecting lines of defense at the state borders before Obama can capitalize on one of his many manufactured disasters by removing the people ’s right to stand opposed .
His Department of Homeland Security has already redefined “ domestic terrorist ” to include anyone who disagrees with Obama .
His minions have already labeled anyone concerned with the Constitution , “ birthers , ” in a childish name - calling effort to silence the dissent .
His left - wing press has affixed the title of “ racist ” to anyone who dare doubt Obama ’s anti-American Marxist agenda , or his mystery messiah status .
Pelosi has made certain that Republicans have no voice in congress and Holder has made certain that the people will not find a legal forum to resolve Obama ’s overt agenda or hidden past in any court .
Growing increasingly desperate to restore the Constitution and fast running out of peaceful means of doing so , the people find themselves in a very real Constitutional Crisis .
Peacefully Forcing the Fed to Reverse Course
With a tone deaf
Fed , the people are turning to their state legislators and the states are moving to close down the Fed .
Led by the Tenth Amendment Center , state legislators are rushing to reclaim freedom and liberty on behalf of their citizens .
Step One – Tenth Amendment Affirmation
– Tenth Amendment Affirmation Step Two – Second Amendment Affirmation
– Second Amendment Affirmation Step Three – Kicking the Fed out of the States
– Kicking the Fed out of the States Step Four – Shutting down the Fed by cutting off 97 % of Fed funding by repeal of the 16th Amendment
– Shutting down the Fed by cutting off 97 % of Fed funding by repeal of the 16th Amendment Step Five – Repeal of the 17th Amendment , removing every current member of the senate and sending new representatives of states right to establish a new constitutional senate .
– Repeal of the 17th Amendment , removing every current member of the senate and sending new representatives of states right to establish a new constitutional senate .
Step Six – cleaning house in Washington DC and establishing a constitutional limited government which will once again serve at the pleasure and benefit of the states and the people
Unlike drug rehab , it does n’t take twelve steps to reinstate a constitutional Fed , although it could take a twelve step program to break many modern Democrats addiction to free - stuff from the public trough .
“ We hold these truths to be self - evident , that all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights , that among these are Life , Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness . —
That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends , it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it , and to institute new Government … ”
If the people fail to quickly alter a Fed run wild , via their state legislatures , they will be left with no option but to abolish and start over from scratch .
Republicans in Washington DC have either lost their way or lost their nerve .
As a result , they have lost all power .
But Republicans , Independents and even Blue Dog Democrats across the nation in state legislatures , are acting in defense of their citizens and the Constitution , and the people MUST take a stand with those state legislators , immediately .
Visit the Tenth Amendment Center for an up - to - date picture of where your state stands in the march to reclaim states rights and reign in the runaway Fed .
Contact your state legislators and get behind their efforts to affirm state sovereignty and rights .
Even Obama does not have the power to force his will upon fifty states who stand united and opposed !
Kay Bailey Hutchison is resigning from the U.S. Senate to challenge incumbent Governor Rick Perry in the GOP primary .
It ’s already shaping up to be a nasty intra-GOP battle .
For some reason , Hutchison ’s website was using the term “ rick perry gay ” as some kind of search term .
Apparently , this was first reported in the Austin American - Statesman , but it ’s all over the Texas media now .
All you have to do is a google news search of “ ‘ Rick Perry ’ and Gay ” and you ’ll see all the current media coverage .
Do a regular google search of “ ‘ Rick Perry ’ and Gay ” and the second of the 207,000 results is this article from the Austin Chronicle back in 2004 .
I ’m sure no one on the Hutchison campaign knew anything about all those rumors .
Funny thing .
Notice the google ads for those search terms ( click on picture for larger image ) :
Yes , you get a link to Texans for Kay , the campaign website .
Okay , the campaign probably bought the “ Rick Perry ” search term .
But , given the news from earlier today , it ’s pretty funny .
And , one does wonder if the Hutchison campaign is sending a message .

This week : heavy metal , organized by the major subgenres that have developed over the five decades of its existence .
Moving from the best - known examples of heavy music to the deepest pits of black Satanic noise , we ’ll conclude with five essential albums that belong in the music library of anyone who likes it hard .

Metal 101
Even casual fans know that the biggest name in heavy metal ’s early days was Black Sabbath , and even today , Ozzy Osbourne and his Birmingham cohorts are widely considered the founding fathers of everything awesome about metal .
But with so many years ’ remove , it ’s easy to forget what made this early form of metal so compelling : downtuned guitars , heavy bass , and crushing drums , and solos heavily influenced by , of all things , the blues — all slowed way , way down .
Though it did n’t have the name at the time , Sabbath revolutionized music by inventing what would later be known as doom metal : a heady blend of a pounding rhythm section , guitars tuned chillingly low , and fearful , doomstruck lyrics , played slow enough so listeners had time to appreciate whatever drugs were coursing through their systems .
By the 1990s , a new wave of doom metal would arise , tinged with the psychedelic heaviness of American bands like Pentagram and spearheaded by Electric Wizard , another Birmingham band that followed in the ironclad footsteps of Sabbath .
A few years later , a number of bands concentrated largely in California ramped up the fuzzy tones , cranked up the heavy , and saturated everything in a sticky - slow haze of weed smoke , and stoner rock was born ; Kyuss and its High Desert compatriots typified the genre , while Sleep took it to extremes and Earthless stripped away the frills , leaving nothing but pure , punishing heavy rock .

By the mid-1970s , a number of bands , particularly in Britain , were still drug - stuffed and in love with loudness as ever , but they were beginning to tire of playing slow and low .
Retaining the rugged , rock - steady rhythm sections , they tuned their guitars up - up - up , and most of all , they got faster .
The music they started making in the late 1970s was called speed metal , and it quickly became one of metal ’s first global genres .
The master of the form , then and now , is Motörhead , which was at the advance guard of the metal umlaut and set the loud - fast - rules aesthetic for decades to come .
Lemmy throttled his bass like a lead guitar , and kicked the whole medium into overdrive .
A few years later , a number of American bands mostly operating in the Bay Area took the basic elements of speed and applied them to the rhythm section as well ; the heavy suffered , but the metal increased , as bands like Metallica , Megadeth , Exodus , and Anthrax popularized the finger - cracking , shredding guitar solo and brought thrash metal into existence .
While American bands turned the speed - metal aesthetic into thrash by throwing the hyperspeed switch and emphasizing technical acumen , a generation of English bands applied surprisingly poppy song structures along with a snotty , sneering , anti-authoritarian attitude to create the new wave of British heavy metal .
The two scenes fed off each other , but ironically , the British movement met with more chart success in the United States , making millionaires out of bands like Saxon , Judas Priest , and Iron Maiden .
Their slashing , dual - guitar attack and willingness to embrace the excess of the metal scene helped NWOBHM bands define the genre for decades to come .

Meanwhile , in Southern California , a number of bands concentrated in the Sunset Strip area embraced the wicked excess of NWOBHM and the flashy guitar solos of thrash , but abandoned any pretense of darkness or edge , instead embracing a wild party - time aesthetic that could only have become huge in the 1980s .
Their genre started out as a more - or - less international phenomenon known as glam metal , which combined the sleazy , androgynous decadence of ’ 70s glam rock with speed - metal musicianship .
But by the time it arrived in Hollywood , bands like Hanoi Rocks and Quiet Riot had given way to poppy , power - ballad - heavy groups like Warrant , Poison , and Great White .
Traditional metal fans hated them , denigrating them as hair metal , but the bands scored huge chart successes .
Their musical merit is , surprisingly , still a topic of some debate .
Just as hair metal dominated the charts in its heyday while being critically vilified , metalcore looms over today ’s heavy scene , selling millions to Hot Topic shoppers while drawing the ire of traditional metalheads .
Growing out of the post - hardcore scene , where bands like Cave In , Earth Crisis , and Time In Malta fused the melodic intensity and flashy play of thrash with the rhythms , vocals , and lyrical concerns of hardcore punk , metalcore prettied up the whole style , dressing it in the latest fashions and adding a strong melodic influence .
If a band blends pop-metal hooks and hardcore breakdowns , combines the death - metal growl with “ clean ” ( that is , traditionally sung ) vocals , and has a long , awkward - sounding name , it just might be metalcore .
But not every metalcore band deserves the “ mall metal ” tag ; some worthwhile bands have emerged from the scene , including Bullet For My Valentine and the thrash - inspired God Forbid .
Micro -genres have also emerged from metalcore , including deathcore ( melodic death metal with a strong metalcore element ) , best heard in the Swedish “ Gothenburg sound ” of At The Gates and In Flames , and screamo , a much - denigrated blend of punk , metal , and emo .

Intermediate Work
Though it comes directly from the California thrash - metal scene , Slayer represented a quantum leap forward in the development of modern metal ; lyrically savage , brutally loud , and with an emphasis on jaw - dropping instrumental prowess , the band paved the way for what would become known as death metal .
It ’s now a global phenomenon ( any city with electricity has a death - metal scene ) , but the genre developed in the sweltering Florida heat in the 1990s , when bands like Cynic , Atheist , Morbid Angel , and especially Death , led by the late , lamented Chuck Schuldiner , held sway .
Their emphasis was on dark , despairing lyrics and punishing drum and guitar attacks ; later bands like Cannibal Corpse would further refine the genre , and more significantly , introduce the death growl ( denigrated as “ Cookie Monster vocals ” by detractors ) that would become such a polarizing factor in heavy music .
Later bands — for example , Gorguts , Psycroptic , and the astounding Meshuggah — refined the jazz - like time signatures and precise instrumental attack of the Florida scene and ramp it up to an unprecedented degree ; the music they created , with its neck - breaking rhythmic assault and mind - blowingly adept guitar playing , would become known as technical death metal .
With its roots in the neoclassical metal of brilliantly egomaniacal fucking - fury - unleasher Yngwie J. Malmsteen , the subgenre known as power metal appeals to fans of the “ classic ” era of heavy music from the late ’ 70s to the early ’ 80s .
Power metal tends to feature clean vocals , making it appealing to those who ca n’t tolerate the death growl , but its emphasis on hyper - difficult guitar and keyboard solos can rival all but the best tech - death bands , as evidenced by DragonForce , whose song “ Through The Fire And Flames ” is the ultimate fuck - you to Guitar Hero players .
Power metal is much more popular in Europe than in the U.S. , largely because its lyrics tend to be pretty hokey , but for awesome solos and old - school - metal feel without the “ extreme ” one - upmanship of a lot of other metal subgenres , bands like Iced Earth , Manowar , Hammerfall , and Blind Guardian fit the bill .

Closely related to power metal , but given a twist that makes it simultaneously more nerdy and more awesome , is folk metal and its various offshoots .
Beginning in the 1990s in places like Great Britain and Scandinavia , a number of bands ( generally in the death - metal mold ) began incorporating local martial rhythms and folk traditions into their musical palate , resulting in everything from the Celtic metal of bands like Cruachan to the Finnish folk metal of Finntroll and Korpiklaani to the Oriental metal ( or as they call it , “ Mesopotamian metal ” ) of the blistering Melechesh .
Metal already tends to go overboard with the elf and goblin imagery , so some of the offshoots of folk metal can get ridiculous — witness the ludicrous , though entertaining , “ pirate metal ” of Alestorm , and whatever the hell Slough Feg thinks it ’s doing .
Still , the scene is n’t all hobbits and grandpa guitars ; Viking metal , as typified by Sweden ’s Amon Amarth , is producing some incredibly ass - kicking metal at the moment .

No musical genre is more tediously obsessed with authenticity than metal ; those who think nothing is more boring than watching hip - hop heads yelling at each other on the Internet about “ realness ” should try having a conversation with someone about what constituted “ true ” black metal .
As a result , a consensus has built up around the idea that metal is never worse than when it tries to blend with other musical forms .
Unfortunately , the nü-metal movement of the late 1990s , with its attempts to fuse metal with rap and “ alternative ” music , did n’t do much to dispel that notion , and for every decent band like Rage Against The Machine or Deftones that ’s emerged from the scene , there was a disaster like Limp Bizkit or Linkin Park .
Likewise , Gothic metal is generally a love - it - or - loathe - it affair , with the music , mysticism , and self - absorbed gloominess of bands like My Dying Bride , Within Temptation , and Lacuna Coil finding a solid crossover audience — especially among female goth fans — but finding resistance among traditional metalheads .
Industrial metal has met with more acceptance , partly because of its long history and its valorization of pure aggressive noise ; Ministry has long been the genre ’s flag - bearer , with the surprising Rammstein hitting it big in the nü-metal years , and younger groups like Static - X carrying on the tradition .
Prog-metal , in the form of bands like King ’s X , Dream Theater , and Fates Warning , has been around for decades , combining complex , jazz - like structures , fluid guitar playing , and ambitious song structures and time signatures with a solid heavy - metal rhythm core and theatrical vocals .
The genre has repeatedly been refined and expanded , bringing everything from the thrash - imbued Queensrÿche and the neo-psychedelic Porcupine Tree to the intense death - metal variations of Opeth into the prog tent .
Building on the experimentalism and eclecticism of prog-metal while building up the heaviness , a number of bands have emerged in recent years in a relatively new subgenre known as post- metal ( also called “ instru-metal , ” since the bands often dispense with vocals altogether , ridding them of a potential embarrassment that no doubt helps their substantial hipster appeal ) .
One of the leading proponents of this style , though its members claim to loathe the term “ post- metal , ” is Chicago ’s Pelican ; others include Neurosis and a handful of affiliated Los Angeles bands — Isis , Intronaut , and the Red Sparowes .
As with prog-metal before them , post - metal bands are creating fascinating music that pushes the boundaries of what metal means , but they also strike many metal purists as pretentious and indulgent .

Advanced Studies
Past the bleeding edges of post- metal , far out on the distant edges of the genre , are a number of bands so difficult to categorize that they practically occupy subgenres all to themselves .
Some still enjoy commercial and critical success ; the Melvins , in particular , are hugely influential , even though they play a style of music that belongs , essentially , just to them .
While no one has managed to fully embrace the group ’s unique style of slow doom tempos , choppy guitars and drums , off - kilter song structures , and bizarre lyrics , a number of bands in the late ’ 80s and early ’90s , particularly in Louisiana , picked up on it , slowed it down even further , and , emphasizing the punk elements and the druggy lyrical concerns , invented sludge metal .
This slow , vicious form of metal was best heard in bands like Eyehategod , Crowbar , and Buzzoven .
Meanwhile , beginning with Seattle ’s Earth , a number of bands kept the slow tempos , but emphasized the pulsing , repetitive riffs instead of the hardcore intensity , giving birth to drone metal .
The style has many proponents and offshoots , including Sunn O ) ) ) ’s experimental flavor and the industrial creaking of Britain ’s Esoteric , but perhaps the best band to emerge from the genre is Japan ’s Boris .
Named after a Melvins song and incorporating both sludge and doom elements , Boris also throws in pure , old - school heavy - rock riffs and noise - rock experimentalism to create a sound that ’s truly like no one else ’s — and louder than hell .

On the exact opposite end of the spectrum from drone is grindcore .
Its fans like it loud and they like it hard , but most of all , they like it fast .
Very , very , fast .
Incalculably fast .
So fast , in fact , that British grind pioneer Napalm Death holds a Guinness - certified record for the world ’s shortest recorded song : “ You Suffer , ” clocking in at a blink - and - you ’ll - literally - miss - it 1.1 seconds long .
There are endless variations of grind : the goregrind of Carcass , with its industrial staccato rhythms and horrific lyrics drawn straight from medical encyclopedias ; the New England style of grindcore practiced by Anal Cunt and Agoraphobic Nosebleed , with their comically hateful song titles and whiplash intensity ; the more punk - influenced New York scene of Discordance Axis and Brutal Truth ; and even a new generation of bands , typified by the excellent Genghis Tron and The Locust , which combine grindcore speed and power with spastic synth and electro .
In whatever guise grind comes calling , though , you ’ll know it by its blinding speed and the fanatic devotion of its listeners .
Finally , existing in the darkest recesses of the metal world , self - isolated and deliberately extreme and alienating , lies black metal .
Embracing without irony the most sinister stereotypes of heavy metal — corpsepaint , spiked leather , and an unabashed love of Satan — black - metal bands have also been the focus of incredible controversy abroad :
A few of their more rambunctious members in Germany and Scandinavia have been involved in church burnings and even murders .
Curiously , the black - metal genre is difficult to pin down , at least in a musical sense ; its founding fathers were in the British trio Venom , who introduced the ultra-violent Satanic lyrical imagery and the distinctive look ( as well as the over - the - top names for band members , now practically a black - metal prerequisite ) , but musically , they were in the NWOBHM tradition : hooky , mid-tempo metal that few today would categorize as “ extreme . ”
Later iterations of the style , starting with Bathory and moving along through bands like Mayhem and Marduk , maintained the imagery , but moved the musical style into a fast , intense form of death metal .
Later refinements took black metal even further away from a recognizable form of rock music : beginning with Sweden ’s Abruptum and progressing through today ’s French black - metal scene with bands like Antaeus , Spektr , and Blut Aus Nord , ambient black metal is becoming more commonplace , with rhythm sections vanishing entirely in favor of screaming guitars and creepy , evocative electronics .
The commitment to shock , blasphemy , and almost cartoonish evil has n’t changed , though .

The Essentials :
1. Black Sabbath , Paranoid ( 1970 )
If you do n’t have any Sabbath in your record collection , read no further — just go out and get the band ’s second album and listen to it all the way through .
If it does n’t convince you of the validity of metal as an art form , nothing will .
Any one of Sabbath ’s first four albums is a must - own , but Paranoid is probably the strongest overall collection of songs , from the unforgettable “ War Pigs ” to the impossibly heavy “ Iron Man ” to the jumpy “ Electric Funeral ” to the ridiculous — and ridiculously catchy — “ Fairies Wear Boots , ” it ’s a stone classic from beginning to end .

2. Iron Maiden , The Number Of The Beast ( 1982 )
Anyone who wants to know why the new wave of British heavy metal was such a big deal needs look no further than Iron Maiden ’s third album — and the first to feature vocalist Bruce Dickinson , whose voice is one of the all - time great instruments in rock ’ n ’ roll .
Half the songs on the album ( “ Invaders , ” “ The Prisoner , ” “ Run To The Hills , ” and the title track ) are instant classics .
Clive Burr will never get enough credit for his clever drumwork — he actually makes the drums the catchiest part of many a song — and guitarists Dave Murray and Adrian Smith do some of their best playing here .
Maiden ’s quality has varied over the years , but on this album , the group sounds like it could take over the world .

3. Slayer , Reign In Blood ( 1986 )
Producer Rick Rubin took liberties with Slayer ’s sound on its third album , and the group ’s members could n’t have been happier about it .
Kerry King ’s wailing guitars stood out like Christ crucified against the blinding speed of the songs , and Rubin wisely brought Dave Lombardo ’s astonishingly powerful drumming to the fore .
“ Angel Of Death ” is still eye - gogglingly great 20 years later , but there is n’t a dud track on the entire record .
The true birth of extreme metal , and by any estimation , a great leap forward for heavy music .

4. Death , Individual Thought Patterns ( 1993 )
Any number of great Florida death - metal bands could fill this slot — Cynic ’s Focus , Atheist ’s Unquestionable Presence , or Deicide ’s debut album were all fantastic records from around the same time — but those looking to get started in death metal might as well go with Chuck Schuldiner , the father of the whole scene .
Individual Thought Patterns finds him sharing the solos for the first time , which opens up Death ’s sound substantially and adds whole new levels of complexity to this most intricate of musical subgenres , and the rhythm section of bassist Steve DiGiorgio and drummer Gene Hoglan is one of the greatest team - ups in metal history .

5. Anaal Nathrakh , The Codex Necro ( 2001 )
Britain ’s dark master of extreme metal kicked off what has been an amazingly rich decade of metal music with this masterpiece .
Its last three records — Eschaton , Hell Is Empty And All The Devils Are Here , and In The Constellation Of The Black Widow — have all been terrific , but it ’s unlikely that it ’ll ever surpass the raw power , surprising eclecticism , and sheer sonic intensity of its debut album , an unprecedented mix of black metal , death metal , industrial , and grind .
Mick Kenney and Dave Hunt have n’t made a bad record yet , but they do n’t come much better than The Codex Necro .
Sheikh Issa bin Zayed al Nahyan , the prince from the UAE who made a video of himself brutally torturing a businessman with whom he had a dispute , has been implicated in 25 further video - recordings of other assaults .
In the leaked video , the prince sets fire to his victim 's testicles , sticks a cattle - prod up his anus , beats him with a board with a nail through it , scourges him with a whip , rubs salt into his wounds , and then runs over him repeatedly with a Mecedes SUV ( you can hear the bones break ) .
The UAE 's national firewall is blocking stories about this ( see the screengrab above ) .
I know that a number of US firms have supplied the UAE with firewall services —
I 'd be interested in any detail any Boing Boing reader has about the blocking shown above : did it come from a company that also supplies moral guardianship to western kids in their schools ?
" I have more than two hours of video footage showing Sheikh Issa 's involvement in the torture of more than 25 people , " wrote Texas - based lawyer Anthony Buzbee in a letter obtained by the Observer .
The news of more torture videos involving Issa is another huge blow to the international image of the UAE .
The oil - rich state has been keen to develop relations with wealthy western politicians , universities and corporations and to promote an aura of moderation and tolerance .
But the shocking video of Issa torturing Afghan grain merchant Mohammed Shah Poor , whom Issa said had cheated him in a business deal , has heavily dented the UAE 's reputation .
Particularly damaging was the apparent involvement of a policeman in the torture and the impunity with which Sheikh Issa could act , even after the tape emerged .
He is a senior prince related to powerful members of the ruling family in Abu Dhabi .
But now it appears the initial tape could just be the beginning of the problem .
The new tapes apparently also involve police officers taking part in Issa 's attacks , and some of his victims in the as - yet - unseen videos are believed to be Sudanese immigrants .

Why 911 ?
You show me one reporter , one commentator , one member of Congress who thought we should invade Afghanistan before September 11 and I 'll buy you dinner in the best restaurant in New York City . "

To be truthful about it , there was no way we could have got the public consent to have suddenly launched a campaign on Afghanistan but for what happened on September 11 .

Amazing Coincidences ...
Please read and understand everything I write before writing a response , too many times in the past I end up repeating myself several times in my thread .
If you need to , please read the thread several times before posting comments or questions .
Thanks .
Too often , as our society always does , we begin to divide ourselves against each other .
Though we often share the same goals , we continually let ourselves be divided and conquered .
And this is evident within the 911 movement .
The truth movement is continually divided so that it can easily be conquered through ridicule and false science .
Fellow members of the movement will argue endlessly about points that will likely never be proven either way , all while they let the goal of exposure slip away .
Always remember , there is only two sides here , you are one or the other .
You are either a person who does not believe the Official story , or you are a person that does believe the official story .
That is the ONLY thing that matters .
It does n't matter if you believe there was no planes , or that I believe that there was planes , if we both agree that the official story is nonsensical .
Through this division we are conquered , and we need to end that here , because we all have a common goal .
When responding to this thread , I want you to begin by making this distinction prior to any comments .
Either “ I believe the official story ( insert comment ) ” or , “ I do not believe the official story ( insert comment ) ” Many people seem to think that it is on the truth movement , to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that the Government was involved .
This is FALSE .
It is NOT on us to prove that , and it is definitely not possible for us to prove that entirely .
Through this false mind set , we limit ourselves from ever making any true headway .
Our only goal is to prove that it did not happen the way they said it did , and through that fact we can understand that they must have done it , because only the guilty must lie in explanation .
Short Anecdote : A young boy walks out of a store , the owner quickly catches up and feels the young man may have stolen some items .
He asks the boy “ do you mind emptying your pockets ? ” .
If the boy has not stolen anything , he would quickly empty his pockets confirming his innocence .
But , if the boy has stolen something , he will do whatever he possibly can to avoid a search .
So why the anecdote ?
Because it illustrates exactly what we DO need to prove in this movement .
We do n't need to know what the boy stole , or why the boy stole , we do n't even need to prove how he stole .
We just need to listen to him do everything possible to avoid that search , because even if you do n't know or cant prove all the variables , we still know based on his unwillingness to allow a search , and the fact that he is lying , prove his guilt .
In essence , I can't prove 100 % why the government conducted 911 , though I have some ideas .
Or exactly how , everything was accomplished , though I have some ideas .
But what can be proven is that their story does not add up , and because of that I know they are guilty , because if they were innocent their story would add up and they would have done everything in their power to divulge every piece of information .
It 's the unknown , and currently – unprovable , variables that are derailing this movement .
It 's why we still have people on this forum , who believe in a completely illogical and outright blasphemous version of events that day .
And with that view , they base their life , making decisions , building their perception , and influencing the way they act and interpret new information .
It is dangerous .
Because it 's through this ignorant perception , that people allow illogical and threatening laws to be passed , wars to be launched , people to be murdered , and countries destroyed .
We must use undisputed facts , inconsistencies in the official version , and highlight the astronomical coincidences to make our point.911 was a classic Problem , Reaction , Solution event .
To help illustrate this point , even before the Problem ( 911 ) was created , the Solution , had already been formulated .
Like the fact that " Game plan to remove al - Qaeda from the face of the Earth " is on Bush 's desk September 9th , 2001 .
This game plan includes invasion plans for Afghanistan .
Which “ coincidentally ” would be the first illegal war launched based solely on the fact that the Problem ( 911 ) was created .
The reaction to the problem , always allows the solution – no matter how ludicrous it may seem .
It 's time for people to understand that there are no coincidences in the grand scheme of this world .
Failing to understand that fact seriously limits your ability to evaluate the current state of your reality .
You are limiting your perception .
Especially since , these coincidences are absolutely astronomical .
A brief moment for another astronomical event .
If you think it is a coincidence that the English secret service , with a company of 1000 + officers , were conducting a terror drill based on a scenario in which the exact same targets , would be attacked at the exact same stations , at the exact same time , you are absolutely oblivious to reality .
That is an astronomical coincidence .
Through this Problem , they created a Reaction from the people , and implemented their Solution of expanded police state , and war on terrorism .
In the process , removing rights , destroying lives , and misleading the public .
Another Problem , Reaction , Solution ( PRS ) , event was Swine Flu .
I spoke out against it immediately , and stood fast while hysteria gripped this forum and our society .
What you were witnessing was the Reaction , to a Problem that the Media had created so that the powers could implement a solution .
We wont know exactly how devastating the vaccines are until 100's of millions have taken them , that will be this winter .
But , we can already see that the WHO has been granted sweeping powers , through the use of a media hyped “ Pandemic Level ” , and vaccine manufacturers have already been given Legal Immunity .
So that when people start showing up maimed , sick , dying or dead .
They have no legal recourse against toxic vaccines .
“ This is a 911 topic , why talk about swine flu ? ” Because it highlights the exact same scam that was used with 911 .
The solution , is always worse than the original problem .
But since their solution has been allowed due to peoples reaction , to a completely fabricated problem , it is acceptable .
Where as , prior to the problem , people would have never accepted the solution .
Is it a coincidence that the “ Pentagon Attack ” happened to hit the only section designed to take such a hit ?
Is it a coincidence that the hijacker , was so nice to go out of his way to attack that portion , rather than any other portion ?
Going so far as to execute almost an entire downward circle , to avoid all pentagon brass stationed directly on the opposite side of the building .
Just a coincidence ?
Is it a coincidence that 3 steel structured towers collapsed into themselves on 911 , yet it has never happened before or since ?
How does a fire , a jet , a bomb , or anything which compromises less than 10 % of a steel structure , some how cause a unilateral , complete systematic failure ?
Is it a coincidence that some how , for the first time in history that day , we had almost two entire planes vaporize ?
Such as in Shanksville or at the Pentagon .
It must be merely a coincidence , that these two planes practically disappeared .
And in the Pentagon attack , it is simply a coincidence that the wings did no damage to the exterior of the building , nor did the engines , before they were ' sucked ' into the building and vaporized .
Riiiight .
Is it a coincidence or simply amazing luck , that Silverstein purchased the WTC complex 6 weeks prior to 911
It is especially convenient , since purchasing the WTC's were theoretically the worst business move in history .
The towers were a black hole , that were only a burden .
It was losing money hand over fist , and the cost of needed renovations were staggering .
It would be cheaper to rebuild the towers , than to go through purchasing them .
It 's just a coincidence , that he profited to the tune of 4.5 billion dollars on a six week investment which cost him 14 million out of pocket .
Thus , it must also be coincidence , that he happened to miss a very important meeting in the World Trade Center that day due to his wife “ demanding ” he see his dermatologist .

How do “ unenlightened ” people know that they want to be “ enlightened ? ”
And how will they know when they have finally reached that point – that point that they cannot yet conceive or explain , yet have faith they will know it when it finally arises ?
But the concept of “ enlightenment ” becomes – in itself – an obstacle to overcome on the quest to what can be called enlightenment , but in itself has no inherit value or meaning .
For those that do believe in enlightenment , and who may also be on the path to find it , these fundamental questions may arise :
What does “ enlightenment ” mean to me ?
This is how enlightenment becomes a trap .
We fantasize – distract ourselves from the true fruits of life in search of a phantasm .
And one day , if we keep on our spiritual path , we will eventually have to let go of even these ideas about “ enlightenment , ” if we want to experience the truth , to see it through one ’s own mind .
For these reasons , one may find that there is nothing useful in his or her personal interpretation of “ enlightenment ” – no knowledge to be found that would guide one to where he or she wants to be .
If a spiritual concept is only causing further roadblocks , reject it and come back to it later ( or perhaps not at all ) – do n’t complicate it any further by intellectualizing it – this only wastes energy .
Enlightenment does not refer to a place where one wants to be – it is a place where one already is .
It is nowhere to be found .
It is nowhere to be discovered .
It is only here to be realized .
Enlightenment is not the end of the spiritual journey , nor is it the beginning .
It can be better characterized as a moment that is outside of human conception ( cannot be measured in the physical world , nor described in words ) – but it is real – because it can be sensed .
The “ feeling ” only is what it is .
And how that “ feeling ” causes us to behave , from that point forward , is how it is .
And that is all there is to it , there is no enlightenment ( quote unquote ) .
Most experience falls short of conception , and therefore it cannot be completely shared with others through language .
As the Polish - American scientist and philosopher Alfred Korzybski once said , “ the map is not the territory ” – in reference to the fact that all conceptions of the mind are abstractions and never encapsulate the thing that is wished to be described as it actually is ( yes , in the complete and utter empty Tao - sense of the word “ is ” ) .

“ When the heavenly gods created human beings , they kept everlasting life for themselves and gave us death .
So , Gilgamesh , accept your fate .
Each day , wash your head , bathe your body , and wear clothes that are sparkling fresh .
Fill your stomach with tasty food .

Delight in the pleasures that your wife brings you , and cherish the little child who holds your hand .
Make every day of your life a feast of rejoicing !
This is the task that the gods have set before all human beings .
This is the life you should seek , for this is the best life a mortal can hope to achieve . ”
The crisis may well determine the future path of the country
By Jim Muir
BBC News , former Tehran correspondent
The crisis in Iran has moved far beyond a dispute over election results .
It has turned into a struggle over the balance of power in the country , and Iran 's future orientation .
That balance is being fought over in a symbiotic struggle that is taking place both behind the political scenes and , through rival displays of people power , on the streets of Tehran and other cities .
It may have some way to run yet before it is resolved .
Neither side is giving way substantially , although the establishment has hinted at some possible minor concessions , while simultaneously cracking down on dissidents and trying to muzzle the foreign media .
Opposition supporters have repeatedly flouted interior ministry warnings and held massive , peaceful protests - often silent - to back their demand that last Friday 's presidential election be annulled and re-run .
Defence mechanisms
Their leader , the reformist candidate Mir Hossein Mousavi has vowed to keep up the civil disobedience campaign until his demand is met .
The leadership knows from its own experience combating the Shah that instruments of state power can be illusory when facing masses of the people
But he is clearly determined to avoid the kind of provocation and confrontation that could allow the establishment to dismiss the protesters as hooligans and vandals bent on wreaking havoc .
While there has been some violence and arrests , the authorities also seem keen to avoid a wholesale collision that could leave heavy casualties , making the situation even more reminiscent of the scenes and images that attended the 1979 revolution that brought them to power .
The Islamic leadership has not yet deployed a fraction of the defence mechanisms at its disposal .
It knows from its own experience combating the Shah that instruments of state power can be illusory when facing masses of the people .
Mir Hossein Mousavi has vowed to keep up his campaign
In past elections large numbers of the rank and file in the Revolutionary Guards and its auxiliary Basij militia were reported to have voted for reformist candidates .
If they were to be deployed against large numbers of protesters - who could include their own friends and relations - could they be depended on not to go to pieces ?
Even if neither side wants it , with passions running high and thousands taking to the streets every day , the risk of such an explosion being sparked on the ground by a random incident or by provocateurs is clearly there .
Faced with an unprecedented situation , the authorities have been putting out mixed signals .
Foreign media have been banned from reporting on the streets , mobile and internet services disrupted and websites warned against carrying " provocative " material .
Leading reformists have been taken from their homes and detained , including second - ranking but significant leaders such as the former Vice - President Mohammad Ali Abtahi , and Mustafa Tajzadeh , a former deputy interior minister who ran elections in President Mohammad Khatami 's days .
Also reported detained was Saeed Hajjarian , a reformist strategist whose near - fatal shooting after the 2000 general election marked the beginning of the hard - line comeback against the reformists in the Khatami era .
Behind the scenes
But even some right - wing papers , and the Iranian state broadcaster IRIB , have given some coverage to the supposedly illegal opposition rallies and marches , in a sense almost co-opting them .
The Guardians , no doubt gritting their teeth , might end up agreeing that the vote was flawed and should be repeated
Who 's who in Iran That could reflect inconsistency and confusion on the part of the establishment .
But it could also be a tactic aimed at absorbing the opposition so that it loses momentum with repetition .
In either case , if the situation goes on unresolved , Mr Mousavi and his supporters will have to find fresh ways of invigorating and escalating their campaign if it is not to risk running out of steam .
At the same time , the authorities face the risk that , if left unchecked , the dissidence could gain yet more momentum and spread in a bigger way to other cities , some of which are already reported to have been affected .
All these considerations and pressures will have been playing into the political contest that must be going on intensively behind the scenes at the core of the power system , over how to get out of the crisis .
Ayatollah Khamenei has called for poll complaints to be examined
In the eye of the storm is Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , who assumed the post in 1989 after the death of the Islamic Republic 's founder , Ayatollah Khomeini .
The man who became president that same year , and again in 1993 , Hashemi Rafsanjani , will now be trying to lobby the leader to meet the opposition 's demands .
A major pillar in the Islamic system from the beginning , Mr Rafsanjani is bitterly at odds with President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , who during the recent election campaign publicly accused him and his family of corruption .
Mr Rafsanjani has said nothing in public since the crisis began last Saturday , with the announcement of Mr Ahmadinejad 's surprisingly massive and bitterly disputed election victory .
But Mr Rafsanjani's politically active daughter , Faeza Hashemi , spoke on Tuesday at one of Mr Mousavi's " illegal " demonstrations , a clear indication of where the powerful family 's sympathies lie .
Mr Mousavi has also been lobbying the senior Islamic clerics in Qom and elsewhere who are an influential element in the system .
The key instrument that will reflect the outcome of the struggle is the Council of Guardians , the extremely conservative watchdog body that has to sign off on the election results within 10 days .
Ayatollah Khamenei has also asked it to examine and adjudicate the complaints lodged by all three of the losing candidates .
So far , the leader has mentioned only the possibility that some ballot boxes could be recounted if complaints are deemed valid .
That goes nowhere near meeting the opposition 's demands .
Years of contradictions
If the balance in the political struggle should tilt against Mr Ahmadinejad , the Guardians , no doubt gritting their teeth , might end up agreeing that the vote was flawed and should be repeated .
Mr Ahmadinejad has much support among the poor and the military
That may seem unlikely , and would go against the grain .
But if it should be deemed necessary for the system to survive , it would be done .
At stake is not just the political future of figures such as Mr Ahmadinejad and Mr Rafsanjani and others , but what face Iran presents to the world and to itself .
As Mohammad Khatami did before him , but with more resolve and political drive , Mr Mousavi has stimulated and harnessed the longing of millions of Iranians for reform and change , to become part of the modern world and the international community .
Mr Ahmadinejad 's appeal has been to the mass of the poor , and he has built a strong base among the military , the Revolutionary Guards and the Basij .
His critics fear he would turn Iran into a cross between medieval Islam and North Korean militarism - a highly conflictual course for a society as diverse and sophisticated as Iran's .
Years of contradictions have come to a head in the current crisis .
The Iranian leadership has in the past shown ingenuity and flexibility in facing serious challenges .
This is probably greater than any , and it goes to the heart of the system .
It is unlikely to be easily or quickly resolved .

ST . LOUIS ( AP ) — Sheriff Raymond M. Martin has been the law for nearly 20 years in a struggling southern Illinois county .
But federal prosecutors say he 's been breaking it lately by peddling pounds of pot , some seized by his own department , often in uniform and from his patrol vehicle .
Authorities on Monday led away a handcuffed Martin , 46 , from his small Shawneetown office after his arrest on federal drug trafficking charges accusing him of supplying a dealer he threatened to kill when that man said he wanted out .
The Gallatin County sheriff also allegedly pledged to use his authority to shut down rival drug traffickers .
Wow , you do n't hear a story like this everyday .
Oh wait , actually you do .
Thanks to the drug war , dramatic incidents of gratuitous police misconduct have become painfully typical :
For 20 years , this creep was the sheriff ?
Can you even imagine all the filthy things he 's done in that time ?
One of the many reasons the drug war fundamentally will never even begin to work is that you can't even trust the " good guys . "
I shudder to think how often the federal drug war dollars we pour into regional law enforcement end up accomplishing nothing other than to assist corrupt cops in cornering the local market .
The whole thing is such a colossal joke , it 's amazing that anyone would even bother to defend it anymore .
Just look at it .
How much more fraudulent and corrupt must this thing become before everyone understands what it is ?
NASA took the first concrete step toward returning human beings to the moon Thursday , successfully launching the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter on a mission to find the best place to land and build Earth ’s first off - world colony .
The 19 - story - high , two - stage rocket and spacecraft launched at 2:32 p.m. Pacific time .
As the huge first - stage Atlas V rocket roared to life at Cape Canaveral in central Florida , NASA spokesman George Diller called it “ America ’s first step in a lasting return to the moon . ”
The $ 500 - million orbiter will spend the next year cruising just 31 miles above the lunar surface , employing a suite of seven instruments to identify landing hazards such as rocks and craters .
It will be paying particular attention to the largely unknown lunar poles , where previous missions have picked up hints that water ice may exist in some permanently shadowed craters .

Locating water on the apparently desiccated moon would be a major discovery that would make permanent settlements much more feasible .
Water would not only be useful for drinking , but it would also be invaluable as a source of oxygen for respiration and rocket fuel .
Finding water is so important , in fact , that riding along with the orbiter is a second spacecraft that has no other job than to punch a hole in one of the polar craters , in hopes of sending a plume of ice and debris six miles above the lunar surface .
Although the relatively inexpensive $ 79 - million Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite is a minor part of the mission , the idea has captured the attention of the public , from amateur to professional astronomers .
Thousands of sky watchers are expected to turn their telescopes to the moon on the morning of Oct. 9 , when the water - seeking satellite steers the fuel - depleted second - stage Centaur rocket into a crater at 5,600 mph .

For those in the western United States , where the moon will still be up , the plume should be clearly visible with a moderately sized backyard telescope , NASA said .
“ For astronomers all over the United States , this is going to be a very exciting day , ” said John Marmie , deputy project manager for the Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite mission , which is managed by the Ames Research Center in Mountain View , Calif .
“ It ’s going to be a smashing success . ”
Everything appeared to go smoothly during the launch .
The only glitch was caused by a set of passing thunderstorms that prompted managers to call off the original 2:12 p.m. launch time .
The weather broke in time to pick up the countdown 20 minutes before the day ’s launch window would have closed .
About 45 minutes after liftoff , the orbiter separated from the rest of the spacecraft and entered a trajectory that will carry it to the moon in about four days .
At that point , it will use its on - board thrusters to settle into a polar orbit .

Among the instruments that will be used to make the most detailed map ever of the moon ’s topography is a set of lasers that will be bounced off the surface to create an image of lunar craters , hills and boulders .
A set of cameras will also take pictures capable of resolving details less than one yard across .
An instrument called Diviner , built by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in La Canada Flintridge , will make the first temperature map of the moon , plumbing recesses of shadowed polar craters , which can be as cold as minus 370 degrees Fahrenheit , and the equator , which can climb to 240 degrees under the sun ’s radiation .
Meanwhile , the ice - seeking satellite began steering itself into a giant four - month - long Earth orbit that will carry it past the moon three times as it lines up for the Oct. 9 crash into a crater at the south pole .
Satellite managers have not picked a target yet .
They are looking at a region known as the Cabeus system of craters , where previous spacecraft have detected the signature of large amounts of hydrogen , a key indicator of water .
Advertisement
Spacecraft controllers will not make a final crater selection until 30 days before impact , by which time the orbiter ’s instruments will have delivered enough data to help make the choice .
Most spacecraft separate from their rockets after the fuel is used up .
In this case , however , the satellite will remain attached to the 42 - foot - long Centaur shell as it lines up its target .
Nine hours before impact , the satellite will swing around so that the Centaur is being steered from behind as it heads for the crash point .
Once aimed at the proper crater , the satellite will sever its connection with the Centaur , sending it off alone for the last leg of its journey .
Advertisement
Then the satellite will use its own thrusters to slow itself down , creating a four - minute gap between the time the rocket shell and the satellite hit the moon .
That will allow enough time for the plume of debris to rise high enough so the satellite can fly through it , taking measurements and looking for evidence of water , before it also crashes , about one mile away from the Centaur impact .
“ The launch was spectacular ; we are on our way to the moon , ” said Jennifer Heldmann , a satellite research scientist at NASA who manages the outreach campaign that will allow professional astronomers and students around the world to share in the observation of the impact .
About two dozen observatories , and the Hubble Space Telescope in orbit , will be watching the crash .
Advertisement
On the ground , the impact should be observable from Mississippi in the east to Hawaii in the west .
The next landing of humans on the moon is not expected until 2020 .
But even that could be delayed or reversed depending on an ongoing review by the Obama administration .

The Central Intelligence Agency withheld information about a secret counterterrorism program from Congress for eight years on direct orders from former Vice President Dick Cheney , the agency ’s director , Leon E. Panetta , has told the Senate and House intelligence committees , two people with direct knowledge of the matter said Saturday .
The report that Mr. Cheney was behind the decision to conceal the still - unidentified program from Congress deepened the mystery surrounding it , suggesting that the Bush administration had put a high priority on the program and its secrecy .
Mr. Panetta , who ended the program when he first learned of its existence from subordinates on June 23 , briefed the two intelligence committees about it in separate closed sessions the next day .
Efforts to reach Mr. Cheney through relatives and associates were unsuccessful .
The question of how completely the C.I.A. informed Congress about sensitive programs has been hotly disputed by Democrats and Republicans since May , when Speaker Nancy Pelosi accused the agency of failing to reveal in 2002 that it was waterboarding a terrorism suspect , a claim Mr. Panetta rejected .

Requires Reliance On Flawed Watch Lists And Fails To Protect Humanitarian Assistance Organizations
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT : ( 202 ) 675-2312 ; media@dcaclu.org
WASHINGTON – Yesterday the House of Representatives passed flawed immigration legislation that would prevent some innocent Americans from returning to their home country and would fail to protect U.S. humanitarian relief providers from criminal prosecution for human smuggling and harboring .
The American Civil Liberties Union calls on the Senate to correct this problematic legislation before moving it forward .
The Alien Smuggling and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2009 , H.R. 1029 , aims to combat human smuggling into the United States by checking all persons entering the country against the error - filled terrorist watch lists .
It also revises smuggling and related criminal laws such as providing “ material support . ”
“ Combating human smuggling to prevent terrorists from entering the United States is an important goal , but this bill goes about it the wrong way by harming humanitarian aide providers as well as Americans who are erroneously on the watch lists , ” said Caroline Fredrickson , Director of the ACLU Washington Legislative Office .
“ The watch lists are riddled with errors , and until they are fixed , we ca n’t rely on them to identify terrorists .
Instead , the lists harm innocent Americans , as does failing to extend immunity to charitable organizations that provide medical assistance and food to the least fortunate . ”
As voted on by the House , the legislation has two significant problems that must be addressed by the Senate .
This bill would for the first time create a statutory requirement to check an individual ’s identification against bloated and error - filled terrorist watch lists .
The lists are filled with the names of many innocent Americans , and provide no real opportunity for those Americans to get their names taken off .
For the watch lists to be effective for this and other purposes , they must be scrubbed regularly for errors .
The House bill also failed to protect humanitarian assistance organizations from being criminally prosecuted for human smuggling and harboring , even though current law applies such an exemption to many religious organizations .
Every day around the country , domestic violence shelters , health clinics , and soup kitchens provide emergency relief to people in distress .
For people lacking lawful status , there is often nowhere else to turn for help .
Humanitarian relief organizations should not be criminally prosecuted for aiding domestic violence victims and people in distress .

IF asked to identify the intellectual founder of their discipline , most economists today would probably cite Adam Smith .
But that will change .
Economists ’ forecasts generally are n’t worth much , but I ’ll offer one that even my youngest colleagues wo n’t survive to refute :
If we posed the same question 100 years from now , most economists would instead cite Charles Darwin .
Darwin , renowned for the theory of evolution , was a naturalist , not an economist , and his view of the competitive struggle was different from Smith ’s in subtle but profound ways .
Growing evidence suggests that Darwin ’s view tracks economic reality much more closely .
Smith is celebrated for his “ invisible hand ” theory , which holds that when greedy people trade for their own advantage in unfettered private markets , they will often be led , as if by an invisible hand , to produce the greatest good for all .
The invisible hand remains a powerful narrative , but after the recent economic wreckage , skepticism about it has grown .
My prediction is that it will eventually be supplanted by a version of Darwin ’s more general narrative  one that grants the invisible hand its due , but also strips it of the sweeping powers that many now ascribe to it .
Smith ’s basic idea was that business owners seeking to lure customers away from rivals have powerful incentives to introduce improved product designs and cost - saving innovations .
These moves bolster innovators ’ profits in the short term .
But rivals respond by adopting the same innovations , and the resulting competition gradually drives down prices and profits .
In the end , Smith argued , consumers reap all the gains .

More than two out of five U.S. credit cardholders report getting whacked by negative changes to their accounts in the past 12 months , according to a new CreditCards.com poll .
The survey comes amid rising criticism of banks for raising interest rates and fees and slashing credit limits on millions of accounts in the months just before a tough new credit card law takes effect .
Did you get whacked ?
Or wooed ?
More than two in every five credit cardholders report some negative action has been taken against them in the past year — but others are getting rewarded with increased credit limits .

The scientific telephone poll , conducted June 26 - 28 , 2009 , on behalf of CreditCards.com by GfK Roper , also highlights a less - talked - about aspect of the current credit crunch : A select few credit card users with high incomes are getting higher — not lower — credit limits as banks compete to win over high - end borrowers .
“ It is common for issuers to lower limits and / or raise fees and APRs on the weakest of their FICO - scored cardholders , and at the same time raise credit limits on the best FICO - scored customers , those with stellar usage and repayment histories ( say , 760 FICO + ) , ” Robert Hammer of R.K. Hammer Investment Bankers , a California card industry consultant , writes in an e-mail .
“ It is , as one might suspect , a very delicate balancing act . ”
That balancing act — of giving to some while taking away credit from others — may be the reason one in three cardholders in the survey say they have actually gotten increases in their credit limits over the past 12 months .
Credit industry analysts say those contrasts are likely to grow as the credit card industry looks to develop a new and profitable business model in the upcoming era of credit card regulation .
Poll results
The poll contacted 1,004 adults through random - digit dialing ( see poll methodology . )
Of the total sample , 824 had credit cards .
The poll asked respondents with credit cards if any of a number of changes in terms had happened to them in the past 12 months .
Getting an increase in their credit limits tops the list ( 33 percent ) , followed closely by negative changes such as getting an interest rate ( APR ) increase ( 30 percent ) and having a credit card limit lowered ( 14 percent ) .
Other changes include being switched to a variable rate card ( 11 percent ) , being offered an incentive to close a card account ( 8 percent ) and being asked to submit a pay stub or tax return in order to qualify for a credit card ( 4 percent ) .
Other results include :
More than two in every five cardholders ( 42 percent ) reported some negative change in their credit card accounts .
Cardholders reporting credit limit increases were disproportionately higher wage earners .
More than two out of five ( 42 percent ) of people earning $ 50,000 a year or more say their limits were increased and 40 percent of people earning $ 75,000 or more a year report increased credit limits in the past 12 months .
The lower - wage earners had less success : Only 19 percent of cardholders making $ 30,000 to $ 39,999 a year said their limits were increased .
Nearly 40 percent of respondents with credit cards say they do not know or had no response to whether they had seen changes in their credit card accounts .
All of the major credit card issuers have engaged in one or more of the practices cited in the poll .
Annual fees and hiked balance transfer and foreign transaction fees are also hitting millions of credit cardholders .
Equifax , one of the Big 3 consumer credit reporting agencies , recently revealed that average credit limits declined 3 percent to $ 4,594 in 2009 from $ 4,747 the year before .
New credit card issuance dropped 38 percent during the first four months of 2009 compared to the same time period in 2008 , according to Equifax data .
Citi offered cardholders up to $ 550 in bonuses if they reduced their credit limits and agreed to stop using their cards for up 11 months .
American Express had a similar strategy — offering $ 300 in gift cards to entice certain users to pay their balances off in full and close their accounts by April 30 .
Other issuers shut customers off by closing unused or dormant accounts .
Amex also began a policy of requesting pay stubs and income tax returns as proof that cardholders have sufficient income to pay their charge card bills .
Fixed no more
Bank of America and Chase are both shifting large numbers of cardholders from fixed - rate accounts to variable rates tied to an index or prime rate plus a fixed rate ( known as a margin ) of , for example , 8.99 percent .
Discover has also notified some of its customers they would be switched to variable rate accounts .
Other card issuers are likely to follow .
The reason : Come February 2010 , when major provisions of the Credit CARD
Act of 2009 take effect , credit card companies will be limited in when they can increase interest rates on existing balances .
According to the new law , one of the acceptable ways to jack up rates on existing credit card balances is when accounts have variable APRs .
The move from fixed rate to variable APRs may not affect many consumers now — because the prime rate is at a historically low 3.25 percent ( as of July 28 , 2009 ) .
When the prime rate begins to rise again , credit card issuers will be able to pass the increase on to consumers with variable rate accounts — regardless of the card users ’ payment history .
Upping the minimum payments
Chase announced that starting in August , minimum monthly payment amounts would increase from 2 percent to 5 percent on some accounts .
For example , a person who owes $ 5,000 on a credit card and was paying $ 100 as the minimum would have to pay at least $ 250 a month in order to avoid additional fees and keep the account in good standing .
“ Many cardholders were already living on the financial edge , struggling to make their minimum payments each month .
More than doubling the minimum payment has literally pushed many over the edge , ” according to Gail Cunningham , spokeswoman for the National Foundation for Credit Counseling ( NFCC ) , a national association of nonprofit credit counselors .
Cunningham suggests cardholders negotiate with their card issuers : “ The first thing the consumer should do is find out why the bank imposed this change to his account .
If there ’s been a sketchy pay history , then he does n’t have a leg to stand on .
However , if he ’s been a longtime customer with a good pay history , I suggest building my case with the bank , proving that I ’m just the type of customer they want to have . ”
Hammer , the card industry consultant , notes that many banks are weighing their options on how to handle these customers .
“ Banks must necessarily walk a pretty narrow tightrope , ” according to Hammer .
“ Earning enough on the bad accounts , many of whom will go to charge - off , with offering enough value at the right price points to attract and retain the better customers .
You can not chase away all your accounts and stay in business very long . ”
Giving and taking away
Representatives of several major credit card issuers contacted by CreditCards.com confirm that they are increasing and decreasing interest rates and credit limits as warranted by customers ’ credit records .
Chase spokeswoman Stephanie Jacobson says via e-mail : “ As a standard operating practice , Chase is continuously evaluating whether our customers ’ credit lines are most appropriate for the customer and his or her needs , and will make adjustments accordingly .
For example , we will lower credit lines for customers who are showing signs of increased risk or inactivity , and we may raise lines for our most creditworthy customers . ”
Jacobson reports that over the past 12 months Chase has :
Opened more than 1 million new credit card accounts each month for a total of more than 14 million customers .
Extended an average of more than $ 6 billion in new credit each month .
Increased the credit lines of more than 500,000 customers a month .
Citi , which has been under fire for raising interest rates on millions of accounts , conducts periodic reviews of accounts , according to spokesman Sam Wang : “ We have adjusted pricing and card terms for some customers as part of our regular account reviews .
This is an ongoing process to ensure we offer terms , interest rates , credit lines and products based on individual needs and risk profiles .
These changes also reflect the dramatically higher cost of doing business in our industry as we work to preserve the broad availability of credit . ”
Interest rate hikes
It ’s no secret that credit card lenders are tightening lending standards and dramatically cutting back on card lending — even to customers who pay their bills on time each month .
Many of the major banks have cited increased risk and uncertainty over the bad economy as reasons for many of the changes .
Members of Congress — who passed tough credit card reforms in May — are now bristling over interest rate hikes they say are designed to squeeze more profits from consumers before the new law takes effect .
U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York asked the Federal Reserve to use its emergency powers to halt the current spate of interest rate hikes .
Sen . Christopher Dodd , chairman of the Senate Banking Committee , also asked regulators to intervene and force banks to begin early implementation of a provision of the Credit CARD Act .
Dodd wants card issuers to review interest rate increases dating back to Jan. 1 , 2009 , and , if warranted , lower APRs .
Under the new law , a requirement for six - month reviews of accounts does not take effect until August 2010 .
Regulators must issue guidelines on how card issuers should implement the APR reviews .
According to a Fed spokeswoman , regulators have not released a response to the senators ’ requests .
Cunningham , from the credit counseling association , notes that the poll did not indicate why credit limits were increased for respondents .
“ I wonder if they requested it , or if the bank simply increased it , ” Cunningham says .
“ If a person requests an increase , it could indicate they need more access to credit , thus are in a financial bind .
If the bank independently increased it , then they were using this as a tool to encourage the consumer to spend more .
Presumably the bank thought the individual could responsibly handle the increase .
Either way , the consumer needs to be prudent when using his credit card , not charging more than 30 percent of the available credit , and paying the balance in full when the bill arrives . ”
Poll methodology
The survey was conducted from June 26 - 28 , 2009 , by GfK Roper Public Affairs & Media on behalf of CreditCards.com .
Random digit dialing phone interviews were completed with 1,004 adults aged 18 .
The raw data were then weighted by a custom designed computer program that automatically developed a weighting factor for each respondent , employing five variables : age , sex , education , race and geographic region .
The survey had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points on the full sample , and plus or minus 4 points on the subsample of credit cardholders .

A new malware worm that targets Google fans and uses Javascript to attack computers through vulnerabilities in Adobe PDF reader and Flash player is on the loose .
According to SophosLabs , the virus known as JSRedir - R blows all other web - based malware out of the water .
JSRedir - R accounted for 42 per cent of all malicious infections found on websites in a one week period .
The malware , also known as ' Gumblar , ' infected a new page every 4.5 seconds .

Infected Redirected via Google Result Pages
Google users are redirected to other sites that download more malware onto the user 's computer and can also allow criminals to steal password details .
In addition , the malware sniffs FTP credentials ( if found ) , which are then used to compromise any websites owned by the victim .
The malware infects user machines , causing the redirection to occur locally .
Once a machine is infected , any site managed by the victim can be targeted .
The worm is believed to draw its code from a China - based website .
Traditional Detection Methods Ineffective
According to Mary Landesman , senior security researcher at ScanSafe , detection through traditional methods such as signature detection and blacklisting are not effective due to the complexity of the Gumblar compromises .
It appears to be more sophisticated than other malware .

Have you ever wondered why you get the errors Execute permission denied or The parameter list is too long ?
These are just a few of the common errors UNIX and Linux novices receive that they may not know how to avoid .
This article explains such errors and provides workarounds and resolutions to these and other errors that may crop up .
./foo : 0403-006
Execute permission denied .
So , you have written or perhaps downloaded a new shell script , and you are itching to try it out .
That sounds great , but when you attempt to execute the command , you get the error message ./ foo : 0403-006 Execute permission denied .
Now what ?
The message may stem from a couple of possible problems :
You do not have adequate permissions to execute the command .
You do not have adequate permissions to the shell you defined inside the script to tell the script how it and the commands inside it should be interpreted .
You do not have adequate permissions to execute the command
The easiest way to verify your permissions is to view who you are logged on to the server as , then look at the output of ls –l :
#id uid=5008 ( cormany ) gid=330 ( atc ) groups =110 ( sales ) , 201 ( sshd ) #ls ‑l foo ‑rwxrw‑r‑ ‑ 1 cormany atc 75 Jun 10 18:46 foo Show more
Show more icon
According to the above example , you are logged in as user cormany , and the shell script ’s owner is cormany with permissions rwx ( or Read , Write , and Execute ) .
This does not appear to be the issue , so let ’s move on to the next possible cause .
You do not have adequate permissions to the shell you defined inside the script to tell the script how it and the commands inside it should be interpreted
Let ’s take a look inside the script :
#cat foo #!/bin/ksh.new echo " This is a just a test " exit 0 Show more Show more icon
It looks like the script is to be interpreted as a Korn shell script , according to the first line .
By looking at the permissions of the shell used , you can verify that you can actually use it :
#ls –l /bin/ksh.new ‑r‑xr‑x‑‑‑ 5 bin bin 289072 May 27 19:03 /bin/ksh.new

As root , correct the file permissions to the shell you attempted to use , and try again :
Switch users to root : # su ‑ root 's Password : Show more

This is a just a test Show more Show more icon
Voila !
The problem has been solved !
ksh : bar : not found .
You have written another script and named it bar in the ~cormany / scripts directory .
The script works perfectly when executing it providing the full path or from the present working directory ( ~ cormany / scripts ) , but for some reason , it will not work when you ’re working from another directory and just typing the script name :
# pwd /home / cormany / scripts #/home / cormany / scripts /bar
This is another test #./ bar
This is another test #cd # pwd / home / cormany # barksh : bar : not found .
Show more
Show more icon
Everything worked perfectly except for when you change directories and try to execute the script .
There are typically three reasons for such an error message :
You do not have permissions to the file you are trying to execute .
The file simply does not exist or is not in the directory you think it should be in .
The file exists and is in the expected location , and you have sufficient permissions to the file .
You do not have permissions to the file you are trying to execute
You know that this is not issue , as you were able to execute the script by providing the fully qualified path as well as from the commands directory .
A simple check on the file permissions should help you discover the cause of the problem :
#ls ‑la ~cormany / scripts total 56 drwxr‑xr‑x 2 cormany atc 512 Jun 12 08:30 .
drwxr‑xr‑x 6 cormany atc 512 Jun 10 08:21 .. ‑rwxr‑xr‑x 1 cormany atc 42 Sep 06 16:20 amdc ‑rw‑rw‑rw‑ 1 cormany atc 154 Jan 27 23:23 atc ‑rwxr‑xr‑x 1 cormany atc 206 Aug 04 20:57 atc.2 ‑rwxr‑xr‑x 1 cormany atc 48 Jun 12 08:21 bar ‑rwxr‑xr‑x 1 cormany atc 87 Feb 22 16:11 pac
Show more
Show more icon
Executing on a command such as ~cormany / scripts / atc would fail , as the file only has Read and Write permission for user , group , and other .
Simply adjusting the permissions to include Execute would resolve this problem .
If there is another command in a different directory that will not execute — for example , ~ cormany / scripts.old / cujo— check the permissions of that file , also :
#ls ‑l ~cormany / other_scripts /cujo ls : 0653‑345 /home/cormany/other_scripts/cujo : Permission denied .
Show more
Show more icon
At first glance , you do not even have Read permission .
Let ’s dive into the target directory and see what is going on :
#cd ~cormany / scripts.old/cujo ksh : /home/cormany/other_scripts : Permission denied .
#ls ‑l ~cormany / scripts.old/cujo ls : /home/cormany/scripts.old :
The file access permissions do not allow the specified action .
total 0 Show more
Show more icon
What just happened here ?
This is yet another form of permission error .
The permissions problem may not always be on the file itself but a directory in the path to the file to be executed :
#ls ‑ld ~cormany / scripts.old d‑‑‑‑‑‑‑‑‑ 2 cormany atc 512 Jan 22 08:42 /home/cormany/scripts.old
Show more
Show more icon
Fixing the permissions on the directory path should resolve your execution issues as long as the file in question also has adequate permissions :
#chmod 755 ~ cormany / other_scripts #cd ~cormany / other_scripts #ls –l cujo ‑rwxr‑xr‑x 1 cormany atc 48 Jan 26 08:21 cujo Show more
Show more icon
Now , back to the original problem with ~cormany / scripts / bar .
The file simply does not exist or is not in the directory you think it should be in
Again , using the command ls to perform a quick spot check should show whether the file is there :
#ls ‑l ~cormany / scripts / bar ‑rwxr‑xr‑x 1 cormany atc 48 Oct 05 08:21 /home/ cormany / scripts /bar
Show more
Show more icon
If the file did not exist in the directory you originally thought , you would receive the following message :
#ls ‑l ~cormany / scripts / bar ls : 0653‑341
The file / home / cormany / scripts / bar does not exist .
Show more
Show more icon
If you think the file is somewhere in user cormany ’s home directory , you could ( provided you had ample permissions ) search for the file with the find command :
# find ~cormany ‑name " bar " ‑ls 16409 1 ‑rwxr‑xr‑x 1 cormany atc 48 Sep 06 08:06 /home/ cormany /atc / bar 590040 1 ‑rwxr‑xr‑x 1 cormany atc 48 Sep 09 08:42 /home/cormany/test/ bar
Show more
Show more icon
The file exists and is in the expected location , and you have sufficient permissions to the file
The previous methods of execution have been either supplying the fully qualified path to the command in question or sitting directly in the files directory and entering the present working directory to execute ( that is , using ./ ) .
Now that you are not in the commands directory and are not entering the full path , let ’s check the value of the PATH environment variable :
#echo $ {PATH} /usr / bin:/etc:/usr/sbin:/usr/ucb:/bin:/usr/bin/X11:/sbin:/usr/
java5/jre/bin:/usr/java5/bin:/usr/ushare/bin:/usr/local/bin
Show more
Show more icon
Aha !
The directory / home / cormany / scripts is not in your path .
Again , there are two things you could do to fix this problem :
Add ~cormany / scripts to your PATH .
Although this change may be easy to make , please keep in mind that every time you add a directory to your PATH variable , you are requesting that the shell search through yet another directory for a command .
If you add 10 directories over time , that adds 10 more directories for the shell to search until it returns results that it could not find a file .
If you still want to continue , simply perform the following commands : #export PATH=$ {PATH}:/home/cormany/scripts #echo $ PATH /usr / bin:/etc:/usr/sbin:/usr/ucb:/bin:/usr/bin/X11:/sbin:/usr/
java5/jre/bin:/usr/java5/bin:/usr/ushare/bin:/usr/local/bin:/ home/cormany/scripts
Show more
Show more icon Note :
It is rarely wise to add the path to the beginning of the user ’s PATH variable .
Doing so could result in the execution of unwanted commands .
If you feel you must place a path at the beginning , proceed with caution .

Move ( or copy ) the script in question to a directory already in your PATH variable .
This can be a good solution if multiple users could benefit from the script .
If this is the case , users typically place their files in /usr / local / bin .
ls : 0653 -341
The file .
does not exist .
You are working in a directory named ~ cormany / scripts .
All of a sudden , none of the scripts in the directory can be found , and you get a strange message that the present working directory no longer exists :
# ls ‑l total 40 ‑rwxr‑xr‑x 1 cormany atc 42 Sep 06 16:20 amdc ‑rw‑rw‑rw‑ 1 cormany atc 154 Jan 27 23:23 atc ‑rwxr‑xr‑x 1 cormany atc 206 Aug 04 20:57 atc.2 ‑rwxr‑xr‑x 1 cormany atc 48 Jun 12 08:21 bar ‑rwxr‑xr‑x 1 cormany atc 87 Feb 22 16:11 pac #./ bar
This is another test #pwd / home / cormany / scripts #./ barksh : ./ bar : not found .
#ls ‑l ls : 0653‑341
The file .
does not exist .

When something like this happens , it means the directory you were once working in has been destroyed via the command rm .
Simply creating a new directory with the same name will not correct this problem , as the file descriptor is different .
More times than not , the person afflicted with this error is the same person who caused it in another window ( at least , in my case ) .
To safeguard against such accidents , rename the directory via the mv command .
By renaming the directory , the users in the original directory can continue to work in a different directory name , as the file descriptor remains the same :
# ls ‑l total 40 ‑rwxr‑xr‑x 1 cormany atc 42 Sep 06 16:20 amdc ‑rw‑rw‑rw‑ 1 cormany atc 154 Jan 27 23:23 atc ‑rwxr‑xr‑x 1 cormany atc 206 Aug 04 20:57 atc.2 ‑rwxr‑xr‑x 1 cormany atc 48 Jun 12 08:21 bar ‑rwxr‑xr‑x 1 cormany atc 87 Feb 22 16:11 pac #./ bar
This is another test #pwd / home / cormany / scripts Show more Show more icon
Similarly , in another session , someone renames the directory you are working in to ~cormany / scripts.20090601 .
Thankfully , by just moving and renaming the directory , your work continues without issue :
#./bar
This is another test #pwd /home / cormany / scripts .20090601

./foo : /usr/bin/ls : 0403-027
The parameter list is too long .
A program has been running for months on your IBM ® AIX ® computer without issue .
But while the program is running , it creates a file every few minutes in the same directory for logging .
The file names begin with f. and e. .
The directory is becoming full , and the ls command is slowing down drastically on response time .
That is understandable , because the directory has so many files in it .
A few more months go by , and the AIX program continues to run consistently and without problem .
There are now 100,000 files that begin with f. and another 100,000 files that begin with e.
Now , when you attempt to clean up the log directory of only the files that begin with f. , you receive the following message :
#rm ~ cormany / logs / f.∗ ksh : /usr/bin/rm : 0403‑027
The parameter list is too long .
Show more
Show more icon
I guess you waited too long before cleaning up the files .
No time like the present , however .
When executing a command like delete , all arguments are validated and expanded before execution .
The example provided is looking for ~ cormany / logs / f.* , which expands to become 100,000 arguments to the command rm .
In other words , instead of rm ~ cormany / logs / f.* , what is actually being executed is rm ~cormany / logs / f.1 ~cormany / logs/f.2 ~cormany /logs/f.3 … ~ cormany / logs/f.100000 .
AIX , like other UNIX and Linux operating systems , has a set size for the number of command - line arguments and environment variables that can be used .
To view the set size in AIX , use the command getconf .
Per the man page for getconf , you should look at ARG_MAX :
#man getconf … ARG_MAX Maximum length , in bytes , of the arguments for one of the exec subroutines , including environment data .
… # getconf ARG_MAX 1048576
Show more
Show more icon
This value tells you that you have 1,048,576 bytes you can use for environment variables and command - line arguments to execute .
It looks like you exceeded that .
To resolve this issue , two options are available :
Increase the amount via smitty chgsys and change ARG / ENV list size in 4 K byte blocks or via chdev .
I do not recommend changing a system - wide parameter every time you run into this type of error out of convenience :
This should be the last resort .
and change or via .
I do not recommend changing a system - wide parameter every time you run into this type of error out of convenience :
This should be the last resort .
Rather than using the command rm with 100,000 arguments , which will fail miserably , the command find does a much better job of removing the files : # find ~cormany / logs –name “ f.∗ ” –exec rm {} \ ; Show more
Show more icon find command searches the directory for any files beginning with f. rather than placing the burden on the shell ’s command line .
The find command then executes rm on each file found , thus removing every file beginning with f .
Conclusion
After reading this article , you should have a better understanding of those common errors you may have come across and how to resolve the problem quickly .
The errors may look simple , but when being introduced to UNIX , it is essential that you understand the basic errors before moving ahead .
Good luck on your troubleshooting !
Mandalor And His Merry Men
by David ' Hades ' Becker [ Wednesday , 8th of July 2009 - 05:28 PM ]
Looks like Lucas Arts and BioWare are starting the campaign to get us all amped for The Old Republic .
As they have just placed out a video clip telling the background of the Mandalorians , via a Jedi Star Log and animatics .
Telling of their rise and fall and what has become of them currently , also kind of why they have become the bounty hunters that we all know and love from the Star Wars Universe .
I have a feeling that we will have more of these in the coming weeks , and most likely covering everything else you can play or kill in The Old Republic .
We 'll keep you up to date as we get these videos in .
But for now , revel in the story of the Mandalorians below .
Newspapers ' Plan For Survival : Charge Money , Beat Up On Craigslist And Keep Repeating To Ourselves That We 're Needed
from the good - luck - with - that dept
Imagine you 're a young business school graduate trying to decide where you want to start your career .
( OK , I know there are no jobs , but imagine it anyway . )
You attend a newspaper industry summit and hear one of the big ideas from an organization at the heart of this world is to compete with Craigslist .
What do you think you would think ?
Talk about an industry looking in the rear view mirror .
Is n't that an idea that might have had legs , oh , maybe five years ago ?
How could it represent in the eyes of that young business school graduate any kind of exciting opportunity today ?
The advice boils down to , " Let 's win back our business from the guy who 's eating our lunch . "
How is the newspaper industry going to attract any of the best and brightest into its ranks if its ideas are stale , at best ?
What might even be more troubling about this proposal is how newspaper people seemed to denigrate the Craigslist brand , when all they need to do is talk to people -- including in their own buildings -- to find out that most of those who 've used the site seem to genuinely value it .
Why ?
Because it gets results and it's free .
Of course leaders should always be learning .
That 's a given .
But are they serious ?
Is n't this a little late ?
If newspaper industry leaders are n't doing this already , do they really belong in their positions ?
Why should shareholders pay executives to learn all they can when they should be able to find ones who already know what they 're doing ?
If people need advice like this , should they be running newspaper companies ?

There 's been plenty of coverage about the potentially antitrust - violating meeting of newspaper execs in Chicago recently , and late last week reports came out about some of the recommendations put forth by the American Press Institute at that meeting .
The API apparently handed out two whitepapers , both of which are amusing , only in that someone actually thinks they 're useful .
The first was effectively saying : " Craigslist really sucks , so let 's try to beat up on Craigslist . "
The second , more thorough whitepaper , rehashes a bunch of debunked ideas about how newspapers should lock up their content in order to charge for it , including such gems as : " Establish that news content online has value by charging for it . "
Apparently someone at the API is unfamiliar with the difference between price and value .
You do n't establish value by putting a price on things .
You are able to put a higher price on things by .
But the industry is n't looking to do that .
It 's looking to pretend its content has value , by locking it up .
Unfortunately for the newspapers ( but good for everyone else ) , economics does n't work that way .
Apparently part of the plan to get around anti-trust issues is to create an intermediary , sort of like an ASCAP for the newspaper industry , which suggests a near total misunderstanding of the differences between news and music -- but if that 's where the industry wants to go , why not let them and watch smarter business folks mop up the mess for profit .
In the meantime , an absolutely fantastic teardown of the API 's whitepapers comes from John Temple , the former editor , president and publisher of the now defunct Rocky Mountain News .
If anyone were susceptible to the backwards looking " let 's try to recreate the way things were " argument , you would think it would be him .
But , instead , he responds to the API 's reports by describing just how backwards looking it is and why it should scare anyone in the news business : Temple also points out two big problems with the API 's suggestions .
The first is that it 's suddenly trying to get people to pay for what they 're used to getting for free -- without adding any additional value worth paying for .
And , the second ( though related ) is that they 're not actually looking to do anything really new or unique to embrace what the internet enables .
While plenty of other websites and services are embracing the technological power of the internet , the best this report suggests is " people who work at newspapers should start experimenting with social networks " :
All in all , the meeting itself , and the recommendations from the API certainly show an industry that 's not looking to compete or add value .
It 's looking for ways to rebuild the walls that let it exist without competition in the past .
It 's a recipe for suicide .

10 Incredible Eatable Artwork Examples
Food art , not to be confused with the culinary arts , requires the use of food as the main component of an artistic creation .
Over the years , this unique form of expression has proven an ever - expanding enterprise , incorporating candy , vegetables and fruits in various colors , shapes and sizes .
Including everything from Larry Kingâ€™s likeness done with Jelly Belly beans to a recreation of Van Goghâ€™s self - portrait using leeks , the artwork below is sure to whet your appetiteâ€ ” for art , dinner or maybe even both .
Lotus Leaf
Rendered in canned goods
The structure above , created in 2005 by Platt Byard Dovell White Architects LLP , is made from 5,000 cans of sliced bamboo shoots and stuffed vine leaves .
Itâ€™s one of several works to come out of Canstructionâ€ ” a trademark charity event and design / build competition under the auspices of the Society for Design Administration .
The challenge ?
To build large structures made of unopened food cans , which are later donated to city - registered food banks .
President Barack Obama
Rendered in cereal
This mosaic of President Barack Obama , created by Hank Willis Thomas and Ryan Alexiev of CerealArt.com , showcases a slew of sugary cereals including Honeycomb , Life and Froot Loops .
The company , which is inspired by 3D visual art and consumer culture , wanted to make a commentary about the presidentâ€™s iconic and commercial appeal , much in line with Thomasâ€ ™ other work , which typically deals with the complex issues of race , identity , class and history in the age of consumerism .
â€ œSelf - Portrait with Grey Felt Hatâ€
Rendered in leeks
The above artwork , inspired by one of Vincent van Goghâ€™s many self - portraits , was displayed at the Paris - Beijing Photo Gallery from November 23 , 2008 to January 22 , 2009 as part of Chinese artist Ju Duoqiâ€™s exhibit titled The Vegetable Museum .
In the series , Duoqi recreates Western masterpieces using common Chinese cuisine ingredientsâ€ ” including tofu , cabbage , ginger , lotus roots , coriander and sweet potatoâ € ” then photographs them for gallery and museum showings .
Landscape
Rendered in bread and cheese
Created by London - based photographer Carl Warner , this food - scape is one of many images in a series that features foodie creations , such as pea pod boats , strawberry hot air balloons , salmon seas and Parmesan cliffs .
Once designed , the setting is photographed and touched up to create original photographic works of art .
In the picture above , loaves of bread were used to depict mountains among a cove of sliced - bread cobblestones and cheese boulders .
Larry King
Rendered in Jelly Belly jelly beans
Displayed in The Jelly Belly Museum of Bean Art , the above mosaic of Larry King was created by Peter Rochaâ € ” who passed away in 2004 .
For each of his mosaics , Rocha placed the candy pieces on a layer of varnish , allowed it to dry and then covered the beans with more varnishâ € ” thus preventing bugs from appreciating his masterwork in a more literal way .
This particular portrait uses around 10,000 jelly beans in a variety of flavors , including blueberry , which was used for the suspenders .
â€ œGold Marilyn Monroeâ€
Rendered in NestlÃ© Smarties
This candy - filled creation , replicating one of Andy Warholâ€™s most famous silkscreen paintings , is made with a sugar - coated chocolate candy that is primarily sold throughout Europe and the United Kingdom .
The work , created by photo artist Prudence Emma Staite of FoodIsArt.co.uk , was part of the Smartie Art Exhibition at the V&A Museum of Childhood in London .
The exhibit marked the relaunch of the blue Smartie , which was used for Monroeâ€™s eyeshadow in this work of art .
â€ œToaster ”
Rendered in toasted bread
This 14.5 x 16.5 - inch mosaic by Ingrid Falk and Gustavo Aguerre was made entirely of toastâ€ ” specifically , 3,053 slices with varying degrees of toastedness , including shades of white , beige , tan , ochre , rust and black .
The two artists are known for using bread and food as a recurring theme in their artwork .
This piece , which took several days of toastingâ€ ” and the use of multiple friendsâ€™ toastersâ€ ” to complete , was displayed at the Galleria Milano in Milan , Italy , in October and November 1999 .
â€ œMona Lisaâ€
Rendered in chocolate
Since 1989 , food artist Jean Zaun has been crafting paintings composed entirely of chocolate , food color , edible gold sugars and confectionery glaze .
Above is his rendition of Leonardo da Vinciâ€™s famous portrait , which is painted on a white chocolate â€œcanvasâ€ base , bordered with a dark chocolate frame and finished with a confectionery glaze .
Would make a very nice chocolate gift .
Anne Robinson
Rendered in cake and biscuits
In spring 2008 , a different kind of European art exhibit was unveiled for the launch of BBCâ€™s on - demand TV service .
For the event , they asked artist Prudence Emma Staite , founder of FoodIsArt.co.uk , to depict legendary British TV characters or shows in â€œpaintingsâ€ made of food .
Above is a portrait of Anne Robinson , most famous for her role as the host of The Weakest Link , crafted from cake and biscuits .
Eminem
Rendered in M&Mâ€™s
Crafted out of more than 1,000 M&Mâ€™s , including rare pale blue and white varieties , this 40 x 30 - inch portrait of the Detroit rapper weighs in at eight pounds and was made by candy artist Enrique Ramos .
The photo , bought by Ripleyâ€™s Believe It or Not ! , is now on display at their Gallery of Unusual Art in Gatlinburg , Tennesseeâ € ” hanging amongst a befitting collection of artwork that includes a portrait of Princess Diana made of lint and a portrait of Michael Jackson rendered in gumballs .

The tale of sex , politics , money and show business gripped the Arab world .
The courtroom descended into chaos after the judge read out a short statement and ordered the sentences referred to the religious authorities for confirmation - as is normal in Egypt .
The defendants looked shocked at the verdict and relatives of Hisham Talaat Moustafa jostled with reporters to prevent them photographing his reaction .
Female relatives burst into tears and one of them fainted in the pandemonium .
Lawyer Samir Shishtawi called the verdict " severe " , adding : " I want to assure Talaat Moustafa 's family that this verdict will be overturned by the appeals court " .
Newly married
The indictment had accused the security guard who worked at a hotel owned by Moustafa of killing Suzanne Tamim , 30 , with a knife at her luxury Dubai apartment last July .
SUZANNE TAMIM Born in Lebanon , September 1977 Winner of Studio El Fan talent show in 1996 Married former classmate Ali MOuzannar ( divorced in 2002 ) , followed by music producer Adel Matouk
Murder that gripped the Middle East Clothes found at the apartment carried his DNA , and he was identified after being caught on film by a security camera .
Telephone conversations between Sukkari and Moustafa also formed part of the prosecution 's case .
The indictment had accused Moustafa , former head of the Talaat Moustafa Group property empire , of participating in the murder through " incitement , agreement and assistance " .
The court heard that he had ordered the killing after twice - married Ms Tamim ended their relationship in favour of an Iraqi kick - boxing champion , Riyad al - Azzawi , whom she had met in London .
Sukkari then followed Suzanne Tamim to the United Arab Emirates and staked out her flat .
He gained entry by saying he worked for the building owner and killed her as she opened her front door .
Elite
As well as serving in the upper house of the Egyptian parliament , Hisham Talaat Moustafa is known to have been close to President Hosni Mubarak 's politically powerful son Gamal .
He sat on the ruling National Democratic Party 's policy committee .
Members of the Egyptian elite are often viewed in the country as being above the law , and there was massive public interest in the case .
The Dubai authorities applied such pressure on the Egyptians to bring the case to trial that he was eventually stripped of his parliamentary immunity .
But reporting of the case was banned in Egypt after the opening statements - a ruling which brought sharp criticism from the opposition .
Reporters from Tamim's home area in the Lebanese capital Beirut said her family was " grateful for the verdict " .
Suzanne Tamim had risen to stardom throughout the Middle East as the winner of a pop idol contest in Lebanon in 1996 .
But her career was marred by reports of a troubled private life .
What are your memories of Suzanne Tamim ?

I just read Joshua Jonah ’s post about Limiting HTTP requests with Django .
The gist is that he ’s starting to get worried about all the different < link rel= ' stylesheet ' > ‘s and < script src= ' / some/js '> ‘s in his document < head > , and we all know that each of those generates a separate HTTP request which will slow down your page ’s load time .
My technique uses a view that builds a JS / CSS file with Django .
The CSS / JS files that are compiled like this should be stored in your templates directory instead of your static media folder so they are accessible to the view …
… This allows you to used [ sic ]
Django template language in your CSS files .
And I had an ah - HA ! moment .
Could this be the way to use variables in your CSS files ?
Having a view that defines a bunch of colors :
def buildcss ( request ) :
… snip …
linkColor = ‘# 999 ’
linkHoverColor = ‘ blue ’
…
and passing that into the template that generates your CSS
a {
color : {{ linkColor }} ;
} a:hover {
color : {{ linkHoverColor }} ;
}
Now , you probably do n’t want have Django performing doing this kind of work for every request , so you might want to cache the URL that generates your CSS .
And I ’m not sure if there are other downsides to this I have n’t considered , but it ’s interesting to think about .

As lawmakers wrangled last week over how to plug California ’s giant deficit , the governor who once called them “ girlie men ” sent the state Senate leader a package that has some Capitol insiders tsk - tsking over what they see as an ill - timed display of machismo .
The gag gift from Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger , a metal sculpture of bull testicles , came with a note suggesting the lawmaker would need them to make some tough budget choices , said legislative sources who were not authorized to speak publicly .
An annoyed Senate President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg ( D - Sacramento ) returned the sculpture with a sober note on the fortitude needed to protect society ’s vulnerable from the budget ax .
That prompted a verbal apology from the governor , the sources said .
Still , “ we ’re not going to be upset ” about a practical joke , said Steinberg ’s spokeswoman , Alicia Trost .
In fact , she said , the Senate leader and Schwarzenegger “ send each other gag gifts all the time . ”

Steinberg had earlier sent the governor a basket of garden - variety mushrooms , Trost said , after Schwarzenegger called Senate budget proposals “ hallucinatory . ”
Gubernatorial spokesman Aaron McLear , who declined to discuss the nature of Schwarzenegger ’s gift , concurred that the two men “ have a great relationship . ”
One lawmaker said the governor ’s gift was inappropriate and unhelpful at a time when he and legislators are clashing over keeping the state solvent .
“ It ’s juvenile , ” the lawmaker said .
“ The timing is bad . ”

Donkey Basketball
Invented during the 1930s as a cheap form of recession entertainment , donkey basketball remains a popular sport in midwest America .
Basically , the tow four - player teams have to shoot hoops while riding on the donkeys .
The animals often just lay down , crushed by the players ’ weight and , in these situations , competitors are allowed to dismount and drag the donkey to the hoop .
Donkeys can carry up to 68kg , but many of the donkey basketball players weigh considerably more .
This unusual sport is played mostly in school gyms , by school staff and local celebrities .
PETA has denounced donkey basketball as animal cruelty , but the folks in Iowa , where these pics were taken , say they do n’t pay much attention to that .
‘ We ’re just a bunch of good ol ’ boys and farmers down here in rural Iowa , so we ’re not worried about PETA . ’ said Angela Stufflebeam , event organizer .
Before the beginning of a donkey basketball match , an announcement is made , saying the animals are treated humanely .
But protesters say the donkeys are starved so they do n’t defecate during the match , they are often kicked , pulled by their tails and ears , and get stressed by the chaotic atmosphere .
Donkey basketball has been banned in Portland , Oregon , Indiana , Ohio and Pennsylvania , but it ’s still thriving in Iowa .

More than 40 people , including politicians , officials and several rabbis have been arrested in a major FBI operation in the US .
Three hundred agents raided dozens of locations in New Jersey and New York as part of a 10 - year probe into corruption and money laundering .
Three mayors from the state of New Jersey and two members of the state legislature were among those held .
One man is accused of kidney trafficking involving Israeli donors .
Prosecutors say the arrests were part of a " dual - tracked " investigation .
Acting US Attorney Ralph Marra told reporters there were 29 suspects on what he termed the " public corruption " side of the investigation , including the politicians .
On the other side , he said , there were 15 suspects in connection with alleged international money - laundering , including the rabbis and their " associates " .
Prosecutors accuse one man of dealing in human kidneys from Israeli donors for transplant for a decade .
It is alleged that " vulnerable people " would give up a kidney for $ 10,000 ( £ 6,000 ) and these would then be sold on for $ 160,000 ( £ 97,000 ) .
Informant Officials say investigations originally focused on a network they allege laundered tens of millions of dollars through charities controlled by rabbis in New Jersey and neighbouring New York .
ARRESTED Hoboken Mayor Peter Cammarano Secaucus Mayor Dennis Elwell Jersey City Deputy Mayor Leona Beldini Ridgefield Mayor Anthony Suarez State legislator Harvey Smith State legislator Daniel Van Pelt Rabbi Eliahu Ben Haim , Deal , NJ Rabbi Saul Kassin , Brooklyn , NY Rabbi Edmund Nahum , Deal , NJ Rabbi Mordechai Fish , Brooklyn , NY Informant leads FBI sting operation Investigators used an informant to approach a group of rabbis from the Syrian Jewish community in Brooklyn and the New Jersey borough of Deal for help hiding his assets .
The rabbis cashed cheques he made out to charities they oversaw and paid the money back to him , minus a cut , investigators say .
The probe then widened to include alleged official corruption with links to a New Jersey construction boom .
The informant was introduced to a series of politicians and powerful local officials .
Posing as a developer , he offered bribes in return for favourable treatment .
State legislators Harvey Smith and Daniel Van
Pelt were arrested , as well as the mayors of some of the state 's major cities and boroughs .
A number of city building , planning and fire inspectors were also held .
Mr Marra said : " It seemed that everyone wanted a piece of the action .
The corruption was widespread and pervasive .
Corruption was a way of life for the accused . "
He said politicians had " willingly put themselves up for sale " and clergymen had " cloaked their extensive criminal activity behind a facade of rectitude " .
' Misunderstanding '
The BBC's Jane O'Brien says the money laundering ring reportedly spanned the US , Israel and Switzerland .
Jon Corzine , the Governor of New Jersey , said : " The scale of corruption we 're seeing as this unfolds is simply outrageous and cannot be tolerated . "
Ed Kahrer , an FBI agent who has worked on the investigation from the start , said : " New Jersey 's corruption problem is one of the worst , if not the worst , in the nation .
" It has become ingrained in New Jersey 's political culture , " he said .
Another FBI agent said : " The list of people we arrested sounds like it should be the roster for a meeting of community leaders , but sadly they were n't meeting in a boardroom this morning , they were in the FBI booking room . "
Most of those arrested have been released on bail .
Hoboken Mayor Peter Cammarano was accused of taking a bribe .
His lawyer said he intended to fight the charge " with all his strength until he proves his innocence " .
A lawyer for 87 - year - old Rabbi Saul Kassin of Brooklyn said it was a shame his client had been " caught up in this misunderstanding " .
Correspondents say the number of people arrested is large even by New Jersey standards , where more than 130 public officials have either admitted to corruption or been found guilty of it since 2001 .

The excellent literary website the Second Pass has decided to take a bite out of the canon .
Its victims are books by Don Delillo , Charles Dickens , John Dos Passos , William Faulkner , Jonathan Franzen , D.H. Lawrence , Gabriel Garcia Marquez , Cormac McCarthy and Virginia Woolf .
And Jack Kerouac .
On the one hand , some of the targeted books are lesser works by masters whose other books , it is implied , would remain safely canonized .
" Absalom , Absalom " should go , but other works by Faulkner should stay .
" The Road " might be Cormac McCarthy 's bestselling book , but it 's not his best .
" ' A Tale of Two Cities ' would be a good book by another writer , " they write , " but for Dickens it was a failure . "
But in other cases , it 's a direct attack .
If just one book by Gabriel Garcia Marquez could go on a must - read list , it would be " One Hundred Years of Solitude " -- but they would banish it .
The same for Jack Kerouac 's " On the Road . "
Which is where I draw the line .
This is how the critique begins :
Like many nerds of the ’ 80s and ’90s , I read " On the Road , " that classic of identity literature , in high school .
I read it as a textbook on how to be cool .
And like many of the traditional textbooks I read at the time , it filled me with awe and boredom .
I 'm not sure when " On the Road " became " identity literature " -- is it creating an identity ?
How can something that described a lifestyle that was alternative to mainstream culture in 1950 be an adoptable identity today ?
The author goes on to describe the cultural role that the book played , both personally and in a greater sense , which she ( it is a she , I checked with the editor ) found alienating .
But I would argue that whatever cultural hallmarks it might signal , the book is a work of literature , one with an intensity of vision and a language of impure steamroller incendiary jazz .
So in America when the sun goes down and I sit on the old broken - down river pier watching the long , long skies over New Jersey and sense all that raw land that rolls in one unbelievable huge bulge over to the West Coast , and all that road going , and all the people dreaming in the immensity of it , and in Iowa I know by now the children must be crying in the land where they let the children cry , and tonight the stars ’ll be out , and do n’t you know that God is Pooh Bear ?
The evening star must be drooping and shedding her sparkler dims on the prairie , which is just before the coming of complete night that blesses the earth , darkens all the rivers , cups the peaks and folds the final shore in , and nobody , nobody knows what ’s going to happen to anybody besides the forlorn rags of growing old , I think of Dean Moriarty , I even think of Old Dean Moriarty the father we never found , I think of Dean Moriarty .
Keep your cultural baggage :
That 's going straight into my canon .
After the jump : Kerouac reads , accompanied by Steve Allen on piano .
The above passage begins about 2 1/2 minutes in .
1969 : The Soviet Union was first to land a spacecraft on the moon , in 1959 , but NASA 's Neil Armstrong becomes the first human to set foot on the lunar surface , realizing humanity 's age - old dream .
And effectively winning the space race for the United States .

Incredible Things NASA Did to Train Apollo AstronautsArmstrong and fellow astronaut Buzz Aldrin left the Apollo 11 command module ( piloted by Michael Collins ) in orbit and performed a landing in the lunar module Eagle .
At 4:18 p.m. EDT , Armstrong announced to a watching and waiting world that " The Eagle has landed . "
Six - and - a- half hours later , he stepped onto the powdery surface with the words , " That ’s one small step for man , one giant leap for mankind . "
Aldrin soon followed Armstrong down the ladder to become the second man to stand on the moon .
The mission was by no means a slam dunk .
There was real fear that once on the lunar surface the astronauts might end up marooned and beyond rescue .
In fact , President Richard Nixon had a condolence speech ready to go in the event things turned out badly .
Things went as planned , however , and Armstrong and Aldrin returned to the command module , leaving behind a plaque inscribed with the words : " Here men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the Moon , July 1969 AD .
We came in peace for all mankind . "
Five more Apollo missions carried astronauts to the moon before the program ended in 1972 .
( There were to have been six , but Apollo 13 's mission ended in near disaster . )
The last man to leave his footprint on the moon was Apollo 17 commander Eugene Cernan , on Dec. 14 , 1972 .

“ You ca n’t win your draft in the first round , but you can certainly lose it . ”
We ’ve all heard this about our fantasy draft .
It does n’t take a genius to take Adrian Peterson # 1 , but AP on your team does n’t guarantee you the trophy .
However , the guy lucky enough to get DeAngello Williams late in the draft probably won your league .
He claims he knew what he was doing ; the rest of your league says he was luckier than James Bond hitting a straight flush to beat a full house in Casino Royale .
The theory applies to real life drafting as well .
Any moron GM who watches SportsCenter can draft Peyton Manning # 1 , but if your team whiffs you end up with Ryan Leaf and your franchise is set back five years .
If you ’re like the Patriots and savvy ( lucky ) enough to find Tom Brady in the sixth round , you can use the money and draft picks you saved to stock up on other positions and build a dynasty .
The point is you need depth from your draft , especially in baseball .
I did n’t use baseball examples because I know next to nothing about the baseball draft .
I doubt you do either .
You ’ve heard of Steven Strasburg and his 102 mph fastball , but the Yankees do n’t have a shot at him unless 28 other teams refuse to shell out $ 50 million for a kid who has never thrown a major league pitch .
In doing research for this article I learned the Yankees are looking at position players like California outfielder Brett Jackson , Southern California shortstop Grant Green and Boston College catcher Tony Sanchez .
Fantastic .
I have no idea who these guys are .
The amateur baseball draft generates the least interest of the Big 3 drafts ( NFL , NBA , MLB - sorry NHL , I am enjoying your finals but how relevant are you when Game 3 & 4 are on Versus ? ) .
The NFL draft is so exciting because every team feels like they have a chance to alter the course of their franchise with a few good picks .
Look at the Dolphins and Falcons .
I ’m a pro football fan first , college second , but I ’ve seen enough games and analysis during the college season that I know which players are good , which will be first round picks , and who I want the Giants to draft .
College basketball ’s March Madness is a national showcase for the best pro prospects , and basketball is unique in that one guy can make a huge difference at the next level .
The baseball draft is completely different .
There are fifty rounds .
50 !!!
I do n’t have the attention span for 50 rounds .
The NFL has seven rounds and I barely watch the first .
50 ??
I ’m struggling to finish this sentence I ’m so bored .
Besides , college baseball only comes on national television during its World Series , so fans do n’t have a chance to get to know the players .
Even if baseball fans get attached to a draft pick , they wo n’t see him in the majors for a couple of years .
Last season Falcon fans got to watch Matt Ryan lead their team to the playoffs starting in Week 1 .
Clippers fans can look forward to Blake Griffin leading their miserable franchise to another disappointing finish in 2010 .
Yankee fans wo n’t see their 2009 # 1 in the majors until 2011 at the earliest , if he even comes up at all .
So why am I giving you all these excuses NOT to care about the 2009 MLB draft ?
I ’ll let you in on a secret : just because WE do n’t care about the draft does not mean the YANKEES should n’t care .
The Yankees have exactly five players drafted this decade on their active roster : David Robertson and Joba Chamberlain ( 2006 ) , Bret Gardner ( 2005 ) , Phil Hughes ( 2004 ) , and Phil Coke ( 2002 ) .
Out of over 400 selections over the last nine years , the Yankees have two relief pitchers in Robertson ( might be good ) and Coke ( probably not ) , a part time centerfielder in Gardner , and two high upside starters in Hughes and Chamberlain .
A 1 % success rate is n’t a recipe for success .
Name one other job you can keep while being wrong 99 % of the time .
Professional Lottery Player ?
One of the reasons the Yankees won their titles in the late 90s was the infusion of young , energetic talent they were able to bring up from their farm system .
Jeter , Posada , Pettitte , and Rivera are all products of the Yankees minor leagues .
Bernie Williams was also home grown and entered his prime during the World Series run .
These players are All Stars and Hall of Famers , not just starters and role players .
As Yankee fans we ’re all acutely aware of what a strong farm system can do for a club .
We saw it in - house a decade ago , and now we ’re seeing it in Boston with guys like Youkalis , Pedroia , Ellsbury , and half a dozen young flamethrowers .
Not only are those guys contributing , but they give the Red Sox bargaining chips to go out and get somebody if they have a hole .
If the Yankees continue to improve their club by signing the best free agent available to a giant contract , they wo n’t have any trade bait , let alone guys they would actually want to keep .
Tim Kurkjian wrote a fascinating article about former Yankee reliever Ross Ohlendorf on Saturday .
Ohlendorf is a Princeton graduate and according to Timmy he may be the smartest man in baseball .
Ohlendorf wrote his senior thesis on the amateur draft :
Ohlendorf examined the top 100 picks from 1989 to 1993 , tracked the progress of each player for a 12 - year period , starting with the draft , to determine the value of the picks .
Ohlendorf studied the investment ( signing bonus ) and the financial return from signing the player .
What were his findings ?
“ On average , ” Ohlendorf said , “ the player brought twice the return .
“ When looked at as a group , the internal rate of return on all the draft picks in the study was 60 percent .
This is an extremely high rate of return .
It is saying that if you invest $ 1 , it will grow to $ 1.60 after a year and $ 2.56 after two years , and so on … I believe the stock market has had a historical rate of about 7 or 8 percent , prior to the last year .
So even though many of the investments did not work out , the upside on those that did was so great , signing the high picks to large bonuses appears to have been a very smart investment . ”
Ohlendorf determined that the average signing bonus during those years [ 1989 - 1993 ] was $ 210,236 , and the average return was $ 2,468,127 .
Ohlendorf is telling us the Yankees have a backward approach to baseball .
Instead of investing heavily in “ proven ” free agents , the Yankees should be spending their money on prospects .
It ’s the Hugh Hefner Method .
Hef learned that the rate of return on marriage was pretty low .
He spent a lot of time and money on one woman with the knowledge that her value would diminish as she aged .
So he changed his thinking .
He spent the same amount of money on several young talents knowing some of them might not work out .
Those who did succeed stuck around and generated 3 or 4 times the production of 1 wife .
Sure , some of the money was wasted on chicks that would n’t get down , but the end result justified the spending .
Who would you rather have : 1 Kimberley Conrad forever , or 1 Kendra , 1 Holly , 1 Bridgette … then 2 twins and a 3rd random playmate ?
The Marlins caught on to this and won two World Series titles with it ; invest in the young , win it all , dump them before it becomes too costly .
The Marlins GM should write a thank you card to Hef every time he so much as looks at those banners .
I ’m not advocating the Yankees never hand out another $ 100 million deal .
They needed to get an all around slugger like Teixeira this winter , and they needed an ace in the ( large ) mold of CC Sabathia .
But it ’s more cost effective and ultimately a smarter investment to put money into the farm system .
Who would you rather have , Carl Pavano for $ 40 million or Joba Chamberlain and Phil Hughes for a tenth of that ?
The Yankees need to spend money on better scouts and they need to spend money to sign the prospects they want .
They cannot continue to be apathetic about developing minor leaguers .
George Steinbrenner did n’t help the situation and frequently gutted the farm system in favor of high priced free agents .
Now that King George has vacated his throne , Brian Cashman needs to prove he ’s a good GM by churning out some players .
Baseball ’s financial system is structured to favor large market teams , and there is no bigger team in a bigger market than the New York Yankees .
Cashman has a near limitless payroll that only a handful of teams ( Red Sox , Mets , Dodgers , Cubs ) can compete with .
This means Cash should have no problem attracting the best scouts , who will in turn go out and discover the best talent , who will in turn be signed to deals that will keep them in pinstripes .
I realize identifying baseball talent is more difficult than the other major sports .
Albert Pujols was drafted in the 13th round .
The Yankees have the resources to overcome that .
You might not tune into the MLB Network on Tuesday to watch the first round of the draft .
I doubt I will .
Whether or not fans care , the Yankees need to pay attention .
Apply the Hugh Hefner Method .

BRUSSELS / SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - EU regulators on Wednesday slapped a record 1.06 billion euro ( $ 1.45 billion ) fine on Intel Corp for antitrust violations and ordered it to halt illegal efforts to squeeze out arch - foe AMD .
Analysts say the move , which Intel CEO Paul Otellini vigorously contested , may help AMD recoup some of the market share lost to its bigger and nimbler rival over past years , but is not expected to radically transform Intel ’s operation .
The decision may also force U.S. regulators to act , analysts say , with South Korea and Japan already accusing the company of antitrust violations .
Shares in Intel , which had slid 6 percent since Reuters broke news of the impending sanction on May 7 , closed at $ 15.13 , down 8 cents or 0.53 percent , while the Nasdaq fell 3 percent .
AMD finished trade on the New York Stock Exchange up 3 cents , or 0.69 percent , at $ 4.38 .
It had been up as much as 1.2 percent earlier .
The European Commission said the world ’s No.1 chipmaker paid computer makers to postpone or scrap plans to launch products using AMD chips , paid illegal rebates to encourage them to use Intel products and paid a retailer to stock only computers with Intel chips .
Intel argued the decision was based on weak evidence that must be reviewed on appeal to an EU court .
“ We do not have those kinds of conditions in our contracts .
Our contracts are straightforward , consistent worldwide and they are volume - based : the more you buy , the less you pay , ” Chief Executive Paul Otellini said on a conference call .

“ There is a significant amount of evidence that was either ignored or disregarded , or both . ”
The antitrust fine , imposed after an eight - year investigation , is the biggest the EU ’s executive Commission has imposed on a company .
It surpassed the 896 million euro fine last year on glass maker Saint - Gobain for price fixing , and a 2004 , 497 million euro penalty on Microsoft for abuse of dominance .
“ Intel has harmed millions of European consumers by deliberately acting to keep competitors out of the market for computer chips for many years , ” European Union Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes told a news conference .
WHITHER INTEL ?
Intel has invested more than 5 billion euros in Europe and employs more than 6,000 people there , mostly in Ireland , its fourth largest global manufacturing site .
Otellini saw no change to its investment there .
Analysts said U.S. - based
Intel would be able to maintain its market dominance , but the EU ’s decision could help AMD boost its market share .
Slideshow ( 6 images )
“ Intel ’s competitive advantage is not that they cheated or anything like that .
It ’s that they are much larger than their smaller rival AMD .
As far as long - term competitive advantage ( goes ) , Intel still has it , ” said Andy Ng , an analyst at investment research firm Morningstar .
Others saw a historic decision that underscored the EU ’s determination to ensure dominant companies do not shut rivals out of the market .
“ The ruling is hugely important .
AMD has been out there for the last five or six years screaming that Intel has been keeping them from getting free access to markets , ” said Insight 64 analyst Nathan Brookwood .
Kaufman Bros. analyst Shaw
Wu said the EU ruling could potentially impact Dell because of its heavy reliance on Intel chips for corporate customers , but not better - diversified HP .
A spokesman for Dell Inc said that the company has sold both Intel and AMD - based products for several years and that it cooperated fully with the EU investigation .
Hewlett - Packard declined comment .
“ When you look at HP , they ’ve been the more balanced player , they use a fair amount of AMD maybe because of their consumer focus , ” Wu said .
“ But with Dell it ’s a little different , they ’ve been very loyal to Intel . ”
The Commission ordered Intel to cease all illegal practices immediately .
Otellini said in a statement it would appeal at the Court of First Instance , the EU ’s second - highest court .
Kroes said the EU antitrust sanctions would be carried out immediately .
In a previous antitrust case against software giant Microsoft , the Commission froze its remedies during part of an appeal filed by that company .
Intel ’s general counsel , Bruce Sewell , told reporters he was “ somewhat mystified ” and unsure what the company needed to change .
He said Intel had not yet begun talks with the Commission on how to comply with its ruling .
“ This is really just a matter of competition at work , which is something I think we all want to see , versus something nefarious , ” Otellini added .
The Commission said Intel must pay the fine , which represents 4.15 percent of the company ’s 2008 turnover , within three months of being notified of the decision .
" The EC decision will signal a sweeping change in the IT industry , " AMD 's chief marketing officer , Nigel Nigel Dessau , wrote in a corporate blog .

The City of Sydney Council has declared The Block an alcohol - free zone after a request from Indigenous locals .
The Redfern area , owned by the Aboriginal Housing Company , is one of 22 new alcohol - free zones approved at last night 's council meeting .
The other zones are on streets in Surry Hills , Pyrmont , Leichhardt , Newtown , Chippendale and The Rocks .
Deputy Lord Mayor Marcelle Hoff says Aboriginal elders at Redfern want the zone in place .
" It enables the elders down there to just gently say to some of their people , ' Look , this is an alcohol - free zone , do n't drink here please , ' and it works , " she said .
" They do it in a very gentle and respectful way and they 're able to get them not to do that in the area where the children are . "
Aboriginal Housing Company chief executive Mick Mundine says the measure will improve the community 's relationship with the police because public drinking is the source of a lot of problems .
But he says the main binge drinking offenders in the area are not locals .
Mr Mundine says outsiders have been causing problems at The Block for some time .
" Enough is enough .
The people that come here and drink around this community ... should stay with the alcohol , drink in the hotels , " he said .
" Do n't come here and use and abuse the community . "
Mr Mundine says The Block 's Aboriginal community should welcome the measure .
Councillor
Hoff says communities have been behind the new alcohol - free zones in most cases .
New signs will go up and Sydneysiders in the affected areas will be informed about the changes over the next week .

This huge solar - powered ship is called M/V Auriga Leader .
It features 328 solar panels mounted on its top deck .
Auriga Leader is part of a demonstration project developed by the Port of Long Beach , Toyota and NYK Line , a shipping company with headquarters in Tokyo .
The ship is the world 's first to use solar energy for its power needs .
With the help of solar panels the ship is able to burn less diesel fuel while in port .
The solar array of Auriga Leader can produce about 40 kilowatts , which is enough to power 10 average homes .
Although previously there were other ships that used solar energy to power some small electronics , such as auxiliary lights , this ship is the first in the world to use solar energy to power its main electrical grid ( at infoniac.com you can find additional information about green technology , so check out the links below this story ) .
According to Fumihiko Shimizu , manager of the U.S. car carrier group for NYK Logistics and Megacarrier , an NYK subsidiary , at the moment the company is in the process of estimating the effectiveness of the solar panels .
Engineers still have to see whether the panels are able to withstand corrosive effects of salt sea air .
The 60,000 - ton Auriga Leader is 665 feet long .
At the same time it is a rather simple vessel in terms of requirements when it arrives in port .
It is worth mentioning that the shipping business is very hazardous for the environment , generating huge amounts of greenhouse gases and though Auriga Leader 's 328 solar panels will not significantly cut the ship 's emissions it is still a very important step towards a greener shipping business .
Apollo astronauts have been speaking about their views on a mission to Mars at a press conference at Nasa headquarters in Washington , to mark the 40th anniversary of the first Moon landing .
While Apollo 10 astronaut Thomas Stafford responded to a question about what Nasa 's priorities should be on Mars , Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin said : " We 'll bring life to Mars , whether its germs or leftover urine bags . "
Eugene Cernan , who took part in the Apollo 10 and 17 space missions , said : " Put the human mind on Mars and then we can answer that question " .

The international trailer for Inglourious Basterds is so much more glorious Eli Roth , Quentin Tarantino June 30th , 2009 under Brangelina
The international trailer for
I can’t believe I am saying this , but I actually want to see the movie more now when it comes out on August 21st than I did before .
The international trailer for Inglourious Basterds was just released and OMG it is so much better than the one we have been seeing here in The States .
The new one has a little more humor and a faster pace to it .
Does n’t this trailer have more of the Quentin Tarantino feel than the other one ?
Plus as much as I love Brad Pitt , the other actors like Eli Roth , Daniel Bruhl , Til Schweiger and MÃ©lanie Laurent are featured a more in this one .
I ca n’t believe I am saying this , but I actually want to see the movie more now when it comes out on August 21st than I did before .
ANCHORAGE , ALASKA , July 7 , 2009 --
After her bombshell announcement Friday that she was resigning as governor of Alaska 18 months before the end of her first term , and amid questions about her political future ricocheting from Alaska to Washington , D.C. , Sarah Palin packed it up , traveled more than 300 miles from her family home in Wasilla and went fishing .
It was there in Dillingham , Alaska , on the shores of Kanakanak Beach , that ABC News joined the former Republican presidential running mate on a salmon fishing trip .
Dressed in a white T - shirt and overall waders , Alaska 's governor was philosophical about politics and life , all the while plucking salmon from the family fishing nets aboard a boat her husband , Todd , and a buddy built 20 years ago .
Palin said she was surprised by the media storm that followed her announcement to leave office , saying she thought it would not have been " such a darn big deal . "
But she struck a determined , if vague , note about her future .
" I said before I stood in front of the mic the other day , you know , politically speaking -- if I die , I die .
So be it , " Palin said .
" Do n't know what the future holds .
I 'm not gonna shut any door .
That -- who knows what doors open .
I can't predict what the next fish run 's gonna look like down on the Nushagak [ River ] .
So I certainly can't predict what 's gonna happen in the next couple of years , " Palin told ABC News .
Palin hinted that whether she holds elected office again or not , she does not intend to live a quiet life made up entirely of family fishing trips .
" I do n't need a title to be the one to usher in what it is that needs to be done in our state or our country . "
Palin conceded many people are still confused about why she decided to leave office .
" You know why they 're confused ?
I guess they cannot take something nowadays at face value , " Palin said .
But she said a major factor in the decision was the mounting legal bills she and the state have had to incur to fight ethics charges from her political adversaries .
None of the accusations have been proved but , she said , the costs of fighting them have been enormous .
" You know , conditions have really changed in Alaska in the political arena since Aug. 29 , since I was tapped to run for VP .
When that opposition research -- those researchers really bombarded Alaska -- started digging for dirt and have not let up .
They 're not gonna find any dirt , " she said .
" We keep proving that every time we win an ethics violation lawsuit , and we 've won every one of them .
But it has been costing our state millions of dollars .
It 's cost Todd and me .
You know the adversaries would love to see us put on the path of personal bankruptcy so that we can't afford to run . "
As to whether another pursuit for national office , as when she joined Sen. John McCain , R - Ariz. , in the race for the White House less than a year ago , would result in the same political blood sport , Palin said there was a difference between the White House and what she had experienced in Alaska .
If she were in the White House , she said , the " department of law " would protect her from baseless ethical allegations .
" I think on a national level , your department of law there in the White House would look at some of the things that we 've been charged with and automatically throw them out , " she said .
There is no " Department of Law " at the White House .
Palin's Dim View of Politicians
Another major reason Palin stated for walking away from her first term as Alaska 's governor was that after she announced the decision not to seek a second term as governor , she would become a lame duck , and she 'd refuse to " milk " that status .
She said most politicians " say it 's a paycheck , it 's a paycheck and I get to travel around .
No , that 's politics as usual . "
Palin spoke openly about her ideas for the country , national security and energy , and she took a dim view of politicians .
" No , I do n't really like a whole lot of politicians , " she said .
Salmon fishing is a family affair for the Palins .
Their fourth child , daughter Piper , age 8 , was on hand to help .
And 1 - year - old baby Trig , who Palin said is getting ready to walk , stayed back on shore .
Palin said the family has n't discussed any plans to move away from Alaska .
But when the family discussed whether she ought to leave office , it was her oldest child , son Track , who is serving in Iraq , who voted " hell , yeah . "
Husband Todd Palin said , " It 's been a topic of discussion quietly for a while .
It 's never come to an , ' I ca n't take it anymore . '
Let 's vote .
It 's been a few months , and it just seemed that the resistance , the wasted time and the wasted money she had to go through every day . "
He said he doubts that his wife 's resignation will be a weight off her shoulders .
" She 's gonna continue to be busy , " he said .
Sarah Palin said , " Every mom that we know multitasks .
I 'm gonna keep working extremely hard , but I am looking forward to having my kids by my side more , without getting criticized for having the kids by my side .
In her first public appearance since her announcement last Friday , Palin appeared on Tuesday in a western Alaskan community called Kotzebue , to sign a bill aimed at improving management of safety officers in rural communities .
Afterwards , she said she was absolutely sure Alaska will be better off with Lt. Gov. Sean Parnell , her successor .
" I 'm extremely happy , " she told ABC News .
" I know that I know that I know that this is the right thing for Alaska . "
A Leicestershire mother who kicked her 19 - month - old son in the face because he would not stop screaming has been spared a prison sentence .
Donna Smallbones , 21 , of Rupert Road , Market Harborough , had pleaded guilty to assault at an earlier hearing .
She kicked Mikey , leaving trainer marks on his forehead , while he was sitting in a pushchair at a friend 's house where she was drinking on 16 December .
Town magistrates handed her an 18 - month community order with supervision .
' Glancing blow '
Smallbones ' friends were so shocked they called the police and paramedics , Market Harborough Magistrates '
Court was told .
Prosecutor Louise Cox said : " They found four parallel dirty marks on the baby 's forehead .
" They appear to have been caused by a glancing blow from a shoe . "
She said a medical examination was carried out on Mikey and no injuries were found .
When Smallbones was arrested and questioned she originally denied what happened but later admitted kicking out at her son twice .
Learning difficulties
The court heard that the 21 - year - old admitted her actions were reckless .
Magistrates at a previous hearing suggested Smallbones , who has learning difficulties , could face a jail sentence .
Defence lawyer Prakash Morar told the court : " She has admitted her part and her role .
" No injury was caused , yes contact was made , we have pleaded guilty on the basis that she kicked out twice . "
He added there had been no instances of Smallbones hurting her son in the past , and it was not feared she would do so again .
The toddler is currently on the child protection register and is in the care of Smallbones ' parents .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - Having sex every day improves the quality of men ’s sperm and is recommended for couples trying to conceive , according to new research .
Until now doctors have debated whether or not men should refrain from sex for a few days before attempting to conceive with their partner to improve the chance of pregnancy .
But a new study by Dr David Greening of Sydney IVF , an Australian center for infertility and in vitro fertilization ( IVF ) treatment , suggests abstinence is not the right approach .
He studied 118 men with above - average sperm DNA damage and found the quality of their sperm increased significantly after they were told to ejaculate daily for seven days .
On average , their DNA fragmentation index -- a measure of sperm damage -- fell to 26 percent from 34 percent , Greening told the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology in Amsterdam Tuesday .
Frequent sex does decrease semen volume but for most men this is not a problem .
“ It seems safe to conclude that couples with relatively normal semen parameters should have sex daily for up to a week before the ovulation date , ” he said in a statement .
“ In the context of assisted reproduction , this simple treatment may assist in improving sperm quality and ultimately achieving a pregnancy . ”
Greening said it was likely frequent ejaculation improved the quality of sperm by reducing the length of time they were exposed to potentially damaging molecules called reactive oxygen species in the testicular ducts .
For a long time now , I ’ve been a huge fan of Reddit – the best darned news aggregator out there .
My Reddits include cognitive science , science , psyschology , technology , world news , math , and comics .
Anyway , a while back , Alexis from Reddit contacted my fiance , Zach , to tell him that he enjoys Zach ’s comic .
This was super exciting news , and when Zach and the Reddit guys scheduled a lunch date for today , I invited myself along .
In my mind I had imagined the guys running Reddit to serious , suit - wearing business types .
To my surprise , they ’re actually laid - back 20 - somethings ( maybe early 30’s ? ? ) who volunteer their spare time to teach the local goldfish how to play soccer .
For lunch we went to a cute Caribbean restaurant near their office in San Francisco .
The guys were really easy to talk to and even seemed interested in my tales of grad school hardships and rattlesnake - tracking ordeals up in Michigan .
As I love any opportunity to tell a story , and they were kind enough to listen , this immediately put them at the top of my list .
Back at their office , we learned the following fascinating bits of information about the Reddit guys :
1 ) They arrange their desktop icons by penis .
That ’s right , the icons on their desktop form a giant wang .
This is apparently awesome 99.9 % of the time , but 0.01 % of the time ( when 7th graders visit the office to see what running a website is all about ) it becomes a bit awkward .
2 ) They can feed Mrs. Splashy Pants ( their pet goldfish ) without being anywhere near his / her tank .
The guys have rigged it up so that remotely opening a CD drive on the computer nearest the fishtank starts up a Rube Goldberg machine , which results in the delivery of fish pellets to the tank .
3 ) They have the power at their fingertips to deliver “ Internet Justice . ”
They offered to deliver to me the head of my enemy , but I politely declined … for now .
All in all , it was a great few hours .
Most importantly , they sent us home with free stuff ( a graduate student ’s favorite thing ) !
We received Reddit bobbleheads , t- shirts , and I got a giant squishy sheep .
It was laying around the office and I ’m guessing they ’ve grown tired of jokes about dirty things to do it , so they were ready to release it to a new home .
I ’ll take good care of it guys , I promise .
In 2007 Skeptic magazine ran an article debunking the myth of the connection between vaccines and autism , and we were hoping that by now this sad tale of pseudoscience would have died a slow death as researchers continue to find no link whatsoever between the two .
Sadly that is not the case .
In fact , thanks to Playboy model Jenny McCarthy , mother of an autistic child , the myth has gained cultural traction as never before , as she and her partner , the comedian Jim Carrey , make the media rounds and appeal to the heart strings of the public , burying the science in a tsunami of emotion .
So we return again to the topic with our SkepDoc , Harriet Hall , M.D. , demolishing the myth once and for all .
Vaccines & Autism
A Deadly Manufactroversy
by Harriet Hall , MD , “ The SkepDoc ”
During a question and answer session after a talk I recently gave , I was asked for my opinion about the vaccine / autism controversy .
That was easy : my opinion is that there is no controversy .
The evidence is in .
The scientific community has reached a clear consensus that vaccines do n’t cause autism .
There is no controversy .
There is , however , a manufactroversy — a manufactured controversy — created by junk science , dishonest researchers , professional misconduct , outright fraud , lies , misrepresentations , irresponsible reporting , unfortunate media publicity , poor judgment , celebrities who think they are wiser than the whole of medical science , and a few maverick doctors who ought to know better .
Thousands of parents have been frightened into rejecting or delaying immunizations for their children .
The immunization rate has dropped , resulting in the return of endemic measles in the U.K. and various outbreaks of vaccine - preventable diseases in the U.S. children have died .
Herd immunity has been lost .
The public health consequences are serious and are likely to get worse before they get better — a load of unscientific nonsense has put us all at risk .
The story is appalling .
It involves high drama , charismatic personalities , conspiracy theories , accusations , intimidation , and even death threats .
It would make a good movie .
It does make a good book : Dr. Paul Offit has explained what happened in Autism ’s False Prophets : Bad Science , Risky Medicine , and the Search for a Cure . 1
I ca n’t tell the whole story here , but I ’ll try to cover the highlights as I understand them .
I ’ll include some new revelations that were not available to Offit when his book went to press .
As I see it , there were 3 main stages to this fiasco :
The MMR Scare
In 1998 a British doctor named Andrew Wakefield published an article in the respected medical journal The Lancet2 .
He did intestinal biopsies via colonoscopy on 12 children with intestinal symptoms and developmental disorders , 10 of whom were autistic , and found a pattern of intestinal inflammation .
The parents of 8 of the autistic children thought they had developed their autistic symptoms right after they got the MMR vaccine .
The published paper stated clearly : “ We did not prove an association between measles , mumps , and rubella vaccine and the syndrome described .
Virological studies are underway that may help to resolve this issue . ”
“ Falsehood flies ,
and the truth comes limping after . ”
— Jonathan Swift
Despite this disclaimer , Wakefield immediately held a press conference to say the MMR vaccine probably caused autism and to recommend stopping MMR injections .
Instead , he recommended giving the 3 individual components separately at intervals of a year or more .
The media exploded with warnings like “ Ban Three - in - One Jab , Urge Doctors . ”
The components were not available as individual vaccines , so people simply stopped immunizing .
The immunization rate in the U.K. dropped from 93 % to 75 % ( and to 50 % in the London area ) .
Confirmed cases of measles in England and Wales rose from 56 in 1998 to 1348 in 2008 ; two children died .
In one small hospital in Ireland , 100 children were admitted for pneumonia and brain swelling caused by measles and three of them died .
So , 14 years after measles had been declared under control in the U.K. it was declared endemic again in 2008 .
Wakefield ’s data was later discredited ( more about that later ) but even if it had been right , it would n’t have been good science .
To show that intestinal inflammation is linked to autism , you would have to compare the rate in autistic children to the rate in non-autistic children .
Wakefield used no controls .
To implicate the MMR vaccine , you would have to show that the rate of autism was greater in children who got the vaccine and verify that autism developed after the shot .
Wakefield made no attempt to do that .
His thinking was fanciful and full of assumptions .
He hypothesized that measles virus damaged the intestinal wall , that the bowel then leaked some unidentified protein , and that said protein went to the brain and somehow caused autism .
There was no good rationale for separating and delaying the components , because if measles was the culprit , would n’t one expect it to cause the same harm when given individually ?
As one of his critics pointed out : “ Single vaccines , spaced a year apart , clearly expose children to greater risk of infection , as well as additional distress and expense , and no evidence had been produced upon which to adopt such a policy . ”
item of interest …
Wakefield had been involved in questionable research before .
He published a study in 1993 where he allegedly found measles RNA in intestinal biopsies from patients with Crohn ’s disease ( an inflammatory bowel disease ) 3 .
He claimed that natural measles infections and measles vaccines were the cause of that disease .
Others tried to replicate his findings and could n’t .
No one else could find measles RNA in Crohn ’s patients ; they determined that Crohn ’s patients were no more likely to have had measles than other patients , and people who had had MMR vaccines were no more likely to develop Crohn ’s .
Wakefield had to admit he was wrong , and in 1998 he published another paper entitled “ Measles RNA Is Not Detected in Inflammatory Bowel Disease . ”
4
In a related incident , at a national meeting he stated that Crohn ’s patients had higher levels of measles antibody in their blood .
An audience member said that was not true — he knew because he was the one who had personally done the blood tests Wakefield was referring to .
Wakefield was forced to back down .
In 2002 , Wakefield published another paper showing that measles RNA had been detected in intestinal biopsies of patients with bowel disease and developmental disorders .
5
The tests were done at Unigenetics lab .
Actually , Wakefield ’s own lab had looked for measles RNA in the patients in the 1998 study .
His research assistant , Nicholas Chadwick , later testified that he had been present in the operating room when intestinal biopsies and spinal fluid samples were obtained and had personally tested all the samples for RNA with a polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) test .
The results were all negative , and he testified that Wakefield knew the results were negative when he submitted his paper to The Lancet .
Chadwick had asked that his name be taken off the paper .
So the statement in the paper that “ virologic studies were underway ” was misleading .
Virologic studies had already been done in Wakefield ’s own lab and were negative .
Wakefield was dissatisfied with those results and went to Unigenetics hoping for a different answer .
Soon Wakefield ’s credibility started to dissolve .
The Lancet retracted his paper .
Richard Horton , editor of The Lancet , described the original paper as “ fatally flawed ” and apologized for publishing it .
Of Wakefield ’s 12 co-authors , 10 issued a retraction :
We wish to make it clear that in this paper no causal link was established between ( the ) vaccine and autism , as the data were insufficient .
However the possibility of such a link was raised , and consequent events have had major implications for public health .
In view of this , we consider now is the appropriate time that we should together formally retract the interpretation placed upon these findings in the paper , according to precedent .
Attempts to replicate Wakefield ’s study all failed .
Other studies showed that the detection of measles virus was no greater in autistics , that the rate of intestinal disease was no greater in autistics , that there was no correlation between MMR and autism onset , and that there was no correlation between MMR and autism , period .
In 2001 the Royal Free Hospital asked Wakefield to resign .
In 2003 , Brian Deer began an extensive investigation6 leading to an exposé in the The Sunday Times and on British television .
In 2005 the General Medical Council ( the British equivalent of state medical licensing boards in the U.S. ) charged Wakefield with several counts of professional misconduct .
One disturbing revelation followed another .
They discovered that two years before his study was published , Wakefield had been approached by a lawyer representing several families with autistic children .
The lawyer specifically hired Wakefield to do research to find justification for a class action suit against MMR manufacturers .
The children of the lawyer ’s clients were referred to Wakefield for the study , and 11 of his 12 subjects were eventually litigants .
Wakefield failed to disclose this conflict of interest .
He also failed to disclose how the subjects were recruited for his study .
Wakefield was paid a total of nearly half a million pounds plus expenses by the lawyer .
The payments were billed through a company of Wakefield ’s wife .
He never declared his source of funding until it was revealed by Brian Deer .
Originally he had denied being paid at all .
Even after he admitted it , he lied about the amount he was paid .
Before the study was published , Wakefield had filed patents for his own separate measles vaccine , as well as other autism - related products .
He failed to disclose this significant conflict of interest .
Human research must be approved by the hospital ’s ethics committee .
Wakefield ’s study was not approved .
When confronted , Wakefield first claimed that it was approved , then claimed he did n’t need approval .
Wakefield bought blood samples for his research from children ( as young as 4 ) attending his son ’s birthday party .
He callously joked in public about them crying , fainting and vomiting .
He paid the kids £ 5 each .
The General Medical Council accused him of ordering invasive and potentially harmful studies ( colonoscopies and spinal taps ) without proper approval and contrary to the children ’s clinical interests , when these diagnostic tests were not indicated by the children ’s symptoms or medical history .
One child suffered multiple bowel perforations during the colonoscopy .
Several had problems with the anesthetic .
Children were subjected to sedation for other non-indicated tests like MRIs .
Brian Deer was able to access the medical records of Wakefield ’s subjects .
He found that several of them had evidence of autistic symptoms documented in their medical records before they got the MMR vaccine .
The intestinal biopsies were originally reported as normal by hospital pathologists .
They were reviewed , re-interpreted , and reported as abnormal in Wakefield ’s paper .
All the reports of measles RNA in intestinal biopsies came from one lab , Unigenetics .
Other labs tried to replicate their results and failed .
An investigation revealed that :
Unigenetics found measles RNA with a test that should only detect DNA .
They failed to use proper controls .
The lab was contaminated with DNA from an adjoining Plasmid Room .
Duplicate samples that disagreed were reported as positive .
Positive controls were occasionally negative and negative ones positive .
The lab was never accredited .
It refused to take part in a quality control program .
When tested by an outside investigator , it failed to identify which coded samples contained measles virus .
The investigator said “ I do not believe that there is any measles virus in any of the cases they have looked at . ”
The lab is no longer in business .
So both Wakefield and his study have been completely discredited .
He moved to the U.S. and is now working in an autism clinic .
He has many followers who still believe he was right .
The Mercury / Thimerosal Scare
In 1998 , U.S. legislation mandated measuring mercury in foods and drugs .
The data came in slowly , and by 1999 the FDA had learned that infants could get as much as 187.5 mcg of mercury from the thimerosal in all their vaccines .
They were concerned because mercury is toxic .
Mercury poisoning caused the Minamata disaster in Japan ; however , that was methylmercury and the mercury in vaccines was ethylmercury .
The amount of mercury in vaccines was within recommended guidelines .
EPA guidelines for permissible mercury exposure were based on methylmercury and were conservative — they were keyed to protect the most vulnerable patients , fetuses .
There were no EPA guidelines for ethylmercury , but it was considered to be far less dangerous because it is eliminated more rapidly from the body .
Two mothers of autistic children published their own “ research ” saying that the symptoms of autism were identical to those of mercury poisoning .
7 I do n’t agree .
You can look up the descriptions of mercury poisoning and autism and draw your own conclusions .
I do n’t see how anyone could confuse the two — their presentations are entirely different , with only a few symptoms that could be interpreted as similar .
Thimerosal is a preservative that allows vaccines to be sold in multi- dose vials .
It contains ethylmercury .
It was tested and found to be safe before it was added to vaccines .
Animal studies showed no adverse effects .
In 1929 in Indiana it was tested as a treatment in a meningitis outbreak — adults injected with 2 million mcg ( 10,000 times the total amount in all children ’s vaccines ) did n’t develop symptoms of mercury poisoning .
A study from the Seychelles showed that children getting high doses of methylmercury from fish did not develop neurologic symptoms .
A study of children in the Faroes who were exposed in utero to whale meat highly contaminated with methylmercury showed subtle neurologic abnormalities ( not autism ) , but a causal connection was not clear because the fish there were also contaminated with PCBs .
The World Health Organization concluded :
The theoretical risk from exposure to thimerosal has to be balanced against the known high risk of having no preservative in vaccines .
Therefore , WHO , UNICEF , the European Agency for Evaluation of Medicinal Products ( EMEA ) , and other key agencies continue to recommend the use of vaccines containing this preservative because of the proven benefit of vaccines in preventing death and disease and the lack of data indicating harm .
In 1999 the U.S. removed thimerosal from vaccines .
Why ?
The decision was not based on evidence but on one person ’s opinion .
Neal Halsey railroaded the committee and threatened to hold his own press conference if they did n’t do what he wanted .
He meant well .
His passion convinced the other committee members to invoke the precautionary principle — essentially bending over backwards to prevent any possible harm from a high total body burden of mercury from a combination of diet , environmental and vaccine sources .
He did n’t even consider autism : he was only concerned about possible subtle neurologic damage .
They announced their decision in words guaranteed to confuse the public and create suspicion : “ current levels of thimerosal will not hurt children , but reducing those levels will make safe vaccines even safer . ”
A 2007 editorial8 in The New England Journal of Medicine stated :
Although the precautionary principle assumes that there is no harm in exercising caution , the alarm caused by the removal of thimerosal from vaccines has been quite harmful .
For instance , after the July 1999 announcement by the CDC and AAP , about 10 percent of hospitals suspended use of the hepatitis B vaccine for all newborns , regardless of their level of risk .
[ Because a thimerosal - free hepatitis B vaccine was not available . ]
One 3 - month - old child born to a Michigan mother infected with hepatitis B virus died of overwhelming infection .
It went on to point out :
The notion that thimerosal caused autism has given rise to a cottage industry of charlatans offering false hope , partly in the form of mercury - chelating agents .
In August 2005 , a 5 - year - old autistic boy in suburban Pittsburgh died from an arrhythmia caused by the injection of the chelating agent EDTA .
Although the notion that thimerosal causes autism has now been disproved by several excellent epidemiologic studies , about 10,000 autistic children in the United States receive mercury - chelating agents every year .
item of interest …
A further insanity has been perpetrated by the father - and - son team of Mark and David Geier .
They claimed that autistics have premature puberty and high testosterone levels ( there is no evidence that this is true ) .
They hypothesized that testosterone forms sheet - like complexes with mercury in the brain ( there is no evidence that this is true ) , preventing mercury ’s removal by chelation .
Their solution ?
They administered the drug Lupron to lower testosterone levels to supposedly facilitate mercury excretion .
The treatment amounts to chemical castration .
Lupron is sometimes ordered by the courts to chemically castrate sex offenders , and it is used to treat precocious puberty and certain other medical conditions .
It is not a benign drug .
It can interfere with normal development and puberty and can put children ’s heart and bones and their future fertility at risk .
The treatment involves painful daily injections and costs $ 5000 to $ 6000 a month .
The Geiers use 10 times the recommended dose .
The company that makes Lupron does not support its use for this purpose .
Like Wakefield , the Geiers have been accused of professional misconduct .
They built their own lab in their basement and formed their own institute to conduct Lupron studies .
Then they formed their own Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) to approve studies .
IRBs are required by law and must follow strict guidelines to ensure that studies are ethical and to protect the rights of subjects .
The IRB they formed was illegal .
They packed the board with friends and relatives : every single member of this IRB was either one of the Geiers , an anti-thimerosal activist , a Geier associate , or a lawyer suing on behalf of “ vaccine - injured ” clients .
One was the mother of a child who was a subject in the research .
Even worse , they let the principal investigator sit as the chair of the IRB overseeing his own research protocols .
Oh , and the IRB was n’t even registered until 2 years after the research was done .
Mark Geier has made a career of testifying as an expert witness in autism cases .
He has not impressed the judges .
Here are a few of the judge ’s comments :
“ Seriously intellectually dishonest ”
“ … not reliable or grounded in scientific methodology and procedure … his testimony is subjective belief and unsupported speculation . ”
“ I can not give his opinion any credence . ”
“ … a professional witness in areas for which he has no training , expertise , and experience . ”
When thimerosal was removed from vaccines , there were no studies showing that it was harmful .
After its removal , study after study showed that it was not harmful .
But activist groups did n’t let the new evidence interfere with their beliefs .
Anti-vaccine groups have viciously attacked medical doctors and researchers for simply stating what the current scientific evidence shows .
They accuse them of being shills for “ Big Pharma ” or covering up for government agencies , and they call them offensive names ; but they do n’t stop there .
They threaten people who write about the scientific evidence , and they threaten their children .
Dr. Offit , the author of Autism ’s False Prophets , received a direct death threat that got the FBI involved .
He had to use a bodyguard and cancel a book tour .
One threatening phone call ominously demonstrated that the caller knew Offit ’s children ’s names , ages , and where they went to school .
Another scientist who received threats was so afraid for her children ’s safety that she vowed never to write anything about autism again .
One anti-vaccine activist had the bad grace to accuse science blogger Orac of lying when he said he was mourning his mother - in - law ’s death from cancer .
She refused to believe he could be sorry his mother - in - law died because he ’s not sorry about supporting vaccines that kill children .
There was no thimerosal in any vaccine except the flu vaccine after 2002 .
The “ mercury militia ” expected autism rates to drop , thereby proving the mercury connection .
Autism rates rose .
Instead of relinquishing their belief , they made implausible attempts to implicate new sources of atmospheric mercury , from cremations of bodies with mercury amalgam fillings or from pollution wafted across the Pacific from China .
The Vaccines - In - General Scare
If the MMR scare can be attributed to Andrew Wakefield and the mercury scare to Neal Halsey , the next stage of hysteria is epitomized by Jenny McCarthy , actress and anti-vaccine activist extraordinaire .
Jenny ’s son Evan is autistic .
At first she subscribed to the fanciful notion that she was an Indigo mother and Evan was a Crystal child .
Indigos are “ difficult ” children who are alleged to possess special traits or abilities such as telepathy , empathy , and creativity , and are said to represent the next stage in human evolution .
Many of them fit the diagnosis of attention - deficit / hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) .
Crystal children represent an even more advanced evolutionary step .
They are “ so sensitive , so vulnerable to the world around them , that they go inward , disconnect as best they can from even humans and do their best to survive in a world where they really do n’t yet fit . ”
They are often diagnosed as autistic .
After a while McCarthy gave up on that fantasy and accepted that Evan was autistic .
She became convinced that vaccines had caused his autism .
She treated him with unproven dietary restrictions , anti-yeast treatments , and supplements , and claims to have cured him .
She thinks her “ Mommy instincts ” are more valid than science .
She says “ My science is Evan , and he ’s at home .
That ’s my science . ”
She realizes that withholding vaccines will lead to the deaths of children .
As quoted by Time magazine :
I do believe sadly it ’s going to take some diseases coming back to realize that we need to change and develop vaccines that are safe .
If the vaccine companies are not listening to us , it ’s their f___ing fault that the diseases are coming back .
They ’re making a product that ’s s___ .
If you give us a safe vaccine , we ’ll use it .
It should n’t be polio versus autism .
She and her partner Jim Carrey have spoken out at every opportunity on talk shows , on the Internet , and through books and public appearances .
When someone questions Jenny ’s beliefs her usual tactic is to try to shout them down .
She is supported by maverick doctor Jay Gordon , who values listening to parents over science and who supports a delayed vaccine schedule not because of any evidence but just because he thinks it ’s a good idea .
On one talk show , a pregnant mother with several autistic children tried to tell Gordon that her child who had the worst autism was the one who had not been vaccinated .
He not only refused to listen to what she was saying but tried to drown her out , loudly insisting she must n’t vaccinate the new baby .
A member of Quackwatch ’s “ Healthfraud ” online discussion list reported sitting next to Evan ’s paternal grandmother at a dinner .
Grandma said Evan ’s symptoms of autism were evident before he was vaccinated , and he is not doing as well as Jenny says .
Grandma is writing her own book — I look forward to its revelations .
Jenny and her cohorts claim they are not anti-vaccine , but they are certainly a good facsimile thereof .
The goalposts keep moving .
First it was the MMR vaccine , then it was thimerosal , then it was mercury from all sources , then it was other vaccine ingredients , then it was too many vaccines , then it was giving vaccines too early .
They will not be satisfied until science can offer a 100 % safe and a 100 % effective vaccine proven to have no side effects of any kind even in a rare susceptible individual .
That ’s not going to happen in this universe .
The other vaccine ingredients that have been questioned include formaldehyde , aluminum , ether , anti-freeze , and human aborted fetal tissue .
Scientists have explained over and over that these ingredients are either not present in vaccines or are harmless , but activists ignore the facts and keep making the same false claims .
Formaldehyde is harmless in small amounts and is even produced naturally in the human body .
Aluminum is an adjuvant used to increase the efficacy of vaccines , and is not harmful .
Ether might be used in the manufacturing process but is not present in the vaccines .
There is no ethylene glycol or even diethylene glycol in vaccines .
( Anti - freeze is ethylene glycol . )
And to obtain enough virus to make a vaccine , the virus must be grown in tissue cultures that were originally derived from monkey , chicken , or sometimes human fetal cells ; but there is no human or animal tissue of any kind present in the vaccine itself .
Apple trees grow in soil , but there is no soil in applesauce .
Some anti-vaccine websites perpetuate the myth that infectious diseases were already disappearing and that the vaccines had nothing to do with it .
Those myths are easily dispelled by historical data .
Vaccine critics ignore the large body of evidence from incidents around the world where as the vaccination rate dropped , the rate of disease rose ; and when the vaccination rate rose again , the disease rate dropped .
No one can seriously deny the effectiveness of vaccines .
They are the most impressive accomplishment of modern medicine .
item of interest …
Giving up the known benefits of vaccines because of a vague hypothetical possibility of risk is a poor trade - off .
We were able to eradicate smallpox , and we ought to be able to eradicate all the diseases that are spread solely by human - to - human contact .
Once enough people have been vaccinated to eradicate the disease , no one will ever have to be vaccinated for that disease again .
Smallpox is long gone ; polio and measles are next on the list .
Polio had been reduced to only 3 countries a few years ago .
Then Nigeria stopped vaccinating due to rumors that the vaccines were an American plot to sterilize their children or give them AIDS .
The polio rate soared and the disease broke out to several other countries , as far away as Malaysia .
When the rate of immunization reaches a certain level , the population is protected by what we call herd immunity .
It means there are not enough susceptible people for the disease to keep spreading through a community .
In many places the herd immunity has already been lost .
It is only a matter of time before diseases break out again .
One traveler from a country with polio could reintroduce the disease into the U.S. Lowered vaccination rates endanger even those who have been vaccinated , because the protection is not 100 % .
People who are immunosuppressed , chronically ill , or too young to have been vaccinated are also put at risk .
Parents who choose to delay vaccination are prolonging their children ’s period of risk .
And they are endangering everyone else ’s public health .
Scientists had been urged to “ listen to the parents . ”
They did listen to the parents and then conducted research to test the parents ’ hypotheses .
There were various kinds of studies in different countries by different research groups .
The results were consistent :
10 studies showed MMR does n’t cause autism
6 studies showed thimerosal does n’t cause autism
3 studies showed thimerosal does n’t cause subtle neurological problems
Now it ’s the parents who wo n’t listen to the scientists .
Autistic children and their parents are being misled and victimized with useless , untested , disproven , expensive , time - consuming , and even dangerous treatments .
Despite the evidence that mercury does n’t cause autism , children are still being treated with IV chelation to remove mercury — at least one child has died as a result .
Along with Lupron injections for chemical castration , children are being treated with secretin , restricted diets , supplements of all kinds , intravenous hydrogen peroxide , DAN ( Defeat Autism Now ) protocols , cranial manipulation , facilitated communication , and other nonsense .
One family was strongly urged to take out a second mortgage on their home so they could buy a home hyperbaric oxygen chamber .
The real tragedy is that all this hoopla is diverting attention from research into effective treatments ( usually behavioral ) and into the real causes of autism ( almost certainly genetic , with environmental triggers not ruled out ) .
An anti-anti - vaccine backlash is now afoot .
Outbreaks of vaccine - preventable diseases are being reported .
Scientists are speaking out .
Blogs like Respectful Insolence and Science - Based Medicine have covered the subject in depth .
The Chicago Tribune published an exposé of the Geiers.9 Even Reader ’s Digest has contradicted Jenny .
They said that vaccines save lives and do not cause autism and they stressed that the science is not on Jenny ’s side .
Let us hope that sanity will prevail before too many more children die from vaccine - preventable diseases .
They are dying now .
The Jenny McCarthy Body Count webpage is keeping track of the numbers .

Travelers who paid $ 200 a year to cut in airport security lines now have to queue up with everyone else , as Clear , the leading Registered Traveler program , went out of business on Monday night .
Clear announced it closing on its web page , saying " Clear ’s parent company , Verified Identity Pass , Inc. has been unable to negotiate an agreement with its senior creditor to continue operations . "
The website offered no guidance for the thousands of Clear members , and a spokeswoman did not immediately reply to a request for comment .
Likely , Clear card holders will need to get in line with Clear 's creditors if they want to see any refund of their membership fees .
Clear , formerly known as Verified Identity Pass , was founded by Steven Brill as a reaction to the notoriously slow security lines at the nation 's airports after the 9/11 hijackings .
For about $ 200 a year and a perfunctory security check , travelers would get a Clear card that let them jump to the front of the line at airports around the country , including Denver , Dulles Washington D.C. , Indianapolis , Little Rock , New York LaGuardia , New York JFK , Newark , Oakland , Orlando , Reagan Washington D.C. , Salt Lake City , San Jose , San Francisco and Westchester Airports .
In 2006 , the TSA and airports set up a generalized system called Registered Traveler to make the program competitive , but Brill 's Clear , which started at one airport in Florida , remained the market leader .
But as the TSA got better at keeping lines moving in the last few years , Clear 's benefits became less clear .
Clear continued to ink deals with the nation 's largest airports and even partnering with football teams to get fans in the door faster , but evidently those strategies did not fare well in a down economy .
Even Brill , a former journalist who started Brill 's Content and then CourtTV , seems to be bored with Clear .
He stepped down as CEO in March to pursue endeavors in " public service and journalism , " and , on the very day that Clear closed down , his spokeswoman sent out an invite to Wired.com for a press event for his newest venture , Journalism Online — a way to put up paywalls around online media content .
But if Brill can't get enough corporate travelers to pay for airport convenience , it 's not clear how he thinks he 'll get enough people to pony up online news subscriptions to save online journalism .

It 's a trend we 're noticing more and more with folks who use Web browsers : Google Search is becoming so ubiquitous that people are comfortable with typing a query rather than referencing a bookmark , to relocate a page they remember .
It saves them the trouble of having to save the page in the first place .
You think I 'm kidding ?
Two of the search phrases that land Google users on Betanews most often are " beta news " and " Betanews . "
Advertisement
So for a lot of people , the bookmarks file is becoming almost atrophied , a disused collection of stuff so old that the Internet Archive might have to look up its contents in a box of floppy disks .
When using the browser 's bookmarks manager becomes more troublesome , or just simply more time - consuming , than a Google query , a user may simply choose the latter .
Perhaps Google already came to that conclusion , or perhaps it would simply prefer users to store their bookmarks on its Web - based service .
This is the only explanation I can attribute to the fact that the Chrome browser is coming up on one year of everyday public use without its Bookmark Manager feature developing even the simplest functionality .
Here 's what I mean : I went ahead and imported my version of the Ancient Historical Bookmarks file into both the latest beta of Google Chrome 3 and Tuesday 's final release of Mozilla Firefox 3.5 , so that they both have the same set of bookmarks ( other than what the manufacturers install there automatically ) .
Both browsers ' Bookmark Managers have the same names , and their windows are laid out quite similarly .
Knowing I might want to consider weeding out any 10 - year - old links to RealNetworks sound files in my archive , I started out conducting a search for real .
Both browsers are capable of turning up entries that contain those four letters in that order , at some point .
But right away , I see the difference : Firefox pulled up 13 items and Chrome only 12 , from the same bookmarks file .
What 's the extra bookmark ?
It 's an item called " Simple Regression Page , " which produces a line of a graph that best fits a set of variable conditions .
The letters " real " do n't appear in that page 's title whatsoever , so why did Firefox pull it up ?
Because " real " appears deep in the page 's URL .
Since the title page of a Web site may not actually contain the title of the site ( it 's been known to happen ) , and a URL is presumably more likely to contain that title , Firefox 's bookmark system searches both entries simultaneously .
However , Chrome 3 did pull up " RCP , " which was my abbreviation for RealClearPolitics.com as it appears on my links bar .
It did n't have " real " in its bookmark title , though it does appear in the URL .
But not deep in the URL , as was the case with the Simple Regression Page .
When Firefox first pulled up 13 entries and Chrome 12 , I wanted to know right away , which one was the odd man out ?
The easiest way for me to figure out would be to click on the Name bar at the top -- usually that sorts by name .
And for Firefox , it does .
Would you believe you can't sort bookmarks in Chrome 3 ; they can only appear in the retrieval space in the same order as they appear in the bookmarks list ?
You can click the Name bar in Chrome 3 until you 've worn a hole in your mouse ; it 's not going to do anything .
Now , you have to wonder , how long has this obvious omission remained in Chrome -- a sort button that does n't sort ?
Has n't anyone reported this ?
Is n't the purpose of beta testing to find problems so they may then be remedied ?
Or perhaps it 's the purpose of Google 's support forums to help users grieve and come to terms with omitted features .
Here is a support thread topic header from December 2008 : " There is no way to sort bookmarks in the bookmarks folder .
By name , by most recent , or otherwise . "
There are dozens of responses to this complaint -- a litany of comments , all of them from Chrome users only , the final one in the set having been posted last May 10 .
That entry contains a link to a Chrome plug - in -- quite literally , an independent British programmer last April created the bookmark sorter that Google neglected to include with its own browser .
To recap :
In less time than it takes an entire corporation , using what is purported to be an open programming process , to re-insert a feature that has been an historical component of a competitive browser ( which , by the way , is actually produced by some of the very same people , so they would have intimate knowledge of that component ) , a theology student in Monmouth , in his spare time in - between running a youth Bible study group and building motorsports racing simulations , comes up with a plug - in that , at least for some users , fills that feature gap .
What is wrong with this picture ?

Religion and science do not have to be at odds .
Science , said Ann Druyan , widow of Cornell astronomer Carl Sagan , can communicate with , learn from and even benefit from religion and vice versa .
Druyan , a writer and media producer who collaborated with Sagan for 19 years until his death in 1996 , reflected on dialogues in the early 1990s between Sagan and the Dalai Lama at a Sept. 28 lecture in Anabel Taylor Auditorium .
For the first time , film excerpts of the meeting between the two were shown in a public venue .
Sagan , Cornell professor and author of " Cosmos , " " Contact " and " Dragons of Eden , " among other books , was perhaps best known for his extraordinary ability to communicate science to the public .
" He wanted to share with everyone the wonder and awe that science inspired in him , " Druyan said .
She stressed that there were political motivations behind Sagan 's work as well : " Carl believed that you can't have a democratic society if you have a tiny scientific elite and a public who is uncomfortable with the methods and language of science , " she said .
Sagan entered the public eye in the 1960s -- a time rife with changes in both culture and thought .
The Catholic church had just switched from giving masses in Latin to local languages so that everyone could understand them , and Druyan said Sagan was trying to do the same for science .

The Dalai Lama , who has had a lifelong interest in science , first met with Sagan during a visit to Ithaca in 1991 .
Their discussion continued in India the following year , where the Dalai Lama cleared his calendar to spend a full day talking with Sagan and Druyan .
In the short segment shown of their conversations , Sagan asked the Dalai Lama about his beliefs in God and what he as a Buddhist would do if a discovery in science conflicted with Buddhist doctrine .
The Dalai Lama replied that even Buddha was said to question his teachings and that Buddhists rely on doctrine as " findings " rather than as " scripture . "
" If through thorough investigation things become clear , only then is it time to accept and believe , " he said .
" So is there no conceivable scientific finding that would make you no longer consider yourself a Buddhist ? "
Sagan responded .
The Dalai Lama said there would be no point at which his spirituality and his respect for science would come at such odds with each other .
" Buddhism is not so much a religion , but a ' science of the mind ' or an ' inner science ' ... there is much benefit to learning from [ scientists ' ] findings , " he explained .
Regarding the contributions of religion to science , Druyan said that while science has developed an amazing library of facts , it does not have the human social organization and the ability to inspire that religion has .
That 's why we have lost that magical excitement with space exploration that the world once shared , she said .
What science needs are more ambassadors .
" We do n't have a Carl Sagan right now , " she said -- a well - informed , ethical and passionate leader , versed in the arts and sciences , concerned about the planet yet willing to " get into any kind of trouble for the sake of the human future . "
Druyan 's lecture was one of many events on campus prefacing the Dalai Lama 's Oct. 9 visit to Cornell .
Many of the ideas she discussed are put forth in Sagan 's latest book , " The Varieties of Scientific Experience : A Personal View of the Search for God , " which she edited .

HONG KONG , June 27 ( Reuters ) - Ethnic clashes between Han Chinese and Uighur workers at a toy factory in China 's southern Guangdong province killed two people and injured 118 , a newspaper reported on Saturday .
In a massive night brawl at the " Early Light " toy factory in Guangdong 's Shaoguan city , a group of Han Chinese fought with Uighurs from China 's northwestern Xinjiang region who had been recently recruited to the factory , Hong Kong 's Ming Pao newspaper reported .
The violence lasted until the early hours of Friday morning and at least 16 were seriously injured , the newspaper reported .
About 400 riot police had to be deployed to quell the unrest as the rival workers battled , some with knives and metal pipes .
The violence was reportedly sparked by a spate of crimes at the factory following the arrival of around 600 Uighur workers in May this year , the newspaper said .
" Some people carrying metal pipes entered a dormitory to attack Uighur workers .
But the Uighurs fought back with knives , leading to a fierce brawl involving hundreds , " the newspaper said .
The factory was reportedly owned by Hong Kong tycoon Francis Choi , one of the city 's leading toy manufacturers .
Xinjiang 's majority Uighur population is a largely Muslim group with a culture close to other Turkic parts of central Asia .
Many Uighurs resent Han Chinese rule , complaining they 're marginalised economically and politically in their own land , while having to tolerate a rising influx of Han Chinese migrants .

News of modest improvements in the availability of credit in the economy were accompanied yesterday by warnings from Bank of England policymakers about the fragility of the recovery , and the success of the Bank 's policy of quantitative easing .
David Miles , a recent appointment to the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee and a former adviser to the Government on housing , told the Treasury Select Committee that any economic growth was likely to be " anaemic " and that the banks were on " life support " .
" It may be the case that we get what looks like a very sharp rebound over the next few quarters : one might interpret that as a V - shape , but that does n't really tell you an awful lot about what the likely path of GDP growth will be ...
The prospect of a rapid return to growth does n't seem a highly probable outcome .
But there are reasons for thinking the period of the most rapid declines in output is behind us , " he said .
" My hunch – and I put it no stronger than that – is that we have seen most of the overall aggregate house price falls . "

A week before the MPC meets again to review interest rates and quantitative easing , fellow committee member Tim Besley also cautioned that the policy would need more time to be seen to work .
" We will not know for sure whether quantitative easing has been directly effective in supporting nominal demand growth for some time , and a definitive assessment right now would certainly be premature , " he said .
Such comments suggest that a reversal , the " exit strategy " , is distant .
Some £ 100bn of a current " budget " of £ 125 bn has been spent .
A further £ 25bn is available from the initial allocation from the Chancellor of £ 150bn , agreed in March .
Some economists are now predicting that the Bank will ask Alistair Darling for an extension to the scheme in August , to coincide with the Bank 's Inflation Report , or even next week .
The European Central Bank left rates on hold , at 1 per cent , yesterday .
Vicky Redwood of Capital Economics commented : " The large amount of quantitative easing already undertaken could ensure that the recovery will be strong enough to bring inflation back to target .
So far , however , it still seems to be having limited success .
Bank lending , in particular , is still disappointingly weak given that commercial banks ' reserves with the Bank of England have now broadly tripled . "
The Bank 's latest quarterly Credit Conditions Survey states that there has been a " small increase " in the availability of lending in the three months to June , though unsecured credit has declined .
Credit availability to households and companies is expected to improve over the next few months .
Weak demand for credit is thought to be more of the problem now .
However , there was relatively little to cheer first - time buyers , with small deposits and mediocre credit ratings .
The Bank says that loan - to - value ( LTV ) ratios had remained " broadly unchanged " over the quarter , though lenders were now tightening up their credit - scoring criteria in readiness for increased lending to high LTV borrowers over the next three months " .
Meanwhile , the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development reported a continuing high level of redundancies : there were 300,000 in the first quarter .
Green shoots wither : Construction slips back
The contraction of Britain 's building sector accelerated again last month , and construction orders over the three months to May also dropped , adding weight to fears that the UK faces a " double dip " return to recession .
The construction purchasing managers ' index , a leading indicator of economy activity , had showed a brief lift in May .
But the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply ( Cips ) said yesterday that its index had dropped back by more than a point to 44.5 in June , still well below the break - even " 50 " mark .
Alongside wavering confidence in the future , historical data is also gloomier than expected .
Office of National Statistics ( ONS ) numbers for the three months to May , also published yesterday , show construction industry orders falling by 1 per cent compared with the previous three months , and 30 per cent year on year .
A brief flurry of " green shoots " last month raised hopes of an early recovery from recession .
Figures from the NIESR showed that the economy returned to growth in April and May , and rising manufacturing output appeared to corroborate the view that the worst was over .
But with banks still reluctant to lend , and concerns over public debt rising , the economy is in danger of slipping back , analysts warn .

I had a breakthrough moment last night .
It was on the IRC channel for one of my projects .
The developers , and the IRC ’s regulars , are a small and tight - knit group .
By a coincidence completely unrelated to the nature of the project , we ’re all firearms fanciers who take a firm line on Second Amendment rights .
Occasionally the IRC chat will turn from project - related technical matters to topics like the relative merits of various pistol calibers .
Occasionally people will show up on the channel looking for project - related help .
Some of them become semi-regulars on the channel because they ’re often working technical problems for which the project is part of the solution .
One of these guys hopped on the channel last night while we happened to be in the middle of a firearms digression , listened for a bit , and then started to spout .
“ Why do you guys think you need firearms ? ” “ Criminals will just take them from you and use them against you . ”
“ They ’re useless for anything but killing . ”
“ You ca n’t seriously think they ’re a deterrent against overreaching governments , the cops will just come for you you first . ”
And on and on and on , the same factually and historically ignorant babble civilian firearms owners are wearily used to hearing – as if civilian firearms had not been culturally and politically decisive in hundreds of struggles for freedom , from the American Revolution clear down to short - stopping Communist counter - coups in Russia and the Baltic States as recently as the 1990s .
I listened to the others on the channel offer polite , reasoned , factually correct counterarguments to this guy , and get nowhere .
And suddenly … suddenly , I understood why .
It was because the beliefs the ignoramus was spouting were only surface structure ; refuting them one - by - one could do no good without directly confronting the substructure , the emotional underpinnings that made ignoramus unable to consider or evaluate counter - evidence .
The need , here , was to undermine that substructure .
And I saw the way to do it .
This is what I said :
“ You speak , but I hear only the bleating of a sheep .
Your fear gives power to your enemies . ”
Ignoramus typed another sentence of historical ignorance .
My reply was “ Baa ! Baa ! Baaaaa ! ”
And another .
My reply was more sheep noises , more deliberate mockery .
And you know what ?
A few rounds of this actually worked .
Ignoramus protested that he was n’t a sheep .
At which point I asked him “ Then why are you disarmed ? ”
* CRACK *
The conversation afterwards was completely different , and ended up with ignoramus speculating about meeting with one of our regulars in his area to do things with firearms .
I learned a valuable lesson last night .
I ’m not normally a fan of mockery and attacks on a man ’s character over reasoned argument .
But when the real issue is in fact the man ’s character – specifically , when the issue is where he fits in terms of Dave Grossman ’s seminal essay on sheep , wolves and sheepdogs – then that ’s the level on which the argument has to be conducted .
I think , now , that gun owners need to be replying more often to hoplophobes simply by echoing their “ Baaa ! Baaa ! Baaaa ! ” back at them .
Because only that reaches the actual fundamentals of the thinly - rationalized anti-firearms prejudice we so often encounter .
And besides being more effective , it ’s in a sense a more honest kind of argument , too .
Because for many of us the fundamental emotional issue is the same , seen from the other side .
Yes , rational consideration of costs and benefits on both individual and social levels amply justifies firearms rights , but for many firearms owners that is surface structure .
The substructure is more like this :
We are not sheep .
We will not behave as sheep .
We are armed because we refuse to be sheep .
Very few of us are ever likely to be at a place and time when civilian firearms change the course of history .
Ordinary crime prevention is a far more likely outcome , but still … for most people , most of the time , the most important thing about bearing arms ( or its inverse , being willfully self - disarmed ) is not what it enables you to do to the other guy , but what it signifies and reinforces about yourself .
Will you be a sheep , a peasant , a subject , an endless means for anyone willing to use more force than you ?
Or not ?
You never know – someday , history might turn on your answer …
" Russia is considering a banking bail - out that will go further than measures taken by the US , as fears grow that
bad loans
could paralyse the economy . "
US bank bail - out
Analysts said such a plan could allow banks to declare the true level of bad loans on their balance sheets , which , once cleaned up under the programme , would break the credit squeeze and allow them to start lending again in 2010 .
About $ 100bn ( €72bn , £ 61 bn ) in domestic loans fall due by the end of the year and the central bank has said banks ’ profits would be totally wiped out if non-performing loans hit 10 to 12 per cent .
Standard & Poor ’s warned last week problem loans could reach as high as 38 per cent .
With inflation , high interest rates , a dearth of new credit and a sharp fall in commodity prices still squeezing companies , bankers say they fear non-performing loans could hit as much as 20 per cent of overall credit portfolios by the end of the year .
International ratings agencies Moodys and S&P have warned that Russia could need to spend as much as $ 40 bn recapitalising the banking system by the end of the year .
Under the draft bill being considered on Friday the prefs would be convertible into ordinary shares in 10 years ’ time should the bank be unable to pay back the bond when it matures in 2019 .
The recapitalisation funds would be limited to the top 55 banks in Russia ’s 1,100 - strong banking system , analysts said .
The draft bill says only banks with a minimum of Rbs50bn ( $ 1.6bn , € 1.4bn , £ 1.0 bn ) in assets would be eligible .
***
If the government continues to delay , “ this means that many banks will just stop operations .
They will continue to exist but they wo n’t be able to provide new loans , ” Ms Orlova said .
The government fears it could spend its entire Rbs4,000bn reserve fund and more , once it begins to recapitalise the private banking sector , she added .
But Yevgeny Gavrilen­kov , chief economist at Troika Dialog , the Moscow investment bank , said it would be best if the government did not attempt to interfere in the problem but concentrated on lowering inflation instead .

「 決し てWebをあなどってはいけない 」 （Never underestimate the Web） 。Google I / O 2009 初 日の基調講演でシュミッ トCEOに続いて登壇したのは、米グーグル
バイス・プレジデントのビック・グンドトラ氏だ。ゆっくりと一語一語を区切りながら語り始めたグンドトラ氏の言葉には重みがある。彼は元マイクロソフト社員で、まさにWebをあなどっていた側にいたからだ。
米グーグル バイス・プレジデントのビック・グンドトラ氏
グンドトラ氏 はWindowsプラットフォームを唱道する立場にあった。彼に限らず、マイクロソフト社員の間には、ネイティブアプリケーションでなければできないことがあるとする見方が一般的だったという。「Keyholeという会社が出てきたとき、彼らが持つようなアプリケーションこそ、ネイティブでなければできないものだと言っていた。ところがグーグルは2004年11月にKeyholeを買収し、Google Earthとしてリリースしたんです。その後、これはWebアプリケーションとしても動くようになりました」（グンドトラ氏）
「 Webアプリケーション開発の機は熟した」としたシュミットCEOの発言を裏付けるように、グンドトラ氏は次々と最新のHTML 5への同社の取り組みについて、デモンストレーションを交えながら熱弁を振るった。
「過去10年でJavaScriptは100倍速くなったのです。しかし、Webブラウザは単に速くなっただけではなく、機能的にも進化したのです」（グンドトラ氏）
Webの進化は速度だけでなく、機能的にもどんどんリッチになっているという
IE がない主要ブラウザの表
HTML 5の各機能について、主要Webブラウザの対応状況を示す表が大写しにされると、会場には徐々に笑いとざわめきが広がった。市場で最大のシェアを持つInternet Explorer 8が入っていなかったからだ。狙いどおりの笑いと戸惑いを観衆から引き出したグンドトラ氏は、ニヤリとして、こう述べた。
「 見ての通り、IEがありません。インターネットを進化させるためにマイクロソフトにできることは、もっとたくさんあるはずです。われわれは、彼らが実装するまで熱烈に待つことにしましょう。Internet Explorerに関するコメントは、今日はこれだけです」（グンドトラ氏）
HTML 5対応の表 に Internet Explorerは入っていない
特に語気を強めた 「 熱烈に 」 （eagarly）というときの口調には、Web標準やHTML
5の実装に消極的なマイクロソフトに対する皮肉が込められていたが、そこにはまた、自分たちはすでにゲームのルールを変えつつあるのだという自信も見え隠れしていたように思う。Google Chromeの普及率を見ると、一般ユーザーの間でのシェアは数％だが、開発者が集まるようなWebサイトでは、すでに大きな伸びを見せ始めている。
Firefox やWebKit、Chromeと、オープンソース系ブラウザの開発スピードの加速と参加者の増加をグラフで示しつつグンドトラ氏は、「すでに5億人のユーザーがオープンソースのWebブラウザを使っているのです」と指摘。HTML 5、次世代Webへ向かおうとするOSS開発コミュニティの大きなモーメンタムに、改めて聴衆の注意を振り向けた。
OSS 系 のWebブラウザの開発者数推移
「 XHR（XMLHttpRequest）のときと同じ過ちを繰り返さないようにしよう」（グンドトラ氏）。Ajaxという、Webアプリケーションにとっては大きなターニングポイントとなった技術を可能にしたXHRを初めて実装したのはマイクロソフトだった。しかし、同社がいかにマーケティングしてもXHRは広まらなかった。Ajaxという名前を得てXHRの威力が認識されるようになるまでには、皮肉にもGmailの登場を待たなくてはならなかった。XHRが登場したのは1999年だが、それから5年間も無視されたままだったのだ。「また10年も待つのはやめにしましょう。Webをもっと先へと進めていこうじゃないですか」（グンドトラ氏）
シュミッ トCEO の 「機は熟した」という発言と、グンドトラ氏の「待つのはやめよう」という呼びかけは重なる。HTML 5の多くの機能は「明日の Webテクノロジー」ではなく、IEを除く主要ブラウザですでに利用可能なものということだ。XHRのとき同様に、いまHTML 5に欠けているのはキラーアプリケーションなのかもしれない。
グーグルがイケてると思うHTML 5の機能
グンドトラ氏は 「 グーグルがイケてると思うHTML 5の機能」を、デモンストレーションを交えながら次々と紹介した。
最初に言及したのは2次元のベクターグラフィックを扱う「Canvas」だ。HTML
5以前の技術だと、Webブラウザに斜めの線を1本引くためには、サーバで画像を生成して送り出すぐらいしか方法がなかったことを指摘。それがcanvasタグで簡単にできるようになるという。
Canvasを使ったデモンストレーションは、これまでにもどこかで見たことがあるものが中心だった。マウスを使ったお絵描きアプリケーション、ファースト・パーソン・シューティングゲームのような動的な3Dポリゴン表示、Mozillaファウンデーションが取り組むWebブラウザベースのIDE「Bespin」……、だが1つ、目が覚めるようなアプリケーションがあった。これらに続いて表示されたアプリケーションに、会場は少しどよめいた。
Chrome上で動いていたのは、いわゆるパフォーマンスモニタだが、まるでネイティブアプリケーションのようなインタラクティブなUIなのだ。それは、ニューヨークタイムズがWebサイトのアクセス状況をリアルタイムで分析するためのモニタで、項目ごとにドリルダウンができたり、表示対象とする時間幅をマウスで増減させることができる。時間幅を変えると、表示されているグラフが動的にズームして伸び縮みした。
HTML 5 のcanvasタグを使ったパフォーマンスモニタの例。ネイティブアプリケーションであるかのような動的なUIが印象的だ
いずれブラウザ標準に？ 3D グラフィックアプリケーション
次にHTML 5の機能として紹介したのは3Dグラフィックアプリケーションを可能にするAPI、「O3D」だ。O3Dを使えば、ハードウェアアクセラレーションが有効なOpenGLベースのWebアプリケーションが作成できる。プラグインなので、IE、Firefox、Chrome、Operaで動く。
グンドトラ氏は冒頭 でGoogle Earthが、すで にWebアプリケーションであるかのような紹介をしたが、実際にはGoogle EarthはいまのところプラグインなしのWebブラウザ単体では動かない。しかし、今後、標準化が進めばHTML＋JavaScriptだけで3Dアプリケーションが作成できる可能性が高い。プラグインの提供は、ある意味では実験だ。「APIをどう設計すべきか」「どういうアプリケーションが可能となるか」といったことを探るプロトタイピングとして存在価値がある。
O3Dを含 むWebブラウザ向けの3D API については、すでに標準化作業 をWebブラウザベンダ間で開始しているほか、開発版のChromeには3D関連機能が統合されていてプラグインや拡張なしにO3Dが利用可能という。
O3D のデモンストレーション。ブラウザの中でシェーダーやテクスチャマッピングを使った3Dグラフィックが扱えるようになる。描画モデルはリテインモードと呼ばれるもので、JavaScriptなどから容易に操作できるという
YouTube もHTML 5のvideoタグで
YouTube がFlashなしで動く――HTML
5で利用可能になるvideoタグに関して、これ以上のデモンストレーションはないかもしれない。HTML
5版のYouTubeデモサイト（http://youtube.com/html5）は、Flashを使ったプレイヤーではなく、ごくシンプルなHTMLタグとJavaScriptで実現できる動画プレイヤーで構成されている。サムネイル画像にマウスオーバーすれば、タイムラグなしに再生が始まり、マウスが画像から外れれば再生が止まる。その応答性の高さは注目に値する。
HTML 5 のvideoタグは、タグを単体で指定してもビデオ埋め込みができるが、JavaScriptを使えば、もっと豊かな表現も可能だ。videoタグの別のデモンストレーションでは、再生中の動画を、Webブラウザ内で360度くるくる回すという派手な動きを実演してみせた。これまでJavaScriptを使って行ってきたことが、そのままvideoタグでも実現可能となる。
一見普通 のYouTubeだが、これはHTML
5のvideoタグを使って構築されたデモサイト（http://youtube.com/html5）
videoタグの応用 。JavaScriptやCSSで使えた表現手法がそのまま使えるため、再生中の動画を回転させることもできる
videoタグの実 例
ただ、videoタグについては、Firefox 、Chrome、Safari、Operaでサポートまたは実験的サポートが終わっているが、コーデックの問題は解決していない。Ogg（Vorbis＋Theora）はロイヤルティーフリーのコーデックとしてOSS実装も存在しているが、特許侵害のリスクがあることからアップルはSafariで採用していない。反対に、OperaはMPEG-4にロイヤルティーを支払うのを嫌い、Oggしかサポートしていないなど分裂している。
特許侵害かロイヤルティーの支払いなしに動画アプリケーションの作成は不可能とも言われている。videoタグはHTML
5の強力な機能拡張の1つだが、現時点では着地点が見えづらいのも事実だ。特許ビジネスとOSS（標準化）は相容れないことが多い。
位置情報はJavaScriptで取得可能に
HTML 5では、Webアプリケーション（JavaScript）から、PCやモバイル端末などのロケーション情報を取得できるようになる。基調講演にはMozillaファウンデーションのバイス・プレジデント、ジェイ・サリバン氏が登場して、最新のFirefox 3.5を使ったデモンストレーションを行った。
Firefox 3.5 でGoogle Mapsを開くと、ストリートビュー表示に切り替えるヒト型アイコンの上に見慣れない青いアイコンが現れる。これをクリックすると、地図が移動して現在地がポイントされる。位置情報はプライバシーに関わるため、利用者の承認を求める確認ダイアログが表示される。Firefox 3.5のデモではブラウザ上部に確認メッセージが表示されていた。
Firefox 3.5 でGeolocation APIを使った例。地図上に現在地が表示される
これはケータイ のGPSでは見慣れた利用シーンだが、JavaScriptを使い、モバイルでもPCでも同じAPIが利用できるということの意義が大きいだろう。すべてのWebアプリケーションが、利用者の位置情報を簡単なAPIで取得できるわけで、今後どんなアプリケーションが登場するのか想像が付かない。
位置情報の活用で、もっとも進化したプラットフォームはおそらくiPhoneやAndroid端末だろう。撮った写真をポストすると、地理的に近い場所で他人が撮った写真まで見えてしまうソーシャルアプリケーション「BrightKite」や、地図上で自分の位置情報を友人や家族と共有できる「 Google Lattitude」などがそれだ。Android端末でGoogleにアクセスすると、いきなり現在地が表示されてローカル検索が有効になるという例もある。位置情報の活用については、現在さまざまなアイデアが実験中とも言える。
位置情報 のAPIについては、現在W3Cで標準化が進みつつあるという。WebKitでも実装が進んでいて、再来週にも発表されると見られるiPhone 3.0も、このW3C の「 Geolocation API 」に準拠し たWebブラウザ （WebKitベース）を搭載する。デモンストレーションでは実際に、iPhone上でGoogle Latitudeが動く様子を披露してみせた。これは、iPhone向けに開発したものではなく標準API向けに作ったアプリケーションが、その標準を実装したブラウザで使えるようになったという意味で、単にiPhoneがGoogleの1サービスに対応したという以上の意味があるだろう。
もう1つ、位置情報の活用についてグーグルから説明があったのは、同社が全世界の主要地域で位置情報データベースを構築したというものだ。GPSは測位に時間がかかったり、うまく機能しないことが多く、一方IPアドレスベースの位置特定は精度が低い。そこで、ケータイの基地局情報も合わせて活用できるようにしたという。すでに日本国内では日常的に同様のことが行われているとはいえ、ここでもHTML＋JavaScriptでデバイスやキャリア、国を問わず、同じようにプラットフォームが活用できるということの意義は大きいだろう。
i Phone 3.0 で はW3C Geolocation APIに対応したWebKitが搭載されるので 、Google Latitudeも利用可能という
グーグルは全世界の主要地域に関して地理情報データベースを構築したという
オンライン/オフラインの区別がなくなっていくHTML
5
Webアプリケーションは 「 ネットにつながってさえいれば使える」と認識されてきたが、それはHTML 5で変わるかもしれない。
HTML 5ではアプリケーションキャッシュが可能となる。Webアプリケーションを構成するHTML、CSS、JavaScript、JPEGなどのファイルは、マニフェストファイルで指定した場所にキャッシュされ、オフライン時にはローカルストレージ上に保存したWebアプリケーションが稼働するようになる。また、ローカルPC（あるいはモバイル端末）上の簡易SQLストレージもHTML 5で使えるようになる。
デモンストレーションでは、この2つを組み合わせた付箋（ふせん）紙アプリケーションを実演。オフラインでも新規付箋紙の作成や編集が可能であることを示して見せた。デモのアプリケーションはApp Engine上で稼働していて、「 クラウド、HTML＋JavaScript、HTML
5対応Webブラウザ」という組み合わせの有効性を強調した格好だった。
オフラインにも対応す るWebアプリケーションの例。付箋紙の新規作成や編集はオフラインでも可能
アプリケーションキャッシュを利用するためのマニフェストファイル。ローカルの置き場所を指定する
グーグルはアプリケーションキャッシュの例として、iPhone/Android向けのGmailを挙げる。両スマートフォン向けのUIは、Ajaxを多用したインタラクティブなものに進化しているが、これらはオフライン時にもオンライン時と同様に動く。過去メールの全検索など、大きなデータセットを使うWebアプリケーションではオンラインの必要性はなくならないが、ちょっとした個人的データを扱う程度のWebアプリケーションなら、今後はオンラインとオフラインの差が消えていきそうだ。
注目のウェビーなモバイルプラットフォーム「webOS」も登場
HTML 5のローカルストレージAPIについては、webOSがアグレッシブに利用していることも注目だ。
webOSは、1度は死んだと思われたパームが放つ注目のモバイルプラットフォームだ。6月に出荷予定のモバイル端末「 Palm Pre」に搭載される。
webOS はLinux＋WebKitベースと、ソフトウェアスタックの下の方はiPhoneやAndroidと似ているが、決定的に違うのは、JavaScriptとHTMLをドラスティックにプラットフォームの中心に据えていることだ。カメラ機能など、デバイス、システム関連の機能もJavaScriptのAPI経由でアクセスできる。webOSでは加速度センサーにすらJavaScriptでアクセスできる。というよりも、JavaScriptが唯一の開発言語で、標準添付のアプリケーションもすべてJavaScriptで書かれているという。
米パーム、シニアバイスプレジデントのマイケル・アバット氏
webOSのUIはHTMLとJavaScript、CSSだけで作り込まれていて、写真アルバム上での写真の回転には、Webサイト上で写真を回転させるのとまったく同じやり方を使っているという。また、Webブラウザのヒストリは、HTML
5を使ったローカルストレージに保存しているという徹底ぶりだ。Objective-CやJavaによる開発が必要なiPhone/Androidに比べると、はるかに「ウェビー」（Webby：Webっぽい）なアプローチだ。
Google Mapsのアプリケーションも、わずかなHTMLとJavaScriptだけで提供されている。JavaScriptからシステムが保存するロケーション情報を取得しているのが分かる
こうした動的 なUIも標準的なHTMLとCSS、JavaScriptで実現しているという
WebブラウザのヒストリなどはHTML
5のローカルストレージに保存しているという
webOSが驚きと賞賛で迎えられようとしているのも（実際に使い物になるかどうか、売れるかどうかは未知数だが）、そもそもパームがJavaScriptだけでアプリケーション実行環境を作ると決断したのも、HTML
5を含むHTML＋JavaScriptの進化がスピードアップしているからだろう。コアエンジンへ開発リソースが集まり、各種APIの開発、議論、標準化が活性化する好循環が生まれている。この波に大胆に乗ったのがwebOSで、JavaScriptでハードウェアにアクセスするというのは理にかなったデザイン・チョイスだ。いまやJavaScriptはグラフィックス、位置情報、加速度センサー、ローカルDBなどにアクセスできる巨大な開発環境・エコシステムへと変貌しつつあるからだ。
ChromeではJavaScriptを使ったユーザーエクステンションの実装が着々と進められている。現在のところ、何らかのWebサービスのAPIを叩いてブラウザの下部にアイコンとして情報を表示させておくというサンプルがある程度だが、将来的には、ネイティブアプリケーションでのみ可能だったようなことがJavaScriptによる拡張でもできるようになるかもしれない。すでに同社は実験的実装として「 Native Client」と呼ぶプラグインを公開している。Native Client はOSやブラウザに依存せず、x86コードが稼働するサンドボックス環境を提供する。
Webアプリケーションにもバックグラウンド処理を
基調講演 でHTML 5の目玉機能として最後に挙がったのは「 Web Workers」だ。JavaScriptで並列処理やバックグラウンド処理を可能とするAPIだ。
HTML 5は仕様巨大化の懸念からモジュール化が進んでいて、「 Web Workers 」も文字通りの意味での「 HTML 5」の規格そのものではない。ただ、HTML
5を次世代Web標準の総称ととらえるなら、Geolocation API やWeb Socketsなどと並んで、間違いなくHTMLの世界に大きな進歩をもたらすAPIの1つだ。
Web Workersを使うと、時間のかかる処理や長期間生かしておきたい処理、複数のタブ間で共有したいライブラリや処理モジュールをバックグラウンドで起動することができる。
Web Workersを使った最初のデモンストレーションは、素数を小さい方から順に数え上げる計算処理を1つのタブで行いつつ、Webブラウジングを継続するというものだった。通常、処理が重くなるとほかのタブに影響を与えたり応答が悪くなるが、Web Workersではスムーズに動く。
次のデモンストレーションは、もう少しリアルなアプリケーションでのWeb Workersの可能性を感じさせてくれるものだ。
それは 、Webカメラからの入力 をWebページ上にリアルタイムで表示するWebアプリケーションで、表示中の画像イメージで動きのある部分を枠で囲むというものだ。この差分検出の処理は、バックグラウンドで走るWeb Workersのインスタンスが担当しているという。画像表示と画像処理を分けることで、こうしたアプリケーションが可能となるのだという。デモは滑らかで、ネイティブアプリケーションのように高速に映像に追随していた。

検索からスタートしたグーグルだが、最近では数多くのプロダクトをリリースし過ぎていて、戦略が見えづらいと指摘されることもある。特に、Androidのような畑違いの市場への切り込みは唐突だった印象を拭えない。しかし、HTML
5という軸でこれまで同社が取り組んできた製品や機能拡張を眺めてみると、クラウドからPC、モバイルに至るまで、そのすべての基盤に「HTML 5 ＋JavaScript」という一貫したモデルが存在していて、それを処理するための強力なプラットフォームを着々と築き上げてきたことが分かる。
OS は 単一で存在するものだったので 、 「 OS の次 はWebブラウザ」という話になると、ついPC上で動くWebブラウザを想像してしまいがちだ。しかし、グーグルがプラットフォームと呼んでいるものは、WebブラウザではなくHTML 5、もっと端的にいえばHTMLそのものと言えるのかもしれない。

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT : ( 212 ) 549-2666 ; media@aclu.org
BUFFALO , NY - A long - time lawful permanent resident fighting deportation will finally get a bond hearing after being held in immigration detention for five and a half years .
Late Friday , a district court ordered that the government must provide Errol Barrington Scarlett with a hearing within 60 days before an immigration judge where the government must demonstrate that he poses sufficient danger or flight risk to warrant his continued detention .
In his request for a bond hearing , Scarlett was represented by the American Civil Liberties Union , the New York Civil Liberties Union ( NYCLU ) and pro bono by Seyfarth , Shaw LLP .
" The court affirmed a basic constitutional principle : no one should be locked up for prolonged periods of time without a hearing to determine whether such detention is warranted , " said Michael Tan , an attorney with the ACLU Immigrants ' Rights Project .
" We are relieved that after five and half years , Mr. Scarlett will finally get his day in court , but thousands of other legal residents are still detained for months or years without the most basic element of due process – a bond hearing to determine if their detention is even necessary . "
The ACLU lawsuit , filed in U.S. District Court of the Western District of New York against the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) , charged that Scarlett 's prolonged immigration detention without a bond hearing violates the Immigration and Nationality Act ( INA ) and the right to due process under the U.S. Constitution .
Scarlett , originally from Jamaica , has lived in the United States for over thirty years and has four children and numerous siblings , all of whom are U.S. citizens .
Because of his family ties and longtime legal residence , he is eligible for cancellation of removal – a permanent form of immigration relief .
There is no evidence that Scarlett poses a threat to the community or a flight risk , yet the government has subjected Scarlett to years of mandatory detention while seeking to deport him based on a non-violent , decade - old drug possession offense for which he had already served his sentence .
During his lengthy detention , the government never gave him a hearing but only a string of " rubberstamp " custody reviews denying his release .
" We hope that this case will serve as a precedent for the many others who have been wrongfully detained , " said Arthur Eisenberg , Legal Director of the NYCLU .
The ACLU initially submitted a friend - of - the - court brief on behalf of Scarlett but then became his primary counsel after the magistrate judge recommended that Scarlett 's request for a hearing be granted .
Over the past few years , the ACLU has filed multiple lawsuits on behalf of individuals who have been held for prolonged periods of time while fighting their immigration cases .
Recently , the ACLU filed a class action lawsuit in the Middle District of Pennsylvania on behalf of lawful permanent residents who are being imprisoned without bond hearings in Pennsylvania jails while they fight their immigration cases .
Lawyers on the case , Scarlett v. The United States Department of Homeland Security Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement , et al. , include Tan and Judy Rabinovitz of the ACLU Immigrants ' Rights Project , Eisenberg of the New York Civil Liberties Union and Lorie Almon and Jeremi Chylinski of Seyfarth Shaw LLP .
More information on the case , including the court order , legal briefs and a podcast with Scarlett are available online at : www.aclu.org/immigrants-rights/scarlett-v-dhs-et-al

The regime in Iran is now desperately – and so far uncertainly – playing for time while it tries to work out just what is happening in the country and the forces that are now engulfing it .
The Council of Guardians has agreed to a recount of the disputed results .
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was seen off for the day to a summit in Russia .
Talks have been opened up with the main opposition leaders .
The foreign press has been effectively confined to barracks .
The authorities have warned against demonstrations but appear to have held back from trying to suppress them by force .
Is this the calm before the authorities marshal their forces to impose a crackdown à la Tiananmen Square ?
Or is it the reflection of a system now divided within itself and an establishment losing control of the situation .
The simple answer is that nobody knows and nobody can know until the strength of feeling around the country , on all sides , becomes clear .
The size of the popular outpourings and the fact that they have persisted and seem to be spreading to other cities , has taken the authorities by surprise and also given an opportunity for Ahmadinejad 's enemies within the establishment to bare their teeth .

These include Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , the former president and chairman of the important Assembly of Experts , rumoured to be in Qom gathering support to overturn the election result ; Ali Larijani , the Speaker of parliament ( the Majlis ) who was a rival to Ahmadinejad in the presidential election of 2005 and has come out to challenge the results of the election ; and Mohsen Rezai , the Secretary of the Expediency Discernment Council and former commander of the Revolutionary Guards , who stood against the President in these elections to garner only 680,000 officially counted votes .
Not for nothing is Iran home to one of the highest number of bloggers per head of population in the world .
Tehran is thick with rumours of plots and counter - plots .
Even the position of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , the Supreme Ruler , is said to be vulnerable .
The truth has probably a lot less to do with plotting and a lot more to do with simple confusion .
Ahmadinejad may have been absent yesterday but he is far from powerless .
A populist who has made his reputation attacking the corruption of the old clerical establishment , he can count not just on the votes of the rural majority but also the more formidable powers of the veterans of the Iran - Iraq war ( in which he served ) and the feared volunteer paramilitary forces of the Basiji .
Behind the scenes stands the ambiguous figure of Ayatollah Khamenei , the religious head of the country , who has so far supported Ahmadinejad and the forces of the hardliners but is ultimately charged with keeping the country whole and balancing the forces surrounding him .
Should the pressures of change prove too great , he is perfectly capable of throwing the country 's President overboard in the interests of unity just as he could give in to hardline advice and go for a clampdown .
For the moment , Khamenei will probably temporise , seeking to treat with the opposition candidates by offering concessions on the recount in the hope that Mirhossein Mousavi can call his followers to order and accept Ahmadinejad 's victory , even if by a reduced majority .
But that assumes the reformists will agree to accept that result and that Ahmadinejad will agree to any compromise .
It also assumes that the hardline forces will continue to hold back and that the students and radicals in the reform movement , having sensed change , will not accelerate their efforts to achieve it .
And of that no one for the moment can be certain .

Debian Maintainer .
With the closing of Debian bug # 531811 I am now officially a Debian Maintainer .
Although I 've been using Debian and related distributions for nearly a decade , for most of that time I 've been pretty happy just being an upstream developer and a downstream user .
That changed when I started learning and using Haskell some 6 months ago .
After using Ocaml on Debian for about four years I had grown spoilt by the work of the Ocaml Debian Maintainers who do a stellar job in keeping the everything Ocaml related in Debian up to date .
Any time I needed a new Ocaml library , it was nearly always just an apt - get install away .
Unfortunately Haskell on Debian is in a poor state in comparison to Ocaml .
My main aim in becoming a Debian Maintainer is to improve Haskell on Debian .
First of all , I will be packaging Haskell libraries .
So far I have make Debian packages of the following three Hackage packages :
haskell - curl - Haskell bindings for libcurl ( already in Debian unstable ) .
haskell - bzlib - Haskell bindings for libbz2 ( still in the new package queue ) .
haskell - unixutils -
An interface between Haskell and Unix - like operating systems ( still in the new package queue ) .
I have also joined the Debian Haskell Mailing List and hope to help out on packaging and improving the compiler version transition process .

Facebook is one of the world 's most popular social networking sites Popular social networking site Facebook is breaching Canadian law by holding on to users ' personal information indefinitely , a report has concluded .
An investigation by Canada 's privacy commission found the US - based website also gave " confusing or incomplete " information to subscribers .
Facebook says it is aiming to safeguard users ' privacy without compromising their experience of the site .
More than 200 million people actively use Facebook .
They include about 12 million in Canada , more than one in three of the population .
' Practical solutions ' Canadian Privacy Commissioner Jennifer Stoddart laid out the findings of the report at a news conference in Ottawa .
She accepted that Facebook regarded privacy issues as a top concern " and yet we found serious privacy gaps in the way the site operates " .
Jennifer Stoddart has the power to take Facebook to a federal court Facebook 's policy of holding on to subscribers ' personal information , even after their accounts had been deactivated , was one area that breached Canada 's privacy laws , she said .
The law requires organisations to retain such information only for as long as it necessary to meet appropriate purposes , she was quoted by the AFP news agency as saying .
The report said Facebook 's information about privacy practices was " often confusing or incomplete " , and urged the site to make its policies more transparent to users .
Facebook was also criticised for failing to adequately restrict access of users ' personal details to some of the 950,000 developers in 180 countries who provide applications , such as games , for the site .
In response , Facebook Chief Privacy Officer Chris Kelly told AFP it was working with the commission to resolve the issues .
" Overall , we are looking for practical solutions that operate at scale and respect the fact that people come to share and not to hide , " he said .
" We continue our dialogue and have every confidence that we will come to acceptable conclusions .
I think the concerns are fully resolvable " .
Ms Stoddart said she would review Facebook 's progress in 30 days .
Under Canadian law , she can take the case to a federal court to have her recommendations enforced , the BBC's Lee Carter in Toronto says .

MUSIC NEWS - The London - based band , One eskimO has been picked by Tori Amos to open for her upcoming " Abnormally Attracted to Sin " North American tour .
The dates kick off on July 10th at Seattle 's WaMu Theater , and then continue through mid-August ( see itinerary below ) .
And ,
One eskimO has announced the upcoming release of its much - admired self - titled debut on September 22 via Shangri -La Music ( buy the download to the previous Faithless album , below )
One eskimO is the brainchild of singer / songwriter Kristian Leontiou , and arrives with an impressive range of imagination that marks them as something extraordinary .
Produced by Rollo Armstrong ( Faithless , Dido ) , the music is an ambitious and affecting collection of widescreen modern pop , alive with iridescent textures and intricately crafted songcraft .
Songs like " Hometime " and " Kandi " ( featuring an indelible chorus sampled from Candi Staton 's classic " He Called Me Baby " ) are moving and expressive , touching upon such universal themes as love and heartbreak , success and failure .
The band 's " Givin Up " has already been featured on Los Angeles ' KCRW and was a " Song of the Day " pick .
And , the new release comes in tandem with a full - length animated film ( Passion Pictures ) in which the band members are represented by a delightfully drawn line - up of anthropomorphized animals , with Leontiou himself presented as the lonely Eskimo of the group 's moniker .
One eskimO 's unorthodox self - visualization adds idiosyncratic color and character to a captivating musical work already filled with invention and emotion .
The animation for the song " Hometime " has become an international sensation , receiving numerous honors at film festivals around the world , and a 2008 British Animation Award .
Also , the song , written while Leontiou recuperated from a snowboarding mishap in the Alps , was featured in Toyota 's environmentally aware " Why Not ? " campaign .

Situation Update
The U.S. Public Health Emergency for 2009 H1N1 Influenza expired on June 23 , 2010 .
On August 10 , 2010 , the World Health Organization ( WHO ) International Health Regulations ( IHR ) Emergency Committee declared an end to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic globally .
For information about CDC ’s response to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic , visit The 2009 H1N1 Pandemic : Summary Highlights , April 2009 - April 2010 .
Internationally , 2009 H1N1 viruses and seasonal influenza viruses are co-circulating in many parts of the world .
It is likely that the 2009 H1N1 virus will continue to spread for years to come , like a regular seasonal influenza virus .
See More on Past H1N1 Updates »
Vaccination
CDC recommends a yearly flu vaccination as the first and most important step in protecting against the flu .
The U.S. 2010 - 2011 seasonal influenza vaccine will protect against an H3N2 virus , an influenza B virus , and the 2009 H1N1 virus that emerged last year to cause the first global pandemic in more than 40 years and resulted in substantial illness , hospitalizations and deaths .
Seasonal 2010 - 11 vaccine has begun shipping from manufacturers and CDC recommends that everyone 6 months and older get a 2010 - 2011 flu vaccine for the upcoming season as vaccine is available .
With the trade deadline approaching the Pittsburgh Pirates are continuing their stingy ways .
Contract negotiations with middle infielders Freddy Sanchez and Jack Wilson are at a stand still and both are now expected to hit the trade market .
General Manager Neal Huntington said , “ They feel like we ’re awfully light both in years and dollars .
In our minds , the conversations are at a standstill . ”
Last week Huntington made offers to both players , both of which should be considered low ball ones .
Wilson was offered $ 8 million for two years , with a club option for 2012 and over riding his current club option of $ 8.4 million for 2010 .
Sanchez was offered only $ 10 million for two years .
A Sanchez extension would also void his vesting option which could pay him $ 8 million in 2010 .
So yea , low ball offers as both players would be taking pay cuts with Sanchez ’s being a forced pay cut .
Freddy ’s vesting option is based on 600 plate appearances , he ’s already at 349 so barring any injuries he ’ll easily hit that number .
The offer becomes even more of a joke when you also consider he ’s a three time All - Star .
There ’s a bigger problem here then low ball offers .
Are the Pirates negotiating in good faith or trying to make the fans think they ’re trying to keep the two talented players ?
It really all depends on who you believe .
If you believe Pirates management they are .
Huntington says , “ There ’s only one good outcome for us in the PR sense , and that ’s if both players sign .
For us to take a PR beating to make offers that were n’t genuine would n’t be a smart move .
We made these offers with the understanding that we wanted these players to stay here .
The first offer has expired .
But , as long as they ’re Pirates , we ’ll be open to considering keeping them . ”
After hearing that you would think he really wants to keep these guys .
You would think the negotiations are in good faith .
Huntington tries to paint the players in a negative light thou , implying that neither was willing to make a counter - offer .
“ Typically , in a negotiation , you get a counter - offer .
That ’s how conversations continue .
We ’ve not gotten that to this point .
We felt pretty strongly that our structure was in place but that we were open to some adjustments off it .
Not huge differences in years or dollars .
But if there was something that added value to the player , we ’re open to that . ”
The counter - offer statements are where the real problems begin .
Wilson , a player very open to staying in Pittsburgh if Sanchez is in the fold , is saying that the players were n’t even given a chance to negotiate .
“ Answer me this : How can we respond with counter - offers when we were told that those were take - it - or - leave - it offers ? ” Wilson said .
“ How do you counter that ? ”
Knowing the history of the Pirates and free agency you ’d have to believe Wilson .
It ’s really hard not to think he ’s telling the truth is n’t it ?
Looking back who was the last big ticket free agent ?
Who was the last high payed player that they actually kept ?
I ’m thinking hard right now but ca n’t think of one .
I know there has to be one but I ’m not going to research it , the point is the Pirates do n’t do it often .
In preparing this article , I read today ’s Pittsburgh Post - Gazette and there was something very troubling in it .
Huntington called himself an “ idiot ” for extending Sanchez ’s contract .
“ A year ago , I was an idiot for extending Freddy for $ 6 million .
And now , I ’m an idiot for not being willing to give him a heck of a lot more than that . ”
He ’s got somewhat of a point but then again he does n’t .
Last year was an off - year for Sanchez only batting .271 so yea the fans are going to call you stupid .
In 2009 , Sanchez is back to his .300 + average , already surpassed last years double total and almost matched his homerun production .
So you ’d have to say this is back to the normal Sanchez and 2008 was an aberration .
So Huntington in reality you are smart for the extension , and an idiot for not ponying up for 2010 .
He ’s one player that is definitely worth $ 8 million and probably more then that .
There ’s another reason that quote is troubling , not just because of Sanchez ’s production .
It ’s Huntington ’s constant need to defend himself to the media .
He ’s way to defensive and apologetic for apparent bad choices .
This is n’t the first time he ’s gone public like this , remember not to long ago he called the extension of Ian Snell a mistake .
After all this one can see the obvious problem with today ’s Pirates and it ’s not the money .
It ’s management .
With someone like Huntington at the helm there ’s no trust at all .
Big league ballplayers are not going to come to Pittsburgh with this guy making low ball offers .
Not with this guy calling his decisions and players “ mistakes ” .
Pittsburgh may be considered a small market , but they could compete if they really wanted too .
They ’ve got enough fans that would support this team if they too could trust management .
They ’ve got a very loyal fan base who just wants a team they can root for .
They want their favorites to stay , not be traded away or allowed to walk .
With a beautiful stadium like PNC Park , arguably the best in the league , there ’s no excuses .
The fans will come out if given a reason and the Pirates could be relevant again .
In attempt to make that happen , owners should first override their GM and get deals with these two players done .
Then a make a change at the general manager position .
Like humans , flies deprived of sleep one day will try to make up for it by sleeping more the next day , a phenomenon referred to as increased sleep drive or sleep debt .
And they 're hard to wake up .
So found Paul Shaw and colleagues at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis , who say their work will help unravel mysteries of human insomnia .
After generations of selective breeding , the researchers produced a line of flies that naturally slept just an hour a day — less than 10 percent of the 12 hours of sleep normal flies get .
When they were awake , the insomniac flies fell over more often .
" We sent them to experts in neurodegeneration in flies to see if their lack of sleep or the breeding had somehow damaged their brains , " Shaw said .
" But the experts said there were n't any physical brain abnormalities . "
Maybe they were sleepwalking , Shaw thought .
But no .
His lab previously isolated a biomarker for sleepiness that is present in flies and human saliva , and the insomniac flies had high levels of it .
The flies also were slower learners and gained more fat , two indicators for fly sleep deprivation that Shaw identified earlier .
Similar symptoms also occur in sleep - deprived humans .
Lead author Laurent Seugnet says that while the insomniac flies " clearly suffer consequences " from their lack of sleep , they also show some resistance to the adverse effects of sleep deprivation .
For example , while 70 hours of sleep deprivation will kill a normal fly , the insomniac flies can spontaneously go up to 240 hours without sleep and still survive .
" Overall , the flies are able to perform better than they should , given how much sleep they miss , " Seugnet said .
" That makes it tempting to speculate that insomnia is like drug addiction .
As it increases the body 's overall vulnerability and risk of collapse , it also seems to boost certain factors that help resist collapse . "
The findings are published June 3 in the Journal of Neuroscience .
The U.S. agreed to resettle 1,350 Palestinians displaced by fighting in Iraq , marking the largest resettlement ever of Palestinian refugees in the nation .
The decision appears to signal a shift in Washington 's previous position against resettling Palestinians out of concern about the potential impact on U.S. relations with Israel and the Arab world .
The resettlement , which is slated to begin this fall , is likely to elicit strong reactions from people on both sides of the Israeli - Palestinian conflict .

At the bottom of this post is a coupon code to give you a $ 50 credit at MyAds – this is not an affiliate promotion , just a take it or leave it offer from MyAds .
Over the last week or so I ’ve had the opportunity to see inside the MyAds from MySpace .
MyAds have been an advertiser here on ProBlogger for a month or two now ( consider that a disclaimer ) so I wanted to see for myself how it worked .
What I found was a very easy to use and pretty affordable way to advertise a product , service or even your blog .
In short – MyAds is a pay per click banner advertising system where you can advertise on MySpace and get your message in front of potentially millions upon millions of MySpace users .
You can use it with an advertising budget of as little as $ 5 a day and have a pretty good looking ad set up to run within just a few minutes using their ad building tool ( or you can upload your own using an uploader ) .
Worth noting before we go any further is that to run a campaign you need a US address and credit card .
As someone without either of these I could only go as far as designing an ad and testing out the targeting features .
I did however talk to a number of MyAds advertisers to get their feedback ( see below ) .
Setting up an ad is easy .
Even me as a design challenged guy got one set up in a few minutes .
I put a mock ad together for my 31 Days to Build a Better Blog Workbook .
Here ’s a screenshot of the page where you set up the ads ( click to enlarge ) :
As you ’ll see there are three ad size options and it ’s as simple as typing in your ad copy , adding an image , choosing a background color and adding in a destination URL .
You can then preview your and move on to working out who you want to see it as well as setting a budget .
On the following screenshot you ’ll see the section to choose your target audience :
As you make your choices about who you want to see the ad the grey area the bottom of the screen changes .
It shows you how many users on MySpace will potentially see your ad as well as giving you a suggested bid price for how much the ad might cost per click to run .
The targeting options look pretty good – not only can you target by demographics ( gender , age , education , relationships , parental status and location within the US ) but you can also choose categories of interests and occupations of the type of person you want to reach with your ad .
I tried a number of options and got the target number of people to reach quite focused and the suggested cost per click quite a bit lower than what you see in the above screenshot .
This enables you to increase the chances of conversion with your ad quite considerably .
All in all from where I stand MyAds seems like something that I ’d like to use if I were running an ad campaign for a product , service or even to launch a new blog .
I ’ve previously used similar ad systems on other social networks with some success and the easy of use of MyAds plus what looks like great targeting make it an attractive option .
How Does it Perform ?
Testimony from a Heavy User of MyAds
As I was unable to go much further in the process ( as a non US resident ) I approached a number of people to get their feedback on the ads .
One of those I talked with was Joe Frevola from Globalizer who uses MyAds quite extensively .
I asked Joe a number of questions to get his insight on the why and how of MyAds :
How have you used MyAds and How has it performed ?
Globalizer uses Myspace MyAds to buy media for our GlobalizerNetwork advertisers .
We have had tremendous success with several campaigns on MySpace and have been impressed with its powerful targeting tools , which we have utilized to target the demographics and interests of our audience .
In comparison with Facebook , it ’s hard to pick a clear cut winner and both should be a part of your media buy in most cases .
Each has advantages and disadvantages and the best choice of the two will vary based on the type of campaign you are running .
While MySpace ’s targeting tool is more organized and allows you to select keywords sorted by categories and sub categories , Facebook ’s keyword search tool allows you to access a more robust database of target interest .
MySpace does have useful demographic targeting that you ca n’t get with Facebook , such as the ability to specifically target mothers or recently married individuals .
Both MySpace and Facebook have solid targeting tools that should allow you to push positive ROI .
While the Facebook ad platform is global , you can only target US users on MySpace currently , however word is MySpace is adding new countries later in the year .
I would highly recommend the use of both ad networks to just about any advertiser .
Do you have any tips for using MyAds to share with ProBlogger readers ?
There are some tricks to getting the most out of MySpace MyAds .
Globalizer runs a lot of lead generation campaigns that drive a very high response , but do n’t pay high bounties per conversion and therefore do n’t allow us to pay very high CPC’s .
Often , when you start a campaign with a very low CPC , the ads delivers very little or no volume at all .
We find that in order to kick start this sort of campaign , we overpay on CPC in the beginning and fully expect to take a short term loss as MySpace ’s optimization system values the quality of our offers .
In the end , the system just wants to back into the highest eCPM , so the fact that our ads are driving very high click through rates more than compensates for the lower CPC .
Once the campaign starts getting significant delivery , we are able to adjust our rate down to a profitable number and continue to experience a great a volume of traffic .
Also , when you first start running a new campaign on MySpace , definitely go with your gut and select targets that you feel will have the best chance of success with your offer .
However , do n’t neglect to test various demographics that you might not think would typically perform with your ads .
You will often be surprised at the demos that respond to your offers .
Get $ 50 Credit with This Code
If you ’d like to test MyAds for yourself ( IF you ’re in the US ) they ’ve given me a coupon code for ProBlogger readers to try it out and get $ 50 credit to use in doing so .
You need to be new to MyAds to redeem it ( ie if you ’ve already used MyAds it ’s not redeemable ) .
To use it – just design an ad and at the end of the process use the coupon code of Pro50 .
Of course this is only for those who are residents of the US and have US address and credit card details .
Baltimore , MD -- Scientists working at the Carnegie Institution 's Department of Embryology , with colleagues , have overturned previous research that identified critical genes for making muscle stem cells .
It turns out that the genes that make muscle stem cells in the embryo are surprisingly not needed in adult muscle stem cells to regenerate muscles after injury .
The finding challenges the current course of research into muscular dystrophy , muscle injury , and regenerative medicine , which uses stem cells for healing tissues , and it favours using age - matched stem cells for therapy .
The study is published in the June 25 advance on - line edition of Nature .
Previous studies have shown that two genes Pax3 and Pax7 , are essential for making the embryonic and neonatal muscle stem cells in the mouse .
Lead researcher Christoph Lepper , a predoctoral fellow in Carnegie 's Chen - Ming Fan 's lab and a Johns Hopkins student , for the first time looked at these two genes in promoting stem cells at varying stages of muscle growth in live mice after birth .
As Christoph explained : " The paired - box genes , Pax3 and Pax7 are involved in the development of the skeletal muscles .
It is well established that both genes are needed to produce muscle stem cells in the embryo .
A previous student , Alice Chen , studied how these genes are turned on in embryonic muscle stem cells ( also published in Nature ) .
I thought that if they are so important in the embryo , they must be important for adult muscle stem cells .
Using genetic tricks , I was able to suppress both genes in the adult muscle stem cells .
I was totally surprised to find that the muscle stem cells are normal without them . "
The researchers then looked at whether the same was true upon injury , after which the repair process requires muscle stem cells to make new muscles .
For this , they injured the leg muscles between the knee and ankle .
They were again surprised that these muscle stem cells , without the two key embryonic muscle stem cell genes , could generate muscles as well as normal muscle stem cells .
They even performed a second round of injury and found that the stem cells were still active .
The scientists then wondered when these genes become unnecessary for muscle stem cells to regenerate muscles .
It turned out that these embryonic genes are important to muscle stem cell creation up to the first three weeks after birth .
What makes the muscle stem cells different after three weeks ?
The scientist believe that these two embryonic muscle stem cell genes also tell the stem cells to become quiet as the organism matures .
After that time is reached , they " hand over " their jobs to a different set of genes .
The researchers suggest that since the adult muscle stem cells are only activated when injury occurs ( by trauma or exercise ) , they use a new set of genes from those used during embryonic development , which proceeds without injury .
The scientists are eager to find these adult muscle stem cell genes .
" We are just beginning to learn the basics of stem cell biology , and there are many surprises , " remarked Allan Spradling , director of Carnegie 's Department of Embryology .
" This work illustrates the importance of carrying out basic research using animal models before rushing into the clinic with half - baked therapies . "

The research was funded by the Carnegie Institution , NIH , and the Riley Children 's Foundation .
The Carnegie Institution for Science ( www.CIW.edu) has been a pioneering force in basic scientific research since 1902 .
It is a private , nonprofit organization with six research departments throughout the U.S. Carnegie scientists are leaders in plant biology , developmental biology , astronomy , materials science , global ecology , and Earth and planetary science .
Over the years ,
The Simpsons cast has ballooned well into the hundreds .
That 's a lot of faces to keep track of , and some will always stand out more than others .
One who immediately stood out from the pack is young Ralph Wiggum .
This cheerful young lad is a bit lacking in brainpower , but he makes up for it with some of the most memorable quotes in all of Springfield .
That 's why we decided to pop our DVDs in the player and go over the past 20 seasons ( and one movie ) to pick out the very best of the bunch .
In this Line - O - Rama feature , we honor our very favorite Ralph-isms , in no particular order . and add them to Ralph 's growing list of short bus humor .
There are plenty more lines worthy of making this list , and we may just compile your top picks into a Readers ' Choice feature soon .
Sadly , +Ralph+can't +spell +
Making Good Introductions " Hi , Super Nintendo Chalmers ! " Bart Gets an A " ( Season 10 Ralph is not the world 's greatest wordsmith , but that tends to lead to some comically bungled conversations .
He frequently refers to his teacher Ms. Hoover as " School Mommy " .
And in this episode , he developed a pet name for Superintendent Chalmers .
Everyone but Ralph is aware of the absurdity of his own dialogue , but that 's half the fun .
Ralph's Survival Skills " I eated the purple berries .
They taste like burning ! " " Das Bus " ( Season 9 When Springfield Elementary 's Mock U.N. was marooned on a tropical island ( apparently Springfield is the only American city to have those ) , their rigid social order quickly devolved into a Lord of the Flies - esque scene of chaos .
Ralph , ever industrious as he is , quickly went in search of food .
That 's where he found a stash of purple berries .
Naturally , Ralph helped himself , leading to this memorable quote .
Ralph was down for the count for most of the episode , but he had already left his mark .
30 Crimes the Government Chooses to Not Label Terrorism
We recently looked at why the government and the press ( outside of some bloggers and opinion columnists ) have not labeled the murder of an abortion provider as â€œterrorism .â€ 
Itâ€™s important to remember , though , that this isnâ€™t an isolated incident .
The word terrorism is used by the FBI and Department of Justice only when it fits a certain political agenda .
The government has systematically labeled animal rights and environmental activists who have never harmed anyone as â€ œthe number one domestic terrorism threat.â€ 
Yet the term is not applied to individuals who have committed much more serious ( and often violent ) crimes either for personal gain or for right - wing motives .
Here are 30 cases that the government has chosen to not label as â€œterrorismâ€ :
Of course we could keep going , there ’s no shortage of examples to draw from .
To be clear , I am not arguing that all of these examples are in fact “ terrorism ” ( I ’ll be outlining what I think are the top criteria for defining acts of terrorism in a future article ) .
But if the government defines “ terrorism ” so broadly as to include releasing mink from fur farms and protesting legally while wearing masks , then why do n’t any of these qualify ?
Sure , Yahoo might be second in search ( which is still , in and of itself , pretty good ) , but the company is far from a has - been — I know a ton of startups that would kill for the eyeballs that it snags in many of its market categories , and some established companies ( Google , AOL , Microsoft , to name a few ) that would love them , too .
In CEO Carol Bartz , Yahoo finally has a messenger : someone to remind the world that there is more to the company than just search .
In a May 2009 interview with CNBC Silicon Valley bureau chief Jim Goldman , Bartz got heated when he said something about Yahoo “ picking up the scraps in the marketplace “ :
We are n’t picking anything up … We are the market we are in .
We are very very good in providing people with the information and content they need .
We are not a search company …
You do n’t go to Google to find out what ’s happening in the financial world .
You do n’t go to Google to connect up with groups that you are interested in .
You do n’t go to Google to get the headline news of the moment .
That ’s not what happens there …
We ’ve got the No. 1 finance site , news site , sports site , No. 1 mail by two times in the world , our Messenger is big , Answers we are No. 1 .
Well , OK then .
Just how big are Yahoo ’s various properties ?
We reached out to comScore to get some idea on how dominant the company is in its various markets :
Yahoo News is the No. 1 news and information site in the country , with more than 50 million monthly unique readers , ahead of The New York Times network ’s 45 million .
Yahoo Finance has more than 20 million monthly unique readers , well ahead of AOL Money ’s 14 million .
Yahoo Sports beats the competition with almost 25 million monthly users .
ESPN is No. 2 with 21 million .
Yahoo ’s OMG !
entertainment page scored more than double the traffic — more than 20 million monthly unique users — of its nearest competitor , AOL ’s TMZ , in May .
TMZ had just shy of 10 million visitors .
Yahoo Games is in a near tie with EA Online , though it has strong tie-ins to EA ’s video game franchises like the Sims 3 .
Both companies had more than 19 million unique visitors in June , with Nickelodeon Casual Games — a more direct Yahoo Games competitor — logging 17.5 million unique visitors .
Yahoo Mail demolishes the competition , grabbing two - thirds of the total webmail market with 103 million unique visitors .
Hotmail had almost 48 million , with AOL and Google lagging behind with 38 million and 36 million visitors , respectively .
Flickr , Answers , Music , TV and Movies also do very well in their categories .
With all the focus on search , it ’s easy to forgot that this is also what Microsoft was trying to buy in Yahoo .
Here are the actual numbers from a few choice categories :
News / Information Total Unique Visitors Yahoo !

The United States has just acquired a new client state -- one with 170 million people , nuclear weapons , an Islamist insurgency and Osama bin Laden .
And that ’s the good news .
The country is Pakistan , and last week it officially became the Obama administration ’s biggest and most daunting rescue mission .
For months , the administration has been inching toward a deeper commitment of American dollars , military trainers and civilian advisors to strengthen Pakistan ’s government and security forces -- not for humanitarian reasons but to stop the country from drifting into the arms of Al Qaeda and the Taliban .
Last week , at a three - way summit meeting of President Obama , Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari and Afghan President Hamid Karzai , a relationship that had been tentative and prickly began to look more like a long - term commitment .
“ I ’m not going to say we turned a corner , but I am going to say we opened a new chapter , ” said special envoy Richard C. Holbrooke , briefing reporters at the White House .
“ It exceeded our hopes . ”
Advertisement
Holbrooke and Gen. David H. Petraeus , the U.S. military commander in the region , said they now expect to see more Pakistani cooperation with the U.S. - led campaign against Taliban forces in Afghanistan and a “ substantial ” Pakistani military campaign against the Islamist insurgents who have taken over the Swat Valley and other parts of northern Pakistan .
In return , the U.S. will dramatically increase aid to Pakistan , both military and civilian .
But Holbrooke , a veteran of nation - building since Vietnam , was careful to add a caveat : “ The real question is , will it produce results ? ”
The United States and Pakistan have a long history .
During the Cold War , the United States supported military - dominated regimes in Islamabad , seeing Pakistan as essential to containing the spread of communism .
But that alliance fell into a decade - long freeze over Pakistan ’s pursuit of nuclear weapons .
After the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 , President Bush made an alliance of inconvenience with Pakistan ’s military leader , Gen. Pervez Musharraf , to seek his help against Al Qaeda and the Taliban .
Under the arrangement , Pakistan ’s armed forces bill the Pentagon for counter - insurgency operations ( and pad the expense account , U.S. auditors say ) .

Pakistanis were annoyed that they got little American help for their shaky democratic institutions or their economy and feared that the United States loved India , their traditional enemy , more .
Americans did n’t see much evidence that the Pakistanis were looking for Bin Laden or breaking off their intelligence service ’s long , deep relationship with the Afghan Taliban .
Now both sides say they are serious about building a deeper , broader relationship .
What ’s changed ?
Fear .
Until last month , many Pakistanis dismissed the Islamist insurgencies in their western badlands as peripheral .
But after a faction of Pakistani Taliban took control of the Swat Valley ( as close to Islamabad as East Hampton is to Manhattan , Holbrooke likes to say ) and began moving into adjoining regions , they finally became alarmed .
The Obama administration also reacted sharply .
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton called Pakistan ’s instability “ a mortal threat to the security and safety of our country and the world . ”
After initially making a deal to pacify the militants , Pakistan ’s armed forces agreed that they could not allow the Swat insurgency to stand .
Even before Swat , Petraeus said , Pakistan ’s armed forces had begun putting more resources into their gritty struggle against insurgents in the west ( as opposed to the traditional , large - scale conflict with India to the east ) .
“ The Frontier Corps used to be underpaid , underfed , underclothed and underequipped , ” he said .
“ They are much more comparable now ” to Pakistan ’s regular army .
Advertisement
Another key change :
The intelligence chiefs of Pakistan and Afghanistan have decided to work with each other , even if they do n’t completely trust each other , in a three - way collaboration with the CIA .
American intelligence and military officers have long worried that Pakistan ’s Inter - Services Intelligence would tip off terrorists about planned U.S. operations ; now the U.S. intends to let the Pakistanis know in advance of military sweeps on the Afghan side of the border , to give them a chance to intercept Taliban fighters should they choose to .
The Obama administration wants the Afghans and Pakistanis , long wary of each other , to cooperate .
Last week , the evidence of progress on that front was limited mostly to mundane issues such as cross - border truck transport and water resources .
The two governments have been so distant from each other that their interior ministers , responsible for their police forces , had never met until they came to Washington .
Obama ’s main message to Pakistanis last week was that he ’s making “ a lasting commitment , ” not just another brief military arrangement .
“ And that is why I ’ve asked Congress for sustained funding , to build schools and roads and hospitals , ’ Obama said .
“ I want the Pakistani people to understand that America is not simply against terrorism ; we are on the side of their hopes and their aspirations . ”
That message was also meant , of course , for the president ’s other audience : Congress .
The administration is proposing $ 7.5 billion in economic aid and at least $ 3 billion in military aid for Pakistan over the next five years , a major increase on both counts .
The proposal is likely to succeed , at least at the outset ; the events of the last year have built a bipartisan consensus behind a major effort to stabilize Pakistan .
But Congress is full of skeptics -- not only Republicans but liberal Democrats with long memories .
Advertisement
Rep. David R. Obey ( D - Wis. ) , chairman of the House Appropriations Committee , was blunt enough to say that Pakistan reminded him of Vietnam .
“ The problem is not the administration ’s policy or its goals , ” he said .
“ The problem is that I doubt that we have the tools there that we need to implement virtually any policy in that region . ”
There are plenty of reasons for skepticism .
The problems are huge , the Pakistani government ’s track record is abysmal and the U.S. government ’s tools are few .
That $ 7.5 billion in economic aid would come to about $ 9 per Pakistani per year .
But this round could be different .
Until now , Pakistan was on the periphery of American concerns ; now it ’s a central focus .
Until now , Pakistani military leaders dismissed the Islamist insurgents as a minor annoyance ;
Swat is starting to change some minds on that .
And we are a long way from the days when Bush lauded Musharraf as a great man ; Zardari , the unimpressive widower of the late Benazir Bhutto , won no such endorsement .
Obama has taken on the problems of Pakistan as his own , but at least he has done so with his eyes open .

NASA ’s Spitzer Space Telescope has captured this new image of M33 , also known as the Triangulum Galaxy , and released it as part of the “ Around the World in 80 Telescopes ” event for the International Year of Astronomy .
Besides the pretty colors , the new image reveals something else about M33 : it ’s more than meets the eye .
M33 is located about 2.9 million light - years away in the constellation Triangulum .
It is a member of what ’s known as our Local Group of galaxies .
Along with our own Milky Way and Andromeda , the group of about 50 galaxies travels together in the universe , bound to one another by gravity .
In fact , M33 is one of the few galaxies that is moving toward the Milky Way despite the fact that space is expanding , causing most galaxies in the universe to grow farther and farther apart .
The new image reveals M33 to be surprising large – bigger than its visible - light appearance would suggest .
With its ability to detect cold , dark dust , Spitzer can see emission from cooler material well beyond the visible range of M33 ’s disk .
Exactly how this cold material moved outward from the galaxy is still a mystery , but winds from giant stars or supernovas may be responsible .
The image is a three - color composite showing infrared observations from two of Spitzer instruments .
Stars appear as glistening blue gems ( several of which are actually foreground stars in our own galaxy ) , while dust rich in organic molecules glows green .
The diffuse orange - red glowing areas indicate star - forming regions , while small red flecks outside the spiral disk of M33 are probably distant background galaxies .
As for the technical details , the blue parts of the image represents combined 3.6 - and 4.5 - micron light , and green shows light of 8 microns , both captured by Spitzer ’s infrared array camera .
Red is 24 - micron light detected by Spitzer ’s multiband imaging photometer .

I wonder if the PostgreSQL development team had any idea .
After all , when you go about the incredibly difficult task of building ( that is , coding ) a relational database , you do n't think : man , this thing will one day achieve mass popularity as the storage repository of choice for tens of thousands of real - money online poker players .
Do you ?
You do n't wonder how long it will be until a group of people in Austin , Texas , in a dilapidated basement not far from 6th Street ...
... subvert your open - source database as a cog in the gearworks of an intricate online poker botting rig ; nor how many other people will do the same thing in Dallas , and New York , and L.A. , and London , and Paris , and Leipzig , and Hyderabad , and Rio , those elusive poker botting hatcheries springing up out of nowhere and from nothing , like underground massage parlors or Northern Cali marijuana grow - houses or seedy all - night poker clubs conducting business in smoke - filled back - offices in nondescript greater metropolitan area office parks .
You would n't consider or even be aware of the thousands upon thousands of PokerTracker and Hold 'em Manager users who'll flock to your database , learning its ins and outs , getting their hands dirty , occasionally even parlaying an end - user poker player 's knowledge of a third - party online poker tool into a job as a full - time database administrator .
And you 'd never ( in your hypothetical shoes as a PostgreSQL contributor ) be able to predict that certain dedicated poker players would take it upon themselves to learn SQL and relational database theory / practice , delving into the arcane ( to a normal person ) minutiae of keys and joins and tables and DDL and DML , all in order to better use a third - party online poker tool originally written by a single developer with an MS Access database ; now thankfully running on a PostgreSQL back - end .
These things happen , but they can't be predicted .
And I guess that the application of open - source technology to a game as viscerally competitive as poker is not without irony .
Software - assisted poker is n't the noblest use of open - source technology that can be imagined ... but it is one of the most interesting .
The evolution of online poker from its naive roots into the tooled - up search - and - destroy seven - headed acid - spitting monster of today is fascinating , at times profound , colorful , even crazy .
Degenerate .
But always interesting ...
And it all started with those pesky goddamn text files .
Since the dawn of online poker ( more or less ) , players have had the ability to request hand histories — textual , step - by - step descriptions of each and every hand of poker played by the player while playing .
After all , it 's poker over the Internet for real money ; some sort of formal , human - readable game record is essential .
And early on , on some sites at least , the way you got these hand histories was over email , usually via sort of automated " Request Hand Histories " window .
You 'd go in and say " hey , give me my last 100 hands , " and you 'd get an email containing the textual history of those hands .
Bada bing .
And that was fine , for a while .
It meant you could do post - mortem analysis , to a certain extent .
If you played an interesting hand or won or lost big in a killer session , you could request the hand history and sanity - check your play or maybe email it to a friend ; whatever ; you had the record .
But the thing which had earth - shaking ramifications for poker as a whole was that textual hand histories enabled the crowdsourcing of poker strategy .
( Also , the Internet may have had something to do with it . )
You know what I mean by crowdsourcing .
I 'm talking about the Online Poker Tactical RFC .
Here 's how it works :
Take a textual hand history .
Cut - and - paste it into a post in a poker forum .
Ask for advice .
For the first time in history , players could get tactical and strategic feedback from dedicated players around the world , and not just generic advice , but specific advice pertaining to the exact play of a specific hand or poker scenario , taking into account all the factors : stack sizes , position , exact bet amounts , and so forth .
And as you know if you 've spent more than two seconds in a poker forum like CardsChat , this trend is alive and well to this day .
( Sadly , the original home of the Tactical RFC , rec.gambling .poker , is now an empty lot littered with beer cans and cigarette butts .
Spam City . )
Anyway , the idea of the hand history as a formal textual record of a single hand of poker gained consensus early on .
And not too much time passed before certain enthusiasts got the idea of subjecting these hand histories to computerized analysis .
After all , it does n't take a genius to figure out that rigorous number - crunching of a player 's complete set of hand histories might yield useful and / or interesting data .
And although hand history formats differed ( and still differ ) from site to site , within a site they were fairly uniform , which in turn meant that it would n't be too difficult to build a hand - history analyzer : a tool which a ) reads in a bunch of hand histories and b ) extracts meaningful data from them .
The idea was kicked around on rec.gambling .
poker and other forums for a spell , and the early poker / programming pioneers descended into their basements and concocted little one - off pieces of software which could parse this or that kind of hand history from such - and - such an online poker site .
I myself wrote ( or started writing ) no less than three of these .
But no single tool achieved real mindshare until PokerStat was released in 2001 .
The original rec.gambling .
poker thread announcing its release is like taking a glimpse into another world :
Hi all , I 've been spending the past several months writing a Paradise Poker hand analysis software for Windows .
It will have : 1 . you and other 's starting cards play
2. you and other 's statistics like win rate in terms of money and big bets
3. ability to leave player comments and notes
4. you and other 's play in the blinds ( improve your EV when stealing blinds ! )
5. how you and your opponents play when raising preflop
And to be added ...
6 . tourney support ( results plus hand histories )
7. filter to only view blinds play , exclude blinds play , view by position , etc ...
8. list of players , see who the top players are and the worst players are in your database
9. other things to be added before the final release ( any ideas ? )
Ah , the innocence .
Now it 's important to understand that as of 2001 , hand history acquisition was still treated as something a player might occasionally want to do .
The idea was that if you played an interesting hand or session , or if you had some question about how the money had been awarded in a certain pot , you could request the hand history .
It was a manual , email - centric process and that was okay , because what would you do with a mountain of 250,000 hand histories anyway ?
Write a program to sort through them all ?
Ridiculous .
And so the online poker sites provided no mechanism for generating or storing hand histories locally , on the user 's machine , and they provided no mechanism for automatically requesting hand histories from the poker site .
PokerStat did n't change any of this .
What PokerStat did do was :
Popularize the notion of the hand - history analyzer as a valuable standalone tool .
Invent the concept of automated hand history acquisition ( see below )
Inspire other developers to build bigger - and - better hand history analyzers .
In other words , PokerStat paved the way for PokerTracker .
The PokerTracker.com domain name was registered on 19 March 2002 , roughly one year after the release of PokerStat .
Shortly after that , the community took up the PokerTracker vs. PokerStat debate , as in the following rec.gambling .
poker missive from 2003 :
Hello , I am a registered user of PokerStat .
I have n't used it for about three months , and have some questions about it and the new software called PokerTracker .
PokerStat Questions : 1 . Is there an update coming that will support Party and Stars ?
2 . If so , will it automatically capture and process histories from these sites like it does with Paradise ( I love this feature ) ?
3 . If # 2 is coming , will this new version allow playing on tables from different sites simultaneously ?
4 . If # 1 is true , will it allow different names on different sites ( my Paradise login name was already in use when I signed up for Party and Stars ) ?
5 Am I a " lifetime " member now that I have version 2 ?
I paid for the software initially , then I had to pay again to upgrade if I 'm not mistaken .
PokerTracker Questions : 1 . Does it have an automated feature to request hand histories ?
2 . Does it have an automated feature to log in to a POP mail server ( like PokerStat ) ?
3 . Does it track multi-table tournament results on Stars ?
4 . If the answer to any of the above is " no " , are these features planned for future versions ?
Questions about both : 1 . Do these packages track session statistics ?
2 . If so , how well do they handle multiple tables at a time ?
3 . How do they handle hourly win/loss with multiple tables ?
Finally , what are your overall impressions of these packages ?
How useful are they compared to , say , tracking sessions on a spreadsheet ?
Thanks for any info .
Phil
Again , at this point in time you still had to request hand histories manually from the poker site .
But notice two of Phil 's questions :
1 . Does it have an automated feature to request hand histories ?
2 . Does it have an automated feature to log in to a POP mail server ( like PokerStat ) ?
PokerStat was the first online poker tool to take a stab at automated hand history acquisition .
You gave it your incoming mail server address along with a username and a password , and PokerStat would go out every so often and fetch / analyze your hand history emails .
This functionality was duplicated in PokerTracker v1 , and still exists today , six years and two major version releases later :
The appearance of this sort of feature in both of the major hand history analyzers of the day is indicative .
What had happened is that players had started to realize that hand histories are a potential goldmine of information .
It suddenly became important to request ALL of your hand histories , boring hands and interesting hands alike .
And as you can imagine , doing this manually ( by requesting hand histories , fiddling with email , etc. ) over the course of an intensive 8 - or 12 - hour poker session was both tedious and error - prone .
So in response to that , first PokerStat and then PokerTracker incorporated Import from Email and Auto - Request Histories functionality , and for a while this was a big selling point .
Now this idea of automated hand history acquisition and analysis is powerful ; even revolutionary , at least within the world of poker .
It meant that hand histories were no longer strictly a subject for post - mortems .
If you could automate the process of delivering and analyzing those hand histories , you could run your hand history analyzer on hands as you played them , in punctuated real time .
If you could then complete the feedback loop by providing the player with real - time information on the opponents he 's facing at the table right now , you 'd have a full - fledged online poker assistant , an intelligent agent whose job is to :
Parse incoming hand histories
Analyze the resulting data Communicate it to the player
This would ultimately lead to the development of the next piece of the online poker equation , the HUD ( heads up display ) , first in primitive versions such as PokerStat 's " manual HUD " , and later with full - fledged HUDs such as PokerAce HUD ( now integrated with PokerTracker ) capable of delivering customizable visual information in all the colors of the rainbow .
But that 's another story .
The thing to take away from all this is that the hand history analyzers created a demand for instantaneous hand histories .
More and more players started requesting more and more hand histories , and more and more programmers built tools to help those players automate the process of requesting those histories ( giving rise to an entirely new species of software , the standalone hand history grabber ) , and in general the number of histories being requested started trending sharply upward , and I think at some point the online poker companies realized that email is a clunky mechanism for hand history delivery .
High - volume email consumes server resources , gobbles network bandwidth , and suffers from high latency .
It 's difficult to secure .
It 's messy .
And there 's absolutely no excuse for it , since by definition :
Every last piece of information necessary to construct a complete poker hand history is present locally , in the poker client running on the user 's machine .
In other words , people in a position to do something about it realized that hand histories could and should be generated locally rather than transmitted remotely .
It 's better from the user 's perspective , because he gets instant access to his hand histories ; and it 's better for the site , because all that expensive hand history processing logic is offloaded onto the client .
Sort of a classic client / server scenario , really , and one wonders why the poker sites did n't implement it this way from the beginning .
Whatever the reason , they eventually came around , and one by one , the major poker venues started generating hand histories locally .
( There are still many sites today that do not , however . )
And it was good .
PokerTracker went on to win the First War of the Hand Analyzers , of course , and within a couple years it would corner the hand history analysis market ( at least until the arrival of Hold 'em Manager ) .
PokerStat continued to enjoy ( and still enjoys ) a small following , and holds the honor of being the first widely - available hand history analyzer ; but PokerTracker was the first hand history analyzer to achieve mass popularity , or what counts for mass popularity in the world of poker .
I have n't been able to find reliable figures for how many copies PokerTracker has sold , but based on its sheer ubiquity , I believe it to be the most profitable piece of third - party poker software built to date , and one of the top three or four most interesting examples of indie development success I 've ever come across .
So Jeff Vogel , eat your heart out .
But to get back to PostgreSQL .
Pretty much every hand history analyzer that 's ever been built can be described as a graphical user interface sitting on top of a database .
That database might be a proprietary or embedded data store ( as in PokerStat ) ; it might be a simple Microsoft Access database ( as in early versions of PokerTracker ) ; it might be a full - fledged PostgreSQL instance ( as in Hold 'em Manager and v2/v3 of PokerTracker ) .
But there will always be a database of some kind .
The mechanism works like this :
Input .
The user imports his textual hand histories .
Processing .
The analyzer parses each history and stores a compacted representation in the database along with various other computed statistics .
Output .
Later on , the analyzer executes SQL against the database and displays the results to the user .
Once the hand history files have been imported and converted to database format ( a process which usually involves taking the data for each hand and splintering it out across multiple tables , a process the programmers and DBAs out there will know as normalizing ) the hand history analyzer never touches them again .
It does all its work ( statistical analysis and reporting and the displaying of charts and tables and graphs ) from data stored directly in the database .
You might wonder why this sort of two - stage processing is necessary .
Why even use a database at all ?
Why not just analyze the hand history text files directly anytime the user wants to see some data ?
( After all , the hand history contains all the information .
Like a can of Prego spaghetti sauce , " it 's in there " . )
And the answer of course is that :
Text files are opaque ( they can't be easily queried / manipulated )
Parsing text is time - consuming
Text files live on a physical hard drive
Disk I/O is time - consuming
In other words , as various hobbyists discovered early on , parsing raw text files takes a lot of time .
An active player can easily chalk up hundreds of thousands or even millions of hands over the course of his career , which means that somewhere on his machine there will be a folder containing multiple gigabytes of hand histories : endless streams and rivers and oceans of text ( a lot like this article , come to think of it ) .
And even though a robust parser can burn through hundreds of hand histories a second , it can still take hours to import a large collection .
When it comes to online poker hand history analysis , you could say that everything is slow for large N .
And it means you have to have a storage bin to persist extracted history data in a durable format that allows it to be queried .
There are several ways to handle this :
You could treat all hand history files as a single flat - file database .
You could build your own proprietary data store .
You could use an embedded relational database , invisible to the user .
You could use a full - fledged relational database , visible to the user .
Well no , I 'm sorry .
Pet peeve .
There 's exactly one way to handle this .
Hand history data cries out for an open relational database with a documented schema running a standard SQL dialect and is extremely pissed off when it does n't get it .
You have to store everything in an well - documented standard format so that :
Players can query and manipulate the database directly
Players can ( if necessary ) administer / maintain very large databases
Third - party toolmakers can build add - ons that work with your database
You have a mechanism for the creation of custom statistics ( custom SQL or SQL - like expressions )
Otherwise your data will kill you .
No , I 'm not saying give the user the option of using an RDBMS .
I 'm saying hog - tie the user and force him to use an RDBMS .
It 's what the user wants , even if he does n't know it .
Consider the following random forum post published two days before Christmas , 2003 :
Also , does anyone know what PokerTracker uses as a back - end to store the data .
I 'm a database guy and was disappointed that I could n't write my own queries against the PokerStat database because it is not just a standard Access ( or other db type ) database .
Lastly , I guess I 'm wondering if anyone has a stat tracker that is just in a regular db ( I 'd take Oracle or even DB2 if that 's all I had access to ... ) .
Thanks
dave
And it 's fascinating from a software development standpoint , because as software developers we 've been instilled with a healthy fear of exposing databases to the end - user .
I can hear it now .
Product Manager :
So wait , let me get this straight .
You want us to force our users , who are some of the laziest people on the planet , to install a full - fledged relational database management system ???
On their home computer ???
Like what , they 're going to become DBAs ?
And you 're calling that a feature ?
Well , why stop there ?
Why not just ship them our source code directly and force them to compile it on the COMMAND LINE ?
Every user is a programmer , right ?
Well ?
ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR F-- KING MIND ??
But online poker is n't a typical industry , and online poker players are anything but typical users .
And apparently the PokerTracker people ( well , at that time I think it was more of a single - man operation ) saw the writing on the wall , because when PokerTracker was released , it did , in fact , ship with a relational database .
The only problem ?
That database was Microsoft Access .
Now the programmers out there will be rolling their eyes .
I do n't want to rant about how terrible a database Microsoft Access is , because it 's not fair to make those kinds of value judgments when it was never intended to be a robust production database .
Another mitigating factor is this : when PokerTracker was released , large hand history databases were a rarity .
The size limitation of Microsoft Access and its choppy performance under heavy load did n't seem quite the deal - breakers then that they would today , now that multiple - hundreds - of - thousands - of - hands databases are commonplace .
Nevertheless , as PokerTracker started to gain market share , that innocuous Microsoft Access database started causing problems :
Its size limitation meant that large hand history collections had to be broken across multiple databases .
Performance degraded as the database grew in size
There were data durability / corruption issues
It got to the point to where you could almost hear the Microsoft Access back - end JET engine groaning under the strain .
And before too long , the thing which had set PokerTracker apart from PokerStat — its open database — became it 's single biggest flaw ( the unresponsive single - threaded PokerTracker v1 / v2 UI being a close second ) .
Armchair programmers around the world started to make comments like : I could build a better PokerTracker .
I'm a database professional and if I were to design PokerTracker I 'd do X , Y , and Z . I ca n't BELIEVE they used Microsoft Access .
And so on .
And then one day PokerTracker version 2.0 was released .
Poker Tracker comes ready to use with a Microsoft Access database that stores the statistics and text of your hand histories .
For most users , the Access database is sufficient and works just fine .
However , for more advanced users and users that want to store a huge amount of hands , a more robust database option has been a requested for a long time .
Enter PostgreSQL ...
Finally , at long last , PostgreSQL joined the fray .
Now my belief is that the nature of the hand - history - text - file - analysis problem meant that PostgreSQL was destined to enter the picture sooner or later .
Consider :
You can't use a commercial database like Oracle or SQL Server because commercial database licenses cost money .
You ca n't use SQL Server Express , MSDE , or other " light " versions of commercial databases .
First , they 're hobbled in terms of performance and capacity .
Second , your power users would still have capacity problems .
Third , " light " versions of commercial databases often have tricky licensing issues .
Fourth , light versions of commercial database are almost always structured to upsell you into a commercial database .
Fifth , the company behind the database can discontinue it at any time .
You ca n't use any database which does n't have a large developer and user community .
You ca n't use a database which has n't been field - tested across multiple versions .
( I.e. , no betas or avant - garde databases . )
There are only two databases that I know of which meet the above requirements .
They are :
PostgreSQL
MySQL
Both of these databases are robust enough out of the box to handle copious hand history data .
MySQL has the larger user base and development community .
But when you consider MySQL 's web - centric history , its lack of transactional and foreign key support , and its relaxed attitude with regard to data integrity , PostgreSQL emerges as the clear winner — at least when it comes to the task of storing and retrieving hand history data in a Windows desktop environment .
In fact , let 's just go ahead and say it :
PostgreSQL is the ideal database for hand history storage .
And as I was saying , PokerTracker 2 was a hybrid .
It had support for Microsoft Access , and it had support for PostgreSQL .
And for a long time PokerTracker was the only game in town , the only product that was functional enough and had enough of a user base to allow for the creation of lots of supporting " how to use PokerTracker " content in the form of forum threads , linkbait , blog posts , e-books , and so forth .
And more and more players started jumping on the PostgreSQL bandwagon as by this point the problems with MS Access were pretty well known throughout the community .
It was a sort of you mean you 're still using an Access database ?
Come on man , you gotta go with Postgre .
Get with the program !
type thing .
Time passed ...
And then in 2007 , a guy by the name of Roy Goncalves released the beta for Hold 'em Manager , the first serious challenger to the PokerStars throne .
It 's funny how history repeats itself .
In 2002 - 2003 , PokerTracker was introduced as a " better " PokerStat .
Five years later , Hold 'em Manager was introduced as a " better " PokerTracker .
This sort of technological leap - frogging is great for innovation , and most of the innovations Hold 'em Manager brought to the table were intended to address some of the unpopular quirks of PokerTracker v2 :
The single - threaded user interface which froze whenever hand histories were being imported
The lack of an integrated HUD ( PokerTracker v2 HUDs were add - ons )
Various layout and display issues
Various database / schema issues
Now I do n't want to get into the subject of whether PokerTracker was / is better than Hold 'em Manager or vice - versa .
I just want to point out that Hold 'em Manager followed PokerTracker 's lead and used PostgreSQL natively from day one .
Around the same time ( 2007 ) , the PokerTracker team started gathering feedback for the long - awaited ( some would say overdue ) PokerTracker v3.0 ; which is the current version of the product as of this writing .
And whereas PokerTracker 2 had given the user a choice , PokerTracker 3 drew a line in the sand :
Attention all users : PostgreSQL is mandatory !
Which meant that the two most popular tools in online poker — a market famous for shoddy software and grumpy , stubborn users — have both standardized on an open - source database for the prosecution of real - money , real - time online poker intelligence , or whatever you call the blend of services that PokerTracker and Hold 'em Manager provide .
Which means that all that robust open - source code running in the PostgreSQL transactional engine ?
It 's running on behalf of a competitive poker player named Joe Bob living in Utah .
And twenty thousand more like him .
Those JOINS are helping poker players improve their game .
As if that was n't random enough : Joe Bob the poker player is actually learning SQL .
With the advent of custom statistics in the PokerTracker 3 ( and to a degree , custom reports in Hold 'em Manager ) , with the publishing of the PokerTracker 3 database schema and statistical reference , and with the increasing sophistication of PokerTracker / Hold 'em Manager setups and custom HUDs and statistical arrangements in general , the utility of SQL has gone way up for the serious player .
You do n't need to know a lick of SQL in order to use PokerTracker 3 and / or Hold 'em Manager ; you can point and click your way to some pretty advanced setups .
But if you want to get the most out of PokerTracker ...
You Will Need To Know :
What a table is
What a column is
What a primary / foreign key is
What a JOIN is
Etc .
And if you plan on doing any serious custom work with PokerTracker then SQL is an absolute necessity .
All of this , all of the above , if you 're still reading , all of it ; it makes me realize what I 've suspected for years without ever really vocalizing : the online poker industry is without a doubt the strangest application of computer science and software development technique to a particular domain that I 've ever witnessed or come across ... with the possible exception of EVE Online .
Poker has always been a darling of the research crowd , from the days of Johnny von Neumann ; but when you add the Internet and the prospect of real money to the equation , the game of poker tumbles down the rabbit hole of weirdness , never to emerge .
I have n't even touched on :
How the widespread availability of hand histories coupled with a demand for large hand history databases produced a black market for illicit hand histories shared / pooled across many users
How that same demand gave rise to a new species of software called hand history data miners : tools ( such as the cleverly - named IdleMiner ) whose only purpose is to " watch " one or more tables of poker and squirt out a textual hand history .
How those hand history data miners enabled the creation of independent and / or unauthorized " player tracking " sites like Sharkscope , OPR , PTR , and the PokerDB .
How the poker botting crowd learned to use hand history databases to bootstrap basic strategy and opponent modelling .
But I hope I 've made it clear that the online poker user experience has , to a large degree , been shaped by the need to generate , transmit , store , parse , convert , analyze , anonymize , visualize , and broadcast the humble text file ; and that this has created a sort of gravity which slowly and over time has pulled users into the orbit of PostgreSQL , a segue which is random , bizarre , slightly perverse , and completely awesome .
Hand histories are the pieces of the online poker jigsaw puzzle .
We were just waiting for the right database to put that puzzle together ...
With Democrats like these ...:
Sen. Ben Nelson ( D - Neb. ) took quite the political heckling in Nebraska the past few weeks .
Both he and Sen. Mary Landrieu ( D - La. ) have come under fire for their on - again - off - again opposition to a public health care option as part of the overhaul now in Congress .
Nelson has said he wo n't filibuster a bill with a public option in it , so his foes have moved on .
Now Landrieu will be getting the Nelson treatment .
Change Congress , the group that sniped at Nelson the last few weeks , is now setting its ( web ) sites on her .
She 'll be on the receiving end of $ 10,000 worth of online ads targeting her for taking $ 1.6 million from big health care and insurance interests .
The ads link to a petition calling on Landrieu to back a public option and break with big insurance companies .
The Howard Dean funded group Democracy for America will also go after Landrieu , sending e-mails to its 20,000 Louisiana members asking them to call her office and press her to back a public option .
If Landrieu does n't move back in support of a public option , said Adam Green of Change Congress , direct mail will be sent to Louisiana donors calling on them to withhold campaign funds -- call it fund - suppressing .
DFA , meanwhile , is working on a TV ad set to attack Landrieu for her opposition to a public plan .
Before opposing the public option , Landrieu signed a letter declaring , in specific terms , her support for it .
Authorities around the state wrote more than 12,000 tickets — a new record — over a two - week period to people who were not buckled up while motoring .
The majority of the tickets — 10,905 — were issued to adults who were not wearing seat belts ; officials also recorded 514 violations of children under the age of 4 who were not properly restrained in a child - safety seat , according to a media release from the Colorado Department of Transportation .
Drivers of the vehicle in which a violation occurs are fined $ 72 .
“ Not wearing seat belts is a serious public - health issue that has a simple solution — buckle up every trip , every time , ” said Col. James Wolfinbarger , chief of the Colorado State Patrol .
During last year ’s two - week campaign , 9,809 seat - belt violations were cited .
The previous record was 11,448 seat - belt tickets in 2007 , CDOT said .
Authorities hope the program results in more drivers and passengers buckling up as a way to help reduce the number of fatal traffic accidents around the state .
Studies show current seat - belt use in the state at about 81 percent , according to CDOT .
Last year , 178 people who were not buckled - in died in traffic accidents in Colorado .
The Colorado State Patrol and 90 law - enforcement agencies wrote a total of 12,685 tickets during the two - week Click It or Ticket campaign that ended May 31 .
According to CDOT : 698 tickets were written for unbuckled young people ages 16 t0 20 ; 398 were written for unbuckled children between the ages of 6 and 15 ; and 170 tickets for children ages 4 and 5 who were not in booster seats .
Troopers with the State Patrol wrote more than 4,865 tickets , and the Arapahoe County Sheriff ’s Office handed out 1,011 tickets , according to CDOT .

TROY , Va. -
For more than a year , Virginia 's largest women 's prison rounded up inmates who had loose - fitting clothes , short hair or otherwise masculine looks , sending them to a unit officers derisively dubbed the " butch wing , " prisoners and guards say .
Dozens were moved in an attempt to split up relationships and curb illegal sexual activity at the 1,200 - inmate Fluvanna Correctional Center for Women , though some straight women were sent to the wing strictly because of their appearance , the inmates and corrections officers said .
Civil rights advocates called the moves unconstitutional punishment for " looking gay . "
The warden denied that any housing decisions were made based on looks or sexual orientation , and said doing so would be discriminatory .
The practice was stopped recently after the Associated Press began questioning it , according to several inmates and one current employee .
Two current guards and one of their former co-workers said targeting masculine - looking inmates was a deliberate strategy by a building manager .
Numerous inmates said in letters and interviews that they felt humiliated and stigmatized when guards took them to the separate wing - also referred to by prisoners and guards as the " little boys wing , " " locker room wing " or " studs wing . "
" I 'm not one who 's going to cry and say Oh my god I 'm in prison and they 're making my time hard , ' you know .
I deserved to go for my crime and I did my time there , " said Summer Triolo , who spent nearly six years at Fluvanna for theft before being released in February 2008 .
" But my punishment was by the judge to do time in prison away from my family and home .
That was my punishment , not all the extra stuff . "
Living conditions in wing 5D were n't worse than the rest of the prison , and no prisoner said she was denied services other inmates received .
However , the unit went on lockdown more often than others , and the women said they were verbally harassed by staff who would make remarks such as , " Here come the little boys , " when they were escorted to eat .
The three guards confirmed such remarks were made .
The two current guards and former guard William Drumheller said Building 5 manager Timothy Back , who is in charge of security and operations for that area , came up with the idea to break up couples by sending inmates to the wing .
Gradually , they said , the 60 - inmate wing was filled with women targeted because of their appearance .
The current employees asked to remain anonymous for fear of losing their jobs .
" I heard him say , We 're going to break up some of these relationships , start a boys wing , and we 're going to take all these studs and put them together and see how they like looking at nothing but each other all day instead of their girlfriends , ' " Drumheller said .
Drumheller said Back told him the plan one day in a prison office .
The other two guards , who are both female , said Back 's reasons for moving the prisoners were commonly known among guards , though officials would deny the reasons for the moves if inmates asked or complained .
" They sort of played it off like that 's not really what they were doing , " Drumheller said .
Warden Barbara
Wheeler called the policy a figment of the inmates ' imaginations .
" With female offenders , relationships are very important , and often times when they 're separated from those relationships they might perceive it as punitive , " Wheeler said .
Wheeler said her employees would n't segregate inmates based on their appearance or sexual preference , and said she would n't condone it if they did .
" That would be very discriminatory , " she said .
" That 's like saying I want to put all the blacks in one unit and all the whites in one unit , " something federal courts have ruled illegal .
A dozen inmates interviewed in person or by letter contradicted Wheeler , saying there 's no doubt why they were moved .
Triolo said she had gone four years without getting in trouble until she shaved her shoulder - length brown locks .
She soon was given a new cell in 5D .
She could n't hope to see her girlfriend in the cafeteria because her unit always went first or last to keep them away from other inmates .
Triolo and Trina O'Neal were two of the first inmates sent to 5D in the fall of 2007 .
" I have been gay all my life and never have I once felt as degraded , humiliated or questioned my own sexuality , the way I look , etc. , until all of this happened , " O'Neal , 33 , who is serving time for forgery and drug charges , wrote to the AP .
Drumheller worked as a correctional officer at Fluvanna for two years but said he quit in August because he did n't like the way the inmates were treated .
Wheeler said she did n't recall the circumstances surrounding his departure .
The prison declined repeated requests to make Back available for an interview , and the AP could not find a working home telephone number for him .
Sex - whether forced , coerced or consensual - is forbidden in prisons primarily to prevent violence and the spread of diseases .
Segregating gay inmates in men's prison has been upheld by federal courts to protect them and maintain order .
Courts have ruled against total isolation or harsher conditions for those inmates .
Separating women based on appearance , though , violates the Constitution 's guarantees of equal protection and freedom of expression , said Helen Trainor , director of the Virginia Institutionalized Persons Project .
Trainor said civil rights and gay rights groups have been hesitant to sue because of the expense and the " certainty of failure " in the 4th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals , the nation 's most conservative .
Inmates say prison officials have more aggressively policed prisoner sex since Wheeler became warden in 2004 .
If inmates are caught having sex they are sent to isolation .
Last year , there were 59 violations for sexual acts .
As of mid-April , there had been 11 this year , according to the prison .
Prison officials have taken other measures to curb sex , restricting nighttime bathroom use and reducing time cells are unlocked during the day .
Prisoners say officers also have separated couples who have n't been caught having sex .
" Point blank , this institution is ran by homophobes , and the rules instated here are based on your sexual preference not what is right or wrong , " wrote Casey Lynn Toney .
Esther Gordon , 45 , who lived in 5D , concurred .
" They 're worried about who goes with who , or who 's having sex with who , " she said .
" It 's just unnecessary harassment . "

168 passengers and crew died in Caspian Airlines crash in the north of Iran
BBC July 16 , 2009 – Wreckage was spread over a large area in a field in Jannatabad village , Qazvin province , about 75 miles ( 120 km ) north - west of Tehran , state TV said .
The Tupolev plane was flying from the Iranian capital to Yerevan in Armenia , with mostly Armenian passengers .
The cause of the crash , which happened soon after take - off , was not known .
Witnesses said it dropped from the sky .
“ The 7908 Caspian flight crashed 16 minutes after its take - off from the International Imam Khomeini Airport , ” Iran ’s Aviation Organisation spokesman , Reza Jafarzadeh , was quoted by Iranian Press TV as saying .
Iranian media reported officials confirming the deaths .
Mohammad Reza Montazer Khorasan , the head of the disaster management centre at Iran ’s health ministry said : “ All people aboard … the crashed plane are dead , ” according to AFP news agency .
The Qazvin Fire Department Chief said residents began calling emergency services about noon local time after seeing thick smoke .
“ After going to the crash scene and scouting , we found that the area of the disaster is very wide and wreckage of the crashed plane have been thrown around as far as 150 to 200m , ” he said .
Television footage showed a massive crater in a field , with smouldering debris over a wide area .
Mr Jafarzadeh said there were no irregularities reported before the plane took off .
“ The regulations of the State Aviation Organisation do not allow a plane to take off before security of the plane is 100 % approved , ” he told Iranian television .
“ As to why this happened and what problem the plane ran into , we will need to carry out a thorough investigation of all contributing elements . ”
The plane was built in Russia in 1987 .
A Caspian Airlines representative told Associated Press news agency that most of the passengers were Armenians , with some Georgian citizens also on board .
It was unclear if other nationalities were involved .
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad offered his condolences to the families of the victims .
Ten members of Iran ’s national junior judo team were reported to be on the plane , ahead of training with the Armenian team .
The BBC ’s Jon Leyne said the country was reliant on air transport , but it had been three years since the last crash .
The civil and military fleets are made up of elderly aircraft , in poor condition due to their age and lack of maintenance .
Since Iran ’s Islamic revolution of 1979 , trade embargoes by Western nations have forced Iran to buy mainly Russian - built planes to supplement an existing fleet of Boeings and other American and European models .

( Adds more Kohn remarks , background )
WASHINGTON , July 9 ( Reuters ) - The U.S. Federal Reserve on Thursday launched a robust defense of its independence and warned that efforts in Congress to put monetary policy under political sway would hurt the economy .
Fed Vice Chairman Donald Kohn said opening up some of the U.S. central bank ’s most sensitive decisions to political scrutiny could result in higher long - term interest rates and hurt the United States ’ credit rating .
Kohn was speaking before a Congressional panel where he was seeking to beat back a proposal that would open policy decisions by the U.S. central bank to audits by a federal watchdog agency .
“ Any substantial erosion of the Federal Reserve ’s monetary independence likely would lead to higher long - term interest rates as investors begin to fear future inflation , ” he said in testimony prepared for delivery to a House of Representatives Financial Services subcommittee .
Kohn ’s testimony comes as Congress debates President Barack Obama ’s plan for regulatory reform , which envisions the Fed taking on an expanded role monitoring risks across the entire financial system to help ward off future financial crises .
The proposal has increased calls for greater accountability at the central bank , which was already facing heavy scrutiny from lawmakers angered by its role in bailing out Wall Street .
Public anger over last year ’s financial crisis and Fed - backed bailouts of investment bank Bear Stearns and insurer American International Group has created a popular backlash that could gain momentum in Congress .
A bill put forward by Representative Ron Paul , a Texas Republican , would expose the Fed ’s decisions on monetary policy and emergency lending to audits by the Government Accountability Office .
It has won support from a majority in the House of Representatives .
The GAO is currently prohibited from auditing these areas .
Kohn said removing this exclusion would be highly detrimental and could lead investors to worry politics -- not economics -- would guide the Fed ’s decisions .
“ The Federal Reserve strongly believes that removing the statutory limits on GAO audits of monetary policy matters would be contrary to the public interest by tending to undermine the independence and efficacy of monetary policy , ” he said .
He also said it could “ cast a chill ” on monetary policy deliberations by making officials nervous ideas they throw around behind closed doors could become public .
Paul ’s bill has 250 co-sponsors , including 78 Democrats .
But it has not been promoted by the Democratic majority leadership in the House , where it has yet to face even a committee - level vote .
If it were to emerge from the House , to become law it would also need to clear the Senate , where support may be more scarce .
Kohn warned that congressional meddling in the Fed ’s affairs could exact a high cost .
“ The bond rating agencies view operational independence of a country ’s central bank as an important factor in determining sovereign credit ratings , suggesting that a threat to the Federal Reserve ’s independence could lower the Treasury ’s debt rating and thus raise its cost of borrowing , ” he said .
He made plain the Fed saw Paul ’s bill as a direct challenge to its independence that could raise the risk investors might begin to expect the U.S. central bank to start printing money to help the government finance a growing budget gap .
“ History provides numerous examples of non-independent central banks being forced to finance large government budget deficits .
Such episodes invariably lead to high inflation , ” he said .
“ Given the current outlook for large federal budget deficits in the United States , this consideration is especially important . ”
Some investors are already worried that a new Fed program to buy longer - term U.S. Treasury securities has opened the door to a “ monetization ” of the debt .
The Fed rejects this view , but is clearly worried this impression could take firmer root among investors if Congress extends its influence over monetary policy .

Cloncurry , a town of over 4000 people in north - west Australia , is gearing up to produce solar thermal power capable of supplying all of ts electricity needs , 24 - hours a day .
The technology used will ensure the 10 megawatt Cloncurry solar thermal power station will continue to generate electricity when the sun is not shining and will deliver about 30 million kilowatt hours of electricity a year .
Up to 8000 mirrors will reflect sunlight onto graphite blocks through which water will be pumped to generate steam that will operate a conventional steam turbine electricity generator .
Because heat stays in the graphite , the system will work through the night and on overcast days .
Cloncurry , which is the first town in the State of Queensland to go totally solar , is a perfect candidate for solar thermal power generation , having long claimed the title of having recorded Australia 's hottest day - 53 degrees Celsius in the shade in 1889 .
The design to be implemented by Lloyd Energy Storage is a solar power tower .
Solar energy is collected by tacking heliostats ( mirrors ) totalling 60,000 square feet that focus the sun ’s rays on to large 10 ton graphite block mounted at the top of a tower .
A total of 54 towers of 18 m ( 59 ft ) high will be constructed .
The thermal energy is turned into electricity on demand by passing water through tubes embedded in the graphite to make steam that drives a steam turbine to generate electricity .
Less water will be used in the turbine than falls in an average year on the power station 's roof .
Test sites using a single tower mounted graphite boiler have been constructed in Comma and Newcastle NSW .
Outback solar dish power stations
Solar power is well suited to small , isolated communities where access to the national electricity grid can be difficult or expensive .
Solar dish power stations have been installed at three remote indigenous townships in Australia 's Northern Territory .
Thirty parabolic reflector dishes , each 14 meters ( 46 feet ) in diameter , generate 24 Kw whenever the sun is 5 degrees above the horizon giving each township between 200 and 300 kw providing 1.5 gigawatts per year in total .
Another type of solar technology has been proposed for Buronga in western NSW .
A solar updraft tower would heat air in a very large circular greenhouse - like structure .
The resulting convection causes the air to rise and escape through a tall tower .
Moving air drives turbines , which produce electricity .
In Alice Springs , which lies in the country 's red center , multiple installations of large solar dishes will track the sun to provide clean energy for the city in a project funded under the Australian Govenrment 's Solar Cities scheme .
The dishes will be connected to the grid and generate electricity for Alice Springs directly from the sun , offsetting some of the requirement to transport fossil fuels long distances .
The Queensland Government has committed $ 7 million towards the $ 30 million Cloncurry power station .
This project will determine if this clean energy solution can be replicated in other rural and remote areas of Australia .
It is a first for Australia and would generate enough electricity for about 3500 homes .
It is expected to be running by early 2010 .

( Latin inquirere , to look to ) .
By this term is usually meant a special ecclesiastical institution for combating or suppressing heresy .
Its characteristic mark seems to be the bestowal on special judges of judicial powers in matters of faith , and this by supreme ecclesiastical authority , not temporal or for individual cases , but as a universal and permanent office .
Moderns experience difficulty in understanding this institution , because they have , to no small extent , lost sight of two facts .
On the one hand they have ceased to grasp religious belief as something objective , as the gift of God , and therefore outside the realm of free private judgment ; on the other they no longer see in the Church a society perfect and sovereign , based substantially on a pure and authentic Revelation , whose first most important duty must naturally be to retain unsullied this original deposit of faith .
Before the religious revolution of the sixteenth century these views were still common to all Christians ; that orthodoxy should be maintained at any cost seemed self - evident .
However , while the positive suppression of heresy by ecclesiastical and civil authority in Christian society is as old as the Church , the Inquisition as a distinct ecclesiastical tribunal is of much later origin .
Historically it is a phase in the growth of ecclesiastical legislation , whose distinctive traits can be fully understood only by a careful study of the conditions amid which it grew up .
Our subject may , therefore , be conveniently treated as follows :
(1) Though the Apostles were deeply imbued with the conviction that they must transmit the deposit of the Faith to posterity undefiled , and that any teaching at variance with their own , even if proclaimed by an angel of Heaven , would be a culpable offense , yet St. Paul did not , in the case of the heretics Alexander and Hymeneus , go back to the Old Covenant penalties of death or scourging ( Deuteronomy 13:6 sqq. ; 17:1 sqq. ) , but deemed exclusion from the communion of the Church sufficient ( 1 Timothy 1:20 ; Titus 3:10 ) .
In fact to the Christians of the first three centuries it could scarcely have occurred to assume any other attitude towards those who erred in matters of faith .
Tertullian ( To Scapula 2 ) lays down the rule :
In other words , he tells us that the natural law authorized man to follow only the voice of individual conscience in the practice of religion , since the acceptance of religion was a matter of free will , not of compulsion .
Replying to the accusation of Celsus , based on the Old Testament , that the Christians persecuted dissidents with death , burning , and torture , Origen ( Against Celsus VII.26 ) is satisfied with explaining that one must distinguish between the law which the Jews received from Moses and that given to the Christians by Jesus ; the former was binding on the Jews , the latter on the Christians .
Jewish Christians , if sincere , could no longer conform to all of the Mosaic law ; hence they were no longer at liberty to kill their enemies or to burn and stone violators of the Christian Law .
St. Cyprian of Carthage , surrounded as he was by countless schismatics and undutiful Christians , also put aside the material sanction of the Old Testament , which punished with death rebellion against priesthood and the Judges .
" Nunc autem , quia circumcisio spiritalis esse apud fideles servos Dei coepit , spiritali gladio superbi et contumaces necantur , dum de Ecclesia ejiciuntur " ( Epistle 61 , no .
4 ) religion being now spiritual , its sanctions take on the same character , and excommunication replaces the death of the body .
Lactantius was yet smarting under the scourge of bloody persecutions , when he wrote this Divine Institutes in A.D. 308 .
Naturally , therefore , he stood for the most absolute freedom of religion .
He writes :
Religion being a matter of the will , it can not be forced on anyone ; in this matter it is better to employ words than blows [ verbis melius quam verberibus res agenda est ] .
Of what use is cruelty ?
What has the rack to do with piety ?
Surely there is no connection between truth and violence , between justice and cruelty . . . .
It is true that nothing is so important as religion , and one must defend it at any cost [ summâ vi ] . . .
It is true that it must be protected , but by dying for it , not by killing others ; by long - suffering , not by violence ; by faith , not by crime .
If you attempt to defend religion with bloodshed and torture , what you do is not defense , but desecration and insult .
For nothing is so intrinsically a matter of free will as religion .
( Divine Institutes V:20 )
The Christian teachers of the first three centuries insisted , as was natural for them , on complete religious liberty ; furthermore , they not only urged the principle that religion could not be forced on others  a principle always adhered to by the Church in her dealings with the unbaptised  but , when comparing the Mosaic Law and the Christian religion , they taught that the latter was content with a spiritual punishment of heretics ( i.e. with excommunication ) , while Judaism necessarily proceeded against its dissidents with torture and death .
(2) However , the imperial successors of Constantine soon began to see in themselves Divinely appointed " bishops of the exterior " , i.e. masters of the temporal and material conditions of the Church .
At the same time they retained the traditional authority of " Pontifex Maximus " , and in this way the civil authority inclined , frequently in league with prelates of Arian tendencies , to persecute the orthodox bishops by imprisonment and exile .
But the latter , particularly St. Hilary of Poitiers ( Liber contra Auxentium , c. iv ) , protested vigorously against any use of force in the province of religion , whether for the spread of Christianity or for preservation of the Faith .
They repeatedly urged that in this respect the severe decrees of the Old Testament were abrogated by the mild and gentle laws of Christ .
However , the successors of Constantine were ever persuaded that the first concern of imperial authority ( Theodosius II , " Novellae " , tit. III , A.D. 438 ) was the protection of religion and so , with terrible regularity , issued many penal edicts against heretics .
In the space of fifty seven years sixty - eight enactments were thus promulgated .
All manner of heretics were affected by this legislation , and in various ways , by exile , confiscation of property , or death .
A law of 407 , aimed at the traitorous Donatists , asserts for the first time that these heretics ought to be put on the same plane as transgressors against the sacred majesty of the emperor , a concept to which was reserved in later times a very momentous role .
The death penalty however , was only imposed for certain kinds of heresy ; in their persecution of heretics the Christian emperors fell far short of the severity of Diocletian , who in 287 sentenced to the stake the leaders of the Manichæans , and inflicted on their followers partly the death penalty by beheading , and partly forced labor in the government mines .
So far we have been dealing with the legislation of the Christianized State .
In the attitude of the representatives of the Church towards this legislation some uncertainty is already noticeable .
At the close of the forth century , and during the fifth , Manichaeism , Donatism , and Priscillianism were the heresies most in view .
Expelled from Rome and Milan , the Manichaeism sought refuge in Africa .
Though they were found guilty of abominable teachings and misdeeds ( St. Augustine , De haeresibus " , no. 46 ) , the Church refused to invoke the civil power against them ; indeed , the great Bishop of Hippo explicitly rejected the use force .
He sought their return only through public and private acts of submission , and his efforts seem to have met with success .
Indeed , we learn from him that the Donatists themselves were the first to appeal to the civil power for protection against the Church .
However , they fared like Daniel 's accusers : the lions turned upon them .
State intervention not answering to their wishes , and the violent excesses of the Circumcellions being condignly punished , the Donatists complained bitterly of administrative cruelty .
St. Optatus of Mileve defended the civil authority ( De Schismate Donatistarum , III , cc. 6 - 7 ) as follows :
. . . as though it were not permitted to come forward as avengers of God , and to pronounce sentence of death ! . . .
But , say you , the State cannot punish in the name of God .
Yet was it not in the name of God that Moses and Phineas consigned to death the worshippers of the Golden Calf and those who despised the true religion ?
St. Augustine , on the contrary , was still opposed to the use of force , and tried to lead back the erring by means of instruction ; at most he admitted the imposition of a moderate fine for refractory persons .
Finally , however , he changed his views , whether moved thereto by the incredible excesses of the Circumcellions or by the good results achieved by the use of force , or favoring force through the persuasions of other bishops .
Apropos of his apparent inconsistency it is well to note carefully whom he is addressing .
He appears to speak in one way to government officials , who wanted the existing laws carried out to their fullest extent , and in another to the Donatists , who denied to the State any right of punishing dissenters .
In his correspondence with state officials he dwells on Christian charity and toleration , and represents the heretics as straying lambs , to be sought out and perhaps , if recalcitrant chastised with rods and frightened with threats of severer but not to be driven back to the fold by means of rack and sword .
On the other hand , in his writings against the Donatists he upholds the rights of the State : sometimes , he says , a salutary severity would be to the interest of the erring ones themselves and likewise protective of true believers and the community at large ( Vacandard , 1. c. , pp. 17-26 ) .
As to Priscillianism , not a few points remain yet obscure , despite recent valuable researches .
It seems certain , however , that Priscillian , Bishop of Avila in Spain , was accused of heresy and sorcery , and found guilty by several councils .
St. Ambrose at Milan and St. Damascus at Rome seem to have refused him a hearing .
At length he appealed to Emperor Maximus at Trier , but to his detriment , for he was there condemned to death .
Priscillian himself , no doubt in full consciousness of his own innocence , had formerly called for repression of the Manichæans by the sword .
But the foremost Christian teachers did not share these sentiments , and his own execution gave them occasion for a solemn protest against the cruel treatment meted out to him by the imperial government .
St. Martin of Tours , then at Trier , exerted himself to obtain from the ecclesiastical authority the abandonment of the accusation , and induced the emperor to promise that on no account would he shed the blood of Priscillian , since ecclesiastical deposition by the bishops would be punishment enough , and bloodshed would be opposed to the Divine Law ( Sulpicius Severus , Chronicle II and Dialogue III ) .
After the execution he strongly blamed both the accusers and the emperor , and for a long time refused to hold communion with such bishops as had been in any way responsible for Priscillian 's death .
The great Bishop of Milan , St. Ambrose , described that execution as a crime .
Priscillianism , however , did not disappear with the death of its originator ; on the contrary , it spread with extraordinary rapidity , and , through its open adoption of Manichaeism , became more of a public menace than ever .
In this way the severe judgments of St. Augustine and St. Jerome against Priscillianism become intelligible .
In 447 Leo the Great had to reproach the Priscillianists with loosening the holy bonds of marriage , treading all decency under foot , and deriding all law , human and Divine .
It seemed to him natural that temporal rulers should punish such sacrilegious madness , and should put to death the founder of the sect and some of his followers .
He goes on to say that this redounded to the advantage of the Church : " quae etsi sacerdotali contenta iudicio , cruentas refugit ultiones , severis tamen christianorum principum constitutionibus adiuratur , dum ad spiritale recurrunt remedium , qui timent corporale supplicium " — though the Church was content with a spiritual sentence on the part of its bishops and was averse to the shedding of blood , nevertheless it was aided by the imperial severity , inasmuch as the fear of corporal punishment drove the guilty to seek a spiritual remedy ( Epistle 15 ) .
The ecclesiastical ideas of the first five centuries may be summarized as follows :
How little we are to trust the vaunted impartiality of Henry Charles Lee , the American historian of the Inquisition , we may here illustrate by an example .
In his " History of the Inquisition in the Middle Ages " ( New York , 1888 , I , 215 ) , He closes this period with these words :
It was only sixty - two years after the slaughter of Priscillian and his followers had excited so much horror , that Leo I , when the heresy seemed to be reviving in 447 , not only justified the act , but declared that , if the followers of a heresy so damnable were allowed to live , there would be an end to human and Divine law .
The final step had been taken and the church was definitely pledged to the suppression of heresy at any cost .
It is impossible not to attribute to ecclesiastical influence the successive edicts by which , from the time of Theodosius the Great , persistence in heresy was punished with death .
(3) About the year 1000 Manichæans from Bulgaria , under various names , spread over Western Europe .
They were numerous in Italy , Spain , Gaul and Germany .
Christian popular sentiment soon showed itself adverse to these dangerous sectaries , and resulted in occasional local persecutions , naturally in forms expressive of the spirit of the age .
In 1122 King Robert the Pious ( regis iussu et universae plebis consensu ) , " because he feared for the safety of the kingdom and the salvation of souls " had thirteen distinguished citizens , ecclesiastic and lay , burnt alive at Orléans .
Elsewhere similar acts were due to popular outbursts .
A few years later the Bishop of Châlons observed that the sect was spreading in his diocese , and asked of Wazo , Bishop of Liège , advice as to the use of force : " An terrenae potestatis gladio in eos sit animadvertendum necne " ( " Vita Wasonis " , cc. xxv , xxvi , in P.L. , CXLII , 752 ; " Wazo ad Roger. II , episc . Catalaunens " , and " Anselmi Gesta episc . Leod . " in " Mon. Germ. SS. " , VII , 227 sq. ) .
Wazo replied that this was contrary to the spirit of the Church and the words of its Founder , Who ordained that the tares should be allowed to grow with the wheat until the day of the harvest , lest the wheat be uprooted with the tares ; those who today were tares might to - morrow be converted , and turn into wheat ; let them therefore live , and let mere excommunication suffice .
St. Chrysostom , as we have seen , had taught similar doctrine .
This principle could not be always followed .
Thus at Goslar , in the Christmas season of 1051 , and in 1052 , several heretics were hanged because Emperor Henry III wanted to prevent the further spread of " the heretical leprosy . "
A few years later , in 1076 or 1077 , a Catharist was condemned to the stake by the Bishop of Cambrai and his chapter .
Other Catharists , in spite of the archbishop 's intervention , were given their choice by the magistrates of Milan between doing homage to the Cross and mounting the pyre .
By far the greater number chose the latter .
In 1114 the Bishop of Soissons kept sundry heretics in durance in his episcopal city .
But while he was gone to Beauvais , to ask advice of the bishops assembled there for a synod the " believing folk , fearing the habitual soft - heartedness of ecclesiastics ( clericalem verens mollitiem ) , stormed the prison took the accused outside of town , and burned them .
The people disliked what to them was the extreme dilatoriness of the clergy in pursuing heretics .
In 1144 Adalerbo II of Liège hoped to bring some imprisoned Catharists to better knowledge through the grace of God , but the people , less indulgent , assailed the unhappy creatures and only with the greatest trouble did the bishop succeed in rescuing some of them from death by fire .
A like drama was enacted about the same time at Cologne , while the archbishop and the priests earnestly sought to lead the misguided back into the Church , the latter were violently taken by the mob ( a populis nimio zelo abreptis ) from the custody of the clergy and burned at the stake .
The best - known heresiarchs of that time , Peter of Bruys and Arnold of Brescia , met a similar fate  the first on the pyre as a victim of popular fury , and the latter under the henchman 's axe as a victim of his political enemies .
In short , no blame attaches to the Church for her behavior towards heresy in those rude days .
Among all the bishops of the period , so far as can be ascertained , Theodwin of Liège , successor of the aforesaid Wazo and predecessor of Adalbero II , alone appealed to the civil power for the punishment of heretics , and even he did not call for the death penalty , which was rejected by all .
who were more highly respected in the twelfth century than Peter Canter , the most learned man of his time , and St. Bernard of Clairvaux ?
The former says ( " Verbum abbreviatum " , c. lxxviii , in P.L. , CCV , 231 ) :
Whether they be convicted of error , or freely confess their guilt , Catharists are not to be put to death , at least not when they refrain from armed assaults upon the Church .
For although the Apostle said , A man that is a heretic after the third admonition , avoid , he certainly did not say , Kill him .
Throw them into prison , if you will , but do not put them to death ( cf. Geroch von Reichersberg , " De investigatione Antichristi III " , 42 ) .
Hence , the occasional executions of heretics during this period must be ascribed partly to the arbitrary action of individual rulers , partly to the fanatic outbreaks of the overzealous populace , and in no wise to ecclesiastical law or the ecclesiastical authorities .
There were already , it is true , canonists who conceded to the Church the right to pronounce sentence of death on heretics ; but the question was treated as a purely academic one , and the theory exercised virtually no influence on real life .
Excommunication , proscription , imprisonment , etc. , were indeed inflicted , being intended rather as forms of atonement than of real punishment , but never the capital sentence .
The maxim of Peter Cantor was still adhered to : " Catharists , even though divinely convicted in an ordeal , must not be punished by death . "
In the second half of the twelfth century , however , heresy in the form of Catharism spread in truly alarming fashion , and not only menaced the Church 's existence , but undermined the very foundations of Christian society .
In opposition to this propaganda there grew up a kind of prescriptive law — at least throughout Germany , France , and Spain — which visited heresy with death by the flames .
England on the whole remained untainted by heresy .
When , in 1166 , about thirty sectaries made their way thither , Henry II ordered that they be burnt on their foreheads with red - hot iron , be beaten with rods in the public square , and then driven off .
Moreover , he forbade anyone to give them shelter or otherwise assist them , so that they died partly from hunger and partly from the cold of winter .
Duke Philip of Flanders , aided by William of the White Hand , Archbishop of Reims , was particularly severe towards heretics .
They caused many citizens in their domains , nobles and commoners , clerics , knights , peasants , spinsters , widows , and married women , to be burnt alive , confiscated their property , and divided it between them .
This happened in 1183 .
Between 1183 and 1206 Bishop Hugo of Auxerre acted similarly towards the neo-Mainchaeans .
Some he despoiled ; the others he either exiled or sent to the stake .
King Philip Augustus of France had eight Catharists burnt at Troyes in 1200 , one at Nevers in 1201 , several at Braisne - sur - Vesle in 1204 , and many at Paris  " priests , clerics , laymen , and women belonging to the sect " .
Raymund V of Toulouse ( 1148 - 94 ) promulgated a law which punished with death the followers of the sect and their favourers .
Simon de Montfort 's men- at - arms believed in 1211 that they were carrying out this law when they boasted how they had burned alive many , and would continue to do so ( unde multos combussimus et adhuc cum invenimus idem facere non cessamus ) .
In 1197 Peter II , King of Aragon and Count of Barcelona , issued an edict in obedience to which the Waldensians and all other schismatics were expelled from the land ; whoever of this sect was still found in his kingdom or his county after Palm Sunday of the next year was to suffer death by fire , also confiscation of goods .
Ecclesiastical legislation was far from this severity .
Alexander III at the Lateran Council of 1179 renewed the decisions already made as to schismatics in Southern France , and requested secular sovereigns to silence those disturbers of public order , if necessary by force , to achieve which object they were at liberty to imprison the guilty ( servituti subicere , subdere ) and to appropriate their possessions .
According to the agreement made by Lucius III and Emperor Frederick Barbarossa at Verona ( 1148 ) , the heretics of every community were to be sought out , brought before the episcopal court , excommunicated , and given up to the civil power to be suitably punished ( debita animadversione puniendus ) .
The suitable punishment ( debita animadversio , ultio ) did not , however , as yet mean capital punishment , but the proscriptive ban , though even this , it is true , entailed exile , expropriation , destruction of the culprits dwelling , infamy , debarment from public office , and the like .
The " Continuatio Zwellensis altera , ad ann .
1184 " ( Mon. Germ. Hist. : SS. , IX , 542 ) accurately describes the condition of heretics at this time when it says that the pope excommunicated them , and the emperor put them under the civil ban , while he confiscated their goods ( papa eos excomunicavit imperator vero tam res quam personas ipsorum imperiali banno subiecit ) .
Under Innocent III nothing was done to intensify or add to the extant statutes against heresy , though this pope gave them a wider range by the action of his legates and through the Fourth Lateran Council ( 1215 ) .
But this act was indeed a relative service to the heretics , for the regular canonical procedure thus introduced did much to abrogate the arbitrariness , passion , and injustice of the Civil courts in Spain , France and Germany .
In so far as , and so long as , his prescriptions remained in force , no summary condemnations or executions en masse occurred , neither stake nor rack were set up ; and , if , on one occasion during the first year of his pontificate , to justify confiscation , he appealed to the Roman Law and its penalties for crimes against the sovereign power , yet he did not draw the extreme conclusion that heretics deserved to be burnt .
His reign affords many examples showing how much of the vigour he took away in practice from the existing penal code .
The suppression of heresy by the institution known as the inquisition
The inquisition of the Middle Ages
Origin
During the first three decades of the thirteenth century the Inquisition , as the institution , did not exist .
But eventually Christian Europe was so endangered by heresy , and penal legislation concerning Catharism had gone so far , that the Inquisition seemed to be a political necessity .
That these sects were a menace to Christian society had been long recognized by the Byzantine rulers .
As early as the tenth century Empress Theodora had put to death a multitude of Paulicians , and in 1118 Emperor Alexius Comnenus treated the Bogomili with equal severity , but this did not prevent them from pouring over all Western Europe .
Moreover these sects were in the highest degree aggressive , hostile to Christianity itself , to the Mass , the sacraments , the ecclesiastical hierarchy and organization ; hostile also to feudal government by their attitude towards oaths , which they declared under no circumstances allowable .
Nor were their views less fatal to the continuance of human society , for on the one hand they forbade marriage and the propagation of the human race , and on the other hand they made a duty of suicide through the institution of the Endura ( see CATHARI ) .
It has been said that more perished through the Endura ( the Catharist suicide code ) than through the Inquisition .
It was , therefore , natural enough for the custodians of the existing order in Europe , especially of the Christian religion , to adopt repressive measures against such revolutionary teachings .
In France Louis VIII decreed in 1226 that persons excommunicated by the diocesan bishop , or his delegate , should receive " meet punishment " ( debita animadversio ) .
In 1249 Louis IX ordered barons to deal with heretics according to the dictates of duty ( de ipsis faciant quod debebant ) .
A decree of the Council of Toulouse ( 1229 ) makes it appear probable that in France death at the stake was already comprehended as in keeping with the aforesaid debita animadversio .
To seek to trace in these measures the influence of imperial or papal ordinances is vain , since the burning of heretics had already come to be regarded as prescriptive .
It is said in the " Etablissements de St. Louis et coutumes de Beauvaisis " , ch. cxiii ( Ordonnances des Roys de France , I , 211 ) : " Quand le juge [ ecclésiastique ] laurait examiné [ le suspect ] se il trouvait , quil feust bougres , si le devrait faire envoier à la justice laie , et la justice laie le dolt fere ardoir . "
The " Coutumes de Beauvaisis " correspond to the German " Sachsenspiegel " , or " Mirror of Saxon Laws " , compiled about 1235 , which also embodies as a law sanctioned by custom the execution of unbelievers at the stake ( sal man uf der hurt burnen ) .
In Italy Emperor Frederick II , as early as 22 November , 1220 ( Mon. Germ. , II , 243 ) , issued a rescript against heretics , conceived , however quite in the spirit of Innocent III , and Honorius III commissioned his legates to see to the enforcement in Italian cities of both the canonical decrees of 1215 and the imperial legislation of 1220 .
From the foregoing it cannot be doubted that up to 1224 there was no imperial law ordering , or presupposing as legal , the burning of heretics .
The rescript for Lombardy of 1224 ( Mon. Germ. , II , 252 ; cf. ibid. , 288 ) is accordingly the first law in which death by fire is contemplated ( cf. Ficker , op. cit. , 196 ) .
That Honorius III was in any way concerned in the drafting of this ordinance cannot be maintained ; indeed the emperor was all the less in need of papal inspiration as the burning of heretics in Germany was then no longer rare ; his legists , moreover , would certainly have directed the emperors attention to the ancient Roman Law that punished high treason with death , and Manichaeism in particular with the stake .
The imperial rescripts of 1220 and 1224 were adopted into ecclesiastical criminal law in 1231 , and were soon applied at Rome .
It was then that the Inquisition of the Middle Ages came into being .
What was the immediate provocation ?
Contemporary sources afford no positive answer .
Bishop Douais , who perhaps commands the original contemporary material better than anyone , has attempted in his latest work ( L'Inquisition .
Ses Origines .
Sa Procedure , Paris , 1906 ) to explain its appearance by a supposed anxiety of Gregory IX to forestall the encroachments of Frederick II in the strictly ecclesiastical province of doctrine .
For this purpose it would seem necessary for the pope to establish a distinct and specifically ecclesiastical court .
From this point of view , though the hypothesis cannot be fully proved , much is intelligible that otherwise remains obscure .
There was doubtless reason to fear such imperial encroachments in an age yet filled with the angry contentions of the Imperium and the Sacerdotium .
We need only recall the trickery of the emperor and his pretended eagerness for the purity of the Faith , his increasingly rigorous legislation against heretics , the numerous executions of his personal rivals on the pretext of heresy , the hereditary passion of the Hohenstaufen for supreme control over Church and State , their claim of God - given authority over both , of responsibility in both domains to God and God only etc .
What was more natural than that the Church should strictly reserve to herself her own sphere , while at the same time endeavouring to avoid giving offence to the emperor ?
A purely spiritual or papal religious tribunal would secure ecclesiastical liberty and authority for this court could be confided to men of expert knowledge and blameless reputation , and above all to independent men in whose hands the Church could safely trust the decision as to the orthodoxy or heterodoxy of a given teaching .
On the other hand , to meet the emperor 's wishes as far as allowable , the penal code of the empire could be taken over as it stood ( cf. Audray , " Regist . de Grégoire IX " , n. 535 ) .
The new tribunal
(a) Its essential characteristic
The pope did not establish the Inquisition as a distinct and separate tribunal ; what he did was to appoint special but permanent judges , who executed their doctrinal functions in the name of the pope .
Where they sat , there was the Inquisition .
It must be carefully noted that the characteristic feature of the Inquisition was not its peculiar procedure , nor the secret examination of witnesses and consequent official indictment : this procedure was common to all courts from the time of Innocent III .
Nor was it the pursuit of heretics in all places : this had been the rule since the Imperial Synod of Verona under Lucius III and Frederick Barbarossa .
Nor again was it the torture , which was not prescribed or even allowed for decades after the beginning of the Inquisition , nor , finally , the various sanctions , imprisonment , confiscation , the stake , etc. , all of which punishments were usual long before the Inquisition .
The Inquisitor , strictly speaking , was a special but permanent judge , acting in the name of the pope and clothed by him with the right and the duty to deal legally with offences against the Faith ; he had , however , to adhere to the established rules of canonical procedure and pronounce the customary penalties .
Many regarded it , as providential that just at this time sprang up two new orders , the Dominicans and the Franciscans , whose members , by their superior theological training and other characteristics , seemed eminently fitted to perform the inquisitorial task with entire success .
It was safe to assume that they were not merely endowed with the requisite knowledge , but that they would also , quite unselfishly and uninfluenced by worldly motives , do solely what seemed their duty for the Good of the Church .
In addition , there was reason to hope that , because of their great popularity , they would not encounter too much opposition .
It seems , therefore , not unnatural that the inquisitors should have been chosen by the popes prevailingly from these orders , especially from that of the Dominicans .
It is to be noted , however , that the inquisitors were not chosen exclusively from the mendicant orders , though the Senator of Rome no doubt meant such when in his oath of office ( 1231 ) he spoke of inquisitores datos ab ecclesia .
In his decree of 1232 Frederick II calls them inquisitores ab apostolica sede datos .
The Dominican Alberic , in November of 1232 , went through Lombardy as inquisitor haereticae pravitatis .
The prior and sub-prior of the Dominicans at Friesbach were given a similar commission as early as 27 November , 1231 ; on 2 December , 1232 , the convent of Strasburg , and a little later the convents of Würzburg , Ratisbon , and Bremen , also received the commission .
In 1233 a rescript of Gregory IX , touching these matters , was sent simultaneously to the bishops of Southern France and to the priors of the Dominican Order .
We know that Dominicans were sent as inquisitors in 1232 to Germany along the Rhine , to the Diocese of Tarragona in Spain and to Lombardy ; in 1233 to France , to the territory of Auxerre , the ecclesiastical provinces of Bourges , Bordeaux , Narbonne , and Auch , and to Burgundy ; in 1235 to the ecclesiastical province of Sens .
In fine , about 1255 we find the Inquisition in full activity in all the countries of Central and Western Europe — in the county of Toulouse , in Sicily , Aragon , Lombardy , France , Burgundy , Brabant , and Germany ( cf. Douais , op .
cit. , p. 36 , and Fredericq , " Corpus documentorum inquisitionis haereticae pravitatis Neerlandicae , 1025 - 1520 " , 2 vols. , Ghent , 1884 - 96 ) .
That Gregory IX , through his appointment of Dominicans and Franciscans as inquisitors , withdrew the suppression of heresy from the proper courts ( i.e. from the bishops ) , is a reproach that in so general a form can not be sustained .
So little did he think of displacing episcopal authority that , on the contrary he provided explicitly that no inquisitional tribunal was to work anywhere without the diocesan bishop 's co-operation .
And if , on the strength of their papal jurisdiction , inquisitors occasionally manifested too great an inclination to act independently of episcopal authority , it was precisely the popes who kept them within right bounds .
As early as 1254 Innocent IV prohibited anew perpetual imprisonment or death at the stake without the episcopal consent .
Similar orders were issued by Urban IV in 1262 , Clement IV in 1265 , and Gregory X in 1273 , until at last Boniface VIII and Clement V solemnly declared null and void all judgments issued in trials concerning faith , unless delivered with the approval and co-operation of the bishops .
The popes always upheld with earnestness the episcopal authority , and sought to free the inquisitional tribunals from every kind of arbitrariness and caprice .
It was a heavy burden of responsibility  almost too heavy for a common mortal  which fell upon the shoulders of an inquisitor , who was obliged , at least indirectly , to decide between life and death .
The Church was bound to insist that he should possess , in a pre-eminant degree , the qualities of a good judge ; that he should be animated with a glowing zeal for the Faith , the salvation of souls , and the extirpation of heresy ; that amid all difficulties and dangers he should never yield to anger or passion ; that he should meet hostility fearlessly , but should not court it ; that he should yield to no inducement or threat , and yet not be heartless ; that , when circumstances permitted , he should observe mercy in allotting penalties ; that he should listen to the counsel of others , and not trust too much to his own opinion or to appearances , since often the probable is untrue , and the truth improbable .
Somewhat thus did Bernard Gui ( or Guldonis ) and Eymeric , both of them inquisitors for years , describe the ideal inquisitor .
Of such an inquisitor also was Gregory IX doubtlessly thinking when he urged Conrad of Marburg : " ut puniatur sic temeritas perversorum quod innocentiae puritas non laedatur "  i.e. , " not to punish the wicked so as to hurt the innocent " .
History shows us how far the inquisitors answered to this ideal .
Far from being inhuman , they were , as a rule , men of spotless character and sometimes of truly admirable sanctity , and not a few of them have been canonized by the Church .
There is absolutely no reason to look on the medieval ecclesiastical judge as intellectually and morally inferior to the modern judge .
No one would deny that the judges of today , despite occasional harsh decisions and the errors of a few , pursue a highly honourable profession .
Similarly , the medieval inquisitors should be judged as a whole .
Moreover , history does not justify the hypothesis that the medieval heretics were prodigies of virtue , deserving our sympathy in advance .
( b) Procedure
This regularly began with a month 's " term of grace " , proclaimed by the inquisitor whenever he came to a heresy - ridden district .
The inhabitants were summoned to appear before the inquisitor .
On those who confessed of their own accord a suitable penance ( e.g. a pilgrimage ) was imposed , but never a severe punishment like incarceration or surrender to the civil power .
However , these relations with the residents of a place often furnished important indications , pointed out the proper quarter for investigation , and sometimes much evidence was thus obtained against individuals .
These were then cited before the judges  usually by the parish priest , although occasionally by the secular authorities  and the trial began .
If the accused at once made full and free confession , the affair was soon concluded , and not to the disadvantage of the accused .
But in most instances the accused entered denial even after swearing on the Four Gospels , and this denial was stubborn in the measure that the testimony was incriminating .
David of Augsburg ( cf. Preger , " Der Traktat des David von Augshurg uber die Waldenser " , Munich , 1878 pp. 43 sqq. ) pointed out to the inquisitor four methods of extracting open acknowledgment :
fear of death , i.e. by giving the accused to understand that the stake awaited him if he would not confess ;
more or less close confinement , possibly emphasized by curtailment of food ;
visits of tried men , who would attempt to induce free confession through friendly persuasion ;
torture , which will be discussed below .
( c) The Witnesses
When no voluntary admission was made , evidence was adduced .
Legally , there had to be at least two witnesses , although conscientious judges rarely contented themselves with that number .
The principle had hitherto been held by the Church that the testimony of a heretic , an excommunicated person , a perjurer , in short , of an " infamous " , was worthless before the courts .
But in its destination of unbelief the Church took the further step of abolishing this long established practice , and of accepting a heretic 's evidence at nearly full value in trials concerning faith .
This appears as early as the twelfth century in the " Decretum Gratiani " .
While Frederick II readily assented to this new departure , the inquisitors seemed at first uncertain as to the value of the evidence of an " infamous " person .
It was only in 1261 , after Alexander IV had silenced their scruples , that the new principle was generally adopted both in theory and in practice .
This grave modification seems to have been defended on the ground that the heretical conventicles took place secretly , and were shrouded in great obscurity , so that reliable information could be obtained from none but themselves .
Even prior to the establishment of the Inquisition the names of the witnesses were sometimes withheld from the accused person , and this usage was legalized by Gregory IX , Innocent IV , and Alexander IV .
Boniface VIII , however , set it aside by his Bull " Ut commissi vobis officii " ( Sext. Decret. , 1. V , tit. ii ) ; and commanded that at all trials , even inquisitorial , the witnesses must be named to the accused .
There was no personal confrontation of witnesses , neither was there any cross-examination .
Witnesses for the defence hardly ever appeared , as they would almost infallibly be suspected of being heretics or favourable to heresy .
For the same reason those impeached rarely secured legal advisers , and were therefore obliged to make personal response to the main points of a charge .
This , however , was also no innovation , for in 1205 Innocent III , by the Bull " Si adversus vos " forbade any legal help for heretics : " We strictly prohibit you , lawyers and notaries , from assisting in any way , by council or support , all heretics and such as believe in them , adhere to them , render them any assistance or defend them in any way . "
But this severity soon relaxed , and even in Eymeric 's day it seems to have been the universal custom to grant heretics a legal adviser , who , however , had to be in every way beyond suspicion , " upright , of undoubted loyalty , skilled in civil and canon law , and zealous for the faith . "
Meanwhile , even in those hard times , such legal severities were felt to be excessive , and attempts were made to mitigate them in various ways , so as to protect the natural rights of the accused .
First he could make known to the judge the names of his enemies : should the charge originate with them , they would be quashed without further ado .
Furthermore , it was undoubtedly to the advantage of the accused that false witnesses were punished without mercy .
The aforesaid inquisitor , Bernard Gui , relates an instance of a father falsely accusing his son of heresy .
The son's innocence quickly coming to light , the false accuser was apprehended , and sentenced to prison for life ( solam vitam ei ex misericordia relinquentes ) .
In addition he was pilloried for five consecutive Sundays before the church during service , with bare head and bound hands .
Perjury in those days was accounted an enormous offence , particularly when committed by a false witness .
Moreover , the accused had a considerable advantage in the fact that the inquisitor had to conduct the trial in co-operation with the diocesan bishop or his representatives , to whom all documents relating to the trial had to be remitted .
Both together , inquisitor and bishop , were also made to summon and consult a number of upright and experienced men ( boni viri ) , and to decide in agreement with their decision ( vota ) .
Innocent IV ( 11 July , 1254 ) , Alexander IV ( 15 April , 1255 , and 27 April , 1260 ) , and Urban IV ( 2 August , 1264 ) strictly prescribed this institution of the boni viri  i.e. the consultation in difficult cases of experienced men , well versed in theology and canon law , and in every way irreproachable .
The documents of the trial were either in their entirety handed to them , or a least an abstract drawn up by a public notary was furnished ; they were also made acquainted with the witnesses ' names , and their first duty was to decide whether or not the witnesses were credible .
The boni viri were very frequently called on .
Thirty , fifty , eighty , or more persons  laymen and priests ; secular and regular  would be summoned , all highly respected and independent men , and singly sworn to give verdict upon the cases before them accordingly to the best of their knowledge and belief .
Substantially they were always called upon to decide two questions : whether and what guilt lay at hand , and what punishment was to be inflicted .
That they might be influenced by no personal considerations , the case would be submitted to them somewhat in the abstract , i.e. , the name of the person inculpated was not given .
Although , strictly speaking , the boni viri were entitled only to an advisory vote , the final ruling was usually in accordance with their views , and , whether their decision was revised , it was always in the direction of clemency , the mitigation of the findings being indeed of frequent occurrence .
The judges were also assisted by a consilium permanens , or standing council , composed of other sworn judges .
In these dispositions surely lay the most valuable guarantees for all objective , impartial , and just operation of the inquisition courts .
Apart from the conduct of his own defence the accused disposed of other legal means for safeguarding his rights : he could reject a judge who had shown prejudice , and at any stage of the trial could appeal to Rome .
Eymeric leads one to infer that in Aragon appeals to the Holy See were not rare .
He himself as inquisitor had on one occasion to go to Rome to defend in person his own position , but he advises other inquisitors against that step , as it simply meant the loss of much time and money ; it were wiser , he says , to try a case in such a manner that no fault could be found .
In the event of an appeal the documents of the case were to be sent to Rome under seal , and Rome not only scrutinized them , but itself gave the final verdict .
Seemingly , appeals to Rome were in great favour ; a milder sentence , it was hoped , would be forthcoming , or at least some time would be gained .
(d) Punishments
The present writer can find nothing to suggest that the accused were imprisoned during the period of inquiry .
It was certainly customary to grant the accused person his freedom until the sermo generalis , were he ever so strongly inculpated through witnesses or confession ; he was not yet supposed guilty , though he was compelled to promise under oath always to be ready to come before the inquisitor , and in the end to accept with good grace his sentence , whatever its tenor .
The oath was assuredly a terrible weapon in the hands of the medieval judge .
If the accused person kept it , the judge was favourably inclined ; on the other hand , if the accused violated it , his credit grew worse .
Many sects , it was known , repudiated oaths on principle ; hence the violation of an oath caused the guilty party easily to incur suspicion of heresy .
Besides the oath , the inquisitor might secure himself by demanding a sum of money as bail , or reliable bondsmen who would stand surety for the accused .
It happened , too , that bondsmen undertook upon oath to deliver the accused " dead or alive "
It was perhaps unpleasant to live under the burden of such an obligation , but , at any rate , it was more endurable than to await a final verdict in rigid confinement for months or longer .
Curiously enough , torture was not regarded as a mode of punishment , but purely as a means of eliciting the truth .
It was not of ecclesiastical origin , and was long prohibited in the ecclesiastical courts .
Nor was it originally an important factor in the inquisitional procedure , being unauthorized until twenty years after the Inquisition had begun .
It was first authorized by Innocent IV in his Bull " Ad exstirpanda " of 15 May , 1252 , which was confirmed by Alexander IV on 30 November , 1259 , and by Clement IV on 3 November , 1265 .
The limit placed upon torture was citra membri diminutionem et mortis periculum  i.e , it was not to cause the loss of life or limb or imperil life .
Torture was to applied only once , and not then unless the accused were uncertain in his statements , and seemed already virtually convicted by manifold and weighty proofs .
In general , this violent testimony ( quaestio ) was to be deferred as long as possible , and recourse to it was permitted in only when all other expedients were exhausted .
Conscientious and sensible judges quite properly attached no great importance to confessions extracted by torture .
After long experience Eymeric declared : Quaestiones sunt fallaces et inefficaces  i.e the torture is deceptive and ineffectual .
Had this papal legislation been adhered to in practice , the historian of the Inquisition would have fewer difficulties to satisfy .
In the beginning , torture was held to be so odious that clerics were forbidden to be present under pain of irregularity .
Sometimes it had to be interrupted so as to enable the inquisitor to continue his examination , which , of course , was attended by numerous inconveniences .
Therefore on 27 April , 1260 , Alexander IV authorized inquisitors to absolve one another of this irregularity .
Urban IV on 2 August , 1262 , renewed the permission , and this was soon interpreted as formal licence to continue the examination in the torture chamber itself .
The inquisitors manuals faithfully noted and approved this usage .
The general rule ran that torture was to be resorted to only once .
But this was sometimes circumvented  first , by assuming that with every new piece of evidence the rack could be utilized afresh , and secondly , by imposing fresh torments on the poor victim ( often on different days ) , not by way of repetition , but as a continuation ( non ad modum iterationis sed continuationis ) , as defended by Eymeric ; " quia , iterari non debent [ tormenta ] , nisi novis supervenitibus indiciis , continuari non prohibentur . "
But what was to be done when the accused , released from the rack , denied what he had just confessed ?
Some held with Eymeric that the accused should be set at liberty ; others , however , like the author of the " Sacro Arsenale " held that the torture should be continued , because the accused had too seriously incriminated himself by his previous confession .
When Clement V formulated his regulations for the employment of torture , he never imagined that eventually even witnesses would be put on the rack , although not their guilt , but that of the accused , was in question .
From the pope 's silence it was concluded that a witness might be put upon the rack at the discretion of the inquisitor .
Moreover , if the accused was convicted through witnesses , or had pleaded guilty , the torture might still he used to compel him to testify against his friends and fellow - culprits .
It would be opposed to all Divine and human equity  so one reads in the " Sacro Arsenale , ovvero Pratica dell Officio della Santa Inquisizione " ( Bologna , 1665 )  to inflict torture unless the judge were personally persuaded of the guilt of the accused .
But one of the difficulties of the procedure is why torture was used as a means of learning the truth .
On the one hand , the torture was continued until the accused confessed or intimated that he was willing to confess .
On the other hand , it was not desired , as in fact it was not possible , to regard as freely made a confession wrung by torture .
It is at once apparent how little reliance may be placed upon the assertion so often repeated in the minutes of trials , " confessionem esse veram , non factam vi tormentorum " ( the confession was true and free ) , even though one had not occasionally read in the preceding pages that , after being taken down from the rack ( postquam depositus fuit de tormento ) , he freely confessed this or that .
However , it is not of greater importance to say that torture is seldom mentioned in the records of inquisition trials  but once , for example in 636 condemnations between 1309 and 1323 ; this does not prove that torture was rarely applied .
Since torture was originally inflicted outside the court room by lay officials , and since only the voluntary confession was valid before the judges , there was no occasion to mention in the records the fact of torture .
On the other hand it , is historically true that the popes not only always held that torture must not imperil life or but also tried to abolish particularly grievous abuses , when such became known to them .
Thus Clement V ordained that inquisitors should not apply the torture without the consent of the diocesan bishop .
From the middle of the thirteenth century , they did not disavow the principle itself , and , as their restrictions to its use were not always heeded , its severity , though of tell exaggerated , was in many cases extreme .
The consuls of Carcassonne in 1286 complained to the pope , the King of France , and the vicars of the local bishop against the inquisitor Jean Garland , whom they charged with inflicting torture in an absolutely inhuman manner , and this charge was no isolated one .
The case of Savonarola has never been altogether cleared up in this respect .
The official report says he had to suffer three and a half tratti da fune ( a sort of strappado ) .
When Alexander VI showed discontent with the delays of the trial , the Florentine government excused itself by urging that Savonarola was a man of extraordinary sturdiness and endurance , and that he had been vigorously tortured on many days ( assidua quaestione multis diebus , the papal prothonotary , Burchard , says seven times ) but with little effect .
It is to be noted that torture was most cruelly used , where the inquisitors were most exposed to the pressure of civil authority .
Frederick II , though always boasting of his zeal for the purity of the Faith , abused both rack and Inquisition to put out of the way his personal enemies .
The tragical ruin of the Templars is ascribed to the abuse of torture by Philip the Fair and his henchmen .
At Paris , for instance , thirty - six , and at Sens twenty - five , Templars died as the result of torture .
Blessed Joan of Arc could not have been sent to the stake as a heretic and a recalcitrant , if her judges had not been tools of English policy .
And the excesses of the Spanish Inquisition are largely due to the fact that in its administration civil purposes overshadowed the ecclesiastical .
Every reader of the " Cautio criminalis " of the Jesuit Father Friedrich Spee knows to whose account chiefly must be set down the horrors of the witchcraft trials .
Most of the punishments that were properly speaking inquisitional were not inhuman , either by their nature or by the manner of their infliction .
Most frequently certain good works were ordered , e.g. the building of a church , the visitation of a church , a pilgrimage more or less distant , the offering of a candle or a chalice , participation in a crusade , and the like .
Other works partook more of the character of real and to some extent degrading punishments , e.g. fines , whose proceeds were devoted to such public purposes as church - building , road - making , and the like ; whipping with rods during religious service ; the pillory ; the wearing of coloured crosses , and so on .
The hardest penalties were imprisonment in its various degrees , exclusion from the communion of the Church , and the usually consequent surrender to the civil power .
" Cum ecclesia " ran the regular expression , " ultra non habeat quod faciat pro suis demeritis contra ipsum , idcirco , eundum reliquimus brachio et iudicio saeculari "  i.e. since the Church can no farther punish his misdeeds , she leaves him to the civil authority .
Naturally enough , punishment as a legal sanction is always a hard and painful thing , whether decreed by civil or ecclesiastical justice .
There is , however , always an essential distinction between civil and ecclesiastical punishment .
While chastisement inflicted by secular authority aims chiefly at punishment violation of the law , the Church seeks primarily the correction of the delinquent ; indeed his spiritual welfare frequently so much in view that the element of punishment is almost entirely lost sight of .
Commands to hear Holy Mass on Sundays and holidays , to frequent religious services , to abstain from manual labour , to receive Communion at the chief festivals of the year , to forbear from soothsaying and usury , etc. , can be efficacious as helps toward the fulfillment of Christian duties .
It being furthermore incumbent on the inquisitor to consider not merely the external sanction , but also the inner change of heart , his sentence lost the quasi-mechanical stiffness so often characteristic of civil condemnation .
Moreover , the penalties incurred were on numberless occasions remitted , mitigated , or commuted .
In the records of the Inquisition we very frequently read that because of old age , sickness , or poverty in the family , the due punishment was materially reduced owing to the inquisitor 's sheer pity , or the petition of a good Catholic .
Imprisonment for life was altered to a fine , and this to an alms ; participation in a crusade was commuted into a pilgrimage , while a distant and costly pilgrimage became a visit to a neighboring shrine or church , and so on .
If the inquisitor 's leniency were abused , he was authorized to revive in full the original punishment .
On the whole , the Inquisition was humanely conducted .
Thus we read that a son obtained his father 's release by merely asking for it , without putting forward any special reasons .
Licence to leave risen for three weeks , three months , or an unlimited period — say until the recovery or decease of sick parents — was not infrequent .
Rome itself censured inquisitioners or deposed them because they were too harsh , but never because they mere too merciful .
Imprisonment was not always accounted punishment in the proper sense : it was rather looked on as an opportunity for repentance , a preventive against backsliding or the infection of others .
It was known as immuration ( from the Latin murus , a wall ) , or incarceration , and was inflicted for a definite time or for life .
Immuration for life was the lot of those who had failed to profit by the aforesaid term of grace , or had perhaps recanted only from fear of death , or had once before abjured heresy .
The murus strictus seu arctus , or carcer strictissimus , implied close and solitary confinement , occasionally aggravated by fasting or chains .
In practice , however , these regulations were not always enforced literally .
We read of immured persons receiving visits rather freely , playing games , or dining with their jailors .
On the other hand , solitary confinement was at times deemed insufficient , and then the immured were put in irons or chained to the prison wall .
Members of a religious order , when condemned for life , were immured in their own convent , nor ever allowed to speak with any of their fraternity .
The dungeon or cell was euphemistically called " In Pace " ; it was , indeed , the tomb of a man buried alive .
It was looked upon as a remarkable favour when , in 1330 , through the good offices of the Archbishop of Toulouse , the French king permitted a dignitary of a certain order to visit the " In Pace " twice a month and comfort his imprisoned brethren , against which favour the Dominicans lodged with Clement VI a fruitless protest .
Though the prison cells were directed to be kept in such a way as to endanger neither the life nor the health of occupants , their true condition was sometimes deplorable , as we see from a document published by J.B. Vidal ( Annales de St - Louis des Francais , 1905 P. 362 ) :
In some cells the unfortunates were bound in stocks or chains , unable to move about , and forced to sleep on the ground . . . .
There was little regard for cleanliness .
In some cases there was no light or ventilation , and the food was meagre and very poor .
Officially it was not the Church that sentenced unrepenting heretics to death , more particularly to the stake .
As legate of the Roman Church even Gregory IV never went further than the penal ordinances of Innocent III required , nor ever inflicted a punishment more severe than excommunication .
Not until four years after the commencement of his pontificate did he admit the opinion , then prevalent among legists , that heresy should be punished with death , seeing that it was confessedly no less serious an offence than high treason .
Nevertheless he continued to insist on the exclusive right of the Church to decide in authentic manner in matters of heresy ; at the same time it was not her office to pronounce sentence of death .
The Church , thenceforth , expelled from her bosom the impenitent heretic , whereupon the state took over the duty of his temporal punishment .
Frederick II was of the same opinion ; in his Constitution of 1224 he says that heretics convicted by an ecclesiastical court shall , on imperial authority , suffer death by fire ( auctoritate nostra ignis iudicio concremandos ) , and similarly in 1233 " praesentis nostrae legis edicto damnatos mortem pati decernimus . "
In this way Gregory IX may be regarded as having had no share either directly or indirectly in the death of condemned heretics .
Not so the succeeding popes .
In the Bull " Ad exstirpanda " ( 1252 ) Innocent IV says :
When those adjudged guilty of heresy have been given up to the civil power by the bishop or his representative , or the Inquisition , the podestà or chief magistrate of the city shall take them at once , and shall , within five days at the most , execute the laws made against them .
Moreover , he directs that this Bull and the corresponding regulations of Frederick II be entered in every city among the municipal statutes under pain of excommunication , which was also visited on those who failed to execute both the papal and the imperial decrees .
Nor could any doubt remain as to what civil regulations were meant , for the passages which ordered the burning of impenitent heretics were inserted in the papal decretals from the imperial constitutions " Commissis nobis " and " Inconsutibilem tunicam " .
The aforesaid Bull " Ad exstirpanda " remained thenceforth a fundamental document of the Inquisition , renewed or reinforced by several popes , Alexander IV ( 1254-61 ) , Clement IV ( 1265-68 ) , Nicholas IV ( 1288-02 ) , Boniface VIII ( 1294-1303 ) , and others .
The civil authorities , therefore , were enjoined by the popes , under pain of excommunication to execute the legal sentences that condemned impenitent heretics to the stake .
It is to be noted that excommunication itself was no trifle , for , if the person excommunicated did not free himself from excommunication within a year , he was held by the legislation of that period to be a heretic , and incurred all the penalties that affected heresy .
The Number of Victims .
How many victims were handed over to the civil power cannot be stated with even approximate accuracy .
We have nevertheless some valuable information about a few of the Inquisition tribunals , and their statistics are not without interest .
At Pamiers , from 1318 to 1324 , out of twenty - four persons convicted but five were delivered to the civil power , and at Toulouse from 1308 to 1323 , only forty - two out of nine hundred and thirty bear the ominous note " relictus culiae saeculari " .
Thus , at Pamiers one in thirteen , and at Toulouse one in forty - two seem to have been burnt for heresy although these places were hotbeds of heresy and therefore principal centres of the Inquisition .
We may add , also , that this was the most active period of the institution .
These data and others of the same nature bear out the assertion that the Inquisition marks a substantial advance in the contemporary administration of justice , and therefore in the general civilization of mankind .
A more terrible fate awaited the heretic when judged by a secular court .
In 1249 Count Raymund VII of Toulouse caused eighty confessed heretics to be burned in his presence without permitting them to recant .
It is impossible to imagine any such trials before the Inquisition courts .
The large numbers of burnings detailed in various histories are completely unauthenticated , and are either the deliberate invention of pamphleteers , or are based on materials that pertain to the Spanish Inquisition of later times or the German witchcraft trials ( Vacandard , op. cit. , 237 sqq. ) .
Once the Roman Law touching the crimen laesae majestatis had been made to cover the case of heresy , it was only natural that the royal or imperial treasury should imitate the Roman fiscus , and lay claim to the property of persons condemned .
It was fortunate , though inconsistent and certainly not strict justice , that this penalty did not affect every condemned person , but only those sentenced to perpetual confinement or the stake .
Even so , this circumstance added not a little to the penalty , especially as in this respect innocent people , the culprit 's wife and children , were the chief sufferers .
Confiscation was also decreed against persons deceased , and there is a relatively high number of such judgments .
Of the six hundred and thirty - six cases that came before the inquisitor Bernard Gui , eighty - eight pertained to dead people .
(e) The Final Verdict
The ultimate decision was usually pronounced with solemn ceremonial at the sermo generalis  or auto - da - fé ( act of faith ) , as it was later called .
One or two days prior to this sermo everyone concerned had the charges read to him again briefly , and in the vernacular ; the evening before he was told where and when to appear to hear the verdict .
The sermo , a short discourse or exhortation , began very early in the morning ; then followed the swearing in of the secular officials , who were made to vow obedience to the inquisitor in all things pertaining to the suppression of heresy .
Then regularly followed the so - called " decrees of mercy " ( i.e. commutations , mitigations , and remission of previously imposed penalties ) , and finally due punishments were assigned to the guilty , after their offences had been again enumerated .
This announcement began with the minor punishments , and went on to the most severe , i.e. , perpetual imprisonment or death .
Thereupon the guilty were turned over to the civil power , and with this act the sermo generalis closed , and the inquisitional proceedings were at an end .
(3) The chief scene of the Inquisition 's activity was Central and Southern Europe .
The Scandinavian countries were spared altogether .
It appears in England only on the occasion of the trial of the Templars , nor was it known in Castile and Portugal until the accession of Ferdinand and Isabella .
It was introduced into the Netherlands with the Spanish domination , while in Northern France it was relatively little known .
On the other hand , the Inquisition , whether because of the particularly perilous sectarianism there prevalent or of the greater severity of ecclesiastical and civil rulers , weighed heavily on Italy ( especially Lombardy ) , on Southern France ( in particular the country of Toulouse and on Languedoc ) and finally on the Kingdom of Aragon and on Germany .
Honorius IV ( 1285 - 87 ) introduced it into Sardinia , and in the fifteenth century it displayed excessive zeal in Flanders and Bohemia .
The inquisitors were , as a rule , irreproachable , not merely in personal conduct , but in the administration of their office .
Some , however , like Robert le Bougre , a Bulgarian ( Catharist ) convert to Christianity and subsequently a Dominican , seem to have yielded to a blind fanaticism and deliberately to have provoked executions en masse .
On 29 May , 1239 , at Montwimer in Champagne , Robert consigned to the flames at one time about a hundred and eighty persons , whose trial had begun and ended within one week .
Later , when Rome found that the complaints against him were justified , he was first deposed and then incarcerated for life .
(4) How are we to explain the Inquisition in the light of its own period ?
For the true office of the historian is not to defend facts and conditions , but to study and understand them in their natural course and connection .
It is indisputable that in the past scarcely any community or nation vouchsafed perfect toleration to those who set up a creed different from that of the generality .
A kind of iron law would seem to dispose mankind to religious intolerance .
Even long before the Roman State tried to check with violence the rapid encroachments of Christianity , Plato had declared it one of the supreme duties of the governmental authority in his ideal state to show no toleration towards the " godless "  that is , towards those who denied the state religion  even though they were content to live quietly and without proselytizing ; their very example , he said would be dangerous .
They were to be kept in custody ; " in a place where one grew wise " ( sophronisterion ) , as the place of incarceration was euphemistically called ; they should be relegated thither for five years , and during this time listen to religious instruction every day .
The more active and proselytizing opponents of the state religion were to be imprisoned for life in dreadful dungeons , and after death to be deprived of burial .
It is thus evident what little justification there is for regarding intolerance as a product of the Middle Ages .
Everywhere and always in the past men believed that nothing disturbed the common weal and public peace so much as religious dissensions and conflicts , and that , on the other hand , a uniform public faith was the surest guarantee for the State 's stability and prosperity .
The more thoroughly religion had become part of the national life , and the stronger the general conviction of its inviolability and Divine origin , the more disposed would men be to consider every attack on it as an intolerable crime against the Deity and a highly criminal menace to the public peace .
The first Christian emperors believed that one of the chief duties of an imperial ruler was to place his sword at the service of the Church and orthodoxy , especially as their titles of " Pontifex Maximus " and " Bishop of the Exterior " seemed to argue in them Divinely appointed agents of Heaven .
Nevertheless the principal teachers of the Church held back for centuries from accepting in these matters the practice of the civil rulers ; they shrank particularly from such stern measures against heresy as punishment , both of which they deemed inconsistent with the spirit of Christianity .
But , in the Middle Ages , the Catholic Faith became alone dominant , and the welfare of the Commonwealth came to be closely bound up with the cause of religious unity .
King Peter of Aragon , therefore , but voiced the universal conviction when he said : " The enemies of the Cross of Christ and violators of the Christian law are likewise our enemies and the enemies of our kingdom , and ought therefore to be dealt with as such . "
Emperor Frederick
II emphasized this view more vigorously than any other prince , and enforced it in his Draconian enactments against heretics .
The representative of the Church were also children of their own time , and in their conflict with heresy accepted the help that their age freely offered them , and indeed often forced upon them .
Theologians and canonists , the highest and the saintliest , stood by the code of their day , and sought to explain and to justify it .
The learned and holy Raymund of Pennafort , highly esteemed by Gregory IX , was content with the penalties that dated from Innocent III , viz. , the ban of the empire , confiscation of property , confinement in prison , etc .
But before the end of the century , St. Thomas Aquinas ( Summa Theol. , II - II : 11:3 and II - II : 11:4 ) already advocated capital punishment for heresy though it cannot be said that his arguments altogether compel conviction .
The Angelic Doctor , however speaks only in a general way of punishment by death , and does not specify more nearly the manner of its infliction .
This the jurists did in a positive way that was truly terrible .
The celebrated Henry of Segusia ( Susa ) , named Hostiensis after his episcopal See of Ostia ( d. 1271 ) , and the no less eminent Joannes Andreae ( d. 1345 ) , when interpreting the Decree " Ad abolendam " of Lucius III , take debita animadversio ( due punishment ) as synonymous with ignis crematio ( death by fire ) , a meaning which certainly did not attach to the original expression of 1184 .
Theologians and jurists based their attitude to some extent on the similarity between heresy and high treason ( crimen laesae maiestatis ) , a suggestion that they owed to the Law of Ancient Rome .
They argued , moreover , that if the death penalty could be rightly inflicted on thieves and forgers , who rob us only of worldly goods , how much more righteously on those who cheat us out of supernatural goods  out of faith , the sacraments , the life of the soul .
In the severe legislation of the Old Testament ( Deuteronomy 13:6 - 9 ; 17:1 - 6 ) they found another argument .
And lest some should urge that those ordinances were abrogated by Christianity , the words of Christ were recalled : " I am not come to destroy , but to fulfill " ( Matthew 5:17 ) ; also His other saying ( John 15:6 ) : " If any one abide not in me , he shall be cast forth as a branch , and shall wither , and they shall gather him up , and cast him into the fire , and he burneth " ( in ignem mittent , et ardet ) .
It is well known that belief in the justice of punishing heresy with death was so common among the sixteenth century reformers 
Luther , Zwingli , Calvin , and their adherents  that we may say their toleration began where their power ended .
The Reformed theologian , Hieronymus Zanchi , declared in a lecture delivered at the University of Heidleberg :
We do not now ask if the authorities may pronounce sentence of death upon heretics ; of that there can be no doubt , and all learned and right - minded men acknowledge it .
The only question is whether the authorities are bound to perform this duty .
In forming an estimate of the Inquisition , it is necessary to distinguish clearly between principles and historical fact on the one hand , and on the other those exaggerations or rhetorical descriptions which reveal bias and an obvious determination to injure Catholicism , rather than to encourage the spirit of tolerance and further its exercise .
It is also essential to note that the Inquisition , in its establishment and procedure , pertained not to the sphere of belief , but to that of discipline .
The dogmatic teaching of the Church is in no way affected by the question as to whether the Inquisition was justified in its scope , or wise in its methods , or extreme in its practice .
The Church established by Christ , as a perfect society , is empowered to make laws and inflict penalties for their violation .
Heresy not only violates her law but strikes at her very life , unity of belief ; and from the beginning the heretic had incurred all the penalties of the ecclesiastical courts .
When Christianity became the religion of the Empire , and still more when the peoples of Northern Europe became Christian nations , the close alliance of Church and State made unity of faith essential not only to the ecclesiastical organization , but also to civil society .
Heresy , in consequence , was a crime which secular rulers were bound in duty to punish .
It was regarded as worse than any other crime , even that of high treason ; it was for society in those times what we call anarchy .
Hence the severity with which heretics were treated by the secular power long before the Inquisition was established .
As regards the character of these punishments , it should be considered that they were the natural expression not only of the legislative power , but also of the popular hatred for heresy in an age that dealt both vigorously and roughly with criminals of every type .
The heretic , in a word , was simply an outlaw whose offence , in the popular mind , deserved and sometimes received a punishment as summary as that which is often dealt out in our own day by an infuriated populace to the authors of justly detested crimes .
That such intolerance was not peculiar to Catholicism , but was the natural accompaniment of deep religious conviction in those , also , who abandoned the Church , is evident from the measures taken by some of the Reformers against those who differed from them in matters of belief .
As the learned Dr. Schaff declares in his " History of the Christian Church " ( vol. V , New York , 1907 , p. 524 ) ,
To the great humiliation of the Protestant churches , religious intolerance and even persecution unto death were continued long after the Reformation .
In Geneva the pernicious theory was put into practice by state and church , even to the use of torture and the admission of the testimony of children against their parents , and with the sanction of Calvin .
Bullinger , in the second Helvetic Confession , announced the principle that heresy could be punished like murder or treason .
The inquisition in Spain
Historical facts
Religious conditions similar to those in Southern France occasioned the establishment of the Inquisition in the neighboring Kingdom of Aragon .
As early as 1226 King James I had forbidden the Catharists his kingdom , and in 1228 had outlawed both them and their friends .
A little later , on the advice of his confessor , Raymund of Pennafort , he asked Gregory IX to establish the Inquisition in Aragon .
By the Bull " Declinante jam mundi " of 26 May , 1232 , Archbishop Esparrago and his suffragans were instructed to search , either personally or by enlisting the services of the Dominicans or other suitable agents , and condignly punish the heretics in their dioceses .
At the Council of Lérida in 1237 the Inquisition was formally confided to the Dominicans and the Franciscans .
At the Synod of Tarragona in 1242 , Raymund of Pennafort defined the terms haereticus , receptor , fautor , defensor , etc. , and outlined the penalties to be inflicted .
Although the ordinances of Innocent IV , Urban IV , and Clement VI were also adopted and executed with strictness by the Dominican Order , no striking success resulted .
The Inquisitor Fray Pence de Planes was poisoned , and Bernardo Travasser earned the crown of martyrdom at the hands of the heretics .
Aragon 's best - known inquisitor is the Dominican Nicolas Eymeric ( Quétif - Echard , " Scriptores Ord. Pr. " , I , 709 sqq . ) .
His " Directorium Inquisitionis " ( written in Aragon 1376 ; printed at Rome 1587 , Venice 1595 and 1607 ) , based on forty - four years experience , is an original source and a document of the highest historical value .
The Spanish Inquisition , however , properly begins with the reign of Ferdinand the Catholic and Isabella .
The Catholic faith was then endangered by pseudo - converts from Judaism ( Marranos ) and Mohammedanism ( Moriscos ) .
On 1 November , 1478 , Sixtus IV empowered the Catholic sovereigns to set up the Inquisition .
The judges were to be at least forty years old , of unimpeachable reputation , distinguished for virtue and wisdom , masters of theology , or doctors or licentiates of canon law , and they must follow the usual ecclesiastical rules and regulations .
On 17 September , 1480 , Their Catholic Majesties appointed , at first for Seville , the two Dominicans Miguel de Morillo and Juan de San Martin as inquisitors , with two of the secular clergy assistants .
Before long complaints of grievous abuses reached Rome , and were only too well founded .
In a Brief of Sixtus IV of 29 January 1482 , they were blamed for having , upon the alleged authority of papal Briefs , unjustly imprisoned many people , subjected them to cruel tortures , declared them false believers , and sequestrated the property of the executed .
They were at first admonished to act only in conjunction with the bishops , and finally were threatened with deposition , and would indeed have been deposed had not Their Majesties interceded for them .
Fray Tomás Torquemada ( b. at Valladolid in 1420 , d. at Avila , 16 September , 1498 ) was the true organizer of the Spanish Inquisition .
At the solicitation of their Spanish Majesties ( Paramo , II , tit. ii , c , iii , n . 9 ) Sixtus IV bestowed on Torquemada the office of grand inquisitor , the institution of which indicates a decided advance in the development of the Spanish Inquisition .
Innocent VIII approved the act of his predecessor , and under date of 11 February , 1486 , and 6 February , 1487 , Torquemada was given dignity of grand inquisitor for the kingdoms of Castile , Leon , Aragon , Valencia , etc .
The institution speedily ramified from Seville to Cordova , Jaén , Villareal , and Toledo , About 1538 there were nineteen courts , to which three were afterwards added in Spanish America ( Mexico , Lima , and Cartagena ) .
Attempts at introducing it into Italy failed , and the efforts to establish it in the Netherlands entailed disastrous consequences for the mother country .
In Spain , however , it remained operative into the nineteenth century .
Originally called into being against secret Judaism and secret Islam , it served to repel Protestantism in the sixteenth century , but was unable to expel French Rationalism and immorality of the eighteenth .
King Joseph Bonaparte abrogated it in 1808 , but it was reintroduced by Ferdinand VII in 1814 and approved by Pius VII on certain conditions , among others the abolition of torture .
It was definitely abolished by the Revolution of 1820 .
Organization
At the head of the Inquisition , known as the Holy Office , stood the grand inquisitor , nominated by the king and confirmed by the pope .
By virtue of his papal credentials he enjoyed authority to delegate his powers to other suitable persons , and to receive appeals from all Spanish courts .
He was aided by a High Council ( Consejo Supremo ) consisting of five members  the so - called Apostolic inquisitors , two secretaries , two relatores , one advocatus fiscalis  and several consulters and qualificators .
The officials of the supreme tribunal were appointed by the grand inquisitor after consultation with the king .
The former could also freely appoint , transfer , remove from office , visit , and inspect or call to account all inquisitors and officials of the lower courts .
Philip III , on 16 December , 1618 , gave the Dominicans the privilege of having one of their order permanently a member of the Consejo Supremo .
All power was really concentrated in this supreme tribunal .
It decided important or disputed questions , and heard appeals ; without its approval no priest , knight , or noble could be imprisoned , and no auto - da - fé held ; an annual report was made to it concerning the entire Inquisition , and once a month a financial report .
Everyone was subject to it , not excepting priests , bishops , or even the sovereign .
The Spanish Inquisition is distinguished from the medieval its monarchical constitution and a greater consequent centralization , as also by the constant and legally provided - for influence of the crown on all official appointments and the progress of trials .
Procedure
The procedure , on the other hand , was substantially the same as that already described .
Here , too , a " term of grace " of thirty to forty days was invariably granted , and was often prolonged .
Imprisonment resulted only when unanimity had been arrived at , or the offence had been proved .
Examination of the accused could take place only in the presence of two disinterested priests , whose obligation it was to restrain any arbitrary act in their presence the protocol had to be read out twice to the accused .
The defence lay always in the hands of a lawyer .
The witnesses , although unknown to the accused , were sworn , and very severe punishment , even death , awaited false witnesses , ( cf. Brief of Leo X of 14 December , 1518 ) .
Torture was applied only too frequently and too cruelly , but certainly not more cruelly than under Charles V's system of judicial torture in Germany .
Historical analysis
The Spanish Inquisition deserves neither the exaggerated praise nor the equally exaggerated vilification often bestowed on it .
The number of victims cannot be calculated with even approximate accuracy ; the much maligned autos - da - fé were in reality but a religious ceremony ( actus fidei ) ; the San Benito has its counterpart in similar garbs elsewhere ; the cruelty of St. Peter Arbues , to whom not a single sentence of death can be traced with certainty , belongs to the realms of fable .
However , the predominant ecclesiastical nature of the institution can hardly be doubted .
The Holy See sanctioned the institution , accorded to the grand inquisitor canonical installation and therewith judicial authority concerning matters of faith , while from the grand inquisitor jurisdiction passed down to the subsidiary tribunals under his control .
Joseph de Maistre introduced the thesis that the Spanish Inquisition was mostly a civil tribunal ; formerly , however , theologians never questioned its ecclesiastical nature .
Only thus , indeed , can one explain how the Popes always admitted appeals from it to the Holy See , called to themselves entire trials and that at any stage of the proceedings , exempted whole classes of believers from its jurisdiction , intervened in the legislation , deposed grand inquisitors , and so on .
( See TOMÁS DE TORQUEMADA . )
The Holy Office at Rome
The great apostasy of the sixteenth century , the filtration of heresy into Catholic lands , and the progress of heterodox teachings everywhere , prompted Paul III to establish the " Sacra Congregatio Romanae et universalis Inquisitionis seu sancti officii " by the Constitution " Licet ab initio " of 21 July , 1542 .
This inquisitional tribunal , composed of six cardinals , was to be at once the final court of appeal for trials concerning faith , and the court of first instance for cases reserved to the pope .
The succeeding popes  especially Pius IV ( by the Constitutions " Pastoralis Oficii " of 14 October , 1562 , " Romanus Pontifex " of 7 April , 1563 , " Cum nos per " of 1564 , " Cum inter crimina " of 27 August , 1562 ) and Pius V ( by a Decree of 1566 , the Constitution " Inter multiplices " of 21 December , 1566 , and " Cum felicis record . " of 1566 )  made further provision for the procedure and competency of this court .
By his Constitution " Immensa aeterni " of 23 January , 1587 , Sixtus V became the real organizer , or rather reorganizer of this congregation .
The Holy Office is first among the Roman congregations .
Its personnel includes judges , officials , consultors , and qualificators .
The real judges are cardinals nominated by the pope , whose original number of six was raised by Pius IV to eight and by Sixtus V to thirteen .
Their actual number depends on the reigning pope ( Benedict XIV , Constitution " Sollicita et Provida " , 1733 ) .
This congregation differs from the others , inasmuch as it has no cardinal - prefect : the pope always presides in person when momentous decisions are to be announced ( coram Sanctissimo ) .
The solemn plenary session on Thursdays is always preceded by a session of the cardinals on Wednesdays , at the church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva , and a meeting of the consultors on Mondays at the palace of the Holy Office .
The highest official is the commissarius sancti oficii , a Dominican of the Lombard province , to whom two coadjutors are given from the same order .
He acts as the proper judge throughout the whole case until the plenary session exclusive , thus conducting it up to the verdict .
The assessor sancti officii , always one of the secular clergy , presides at the plenary sessions .
The promotor fiscalis is at once prosecutor and fiscal representative , while the advocatus reorum undertakes the defence of the accused .
The duty of the consultors is to afford the cardinals expert advice .
They may come from the secular clergy or the religious orders , but the General of the Dominicans , the magister sacri palatii , and a third member of the same order are always ex-officio consultors ( consultores nati ) .
The qualificators are appointed for life , but give their opinions only when called upon .
The Holy Office has jurisdiction over all Christians and , according to Pius IV , even over cardinals .
In practice , however , the latter are held exempt .
For its authority , see the aforesaid Constitution of Sixtus V " Immensa aeterni " ( see ROMAN CONGREGATIONS ) .
Magic Hat Odd Notion – Summer ’09
Magic Hat Brewing Company - South Burlington , VT
Info : “ Golden in color and light in body , this low - hop bitterness ale is refreshing to drink and finishes with a subtle spicy complexity from a very unique Belgian yeast strain and Belgian candy sugar . ”
I received a message from a commenter not too long ago as a retort for my reviews that often decry the inherent bitterness of IPA .
Basically , what it boiled down to is that , “ any decent beer reviewer who is not a fan of IPA ’s is not a beer reviewer at all . ”
Look , I see the point since the basic underlying theme of truly enjoying an IPA is to truly appreciate the nuances and frequently brutal bitterness of everything a beer aspires to be .
I call bullshit .
Case in point : my brother is a registered wine sommelier and there are certainly wine types and flavors that he ’s none too fond of , as are , I ’m sure , many of his ilk .
I love beer , end of story .
The simple fact that I occasionally do n’t love a hefty hoppy and bitter beer is in no way a reflection on the job I have .
Why even bring this up ?
You ’ll see .
One of a beer lovers greatest pleasures is the mighty 12 - beer sample pack .
There is no better way , shy of actually visiting breweries , to get a full supply and idea of some of that company ’s finest samplings .
So , I snatched up the Magic Hat Summer Sample pack for a paltry $ 12.99 ( plus that pesky Michigan deposit I so loathe ) and sat down with my buddy to test this sucker out .
The very first beer I grabbed for no other reason than the bottle looked pretty ( also because I ’ve had Odd Notions from years past ) was the very one I review for you now .
And just to spoil the ending before I begin the actual verbal slaughter for those who have a less than track - worthy train of thought :
It ’s not so good .
Now here ’s where I tie this in with my opening diatribe .
This is so far the opposite end of the spectrum from a bitter IPA that it ’s almost sickening .
You ’d think I ’d really enjoy that .
Well , you ’d be wrong .
Oh , sure , the masking color and pour are just stunning : crisp yellow - orange with a nice bit of lacing .
But right off the bat like a knuckle sandwich is the incredible and irksome odor .
No , this does not get the honor of being described as a ‘ nose ’ , this mess is an odor fully completely .
The beer smells like a demonic amalgam of gone - off grapefruits and far - too - hard apple cider .
Basically , it smells like fruity garbage .
And no , I do n’t think the batch is bad nor even just one of the three samples of this flavor : they all smelled exactly the same .
Taste ?
Oh yeah , I guess you want that , too .
Philistines .
Unfortunately , it tastes precisely as it smells .
But there ’s more .
Somehow , the spice mix and yeast additives coupled with whatever Belgian Candy Sugar is makes this beer taste like a drunk ’s Christmas morning .
It ’s like a batch of Bad Santa .
It ’s Rudolph piss .
Get the picture ?
Now I ’m not one to pour out a beer regardless of it ’s funk .
I mean despite my utter distaste for this selection it would have had to have a spider actively swimming in it for me to dump it , so , ergo , I finished it .
Much to my chagrin .
I have n’t been this forlorn over a beer from a superb company in a long time .
It makes me sad .
Sorry Magic
Hat , not a fan .
Rating : * 1/2
Though still potentially drinkable , it is a hard beer to get through .
High hopes fall flat .
Sad , really .

Every secondary school in England and Wales will receive a free DVD by renowned atheist Richard Dawkins to celebrate the anniversary of Darwin 's Origin of the Species .
The speech was originally delivered as part of the professor 's 1991 Royal Institution Christmas Lectures for children , and is being distributed by the British Humanist Association with funding from the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science .
" Increasing young people 's understanding of science has never been more important , " Professor Dawkins said .
" The lectures explore a number of themes and tasks young people to think critically about the world around them and to explore the awe and wonder that the magnificence and complexity of the natural world , which has evolved over billions of years , can arouse . "
Andrew Copson , BHA director of education , said : " We know that some teachers already use these lectures as end - of - term videos , and are confident that their versatility and breadth of topics covered will allow teachers across many subject areas to make the best use of this important resource in their own ways . "
Prof Dawkins is a divisive figure in the debate over religion , especially after the runaway success of his bestselling book ' The God Delusion ' , which is credited by some as having revived a lagging atheist movement in the UK and America .
This year is the 200th anniversary of Charles Dawin 's birth and the 150th anniversary of the publication of his seminal text ' On the Origin of Species ' .
Say hello to me little friend !
Oh Robespierre !

But they have to give props to Friendster , the social network that paved the way and contributed many of the key concepts behind online connections .
Before the founders of a little - known social network called ConnectU cried foul about Facebook stealing its ideas , MySpace was replicating then - top network Friendster , according to Friendster founder Jonathan Abrams .
" I do n't think there 's anyone who has had their stuff copied more than me , " Abrams said over lunch in San Francisco recently .
In a previous post on our interview with Abrams , he credits himself with the creation of the friend request system , a vital piece of the online social networking puzzle .
But he soon learned that being first does n't necessarily mean you 'll come out on top .
Work on Friendster began in 2002 .
The site launched in March 2003 and by autumn , it had more than 2 million users requesting and accepting friendships and filling out personal profiles .
The company was experiencing extraordinarily fast growth and was having trouble keeping up , Abrams said .
To fund the ballooning beast , Abrams sought funding from venture capitalists and secured enough to keep the ship afloat -- for a while .
Within a few months of a successful fundraiser , Abrams was ousted as chief executive .
He did n't say whether the heave - ho had anything to do with the $ 30 - million buyout offer he turned down from Google .
But over the next two years , Friendster had four different people at its helm and a host of problems inside and out .
" I actually stuck around through 2004 and 2005 , trying to help Friendster , " Abrams said .
The problems were beyond his control .
Coping with the torrent of growth in 2004 , Friendster replaced the shaky computer systems that had been running the site with " worse technology , " Abrams said .
Meanwhile , Chris DeWolfe and Tom Anderson , founders of MySpace , had built a competing product that ...
PARIS , Texas ( AP ) 
A teenager who has profound mental disabilities was sentenced to 100 years in prison after pleading guilty to charges in a sex abuse case involving his 6 - year - old neighbor .
Aaron Hart , 18 , of Paris , was arrested and charged after a neighbor found him fondling her stepson in September .
The teen pleaded guilty to five counts , including aggravated sexual assault and indecency by contact , and a jury decided his punishment .
Lamar County Judge Eric Clifford decided to stack the sentences against Hart after jurors settled on two five - year terms and three 30 - year terms , The Dallas Morning News reported Wednesday .
The judge said neither he nor jurors liked the idea of prison for Hart but they felt there was no other option .
" In the state of Texas , there is n't a whole lot you can do with somebody like him , " Clifford said .
Hart has an IQ of 47 and was diagnosed as mentally disabled as a child .
He never learned to read or write and speaks unsteadily .
Despite being a target of bullies , he was courteous , well - behaved and earned money by doing chores for neighbors , supporters said .
His parents say he'd never acted out sexually .
" He could n't understand the seriousness of what he did , " said his father , Robert Hart .
" I never dreamed they would think about sending him to prison .
When they said 100 years — it was terror , pure terror , to me . "
Jurors said they sent the judge notes during deliberations in February , asking about alternatives to prison , but did n't get a clear answer .
They believed the judge would order concurrent sentences , jurors said .
District Attorney Gary Young said he sympathized with Hart 's situation but stands by his decision to prosecute on five counts .
Prosecutors commonly pursue several charges for a single incident to see which the jury will support .
Young said a diversion program was not an option since the law does n't allow that for serious felonies .
" I hope people will remember he committed a violent sexual crime against a little boy , " he said .
Hart 's appellate attorney , David Pearson , said the court - appointed doctor did the bare minimum to assess competency and ran tests geared for mental illness , not mental retardation .
He said an appeal will be filed .

Before we get started , those who have never played Monkey Island should probably just skip to the score at the end , dash over to Xbox Live Arcade and hit the download button .
Unless you 're a joypad - mangling mouthbreather , incapable of seeing past the next big shiny shooty game , you 'll discover something that comes awfully close to being the perfect adventure game .
For those uninitiated , Monkey Island introduces us to Guybrush Threepwood , an ambitious young fellow newly arrived on Melee Island to seek his fortune as a pirate .
First released back in 1990 , he points and clicks his way through a series of puzzles , learning the art of insult sword - fighting and discovering the supernatural properties of root beer .
Along the way he falls for Elaine , the island 's feisty governor , and falls foul of the ghost pirate LeChuck , who has plans of his own for the lovely lass .
If any of this sounds familiar then , yes , the Pirates of the Caribbean movies did borrow rather liberally - and rather cheekily - from this game in order to transform a Disney theme park ride into a rousing blockbuster success .
To say any more of the plot would surely spoil a wonderful experience best enjoyed fresh , so everyone who has yet to make Guybrush 's acquaintance should do as they 're told and go and play the bloody thing already .
Go on .
We 'll still be here when you get back .
For those who already harbour fond memories of this beloved LucasArts adventure , more troublesome questions remain .
First and foremost , have they mucked it up ?
The words " special edition " have taken on a less than enticing air when applied to projects connected with George Lucas , and the prospect of Star Wars - style tampering must surely cause concern to long - serving fans .
Thankfully , this makeover is purely technical in nature .
The whole game has been redrawn and reanimated in HD , and the soundtrack re-recorded with real actors and musicians , but the game itself remains mercifully untouched .
It 's the same script , the same puzzles , the same brilliant gags .
Even Mr Lucas ' fish - munching cameo remains unaltered .
Before ...
Personally , I found the visual makeover a little hard to accept at first .
The original game is so deeply ingrained in my mind that the change took some time to feel right , a bit like seeing a colourised version of a classic black - and - white film .
It does n't help that they 've redesigned Guybrush to fit in better with the cartoony makeover the series received after the somewhat controversial third entry , the first to be produced with no input from creator Ron Gilbert .
The shift from scrappy young hero to gangly blond fop still feels awkward , although almost every other character and location benefits from the fresh lick of paint .
Some puzzle sequences - such as the cave search with the navigator 's head - work much better with the crisp new definition , while many jokes are much funnier when spoken aloud .
Purists like me will almost certainly find something to grumble about over the span of the game , but the overall impact of the redesign is undeniably for the better .
And after ...
For those unable to let the past go , a prod of the back button switches instantaneously between the new version and the original , a feature that is both welcome and technically impressive .
It 's a complex real - time dissolve between a pixellated square play area with static speech captions and an HD widescreen display with full voice acting , but it 's pulled off seamlessly .
In fact , I often found myself switching back and forth between the two just to see how it had been done .
The improvement is most obvious during the static dialogue scenes , where the rather corny Mills & Boon - style still images of the original are thankfully replaced .
Those chintzy pictures never sat right with the game 's irreverent tone , so while still I mourn the loss of the original Guybrush , in all his pugnacious tousle - haired glory , I 'm happy to see him replaced with the chinless blond do - over for these moments at least .
The change in control has been less successful .
The classic mode still uses the old LucasArts on - screen menu of actions and inventory items , but the special edition version uses a rather less intuitive combination of pop - up radial menus .
The A and B buttons act as left and right mouse - clicks , making movement and basic interaction simple enough , but the d-pad doubles as a quick select for actions and its problematic diagonals means that finding essential commands such as " Use " becomes a bit of a fiddle .
Chaining a sequence of actions together with inventory items is just clumsy enough to be annoying , especially when faced with a timed challenge such as the melting grog mugs , and I actually found myself switching back to the 1990 point - and - click menu for these moments .
Sometimes the old ways really are the best .

In a case of life imitating a video game , Citroën has confirmed that it will build an extremely low - volume production version of the GT originally created for the PlayStation 3 racing sim Gran Turismo 5 .
Revealed as a concept car at last year 's Paris Auto Show , the GT was penned by PSA Peugeot - Citroën designer Takumi Yamamoto in a tie in with the virtual car available to players of GT5 .
Now , AutoCar and other sources have confirmed that six – count 'em , six – examples of the carbon - fiber bodied beauty will be built and sold for about $ 2 million .
Already , a video ( below ) of the GT concept driving through the streets of London shows it gets more attention than a Sonia Sotomayor speech .
No word yet on the drivetrain – that 'll be announced officially when the production version is revealed at this September 's Frankfurt Motor Show – but AutoCarcites Citroën Products and Markets head Vincent Besson saying a General Motors of Ford V - 8 might make it under the hood .
Whatever winds up in the engine bay , it will be mated to a paddle - shifted manual .
We were hoping for a production version of the diesel - hybrid first shown in the Hypnos concept , or at least an Italian - sourced powerplant in the vein of the legendary SM , but anything will do in a car that looks so good .
According to The New York Times , the GT will be sold worldwide , making it the first Citroën available stateside since the last grey market XMs hit U.S. shores in 1994 .
We bet one will end up in Dubai , and another will end up on wreckedexotics.com .

" Azok közé tartozol , akik nem akarnak semmi különöset , de amellett szívesen kiállnának ? "
Részlet a szervezők felhívásából
„ Mit akarunk ?
Semmit ! Mikor ?
Soha ! ” A Központi Statisztikai Hivatal ( KSH ) előtt gyülekező tüntetők hosszú percek óta skandálják követeléseiket , amelyek azonban nem találnak meghallgatásra .
A hivatalból senki nem merészkedik elő , hogy átvegye a petíciót , és kísérletet tegyen a párbeszédre .
Pedig követelésből van elég .
„ Holnap legyen tegnap ! ” „ Oszlassanak fel ! ” „ Nagyszínpad ! ” „ Gyök alatt van itt mindenki , tessék már négyzetre emelni ! ”
Kattintson ide , és nézze meg , miért érdemes tüntetni !
A további transzparensekből a tüntetők holisztikus eszmerendszerére következtethettek volna a KSH érdeklődő illetékesei : „ Éljen a giccs ” , „ Ebédelni mentem ” , továbbá „ Fej , tor , potroh ! ”
Ez utóbbit egyébként hosszasan kántálja is a 2-300 fős tömeg , amíg meg nem jelenik a lépcsőkön a főszervező , Kovács Gergely , aki egyébként az ország egyetlen izgalmas köztéri és közéleti hekkercsapatának , a Kétfarkú Kutyapártnak a vezetője és egyetlen tagja .
A pártvezető hangosbeszélőn bejelentette : „ Követeljük , hogy haladéktalanul , úgy egyetemesen , mint egyébként , külön eseti megvizsgálás nélkül , mindenkire egyenlő arányban , a képességeihez mérten , politikai hovatartozás nélkül , vallás és ruhamárkára tekintet nélkül , különálló csoportokban , betartva a vonatkozó uniós ajánlásokat , és szabálymódosításokat idegenbe szakadt honfitársainkkal karöltve , minél előbb ! ”
A tömeget láthatóan nem lombozza le , hogy nem indul meg a kulturált és demokratikus alapokon nyugvó diskurzus a hivatallal .
Ami tulajdonképpen a lényege is az Általános Tüntetésként meghirdetett szombat esti demonstrációnak .
Ha most itt ülne mellettem Dessewffy Tibor , nyilván a politikából és közéletből kiábrándult fiatalokról , az eszmék korrodálódásáról , és a valódi érdekképviselet hiányáról mondana nekem szomorú dolgokat .
Amellyel egyrészt zavarna a munkában , másrészt viszont nem lenne igaza annyiban , hogy a tüntetésen pont a szomorúságnak nem volt semmi nyoma .
Sőt , ennyi röhögést egy tömegben legfeljebb a High Times éves termékminta - bemutatóján lehet tapasztalni .
Az Általános Tüntetés , amely nem folyik semmiért , nem akar semmit elérni , és amelyen csak konkrét követeléseket nem tartalmazó transzparenssel lehet részt venni , láthatóan felszabadítóan hat az emberekre .
Az átlagéletkor ugyan 25 körül mozog , de az elszórtan álló idős hippik , entellektüellek és senior technósok is ugyanolyan kajánul vigyorognak , mint a másodéves egyetemisták .
Itt tekintheti meg az összes követelést nagy méretben !
Csak hogy érezhető legyen , mennyi kraft van a dadaizmus és nihilizmus közt egyensúlyozó demonstrációban , megemlítem , hogy a meglepően nagy tömeg a zuhogó esőben is hajlandó egy órán keresztül vonulászni a Mechwart liget környékén , csak azért , hogy hülye táblákat lengethessen .
„ Nem voltam még soha tüntetésen ” – meséli közben a „ Döntsenek helyettem ” feliratot tartó , csurom vizes srác .
Felsorolja , hogy melyik párt rendezvényére nem menne el , de mire a végére ér , nem maradt egyetlen politikai erő sem .
A Critical Mass szervezésében vett részt , jut az eszébe , meg ha lenne tüntetés az Indexért , azon is megjelenne .
Megkérdezem a „ There is no spoon ! ” követeléssel érkezett lányt is , aki bevallja , eddig még eszébe sem jutott , hogy bármilyen tüntetésére elmenjen .
Meglepő módon a mostani esemény tapasztalataiból azt a következtetést szűrte le , hogy a dolog mégis érdekes , és legközelebb majd kipróbál egyéb demonstrációkat is .
Nem akarom kiábrándítani , úgyhogy barátságosan bólogatva lemaradok .

Végül egy tudatosabbnak tűnő felvonulóhoz fordulok , aki azonban nem hajlandó megszólalni , viszont minden kérdésemre felmutatja a kört , háromszöget és négyzetet hirdető tábláját .
Nem értem , miként is értelmezzem a geometriai alakzatokat az aktuálpolitika tükrében , csak annyit veszek észre , hogy könnyed hangulatba kerültem , pedig éppen elindult a hideg esőlé a gerincem mentén .
De politieke geschiedenis van de vrouw in België Volgens de actiegroep Alice moet de volgende Vlaamse regering vijf vrouwen tellen .
Na de evenredige vertegenwoordiging op de kieslijsten een nieuwe stap in de gelijkwaardige behandeling van vrouwen in de politiek .
Nochtans komt men van ver .
Jong België : liberaal maar niet democratisch
Toen in 1830 de Belgische onafhankelijkheid werd geproclameerd beschikte België over een van de meest liberale grondwetten in Europa .
Toch bleek ze niet democratisch .
Immers , slechts 46.000 mannen die een bepaalde som aan rechstreekse belastingen betaalden konden gaan stemmen op basis van het cijnskiesrecht .
Vrouwen waren helemaal uitgesloten niettegenstaande ook zij hadden deelgenomen aan de opstand voor de afscheuring van Nederland .
Het feminisme wordt geboren
In 1848 schreef Lucien Gottrand een boek waarin hij pleitte voor algemeen enkelvoudig stemrecht voor mannen én vrouwen .
Hij was ( voorlopig ) een roeper in de woestijn .
Het feminisme kreeg een eerste opstoot door Marie Popelin .
Zij was in 1888 als juriste afgestudeerd maar werd niet tot de advocatuur toegelaten .
Het was een kaakslag voor de vrouwen .
In 1892 werd daarom de Ligue Belgue du Droit des Femmes ( Belgische Liga voor de rechten van de Vrouw ) opgericht .
Het stemrecht voor de vrouw was echter niet de eerste prioriteit voor de Liga , maar ze streefde eerder de economische en juridische gelijkheid na .
Meervoudig stemrecht
In 1893 werd het algemeen meervoudig stemrecht voor de man toegekend .
Mannen konden zodoende soms meer dan één stem uitbrengen als ze cijns betaalden of een hoge positie bekleedden .
De opkomstplicht werd ingesteld en men kon kiezen vanaf 25 jaar .
Algemeen enkelvoudig stemrecht voor mannen
De roep om stemrecht voor vrouwen werd aanvankelijk door de Werkliedenpartij gesteund .
Gezien de katholieke dominantie in Vlaanderen begon men echter bang te worden dat de vrouw overwegend katholiek zou gaan stemmen zodat zowel socialisten als liberalen de eis niet meer ondersteunden , maar de katholieken dan weer wel .
In 1919 werd het algemeen enkelvoudig stemrecht voor mannen een feit .
Vrouwen konden enkel stemmen voor de gemeenteraad , maar konden zich wel verkiesbaar stellen op alle niveaus .
In het Interbellum bleef het aantal verkozen vrouwen zeer laag , op en al 1 % .
In 1921 werd Marie Spaak - Janson , de eerste vrouwelijke senator , gecoöpteerd , maar de eerste rechtstreeks verkozen vrouw , Lucie Dejardin , kwam er pas in 1929 .
Algemeen enkelvoudig stemrecht voor vrouwen
Op 27 maart 1948 werd de vrouwen dan toch eindelijk stemrecht toegekend , maar dat leidde niet direct tot een aanzienlijke verhoging van het aantal vrouwelijke verkozenen .
Tot het begin van de jaren zeventig bleef dat aantal rond de 3 % schommelen omdat vrouwen nog steeds niet voor vrouwen kozen en gewoonlijk het stemgedrag van hun man volgden .
Vanaf 1970 werden de vrouwen door de vrouwenbeweging opgeroepen om op vrouwen te stemmen .
In Brugge ging de vrouwelijke vertegenwoordiging in de gemeenteraad spectaculair de hoogte : de twee verkozenen werden er nu zeven .
Maar op landelijk vlak beperkte de opgang zich tot 6,6 % .
Quota op de kieslijsten
In de jaren negentig kwam er schok in de zaak .
De wet Smet - Tobback in 1994 legde de verplichting op dat minimum 33 % van de kandidaten op de kieslijsten van het vrouwelijk geslacht moesten zijn .
Door toedoen van Laurette Onckelinckx werd dat percentage in 2002 tot 50 % opgetrokken .
Mannen en vrouwen moesten alternerend op de kieslijsten verschijnen .
De ministers Pas in 1965 was de eerste vrouwelijke minister tot de regering toegetreden .
Mevrouw Marguerite De Riemaecker - Legot werd minister van Gezin en Huisvesting .
Het aantal vrouwelijke ministers in Belgische regering is sindsdien altijd eerder beperkt gebleven .
Vandaar de eis van Alice om ook op dat vlak een verhoging van het aantal vrouwen te eisen .
België niet in het koppeloton
Met de toekenning van het stemrecht aan vrouwen in 1948 was België alvast niet bij de eerste .
Finland kende het stemrecht reeds toe in 1906 , Denemarken volgde een kleine tien jaar later ( 1915 ) .
Na de Eerste Wereldoorlog volgden Nederland , Duitsland , Luxemburg , Zwitserland en Oostenrijk .
Pas in 1944 was Frankrijk aan de beurt .
Vier jaar later België , in 1952 Griekenland en Portugal sloot de rij in 1974 .

Advertisement Foreign legionnaires in the French army have been strongly criticised for starting a forest fire which spread to the outskirts of Marseille .
Seven firemen and police were hurt , and hundreds of people fled their homes .
French Prime Minister Francois Fillon , viewing the devastation , said clear instructions had not been followed and the mistake was " inexcusable " .
The officer in charge when soldiers fired tracer bullets during a training exercise has been suspended .
The firing of the bullets went against regulations .
Personally , I can't see the need to carry out military exercises in 32 - degree heat and a strong wind
Marseille Mayor Jean - Claude Gaudin
It was the second time in two years that the military had started a wildfire .
Mr Fillon said : " Everyone knows among the soldiers who use the camp that tracer bullets are banned .
" There are very clear instructions and regular work is done with the ranks to remind them of the rules .
It is a mistake that no explanation can excuse . "
Defence Minister Herve Morin added : " On this occasion we have got an NCO who ... has not obeyed instructions .
This is all appalling . "
' Incredible stupidity '
The blaze threatened some 400 homes and elderly residents had to be evacuated .
The fire reached the outskirts of Marseille Inhabitants of a retirement home in La Panouse , south of Marseille , had to be carried away in their pyjamas in the early hours of the morning .
A nearby centre for the disabled was also cleared as the fire approached .
By Thursday morning , rescue workers said it had been brought under control , although some 500 firefighters remained at the scene .
Marseille 's mayor and senator , Jean - Claude Gaudin , demanded that the military help out with the clean - up operation .
" Personally , I can't see the need to carry out military exercises in 32 - degree heat and a strong wind .
It must really have been someone who is not from around here who took this decision , " he said .
" We did the best we can but when you 're faced with this kind of incredible stupidity , you need to say so with a certain force . "
Strong winds and high temperatures have helped trigger fires across the region .
In Spain , the high - speed rail link between Madrid and Barcelona was suspended because of blazes in the north - east of the country .
Four firefighters were killed in Tarragona province on Wednesday , and another on Thursday , while more than 1,000 people were evacuated from their homes .

This is what happens when you build an extremely powerful vortex cannon , loaded with " one of the most dangerous gas mixes in the world , " to fire it against houses made of straw , sticks , and bricks , like the big bad wolf .

Looking at the video — filmed at 1300 frames per second — it seems like the big bad wolf would have had a chance against the three little pigs , and eat the suckers roasted in a wood brick oven , with just salt and a bit of water .
If the third pig did n't use cement , that is .
Otherwise , the 200 mph cloud — which is formed by the pressure inside the air vortex condensing the water above the lake — seems powerful enough to knock down a man .
Certainly more powerful than the candle cannon .

This past Friday it surfaced that Facebook started including user profile photos in ads run with in the Facebook network .
It ’s widely known that if a product or service is vouched for by a close friend the liklihood that you ’ll investigate and buy the product or use the service increases .
The marketing and advertising folks at Facebook know their stuff and they ’re taking full advantage of their terms of use to increase click through rates on ads and monetize their community .
What does this mean to you ?
It means if you do n’t dig into the privacy settings and opt out of having your profile photo or perhaps other photos of yours used in ads , you could end up with your photo (s ) next to an online dating service ad or perhaps something as awkward as a Viagra ad .
While many wondered why all the fuss about the photo unfriendly Facebook Terms of Use I hope you now understand .
Facebook is an advertising engine looking to exploit trust between you and your network to maximize profits .
The fact that they force you to opt - out versus opt - in to this type of system shows their true intentions contradicting past statements .
As before if you use Facebook be aware and be diligent in checking to see what they ’re up to and how they ’re using your creative content .

The advert marked the West Bank and Gaza with only a faint line
Enlarge Image
Israel 's tourist ministry has admitted to a " mistake " over adverts on the London Underground after complaints that they " wipe Palestine off the map " .
The ads include a map which campaigners say shows the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip - as well as Syria 's Golan Heights - as integral parts of Israel .
The ministry said that in general , maps should not be used on billboards .
But it denied a Transport for London statement that it had asked for the offending posters to be removed .
Transport for London said it has received about 600 complaints about the poster , while the Advertising Standards Authority said it had had 300 .
Hugh Lanning of the London - based Palestine Solidarity Campaign said the adverts were a " disingenuous attempt to remove the Palestinians from the public mind , and create a false impression about what constitutes Israel " .
The posters were " selling a lie " by suggesting tourists could visit Gaza when the Hamas - run strip is subject to a strict Israeli blockade under which even some doctors and humanitarian workers have been denied entry , PSC said .
The map shows Israel , the West Bank , Gaza Strip and the Golan Heights in the same striking yellow colour ; the faintest of white lines mark out the Palestinian territories - though not the Syrian one which Israel annexed in 1981 .
Insufficient vetting Israel occupied the three Arab territories , including East Jerusalem , during the 1967 war .
It has since cemented its hold by settling hundreds of thousands of its citizens there .
Oren Drori , Head of Marketing Administration for the Israeli Ministry of Tourism , described the adverts as a " professional mistake " with no geopolitical intentions .
He said he did not think maps should be used on billboards to advertise tourism in any country and the adverts had not been sufficiently vetted .
" We are not tearing anything down , " he said .
But the ministry had decided to " fast - forward " to the next set of posters scheduled in the campaign , after learning that there was " a bit of a harsh response " to the map advert , he said .
No more map adverts would be posted , he said , and existing ones would be removed as they reached the end of their scheduled display times over the next two weeks , he said .
The Syrian Embassy in London , which had lodged its own protest , described the advert as " offensive " .
US President Barack Obama is trying to kick - start talks to reach an negotiated agreement creating a state of Palestine in the West Bank and Gaza , although Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not signed up to the idea .
The fate of the Golan Heights is key to any peace negotiations between Israel and Syria .

This is a re-post ( with permission ) of a post that Greg Maxwell wrote in response to a comment by Chris DiBona from Google on a whatwg mailing list .
The codecs being discussed are the same ones we ’ll be including in Firefox 3.5 and are also the same codecs that Mozilla , Wikipedia and others have been investing in .
Recent developer nightlies of Google Chrome support these codecs and a future version of Opera will also support them .
Theora and Vorbis also work in Safari if you install the Xiph Qt component .
We ’re quickly reaching the point where all modern browsers support these open codecs with full support for the video tag .
You ’ll note that Greg ’s post does n’t have the tone of a marketing document – it ’s not meant to .
Nor is this a comparison against HD - sized , high - bitrate video .
Instead it ’s an attempt to give an honest comparison of how the open codecs fare against commonly - used formats and sizes used on the world ’s largest video site .
I think you ’ll agree with Greg ’s conclusions at the bottom of the document , especially with audio where Vorbis really shines .
Greg ’s post follows .
Purpose
On Jun 13th 2009 Chris DiBona of Google made a remarkable claim on the WhatWG mailing list :
“ If [ youtube ] were to switch to theora and maintain even a semblance of the current youtube quality it would take up most available bandwidth across the Internet . ”
Unfortunately , open video formats have been subjected to FUD so frequently that people are willing to believe bold claims like these without demanding substantiation .
In this comparison I will demonstrate that this claim was unfair and unreasonable .
Using a simple test case I show that Theora is competitive and even superior to some of the files that Google is distributing today on YouTube .
Theora is n’t the most efficient video codec available right now .
But it is by no means bad , and it is substantially better than many other widely used options .
By conventional criteria Theora is competitive .
It also has the substantial advantage of being unencumbered , reasonable in computational complexity , and entirely open source .
People are often confused by the correct observation that Theora does n’t provide the state of the art in bitrate vs quality , and take that to mean that Theora does poorly when in reality it does quite well .
Also , the Theora encoder has improved a lot lately so some older problems no longer apply .
While different files may produce different results , the allegation made on WhatWG was so expansive that I believe a simple comparison can reliably demonstrate its falsehood .
I do not believe Chris intended to deceive anyone , only that he is a victim of the same outdated and / or simply inaccurate information that has fooled many others .
Automotive enthusiasts may make a big deal about a 5 horsepower difference between two cars , but these kinds of raw performance differences are not relevant to most car buyers nor are they even the most important criteria to people who race .
Likewise , videophiles nitpick the quality of compression formats and this nitpicking is important for the advancement of the art .
But I believe that people are mistaking these kinds of small differences for something which is relevant to their own codec selection .
Results
A 499 kbit/sec H.264+AAC
output and a 327 kbit / sec H.263 ( Sorensen Spark ) +MP3 output were available via the download service .
The YouTube - encoded files are available on the YouTube site .
Because the files on YouTube may change and the web player does not disclose the underlying bitrate , I have made the two encoded files available .
~499kbit/sec comparison
YouTube
Download ( H.264+AAC ; 17MiB )
Ogg / Theora + Vorbis

~327kbit/sec comparison
YouTube
Download ( H.263+MP3 ; 12MiB )
Ogg / Theora + Vorbis
Download / Watch ( Ogg / Theora + Vorbis ; 12MiB )
A slightly lower bitrate was used for the Theora + Vorbis test cases to avoid any question of quality improvement resulting from larger outputs .
For a fair comparison you must compare the audio as well .
Even without audio differences , still image comparisons are a poor proxy for video quality .
I provided this random frame still image comparison only because I expect that people will not bother watching the examples without evidence that the results are interesting .
Methodology
In order to avoid any possible bias in the selection of H.264 encoders and encoding options , and to maximize the relevance for this particular issue , I ’ve used YouTube itself as the H.264 encoder .
This is less than ideal because YouTube does not accept lossless input , but it does accept arbitrarily high bitrate inputs .
I utilized the Blender Foundation ’s Big Buck Bunny as my test case because of its clear licensing status , because it ’s a real world test case , and because I have it available in a lossless format .
I am not aware of any reason why this particular clip would favor either Theora or H.264 .
I chose to use a test case with a soundtrack because most real usage has sound .
No one implements HTML5 video without audio , and no one is implementing either of Theora or Vorbis without the other .
Vorbis ’s state - of - the - art performance is a contributor to the overall Ogg / Theora + Vorbis solution .
Obtain the lossless 640×360 Big Buck Bunny source PNGs and FLACs from media.xiph.org .
Resample the images to 480×270 using ImageMagick ’s convert utility .
Use gstreamer ’s jpegenc , produce a quality =100 mjpeg + PCM audio stream .
The result is around 1.5 Gbytes with a bitrate of around 20 M bit / sec .
Truncate the file to fit under the YouTube 1 G byte limit , resulting in input_mjpeg.avi ( 706MiB ) .
Upload the file to YouTube and wait for it to transcode .
Download the FLV and H.264 files produced by YouTube using one of the many web downloading services .
( I used keepvid )
Using libtheora 1.1a2 and Vorbis aoTuv 5.7 produce a file of comparable bitrate to the youtube 499 k bit / sec from the same file uploaded to YouTube ( input_mjpeg.avi ) .
Resample the file uploaded to YouTube to 400×226 .
Using libtheora 1.1a2 and Vorbis aoTuv 5.7 produce a file of comparable bitrate to the youtube 327 k bit / sec from the 400×226 downsampled copy of input_mjpeg.avi .
I later discovered that YouTube sometimes offers additional sizes .
I tried the youtube - dl utility and it indicated that these other sizes were not available for my file .
Otherwise I would have also included them in this comparison .
A keyframe interval of 250 frames was used for the Theora encoding .
The theora 1.1a2 encoder software used is available from theora.org .
The Vorbis encoder used is available from the aoTuV website .
No software modifications were performed .
My conclusions
It can be difficult to compare video at low bitrates , and even YouTube ’s higher bitrate option is not high enough to achieve good quality .
The primary challenge is that all files at these rates will have problems , so the reviewer is often forced to decide which of two entirely distinct flaws is worse .
Sometimes people come to different conclusions .
That said , I believe that the Theora + Vorbis results are substantially better than the YouTube 327 k bit / sec .
Several other people have expressed the same view to me , and I expect you ’ll also reach the same conclusion .
This is unsurprising since we ’ve been telling people that Theora is better than H.263 , especially at lower bitrates , for some time now and YouTube only uses a subset of H.263 .
The low bitrate case is also helped by Vorbis ’ considerable superiority over MP3 .
For example , the crickets at the beginning are inaudible in the low rate YouTube clip but sound fine in the Ogg / Theora + Vorbis version .
In the case of the 499 kbit / sec H.264 I believe that under careful comparison many people would prefer the H.264 video .
However , the difference is not especially great .
I expect that most casual users would be unlikely to express a preference or complain about quality if one was substituted for another and I ’ve had several people perform a casual comparison of the files and express indifference .
Since Theora + Vorbis is providing such comparable results , I think I can confidently state that reports of the internet ’s impending demise are greatly exaggerated .
Of course , YouTube may be using an inferior processing chain , or encoding options which trade off quality for some other desirable characteristic ( like better seeking granularity , encoding speed , or a specific rate control pattern ) .
But even if they are , we can conclude that adopting an an open unencumbered format in addition to or instead of their current offerings would not cause problems on the basis of quality or bitrate .
But please — see and hear for yourself .

Reasons Manchester
United might not have it all their own way in Estadio do Dragao tonight
1 ) Porto are unbeaten in 24 matches since 2 November .
2 ) Manchester United have not won in three previous visits to Porto , who have never lost at home against English opposition .
3 ) Porto have won all bar one of the eight ties in Uefa club competition where they have drawn the first leg away from home .
4 ) United have lost their last four knockout ties in the Champions League when they have played the second leg away from home .
Then again ...
1 ) Porto is a foreign club , ergo a flakey one , unlike Manchester United , an English club built on the good honest , sweaty graft of proud northern Englishmen ... and imported Irish labourers , who are also foreign , but not in the same way as Portuguese , Spanish , French and other properly " foreign " folk .
Team news we 've attached a rope to and dragged kicking and screaming from the wires Sir Alex Ferguson recalls former Porto star Anderson to try to steer Manchester United through to the Champions League semi-finals at the expense of his old club tonight .
The Brazilian had missed three games since picking up a knee injury on international duty with Brazil , but Ferguson had no hesitation in including him in a side captained by Ryan Giggs , which has Rio Ferdinand back in central defence alongside Nemanja Vidic .
Mariano's last - minute equaliser at Old Trafford to earn a 2 - 2 draw eight days ago ensures Porto start tonight 's second leg as favourites to progress .
The Portuguese champions are unchanged as they tried to subdue an attack spearheaded by Dimitar Berbatov , with Cristiano Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney providing the support .
FC Porto : Helton , Sapunaru , Rolando , Bruno Alves , Cissokho , Lucho Gonzalez , Fernando , Raul Meireles , Lopez , Hulk , Rodriguez .
Subs : Nuno , Stepanov , Guarin , Mariano Gonzalez , Costa , Madrid ,
Farias .
Man Utd : Van der Sar , O'Shea , Ferdinand , Vidic , Evra , Giggs , Carrick , Anderson , Rooney , Berbatov , Ronaldo .
Subs : Foster , Neville , Evans , Nani , Scholes , Tevez , Macheda .
Referee : Massimo Busacca ( Switzerland )
Rob Smyth , who 'll be blogging on this match here at the final whistle is very pleased that Gary Neville is on the bench and reckons that Manchester United will play a 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 , with Rooney on the left , Ronaldop on the right and Giggs in the middle , just behind Berbatov .
Who am I to disagree ?
An email , from Jack Burns : " I really want to see the game tonight but I have neither Sky tv nor friends to go to the pub with , " he writes .
" At whom should I direct my anger ?
Evil Capitalist Fiend Rupert Murdoch ?
Or my mother for my complete inability to form meaningful relationships with anything other than pornography and general social ineptitude ? "
Jack does n't say where he 's writing from , but assuming he gets back in touch to let me know , is there anybody out there who'd be at least provisionally prepared to go to the pub with him , have a few pints and watch the game ?
He writes amusing enough email to suggest that he might be a reasonable drinking companion , if not a prospective Best Man .
Another email , this time from Nathan Smith : " Since when has Dimitar Berbatov spearheaded anything ? " he asks .
" Unless you mean a large , unresponsive spearhead which slows everything down .
It 's like Fatima Whitbread throwing a plunger . "
" How was the AC / DC concert and did you encounter any sleeping children ? " asks Richard Hooker , referring to the pertinent clip from Monday 's Football Weekly .
It was great - one of the best gigs I 've ever attended - and I did n't , Richard , although there were quite a few dads - with - young - sons combos present .
Worryingly , my ears are still ringing .
An email from John Kim , who has a certain amount of sympathy for Jack Burns : " Jack needs to grow a pair and just go to the pub by himself , " he writes .
" Tell Jack he sounds like my kind of guy ( seemingly having roughly the same social issues ) and that if he lives anywhere near Royton , in Oldham , he can come to the pub with I and my lady friend , " adds Kyle Walker - Booth , who is clearly nothing like Jack Burns if he can boast a girlfriend that he does n't need to inflate with a foot - pump .
A 2 - 2 draw is the only result tonight that can take this tie to extra time and keep me in the office for an extra 30 minutes , so get your money on that .
" As the members of AC / DC have aged has the Highway to Hell become shorter ? " asks James Colern .
" Or perhaps they are now driving down the highway for miles on end with their turning signal on going at least 20 mph under the speed limit . "
Click - clack , click - clack , click - clack , click - clack :
The teams emerge from the tunnel into the packed arena and line up for the fancy Champions League music .
Both are attired in their customary home strips .
Predction time - I 'll go for a nervy Porto win - 2 - 1 , 4 - 3 on aggregate .
Pete Jones writes : " I 'll go to the pub with Jack Burns if he lives in Paris , " he says .
" Otherwise I 'm consigned to another evening spent shut in my room while my flatmate sits on the couch giggling and tickling with a new beau on the other side of an impossibly thin wall .
Will Jack buy the beers though ?
I 'm very poor , otherwise I 'd actually go out alone .
Sigh . "
And they 're off .
Manchester United kick off playing from left to right .
Or right to left if you 're looking at it from the other side of the ground .
The ball is immediately hoofed forwards towards Ryan Giggs in the final third , but there 's too much welly on it and Porto clear .
1 min : Anderson picks up the ball in midfield and is harried and hassled into giving it away by Hulk , who 's all over him like a cheap suit .
2 min : " When I was a humble government employee I would have been happy to share pints with Jack Burns and just about everyone else on a Wednesday afternoon , " writes Mark Schlink .
" But alas , I no longer work for ' the man ' and have found that ' a man ' keeps closer track of my hours .
That said , if Jack happens to be in Washington DC , the Lucky Bar is always packed ( with the unemployed / government - employed and surprisingly attractive women ) for the Champions League . "
3 min : Hulk brings the first save of the evening out of Edwin van der Sar with a free - kick from much the same area that Fabio Aurelio scored Liverpool ' ;s opener last night - 35 yards out , right of centre .
Hulk 's effort was n't as good , but Van der Sar had to have his wits about him as the ball bounced on the edge of the six - yard box before finding its way into the Dutchman 's warm embrace .
GOAL ! Porto 0 - 1 Manchester United ( Agg : 2 - 3 ) ( Ronaldo 6 ) A sensational goal from Ronaldo who , out of nothing , rifles a right - footed 40 - yard screamer into the top left - hand side - netting .
Correction : official stats show it was a mere 39.6 yards , with the ball travelling at 64.2 mph .
8 min : It 's all United so far .
They 're a goal up , dominating possession and have their hosts chasing shadows in their own backyard .
That opener has really knocked the stuffing out of Porto - it was unbelievably good .
I do n't think Helton even saw it go in .
11 min : Michael Carrick tries his luck from distance , but his scuffed 30 - yard daisycutter does n't trouble Helton and fizzes well wide of the left upright .
12 min : Rooney wins a throw - in deep in Porto territory , in the right - hand corner .
It 's taken and United play keep - ball , passing from one side of the field to the other , across the edge of the penalty area .
Their patience pays off when Ronaldo wins a free - kick on the left flank , from which comes a throw - in .
Berbatov gets the ball at his feet and is immediately surrounded by a swarm of men in blue and white .
He 's forced further and further back , until eventually the only realistic option open to him is a back - pass to his own goalkeeper .
15 min : " Were The Answer supporting AC / DC last night ? " asks Niall Harden , prompting a " yes " from me .
" They used to play the same shitty venues in Belfast as my rubbish post - rock band .
I found myself next to the singer at a wedding and asked if the band had any good shows coming up .
' Nah , " he replied , before adding ' No wait !
We 're in Sweden next week .
Oh , and then Japan . '
Bah .
If only we 'd abandoned post - rock for Big Rock . "
17 min : " I do n't see how it could have gone any better for United so far .
Porto have not shown anything and United have dominated the possession , " says Andy Gray on Sky , taking the words out of my mouth .
18 min : Cristian Rodriguez does well to rob the ball from Wayne Rooney about 10 yards inside the Manchester United half on the right - hand side , but his pass to Hulk is intercepted by Nemanja Vidic .
19 min : Free - kick for Porto , left of centre about 35 yards out .
Bruno
Alves clips it over the wall and the ball fizzes about three feet wide of Edwin van der Sar 's right stick .
It was n't a bad effort , but Porto 's justified pleas for a corner are turned down by the referee , despite the ball taking a deflection off the wall .
21 min : Jack Burns has written in to say he's in Carlisle .
" You went to see AC / DC ? " he asks .
" That 's amazing .
I 'm well jealous .
I went for a run today with Let There Be Rock on my walkman , the perfect Rock !!
album and an even better running soundtrack . "
Your Walkman ?
Heaven help us , Jack , you really do have problems .
23 min :
In the United half , Lisandoro , Hulk , Rodriguez and Aly Cissokho string a series of passes together for Porto 's first sustained bit of possession .
The manage to create a half - chance for Cristian Rodriguez , whose weak shot from distance does n't trouble Van der Sar unduly .
Rodriguez 's complaints that he was pushed by Rio Ferdinand as he shaped to pull the trigger fall on deaf ears .
25 min : From the left wing , Lucho Gonzalez quater - backs a pass up towards Lisandro on the edge of the six - yard box .
Van der Sar claims .
27 min : Having been totally dominated for the opening 20 minutes , it 's Porto who are bossing the game now .
They 're enjoying plenty of possession and starting to look a lot more like the team that took the game the United at Old Trafford last week .
28 min : Bad news for Porto , who lose their captain Lucho Gonzalez to injury .
He 's replaced by his namesake Mariano Gonzalez , who scored Porto 's equaliser in the first leg .
29 min : United in possession .
A cross from the right is met by Ryan Giggs on the far side of the six - yard box .
He volleys the ball straight at Helton in the Porto goal , but the Brazilian spills it and only just beats an alert Wayne Rooney to the rebound .
33 min : Anderson gallops down the left wing with the ball at his feet , attempts to cross it with a wild left - footed slash , misses completely and falls over .
The ball rolls wide and Wayne Rooney waves his arm contemptuously at the Brazilian while shaking his head ( his own head , not the Anderson's ) .
34 min : " I was glad to see the Guardian 's story on Tommy Smyth 's inane commentary and its effects on those of us in the US , " writes Graham Martin .
" However , forgetting that he wo n't be gone from our airwaves until next year , I tuned in late to the match only to hear his rancid " old onion bag " comment as Ronaldo scored and I blacked out . "
36 min : Wayne Rooney is now limping after coming out second best from a tackle by Rolando .
It looks like he might have damaged a muscle in his thigh .
Whatever is wrong with him , he 's struggling at the moment .
39 min : Manchester United corner .
The ball drops nicely for Carrick outside the penalty area , but his low drive is blocked by his own man , Nemanja Vidic .
With most of the United team committed up front , Vidic 's " clearance " ricochets towards the left touchline , with full - back Aly Cissoko in hot pursuit .
With United looking vulnerable to a breakaway , the ball beats Cissoko to the line .
40 min : Nemanja Vidic gets booked for a late tackle on Cristiano Rodriguez .
Moments earlier , Porto had won a free - kick on the left wing and the ball was curled across the Manchester United penalty area .
Sprinting in , Bruno Alves got the jump on Nemanja Vidic and flashed a bullet - header a couple of feet wide of the right upright .
If that had been on target he 'd almost certainly have scored .
43 min : Corner for Manchester United , which Ryan Giggs floats towards the near post .
John O'Shea helps the ball on his way , it drops nicely for Vidic , who lunges forward and pulls off the impressive feat of skying it over the bar from four yards .
It was easier to score .
45 min : Here 's a good one .
It seems that because he 's serving the first game of a Uefa - imposed two - match touchline ban tonight , Porto manager Jesualdo Ferreira has n't even turned up at the stadium , stating that he did n't want to be the focus of the TV cameras ' attention wherever he sat in the stand .
I 'd like to think he 's keeping in touch with everything that 's going on courtesy of this minute - by - minute report , but I doubt that 's the case .
The word on the street is that he prefers Football 365 .
Half - time
Second half is go : " Why does your photograph of Fergie remind me of Hitler ? " asks Luke Crane .
" Jack Burns can come round here if he wants , " adds Chris in Brighton .
" He sounds great .
The wine 's going down well and I 've some nice crisps .
No Sky though .
It 's all about Five Live and the Guardian .
Oh , and my wife 's back from pregnancy yoga before the end , so we might have to watch the Apprentice . "
I 'd say by the time Jack gets down from Carlisle , Chris , your wife will have had the baby .
Who 's she having it for , by the way ?
I presume that if it was yours you 'd have accompanied her to the yoga .
46 min : Cristiano Ronaldo fires the first shot in anger in the second half .
The rain is bucketing down , making both surface and ball very greasy , but Helton gets down to save well at the near post .
47 min : Patrick Evra gives the ball away in the Manchester United left - back position , where he can often be found loitering .
The ball is pinged towards Raul Meireles on the edge of the penalty area and he curls a speculative effort wide - but not too far wide - of the angle between left upright and crossbar .
48 min : " Dear Mr Glendenning , yes I am not at the stadium tonight and I am relying on you to keep me informed , " writes Jesualdo Ferreira , or somebody with so much time on their hands they 've actually gone to the trouble of setting up a googlemail account in his name .
" Please tell Jack Burns that I'm on the M6 passing Southwaite and should make it to the Dog & Whistle next to Tescos by 75 min . "
53 min : Free - kick for Manchester United , deep in Porto territory in the right channel .
Ryan Giggs curls it straight into Helton 's hands .
" The photo that reminds Luke Crane of Hitler seems to be of Fergie offering Liverpool their perch back , " observes Ian Copestake .
54 min : Manchester United corner .
Giggs sends it into the mixer and Bruno Alves clears the ball half the length of the field with an outstanding defensive header .
55 min : " Luke Crane will find that the picture of Fergie looks uncannily like the status of Saddam that they toppled after the conquest of Baghdad , " writes Steve Gaw .
He 's right - it does .
57 min : Free - kick for Porto , about 30 yards from the Manchester United goal , slightly right of centre .
Hulk stands over it , before dinking the ball around the wall , but straight at Edwin van der Sar .
58 min : Another shot for Porto from outside the penalty area .
This time Cristian Rodriguez tries his luck , but skews his effort horribly wide .
60 min : " Why on earth do n't you tell me something useful like do man u need to get another goal , you muppet , " writes Tessa Clegg .
Let 's see - on aggregate United have three goals , Porto have two , Tessa does n't know who 's winning and apparently I 'm the muppet .
63 min : Porto substitution : Cristian Rodriguez off , Ernesto Farias on .
An Argentinian striker for a Uruguayan one .
64 min : Manchester United are looking comfortable enough so far , but remain just one accurate long - range effort or John O'Shea gaffe away from Champions League elimination .
65 min : Corner for United , which Giggs swings in from the left .
It 's cleared , but not for long .
United win another corner , which Giggs ... eventually ... larrups in from the other side .
His outswinger is headed clear by Bruno Alves .
67 min : " I would recommend to Tessa Clegg that she should listen to Tommy Smyth 's commentary , " writes Graham Martin .
" He endlessly repeats drivel like ' Porto need a goal if they are going to win ' . "
A vaguely promising Porto attack comes to naught when Nemanja Vidic hoofs the ball into Row Z .
69 min :
When I saw the photo of Fergie , I assumed he was blowing kisses to Ramon Calderon , " writes Luke Williams .
70 min : Porto are enjoying plenty of possession without creating much in the way of chances .
They 've only 19 minutes to rescue their Champions League ambitions .
Obviously that 's a long time in football as it's well - documented that it only takes a second to score a goal .
That being the case , do n't rule out a Man Utd 1 - 1140 Porto scoreline .
73 min : Hulk ripples the side - netting after volleying a poor attempt at a headed clearance from John O'Shea from the edge of the Manchester United six - yard box .
74 min : Corner for Porto , after Adrianno Gonzalez gets the better of Patrice Evra down the right wing .
The corner is flighted towards Ernesto Farias at the near post , but despite pulling off the kind of mid-air contortions that would be the envy of those in the Pregnant Yoga class of Chris In Brighton 's wife , he 's unable to steer his effort on target .
76 min : " Pass on my thanks for all the offers of company tonight Barry , " writes Jack Burns .
" Did you notice that they all came from people who can be pretty sure I wo n't be able to accept .
And you can tell Jesualdo Ferreira that there is no Dog & Whistle near Tesco .
At least , I do n't think there is , I 'm not up that way often , hang on !
Jesualdo Ferreira is n't really on his way to Carlisle is he ?
Five Live is n't too bad , Alan Green aside , Pat Nevin is on and he 's always good value .
Why do n't you get him in at the Guardian ?
If he 's good enough for Newsnight Review ... "
77 min : Manchester United substitution : Anderson off , Paul Scholes on .
Porto win a corner which is flighted across the edge of the six - yard box .
Van Der
Sar comes for it and does n't get it , leaving Raul Meireles with a free - header oin a virtually unguarded goal .
Wide .
79 min :
By the way Jack Burns , I 'm a big fan of Pat Nevin , but think his appearance on Newsnight Review to discuss The Damned United smacked of tokenism and was insulting both to him and his fellow guests .
He should have appeared only on condition that they got him back some other night when there was n't a football - related topic up for debate .
Nevin 's a smart , opinionated bloke with plenty of interests outside football and could wax lyrical on end of topics .
81 min : Rooney has a crack from distance , but his effort fizzes over the bar .
Moments previously , Van der Sar shanked a clearance after the ball took a horrible bobble just before he made contact .
That could have been very embarrassing .
83 min : Porto pile on the pressure without creating any goalscoring chances .
Mariano Gonzales skins Evra down the right wing and sends in a cross that has far too much pace on it .
84 min : Nervous times for Manchester United .
Lisandro picks up a cross from Gonzalez and fires straight at Edwin van der Sar from 13 yards when a more considered shot either side of the goalkeeper would almost certainly have seen Porto through to the semi-finals .
86 min : Corner for Manchester United , which Giggs swings in from the left .
He wins another one , which he 's in no rush to take .
87 min : Giggs sends this outswinger to an area of the Porto box populated almost entirely by home players .
One of them sends a header straight into the path of Anderson , who fires over the bar .
88 min : Another cross from the left from Gonzalez .
Lisandro gets his head to it , but it 's too high for himn to be able to control .
He flicks it over John O'Shea , out to the left channel , into the path of ... nobody .
89 min : Hulk tries a shot from distance .
Wide .
There 'll be three minutes of added time .
90 min : " Five Live commentator Alan Green reckons he could write a book on Carlos Tevez and Ferg 's refusal to play him in big games , " writes Guardian cub reporter Mikey Stafford , who is n't paid enough to be able to afford either a Sky subscription or a trip to the pub ... or indeed basic food and shelter .
" There 's your stocking filler sorted for this Christmas .
The definition of ' page - turner ' right there . "
90+2 min : Cristiano Ronaldo brings a good save out of Helton with a low drive .
90+2 min : Thomas Costa knocks it long for Porto and Hulk beats Ferdinand in the air .
Nemanja Vidic cleans up at the back .
Behave .

Manchester United become the first English team to beat Porto in their own manor and will meet Arsenal in the semi-final .

You 've been at the Guardian too long , " writes Chris Moore .
He 's not wrong .
First , the president 's healthcare reform package is thrown into doubt in both articles .
Will he be able to pass it ?
Is he floundering ?
Is this reform effort in trouble ?
When you read the articles , however , you do n't get any reason why these assumptions are made or these questions asked .
There are no poll numbers to indicate that the American people want healthcare reform any less - or that they are more skeptical about Obama 's version .
In fact , we know the opposite is true .
There have been many different polls that show the public is overwhelmingly in favor of Obama 's version of reform , which includes a public option ( for example , a CBS News / New York Times poll had 72 % in favor and even a poll done by healthcare reform opponents showed 83 % in favor of the public option ) .
Those are unreal numbers and indicate that Obama has the public clearly behind him on this issue .
So , what does the media do ?
They write an article about how Obama is in trouble on this issue .
Their evidence ?
He called a " hastily scheduled " press conference on Friday that Republican Senator Chuck Grassley was not in favor of .
Are you kidding me ?
But mainly they almost seem to rejoice in pointing out that he is having trouble getting some of his fellow Democrats on board .
That is true .
And that gets us to point number two .
Throughout both articles , they credulously point to conservative Democrats concerns about how quickly this is all proceeding or how much the plan will cost .
Did it not occur to these reporters that some of these so - called conservative or centrist Democrats might be against this reform effort because their primary financial benefactors are the same healthcare companies that are desperate to kill this bill ?
Would it not have given the reader a better and more informed perspective to at least mention this possibility ?
Or do you want to just take these politicians at their word ?
Look , we all knew the healthcare industry was going to try to kill this reform effort , especially the public option provision .
How did you think they were going to do it ?
Did you think they would just walk up to the media and announce , " We have bought these six to eight senators and they will vote our way because we paid them . " ?
These senators are not against Obama 's healthcare effort because they want to have time to study it more .
How credulous and sadly naïve and misinformed about politics can you be if you think that 's what 's happening here ?
Please do n't tell me that you grizzled DC reporters are that pathetically unaware of how politics is actually played .
The " centrist " Democratic senators and congressman should more accurately be called " corporatist " Democrats .
There is nothing conservative about being against more competition in the free market , which is what the public option does .
But that is certainly in the best interests of the existing corporations - to limit competition .
There is all the difference in the world between being a capitalist and being a corporatist .
I get why the politicians are corporatist .
Those are the guys who pay their bills , fund their elections and allow them to hold on to their power .
That 's no big mystery .
That 's exactly the battle we were waiting for in trying to do healthcare reform .
What I do n't get is why the media goes along with this theater ?
What 's the motivation of Politico and the Washington Post to help the healthcare industry fight back against Obama 's proposals by : a ) painting the effort as failing and losing momentum ( if this idea sticks , maybe Obama will panic and just get reform done without a public option - which is exactly what the industry wants ) b ) pretending that the " centrist " politicians are on the level and totally unconcerned about where they get so much of their political funding ?
It leads to the same question we unfortunately run into about the media so often - are they incompetent or complicit ?
The Washington Post healthcare salons give you a sense of why they might be financially motivated to play ball .
But I can't get myself to believe that they are that craven and compromised .
Maybe I 'm being sadly naïve .
I tend to think that they suffer from DC bubble disease .
They have forgotten that they are supposed to challenge politicians .
They have been captured by the power interests in the capital and they are suffering from Stockholm Syndrome .
They have become convinced that politicians generally mean well and the only acceptable way to challenge a politician is if you have an equal and opposite politician demanding that you do ( because presumably he must mean well in offering up this challenge -- after all , it is not a legitimate opinion if it is not offered up by someone in power in Washington ) .
There is one more layer here .
If one side is being bought by corporate interests and their opposition to another politician is not genuine or based on principle , you must not under any circumstances let the public know what game is actually being played .
Pretend everything is on the level - everyone 's job depends on it ( though I 'm not sure that it does ; if that is The Washington Post 's calculation , I think they have gravely miscalculated ) .
The final move by the established DC media is - step aside , call everything 50 - 50 , do not fight for anything - let alone the truth .
You must resign yourself to covering the process and " politics " of any issue , which is so ironic because they never , ever tell you what the politics is really about ( when 's the last time you so an expose on how a politician voted a certain way because of corporate or lobbyist money he was given ?
should n't you see an article like this nearly everyday given how much money lobbyists pour into Washington ? ) .
You must never dare to look into what the substance of an issue is ( would The Washington Post ever dare to try to show whether the public option would in fact be less expensive for the average American - no , heaven forbid they should be accused of lacking neutrality if they try to actually figure out which side is right about the facts ) .
You must never let on that these respected politicians who you see everyday in fact are bought and sold on the open market by lobbyists who give them most of their money .
There might be a vague article here and there about lobbyists in general , but when is the last time you saw an expose about which lobbyists bought which politicians ?
Of course , if you say Ben Nelson or Orrin Hatch are frauds who vote based on the money and not their principles it will be awfully uncomfortable at the next cocktail party ( for the record , I use " cocktail party " only as a symbol for the symbiotic relationship reporters have with politicians these days ; I do n't think Ben Smith and Orrin Hatch are necessarily knocking back appletinis together ) .
It would be so ghastly impolite to challenge your friend and source like that .
Better to lie to the American people and pretend that all that money never influences a soul .
Watch The Young Turks Here
Why did n’t I vote in the latest elections for the president of the country of my birth , Iran ?
Because no matter who is the president of Iran , they would stone me !
As an Iranian woman , I require big changes in order to convince myself that a change in president would mean an improvement of my basic rights as human being inside Iran .
I was among many Iranians who decided not to vote in the recent [ s ] election .
We boycotted the sham election in my motherland and have not been surprised by the results publicized by the mainstream media , both in Iran and elsewhere .
This puppet regime has never considered the people ’s wishes and has always acted in the interests of the few who are in charge of the prison called Iran .
Cheating , lying and hypocrisy are the specialities of the religious demagogues that maintain the farce that Iran is a democratic state .
Here are some simple facts that demonstrate that irrespective of who is president , I would be stoned to death in Iran :
As a woman whose husband refused to divorce her when she escaped the country and came to Canada as a refugee , I am considered this man ’s wife as long as I am alive .
It does not matter if I lived separate from him for years , have divorced him in my new country and am in a relationship with a new man .
Under Iranian laws and the Iranian constitution , which are based on strict interpretation of Islamic laws , I am considered his wife and am at risk of being stoned for “ adultery ” if I ever go back to Iran .
In fact as a woman , I have no right to divorce my husband under the country ’s laws while he has the privilege of marrying three more times without divorcing me .
This is the case no matter who is the president of Iran ; Ahamdinejad or Mousavi .
As a journalist and filmmaker , I am called upon by the Islamic Republic of Iran to respect the red lines .
These “ red lines ” include belief and respect for the Supreme Leader and the savagely unjust rules of traditional Islamic law in my country .
I am expected not to write or demand equal rights .
I am not allowed to make the underground films I have made about the plight of sex trade workers and other social diseases rampant within Iran , as I did secretly 12 years ago .
In fact , I am not allowed to make any film without the permission and without censorship by Iran ’s Minister of Culture .
If I did openly do all these things in Iran , I would disappear , I would be tortured , I would be raped .
I would be killed as have so many women journalists , filmmakers and activists in Iran .
Among those killed include Zahra Kazemi , the Iranian - Canadian photo journalist , who was brutally tortured and murdered for attempting to photograph and publicize brutalities committed by the Iranian regime .
I would be considered an infidel if I was born into a Muslim family and later converted to another religion or had I considered myself a non-believer who does not follow strict Islamic morality .
My branding as an infidel would result in my public murder , probably by stoning .
No matter who is the president of Iran .
I would be lashed in public , raped in jail or even executed or stoned to death for selling my body in order to bring food to my family , as so many unfortunate Iranian women have been forced to do secretly including many single mothers who have no access to social assistance in a rich but deeply corrupted country like Iran .
Even the simple crime of being in love , engaged in a relationship outside of marriage , or worse yet , giving birth to a human being out of Islamic wedlock is considered a crime against humanity !
The product of such a union would be considered a bastard and would be taken away from me , and I would receive 100 lashes immediately after giving birth to my baby .
No matter who is the president of Iran .
No matter who is the president of Iran , I would be denied a university education , a government job and a say in politics and it would be as if I basically did not exist if I was a Baha ’i .
I would be considered half a Shia Muslim if I was Christian , Jewish , Zoroastrian or even a Sunni Muslim by all levels of society , no matter who is the president of Iran .
I would disappear and might be found dead if I were to keep writing and demanding my basic rights as a woman and an intellectual who has no say in politics ( there was not even one female minister in the so - called “ reformist cabinet ” of Mohamad Khatami ) .
This would be my fate had I continued to argue against and challenge the authorities to the fact that although Iran is one of the richest countries in the planet when it comes to resources , 70 % of my people live in poverty because of corruption among the leaders and their generous contributions to external causes from fanatic Muslim Hezbollah in Lebanon to the communist government of Venezuela through which they build alliances around the world .
Huge numbers of children go to sleep on empty stomachs .
Little girls are forced to sell their bodies in the streets of Tehran , Dubai and even China just to survive .
I would be jailed or disappeared no matter who is president of Iran .
No matter who is the president of Iran , I would not be able to be a judge or even a witness in court as a woman .
This is because according to Islamic Courts , two women are equal to one man .
No matter how educated and aware , I still would be considered half of a man who might be at a demonstrably much lower level of education and qualification , no matter who is the president of Iran .
No matter who is the president of Iran , I would be lashed if I did not cover my head and body in public in compliance with the mandatory Islamic dress code .
If I would be caught at a private family / friend / party or wedding taking place in mixed company , I would be punished for the crime of not being covered .
Much worse would happen if I was caught drinking .
It would not matter if I considered myself a non-believer of Islam who simply does not want to follow Islamic rules .
I would be punished harshly , lashed , raped while in custody and even before going on trial .
No matter who is the president of Iran .
No matter who is the president of Iran , I would be killed if I was openly a homosexual .
I would be denied all rights as a human being since homosexuality is considered one of greatest possible sins under the Iranian Islamic regime .
I would be considered a criminal and be killed because “ there are no homosexuals in Iran ! ’
That ’s odd , because some of my closest friends in Iran say they are gay , but stay “ in the closet ” for fear of execution , No matter who is the president of Iran .
No matter who is the president of Iran , Iranian activists living in exile , including myself and many others who are openly opposed to the regime for its cruel human rights violations , will not be able to enter the country .
We would be caught at the airport by the regime ’s police forces and forced to sign an apology letter for our actions against the regime .
If we refused , we would be jailed without trial for wanting freedom for our fellow people .
I would be denied of my basic rights as an opposition to the regime and would be called a “ spy ” , jailed , tortured , raped and executed .
This would happen regardless of who was the president of Iran .

This is Iran .
This is what it means to live under Ayotollah Khameini and his goons .
No change is possible while Iran is controlled by autocratic , fundamentalist religious despots who determine the laws of the land .
There has been no real election .
Candidates are all hand - picked and cleared by a central religious committee .
It is a farcical imitation of the free nomination / election process that we have pictured in the free world .
There is no possibility that a secular , pluralistic , freedom - loving democratic person who loves his or her country can become a candidate to run for president ( or any other office ) in Iran .
Twelve years ago , we went through the same process .
Mohamad Khatami became the favourite of the western media , which called him a “ reformist ” who spoke beautifully about freedom of speech , civil rights and dialogue between cultures .
But when he became president there was a crack down on a student uprising – a crackdown against the same students who voted for him .
Many were killed , many disappeared , and many were tortured .
Artists , authors and intellectuals disappeared and were found “ mysteriously ” murdered .
The smooth - talking president Khatami , whom westerners loved , never tried to stop the violence and never showed sympathy to his supporters .
Instead , he openly avowed that his responsibility was to respect the wishes of the supreme leader , Ayotollah Khameni , and to protect the security of the Islamic regime .
Now , the passionate and oppressed young generation of Iranians are going through exact same situation .
They are supporting Khatami ’s friend , Mousavi .
It is sad that history repeats itself so quickly in my beloved country of birth .
The people of Iran were fed up with poverty , injustice , corruption and international embarrassment with the knuckle - dragging , anti-Semitic , war - mongering cretin who was President Ahmadinejad .
They chose to support a bad choice – Mousavi – rather than the worse choice , Ahmadinejad .
However , when an election is really a selection , choice is an illusion .
Mousavi is from the Islamic regime ; he is inseparable from it , and all its abuses and cruelties .
The reality is that Iran has not had a democratic , free election for the past 30 years .
Mr Mousavi , if elected , will not make any changes , not because he is powerless to do so ( as Khatami ’s supporters claimed during his presidency ) , but because he does n’t believe in a democratic state as his background shows .
He belongs to the fanatic dictatorial era of Ayotollah Khomeini and he believes in the same command - and - control system of government .
We should not forget Khomeini ’s statement in one of his speeches after the revolution about democracy .
He said that “ if all people of Iran say ‘ yes ” I would say no to something that I would believe is not right for the Islamic Nation ” .
Let us not forget that Mousavi was Prime Minister of Iran in the 1980s when more than ten thousand political prisoners were executed after three - minute sham trials .
He has been a part of the Iranian dictatorship system for the past 30 years .
If he had not been , he would not be allowed to be a candidate in the first place .
In fact in a free democratic state someone like Mousavi should have gone on trial before becoming a presidential candidate for his crimes against thousends of freedom - loving political prisoners who were killed during the time he was Iran 's Prime Minister .
A quick look at Mousavi ’s political biography reveals him to be a fanatic Khomeini supporter and a fanatic hard - liner similar to Ahmadinejad and others in control of the Islamic regime .
His reign as Prime Minister was one of the darkest times in the history of Iran ’s Islamic regime in terms of censorship and human rights violations .
He is also backed up by the Rafsanjani mafia family , who have stolen oil money for their own family interests while 70 % of the population lives in poverty .
So ingrained as he is in a system of corruption and exploitation , that how could anyone believe that Mousavi genuinely wants reform ?
For these and many other reasons , I did not choose to vote and instead boycotted the election , along with many other Iranians .
But this time , many Iranians who boycotted the vote in the last election voted in this one because of their profound disgust with Ahmadinejad .
I sympathise with them , but I believe that there exists no better option for the people of Iran than to entirely overthrow the Islamic regime that oppresses the country of my birth .
I strongly support my people ’s movement against the ever - present dictatorship and violence infecting my country .
I will scream , along with my compatriots , ” Down with dictators ! ” “ Down with murderers ! ” “ Down with the brutal oppression that is the Islamic regime and all of its toxic , self - serving alliances . ”
Long live freedom in Iran !
Local veteran Jeff Curran has faced some of the toughest fighters in the WEC ’s featherweight and bantamweight divisions .
It does n’t get any easier for the “ Big Frog ” as he prepares to go toe to toe with Japanese warrior Takeya Mizugaki .
Many remember Mizugaki ’s battle with East Chicago ’s Miguel Torres as a candidate for fight of the year .
Chicago ’s MMA caught up with Curran at his new training facility .
He was hosting a seminar for his friend , Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and ADCC champion Marcelo Garcia , who is also helping him prepare for the upcoming fight with Takeya .
Curran is once again doing a video blog of his training camp leading up to WEC 42 .
You can watch his videos at Sucker Punch Entertainment ’s website .
And stay tuned to Chicago ’s MMA for more of our interivew with Jeff Curran .
He talked with us about several other topics .
Those videos are coming up later this week .
The unique lost rainforest of Mount Mabu is to be given protection from exploitation , following a new expedition to the remote area revealed a host of new species .
The existence of the pristine forest in northern Mozambique was revealed by the Observer last year , and was originally discovered with the help of Google Earth .
It is now thought to be the largest such forest in southern Africa .
At a meeting this week in the capital Maputo , government ministers agreed to put conservation measures in place before any commercial logging occurs there after meeting representatives from the Royal Botanic Gardens Kew , the Mulanje Mountain Conservation Trust ( MMCT ) , and numerous other groups involved in the project .
" The three messages we conveyed were that there is rich biodiversity in Mozambique , that butterflies and botany can be as important as mammals , and that conservation policy should take into consideration areas such as these mountains or the coastal forests , that do not easily fit into the usual category of national park , " said Kew 's Jonathan Timberlake .
The media coverage had clinched the participation of the government , added Paul Smith , head of the Millennium Seed Bank project at Kew .
Julian Bayliss of MMCT , who first identified Mount Mabu as an area of possible exploration using satellite imagery on Google Earth said : " As scientists it is incredibly exciting to go into a previously unexplored area and discover new species of butterfly , snake and chameleon , but our aim was always to secure pledges of conservation towards the protection of these sites . "
The first full - scale expedition to Mabu last October uncovered three new species of butterfly , a new species of bush viper , a number of rare birds and potentially unrecorded plants .
" These expeditions into the area are absolutely essential to securing conservation measures , " said Smith .
" Unless you know what 's there , then no protective decision can be taken about management of those areas . "
Outside the forest , the land has been devastated by civil war , but inside the landscape was almost untouched .
Ignorance of its existence , poor access and the forest 's value as a refuge for villagers during the fighting had combined to protect it .
The scientists fear that with local people returning to the area , and Mozambique 's economy booming , pressure to cut the forest for wood or burn it to make space for crops will threaten the ecology .
Just weeks before presenting their findings in Maputo , Bayliss was convinced that further new species could be discovered and so gathered a team of experts – and the Observer – for a final expedition into the area .
After trekking into the thick forest , the team spent its time setting up butterfly traps in sunspots , overturning stones and fallen branches searching for frogs , and tapping at the huge mahogany buttresses to awaken sleeping snakes .
Nights saw the bat nets go up and torch - lit searches for chameleons .
" Hunting chameleons at night is much easier , " explained herpetologist Bill Branch .
" Because at night they sit out in the open and they bleach to a white colour , which means they stand out in torch light . "
The pygmy chameleons , no bigger than a thumb , were in abundance , but it took three nights to uncover a different beautiful creature with perfectly coiled tail .
" It appears similar to the one that is considered endemic to Mount Mulanje , but frankly from the colouration I suspect we have a new species here .
This is what I came to Mabu to find , " said Branch .
The expedition discovered eight new species of amphibians , four of butterfly and a new pseudo scorpion .
The findings were reported at the meeting in Maputo , where representatives from the Mozambican department of agricultural research , Birdlife International , WWF , the International Union for Conservation of Nature , and the British High Commission joined the others to convince the government to commit to protection .
" It was an extremely positive outcome , " said Smith .
The expedition team
Bill Branch Herpetologist at Bayworld , Port Elizabeth , South Africa : " These mountains are some of the last explored areas in southern Africa ; I came here specifically to hunt for a new species of chameleon . "
Colin Congdon Lepidopterist based in Tanzania : " We leapt at the opportunity to join this expedition because nobody from the butterfly world has ever been into these places before . "
Martin Hassan Lepidopterist based in Tanzania : " The Baliochila were flying high up in the canopy and I had to climb high up a vine and use extension poles on my net to catch them . "
Steve Collins Director of African Butterfly Research Institute , Nairobi , Kenya : " It has been really exciting to see the place – seeing is believing – to get to the top of the mountain and look at the forest spread out is incredible . "
Julian Bayliss Project field coordinator of this Darwin Initiative project and ecological adviser to the Mulanje Mountain Conservation Trust : " We do n't just want to finish this project with a series of technical reports put on the tables of various Mozambican departments , we want pledges of conservation towards the protection of these sites . "
Hassam Patel Botanist : " Mabu is very important because it is such a big area of mountain forest .
In the other sites it was mainly woodland , but this is very special and we are uncovering lots of new plants . "

http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0380/
proposes new syntax ( " yield from " ) for generators to delegate control to a " subgenerator " ( really to any iterator ) .
Any send / next / throw / close calls to the delegating generator are forwarded to the delegee , until the delegee is exhausted .
This is being considered for inclusion in Python 2.7 , but I wanted a way to play around with the design pattern now ( and in case the PEP is n't soon accepted , and on older Python installations regardless of what happens with future versions of Python ) .
So I came up with this decorator - based solution .
The " supergenerator " decorator wraps the delegating generator with a control handler that takes care of directing send / next / throw / close calls to the delegator or delegee , as appropriate .
Sample usage is described in the decorator 's docstring .
Delegees can pass return values to the " yield _from " call by " raise StopIteration ( retval ) " .
Example :
@supergenerator def gen1funct ( ) : for i in xrange ( 3 ) : sent = yield i print " sent1 : %r " % ( sent , ) delegee = gen2funct ( ) retval = yield _from ( delegee ) print " return value : %r " % ( retval , ) def gen2funct ( ) : for i in xrange ( 3,6 ) : sent = yield i print " sent2 : %r " % ( sent , ) raise StopIteration ( 100 ) gen=gen1 funct ( ) try : i = gen.next ( ) while True : print " yielded : %r " % ( i , ) i = gen.send ( i* 10 ) except StopIteration : print " yielded : %r " % ( i , ) print " stopped "
Result :
yielded : 0 sent1 : 0 yielded : 1 sent1 : 10 yielded : 2 sent1 : 20 yielded : 3 sent2 : 30 yielded : 4 sent2 : 40 yielded : 5 sent2 : 50 return value : 100 yielded : 5 stopped
This is the " simple " version of my implementation .
It does n't do any special handling of nested " yield _from "s .
As a result , there 's an extra level of generator - switching overhead for each delegating generator .
If there are many levels of nesting , this will add up .
However , I also have an " optimized " implementation which automatically keeps track of nested " yield _from "s , and delegates directly to the most deeply - nested delegees .
See http://code.activestate.com/recipes/576728/.
The flow control in this simple implementation is less straightforward than it might be .
I did that in order to maximize the similarity between the simple and optimized versions .
Given how long they made us wait to see the film , and how many clips and images they 've released over the course of the year - and - a - half long marketing campaign , it 's fair to assume you know everything about .
Particularly if you 've read the books , right ?
How much surprise can there be in actually seeing Ron be wooed by Lavender Brown ?
Trust me , I was right there with you , until I finally saw the sixth movie and was thrilled to find new things to enjoy , even in a movie that slices out some of the best parts of the book .
Part of it is just seeing the world come to life , part is the maturation of the series ' main actors , and part is just a bit of genius on part of the filmmakers .
Below , my five favorite surprises from , with no spoilers for the movie , but maybe a few from the book if you have n't read it .
And if you have n't , seriously , what are you waiting for ?
He 's been skulking in the background of the last few pictures , as Harry took on villains far more significant than petty meanie Draco Malfoy .
But in the sixth book Malfoy finally tiptoes toward his long - awaited redemption , albeit via some pretty nefarious means , and Felton digs into the role as if it's what he 's been waiting for all along .
As he 's grown his face has become all sharp angles and daggers , and it's a wonder to see it all crumple as he cries in front of a bathroom mirror , overwhelmed at the task at hand .
As Daniel Radcliffe 's acting skills have seemingly shrunk with age , Felton has just gotten better .
It sure does n't hurt that he 's also gotten handsome .
None of the Potter films have really known how to handle Quidditch , the wizarding sport that seems so logical on the page but baffles most filmmakers .
Yates memorably cut it out of the fifth film entirely .
But in depicting one particularly challenging game for Ron as the Gryffindor team 's new Keeper , Yates makes the game exciting and even mostly coherent .
The technology for depicting these matches has improved immensely since Ron and Harry first learned how to ride brooms , and watching Ron dive to catch Quaffles or the Beaters swinging their bats , the heights and the rushes of wind actually feel real .
Added bonus : they show us Luna Lovegood 's crazy roaring lion hat , which looks exactly as great as you imagined .
Harry and Dumbledore do n't spend nearly as much time delving into Voldemort 's memories as they did in the book , mostly because it would be a fairly frustrating movie if it were made up entirely of flashbacks .
But two key memories -- Dumbledore 's visit to Tom at the orphanage , and Slughorn 's memory -- are intact , and Yates captures an excellent ephemeral , dreamy quality to both memories .
It 's hard to describe , but seeing teenage Voldermort turn into a wisp of black smoke looks effortless , almost as if it was what was there in the books all along .
The climactic scene of the book , in which Harry and Dumbledore undertake a dangerous journey inside a cave , is the scariest part of the series for my money .
And when I heard thathad earned a PG rating , I was concerned they would tame down the scene , cut the terror felt by Dumbledore or the horrifying creatures living within the cave .
And would n't you know it ?
They actuallythe scares .
Nothing can ever be as frightening as what you imagine , of course , but using his clever visual style and a powerhouse actor like Michael Gambon , Yates makes you feel the chills all over again .
There will be a lot of talk about the humor of this film , how it focuses on teen romances and even pratfalls rather than the usual dark meditations on evil and coming - of - age .
And while Rupert Grint 's the best comedian in the bunch -- look forward to seeing him struck by a love potion -- the real surprise is Daniel Radcliffe , who gets to cut loose when Harry takes another kind of potion that makes him feel , well , a little drunk .
In the book Harry was full of purpose and energy after drinking the potion , but Radcliffe 's version is a bit more manic , and way more fun , than we 've ever seen him before .
It 's a brief scene , but maybe the freshest of the whole series .
130 years ago , astronomers discovered Stephan 's Quintent - - a compact group of galaxies 280 million light years from Earth .
NASA 's Chandra X-ray Observatory has captured the X - rays generated by the interstellar collision , as one of the galaxies is sucked through the center of the group at 2 million miles per hour .
Back in the mid 1980s , GE and NASA began testing on a new propulsion system that used counter rotating fan assemblies in an attempt to boost efficiency .
The testing ultimately led to the design of the GE36 experimental aircraft engine , but was then set aside to explore other options .
Now , GE and NASA are planning on revisiting the design and adding some new technology to the mix .
The design is ultimately a hybrid between a Turbofan and Turboprop , which was aptly named a Propfan or Unducted Fan .
The process begins by using a turbofan engine with the fans relocated to the outside of the engine housing .
As the exhaust from the turbofan engine is forced out , they pass over a turbine which is connected to a prop on the exterior , while the other prop is driven by the turbofan .
Both sets of props have variable pitch blades that featured a dramatic curve , similar to a scimitar , which would allow the engine to reach speeds close to Mach .75 .
Along with the high flight speeds , the engine also showed a 30 % to 35 % decrease in fuel consumption .
The only real drawback to using a Propfan engine was the noise that was present inside the cabin .
This , when combined with a shifting market , ultimately led to the design being shelved .
Skip to today 's market , where the price of fuel is driving everyone in the transportation business to find ways to increase efficiency and decrease consumption , and the Propfan engine could change the air transportation industry as we know it .
GE and NASA are planning on performing tests throughout the summer and into next year , using the same rig they had employed for testing on the GE36 .
They hope the advances in wind tunnel diagnostics and aerodynamic modeling will be able to offer a better picture of the feasibility of the experimental engine .
The testing itself will be conducted at the Glenn Research Center in Ohio and will focus more on the blade design rather than the engine itself .
They plan on testing 6 different styles of blades , each with different lengths and sweeps , and determine which is able to provide the best performance for its intended application .
Assuming the tests are successful , it might not be very long until we start to see open rotor engines on commercial aircraft .
Aside from decreasing costs for the airline , a 30 % reduction in fuel usage would have a huge impact on the prices of airline tickets as well as the amount of emissions being released into our atmosphere .
Newsweek 's decision to have Stephen Colbert guest - edit the magazine 's June 8 edition " reeks of desperation , " said Gawker .
The newsweekly " recently underwent its second major design reconstruction in three years , " and now it 's enlisting a Comedy Central host as the first guest editor in its 76 - year history .
Newsweek editor Jon Meacham denies it , but this is just a " PR stunt . "
And it will surely help Newsweek sell a lot of magazines , said Annie Barrett in Entertainment Weekly .
Colbert says he 'll sprinkle the June 8 issue with the " conventional wisdom " of his ultra- conservative TV character , " but insists much of the content will be treated with the utmost seriousness . "
What fan of The Colbert Report would n't cough up a few bucks to see what Newsweek will look like with Colbert in charge ?
Newsweek could certainly use the buzz right now , said Nick Zaino in TV Squad .
The magazine 's redesign , unveiled three weeks ago , was meant to " reconceptualize the newsweekly 's place in the age of instant news . "
The new version is " more thought - provoking , more interesting , and less fluffy around the edges than the old Newsweek , " but it wo n't do any good unless people pick up the magazine and see for themselves .
Lately , I have been trying to perfect the x -browser behavior of pressing the enter key inside of an input field while using one of the in - page popups on Mint.com .
The desired behavior is to capture the form submission and execute the same JavaScript action as is triggered by the call - to - action button .
So , first I did some research trying to find out how the HTML specifications dictate that forms should behave .
Unfortunately , I did not find what I was looking for , so instead I opted for writing a Test Page to run against each browser and help track my findings .
The Test Page evaluates 5 forms , each using a different submittal `button` to trigger a form submission .
The first test is an input with type submit , which should always submit the form .
The second test is an input with type image , which is evaluated as a control against type submit , because it should behave the same .
The button element is the third submitter evaluated .
While the fourth submitter is an input of type button , which should never fire the submit event .
And the fifth is another control , using an anchor as a button , to ensure that using it does not trigger any form events .
Initially , each form has one text input and one submitter ( when we add a second text input , the event behavior changes ) .
The form submit event and the submitter click event is subscribed to in JavaScript .
Now going through each form , type something into the text field and hit enter .
Then go back through each form and click the submitter .
Executing this test plan in various browsers shows that there are 3 classes of browser behavior : FireFox & Opera , Safari and Chrome , and IE .
All browsers , when there is only one text input per form , fire the form submit event properly when typing enter , regardless of whether there is a `button` present that would normally submit the form .
However , some browsers will also fire the click event of the submitter button ( the exact behavior varies between browsers ) .
And IE can require two enters before submitting , if the text input is empty .
When clicking the submitter all browsers behave correctly with the input type button and the anchor tag , only firing the click event .
All browsers behave uniformly when clicking input types submit and image , firing both the click and the form submit events .
All non-IE browsers do the same when clicking element type button , but IE treats button elements like inputs of type button .
If that wasn t complicated enough already , the behavior changes when two or more editable inputs are added to a form .
In Chrome and Safari , the behavior with multiple inputs of all 5 tests is exactly the same as with a single input field .
However , in IE , FireFox , and Opera forms will no longer submit on enter unless there is a submitter present that would trigger a form submission when clicked ( inputs of type submit and image work in all 3 browsers , and element button works in non-IE browsers ) .
My Mint.com project was further complicated , because I had click listeners on the buttons and a submit listener on the form .
So in some browsers actions were being duplicated or not fired at all .
Sometimes , only one editable input field exists per form and sometimes there are many .
Lastly , in some cases we used " display : none " on inputs of type submit to trick the browsers into behaving correctly .
But to work uniformly across all browsers , I needed a standard to use everywhere .
So looking again at the Test Page , where do all browsers intersect and behavior uniformly ?
This happens when there is more than one editable input field and an input of type submit ( or image ) .
All browsers will fire both the form submit event and the submitter click event when typing enter in the input or clicking on the submitter .
They will also fire the click event first , so if you prevent the default event , then the form submit will never fire , so you won t need to also listen on the form submit event .
The solution is then to always have two or more editable fields in a form .
If you do not need 2 or more fields , then you can add an input of type text styled " display : none " and this will still make IE behave correctly .
Then all forms need to have one input of type submit , whose click event should be subscribed to .
If you do not want the form to submit , then prevent the default behavior of that click event .
The input of type submit needs to be displayed and visible for IE to recognize it ; depending on the situation you can set its opacity to ZERO or apply these styles " width :0 ; border : 0 ; height:0 ; padding : 0 " to make it invisible in the UI .
Following these guidelines will help preserve your sanity and make form submission behave uniformly across all the major browsers .
Although , I did not run these tests against IE 8 yet , because my local installation is screwy .
If someone has time and the inclination , please post a comment of your IE 8 results .
When they refer to themselves as , " the bad boys of British brewing " , BrewDog are not being entirely serious .
Indeed , it 's this tongue - in - cheek tendency to irony and silliness that has often got them in trouble with the more traditional side of the brewing industry .
James Watt and Martin Dickie , however , are certainly not your typical craft brewers .
For a start off , they 're just 26 , neither of them has a beard , and they call their beers things like Punk IPA .
They also favour a chippy , lippy marketing style which , rather than emphasising the hand - crafted , artisan qualities of their beers , is funny and confrontational .
Said Punk IPA comes with the warning : " We do n't care if you do n't like it . "
In the sedate world of real ale , where beers are usually named after rare birds or steam trains , this is heady stuff .
It has also brought BrewDog into conflict with the self - appointed moral guardians of the British brewing industry , the Portman Group , who have repeatedly criticised the Scottish company 's supposedly irresponsibly named and packaged beers .
" I have n't been too upset , " chuckles Watt .
" They 've done a lot more good for us than the marketing company we use . "
Such slick branding is not the only way that these rabid beer enthusiasts want to break away from accepted beer practice .
Instead of what BrewDog see as samey 3 % and 4 % traditional English bitters , the duo are on a mission to brew stronger beers , often inspired by what they consider spikier and more interesting international brewing styles .
Their Punk IPA , for instance , tips its crisp , wildly fruity hat to the more florid Bohemian lagers .
Now BrewDog are opening up another new front , with Beer Rocks , an experiment to create a collaborative , democratic beer online .
Basically , it works like this : for the past few weeks ( stage five of the process starts this Saturday ) BrewDog have been posting videos on their blog , in which Watt , Dickie and head brewer Stewart Bowman suggest different ways of developing a new beer .
The drinking public then vote for their favourite idea at each stage of the beer 's development .
It 's not a unique concept - reading the Appellation Beer Blog I stumbled across Flying Dog Ales ' Open Source Beer Project - but , with its video blogs and voting process , BrewDog 's Beer Rocks takes the idea to a new , as they pun it , " web brew point oh " , level .
The results so far are :
1 ) Beer style - winner : black IPA .
2 ) Malts and ABV - winner : a combination of Pale Marris Otter , Amber malt , Black malt ; strength , 6.5 %
3 ) Hops - winner : Cascade and Centennial
4 ) Special stuff - winner : a blueberry and oak chip infusion
5 ) Beer name and packaging - vote now !
BrewDog claim to have been , " inspired by the passion , knowledge and enthusiasm of craft beer drinkers " .
More circumspect observers may think that - as they 've ended - up brewing a 6.5 % black IPA infused with blueberries and oak chips - the voters have been taking the Michael ( Jackson ) .
Watt is unfazed .
BrewDog will produce and bottle 2000 litres of this still - to - be - named brew , come what may :
I guess coherence has gone out the window a little , but that was always going to be part of the project .
It 'll be fun to see how it all comes together .
It 's definitely going to be a saleable beer , but , at the same time , it 's going to be an experimental , progressive , connoisseurs ' beer .
It 's not going to be for someone who drinks Budweiser .
Fans will be able to buy the new beer through the website in about six weeks ' time .
It is n't the first time BrewDog has taken such an interactive approach .
Last year , after buying a mixed case of prototype BrewDog beers , drinkers could vote on which to put into production .
As well as the winner , Chaos Theory , BrewDog are about to launch the runner - up , Zeitgeist .
Interestingly , the Zeitgeist website will feature a blog ( each six - pack will contain a one - off unique user code ) where fans will be able to post messages , photos and video .
Again , according to Watt :
We 're a small company and , in everything we do , we want to take something new to the table .
A key thing in marketing is shortening the distance between ourselves and the customer , and we want use new technology to make the customer feel closely involved in our business .
It 's exciting to actually be involved in the decision making process , and then drink the beer .
All of this throws up some interesting questions .
In the web 2.0 , post - X Factor world we now live in , where people refuse to consume passively , where people want to have their say , a vote and to interact , will initiatives like Beer Rocks ( and Walkers ' Do Us A Flavour competition ) become commonplace ?
And is that a good thing ?
Is it not enough that we have to buy and eat things , that we now have to design them ourselves ?
As for the beer dimension to this , is this precisely what the staid real ale world needs , a bit of youthful excitement , irreverence and marketing savvy ?
Or does it all smack of heavily - hopped hype ?
OK .
I set the bar pretty low for our friends over at Fox News .
I expect little from them .
Basically as long as they do n't walk in front of the camera wearing SS uniforms or run segments about how slavery should be re-instituted I chalk it up as some sort of victory .
They meet our ridiculously low expectations every time they manage to broadcast for an hour without completely , blatantly , and willfully violating every social norm of the Western world .
They stumbled over that hurdle on July 8th , 2009 .
You might know Brian Kilmeade , one of the Regis clone candy - asses who look like John Tesh and populate insufferable morning shows like Fox & Friends .
Recently the F&F gang were chatting and having a perky morning chuckle about a study conducted by Swedish and Finnish scientists which suggests that married people are less likely to develop Alzheimer 's Disease .
Harmless premise , right ?
The sanitized Ray Romano - style jokes practically write themselves , right ?
" Well those scientists never met MY wife , Steve ! " ( * sounds of general merriment * )
Let 's just say Brian Kilmeade took it in a different direction in explaining why Americans are different from the Scandinavians in the study :
" We are — we keep marrying other species and other ethnics and other … "
At this point , his co-hosts , who despite being dumber than bags of sand are smart enough to realize that he 's loading grandpappy 's shotgun and inserting both barrels into his career 's mouth , try to get him to shut the fuck up .
Failing that , they try to talk over him .
Failing that , Brian Kilmeade keeps talking :
" See , the problem is the Swedes have pure genes .
Because they marry other Swedes ….
Finns marry other Finns , so they have a pure society . "
Check out the look on Gretchen Carlson 's face after he says that .
She looks into the camera , makes a Jim Carrey raised - eyebrow funny face , and tries to non-verbally communicate " Look , this is n't my fault .
Do n't fire me too " to the NewsCorp lawyers who will be watching the tape on an endless loop for the rest of the week .
I am setting myself up for disappointment here , but I have to believe that even for NewsCorp this guy has crossed a line .
They may love putting out a thoroughly biased sham news product but I do n't think they want to become America 's # 1 Source for Eugenics .
We may tune in tomorrow and see Brian Kilmeade 's eulogy .
Or maybe we 'll see Kilmeade doing a phrenological examination on a Negroid specimen ( probably Juan Williams ) .
Neither will surprise me .
Maybe Willie Sutton , the natty thief who robbed banks because " that 's where the money is , " picked the wrong target .
If only he'd gone after oil companies , he could have made more money , avoided jail time , and even picked up an award or two along the way .
Consider Pablo Fajardo and Luis Yanza , two Ecuadorians who on Monday were the toast of San Francisco after winning the prestigious Goldman Environmental Prize .
Mr. Fajardo , a lawyer , and Mr. Yanza , co-founder of the Amazon Defense Front , have been waging a long legal campaign ...

Last week , in honor of Canada Day , I decided to whip off a list of The Top Ten Reasons We Here in The Great White North Should Be Both Proud and Ashamed of Being Canadian .
However , I soon realized that it was n't something that could simply be whipped off in a few minutes , so I decided to take a few more days to think about it and here , finally , is my official list of the top ten things I love and hate about this country :
Shame :
Let 's start with the negative stuff first , just to make sure that no one mistakes this for yet another " Oh are n't we just the most perfect nation on earth " piece of mindless , nationalistic claptrap and self - praise .
There 's simply no denying that this is one hell of a great country , but we also have some pretty shameful things that need to be acknowledged and dealt with before I , personally , will ever say I 'm fully proud to be Canadian .
That 's right people , like a Canadian Michelle Obama , I 'm declaring that I 've never been 100 % fully proud of my country .
And I should mention that we 're not talking about miserable winter weather here .
Nor are we talking about much of the country 's inexplicable love of both Don Cherry and bare - knuckle brawling during otherwise perfectly entertaining hockey games .
What we are talking about , however , are the following ten items from the Canadian Hall of Shame :
10 . Celine Dion :
Not much we can do about this one , she 's out there , she 's , tragically , perhaps the most famous Canadian in the world , she 's reputedly sold over 200 million albums worldwide , and as Blender magazine so famously and perfectly put it she has been " Seemingly hellbent from birth on proving that Michael Bolton is n’t the cheesiest balladeer on the face of the planet " .
9. Conrad Black :
If his name alone does n't conjure up immediate feelings of scornful disgust , then perhaps you should read more here : The Black Hole of Arrogance Rant ' n ' Rave : Conrad Black Convicted
8. Alberta : Sure , with the influx of Canadians from other parts of the country and immigrants from overseas in recent years , there may now actually be some progressive types in the province , particularly in the two big cities of Calgary and Edmonton , but that in no way takes away from the fact that this Land of Rednecks , Bigots and Oil Sands is our very own Texas .
Decades of opinion polls have shown a population that is much more in touch with their kin down there in the Lone Star State than they are with their fellow Canadians .
It may have the spectacular beauty of the Rocky Mountains going for it , but this bastion of The Three R's ( that is , all things Right - wing , Redneck and Reactionary ) is still a scar on the otherwise ( relatively - ) progressive Canadian landscape .
Not only did they give the country the anti-semitic Social Credit Party of the 1930s and ' 40s and the dreaded earth - destroying oil sands of today , but they 've also given us the dual scourge of Preston Manning and Stephen Harper as well .
And , yes , I guess I should acknowledge that the relatively large redneck element that exists right here in B.C. would probably rather be part of Alberta themselves , but , hey , everywhere has got at least some right - wing wackos , right ?
The difference in Alberta is they 're the dominant force in the province .
7. Exporting asbestos :
Few people may have known about this story before the CBC 's exposé a few weeks back , but , unbelievable as it may seem , Canada does in fact actually still sell this cancer - causing shit overseas , even though we wo n't let it be used here in our own country due to the overwhelming evidence that it kills people .
You want horrific hypocrisy in the name of slimy greed , look no further than this .
To learn more about this blemish on our national reputation watch Canada 's Ugly Secret , Mellissa Fung 's excellent recent piece that aired on CBC's The National .
6 . The Queen : Is it just me or is it not simply ridiculous that Canada 's head of state resides across the Atlantic Ocean in England ?
But that 's not the half of it .
Will somebody please tell me why on earth we still have the head of some inbred European aristocratic family as our nation 's sovereign ?
Oh , I forgot , they 're born of " good blood " or some such shit .
Unelected , undemocratic , unneeded .
Feudal systems of government sucked in feudal times and they suck even more in the 21st century .
Wake up people , wake up !

5. Downtown Eastside , Vancouver ( and other similar areas in other Canadian cities ) :
It is absolutely inexplicable , inexcusable and downright disgraceful that a country this rich allows such an appalling , poverty - stricken , drug - riddled area to exist right in the middle of one of its major cities .
And it's all the more outrageous when you consider that all these people have been abandoned to the streets of Vancouver , a city of incredible wealth and overabundance .
Obviously it 's not something that is easy to solve , what with all the addiction and people so down on their luck , but if we can spend billions on bailing out GM then we can certainly spend the few millions it would take to clean up such a disgraceful situation and get all these homeless people housed and in proper treatment programs .
There 's simply no place for such suffering , poverty and hopelessness in a country as rich as this .
4. Police brutality :
It may be true that police brutality occurs in every country on earth , but that does n't lesson the revulsion of knowing that cases such as that of Robert Dziekanski actually happen right here in Canada .
It should also be noted that not all countries have national police forces that seem to do whatever they can to protect the thugs within their ranks , rather than doing everything possible to clean up the force .
Because at the end of the day the truly outrageous thing is how the thugs within the police force are coddled , protected and allowed to stay on the job when they should , of course , be charged and prosecuted .
I 've said it over and over again , there are lots of good cops out there , but there are also a lot of hothead , kneejerk reactionary thugs in the force as well .
And a truly civilized nation would n't put up with the thugs for a minute , let alone coddle them .

3. Getting sucked into America 's so - called War On Terror :
No , we , thankfully , did not get sucked into Bush 's illegal invasion and occupation of Iraq , but we , as a nation , have most certainly been dragged into some awful Bush - like behavior over the past eight years :
- First and foremost is our government 's disgraceful stance when it comes to Canadian child soldier , Omar Khadr .
Read more here about how we 've left this poor kid to rot in Guantanamo Bay for seven long years : Canada The Callous and Cold : Get Omar Khadr Freed Now !
- Then there 's the case of Abousfian Abdelrazika , the Canadian citizen stranded in Sudan for six years who , until last month , the Canadian government illegally refused to issue a new passport to , even after CSIS and the Sudanese authorities had both cleared him of any wrongdoing or involvement with terrorism .
- Then there are those dreaded national security certificates that allow the government , in violation of hundreds of years of legal tradition , to withhold evidence from suspects in their own trials ; certificates that Canada used to hold five men for up to eight years without charge ( and still holds them today under house arrest ) .
Just last week it was revealed that in two of these cases CSIS mishandled and misrepresented evidence against the accused ( which the accused never knew , of course , since they and their lawyers had been denied the right to see the faulty evidence in the first place ) .
- Then , back in 2006 , under intense American pressure the Canadian government , as part of the so - called " War On Terror " , took sides in a civil war and , ridiculously , branded the Tamil Tigers alone as the terrorists in the 30 - year - old conflict on the island of Sri Lanka .
Read more here : Freedom Denied !
Are We Happy Now : The Crushing of Sri Lanka 's Tamils
- And let 's not forget about our present government 's one - sided , 100 % - pro -Israel position , no matter how horrific the carnage and loss of civilian lives in Gaza earlier this year and in Lebanon back in 2006 .
That the " War On Terror " is a joke that has destroyed many innocent lives is sad ; that our country has largely gone along for the ride is tragic .

2. Treatment of Natives :
If this were a purely historical list then this would , without question , sit at number one .
Because when it comes to shameful aspects of Canadian history nothing really comes close to our treatment of this country 's Native peoples .
After all , we do n't really see ourselves as a nation that commits horrific war crimes , slaughters innocents , steals land , breaks treaties and kidnaps children , do we ?
But that 's exactly what this country is guilty of .
Of course these explicit horrors and crimes are all long in the past now , but the legacy of this treatment on the original inhabitants of this land lingers on in innumerable ways .
The overt racism may be long gone from government policy , but the living conditions on many reserves across this country are still often comparable to those in the Third World .
After stealing their land and then attempting to destroy their way of life , culture and sense of self - worth , there 's no doubt that we as a nation have a moral obligation to make things dramatically better for Canada 's aboriginal people .
Stephen Harper 's apology for the horrors of the residential school system was an important step , but there 's so much more that clearly needs to be done .
Read more about the residential system and Harper 's apology here : Finally An Apology : The Canadian Native Residential Schools Rant
1. Environmental record : Can anyone say oil sands ?!
But that 's just one aspect of our country 's pathetic record when it comes to the environment .
As I wrote in much more detail in an earlier piece , " The Let 's Get It Together Canada Rant : Canadians Among Worst Environmental Degraders In The World " , when it comes to taking care of this planet , when it comes to truly caring about the world we 're going to leave for future generations , when it comes to genuine concern for the world around us ... we simply suck !
Do n't believe it ?
Well , just this past week we scored yet another great distinction : Canada in last place on WWF 's G8 climate scorecard
Perhaps if you think Jesus is coming soon to carry you up in The Rapture then none of this really matters .
But for all non-delusional Canadians out there the fact that we are among the worst , if not the worst , per capita contributors to greenhouse gas pollution in the world is a horrific reality that simply must change .
Pride :
We may not have given the world any sort of fine cuisine ( does poutine count ? ) and we may be laughed at for being too polite at times , but this country most certainly has some pretty friendly people and , as anyone who has ever driven across the country from coast to coast can attest , some awe - inspiring natural beauty as well .
Beauty that makes this one of the most strikingly magnificent places on earth .
However , this list is not about such bland and obvious things as " friendly people " and " beautiful nature " .
Nor is it about such basic and absolutely crucial fundamental rights and institutions as freedom of speech , a free press , and democracy itself .
No , this list is , in fact , about these ten things :
10 . Neil Young , Joni Mitchell , and Leonard Cohen :
These three Canadian musical legends have each spent more than 40 years creating works of sublime beauty and , in Neil 's case , some rugged rockin ' masterpieces as well .
Pure Canadian greatness .
Almost great enough to make you forget Celine Dion .
Read more about Neil and Joni here : Talkin' Prairie Triangle of Inspiration ( A.K.A. Bob Dylan , Neil Young and Joni Mitchell Make Their Great Escape )
9 . Beer :
We may not be Belgium or Germany , but when it comes to smaller local breweries ( even if they 've mainly been bought up by bigger conglomerates in recent years ) , we 've sure got some fantastic beer here in Canada .
Now if we could just do something about the pathetically puritanical public drinking laws in this country we'd be set .
Oh and , hey , with beer being the most popular drink in the nation and pizza being the most popular food is n't it about time that parliament recognized pizza & beer as our National Meal ?
8 . Thriving arts :
This country has an incredibly vibrant thriving cultural soul .
Including :
- world class authors the likes of Margaret Atwood , Michael Ondaatje , Mordecai Richler , Robertson Davies , Alice Munro , Margaret Laurence , Timothy Findley , Douglas Coupland , and William Gibson .
And let 's not forget great political and environmental writers and activists like Naomi Klein and David Suzuki ;
- some of the greatest acts of the rock ' n ' roll era , such as The Band , The Tragically Hip , Bruce Cockburn , Ron Sexsmith , Arcade Fire , Rufus Wainwright , and the aforementioned Neil Young , Leonard Cohen and Joni Mitchell ;
- great filmmakers such as David Cronenberg , Paul Haggis , Denys Arcand , Deepa Mehta , Bruce McDonald , Don McKellar , Atom Egoyan , Norman Jewison , James Cameron , Sarah Polley , and Guy Maddin ;
- an endless supply of hilarious comedians like Mike Myers , Dan Aykroyd , Jim Carrey , John Candy , Seth Rogen , Catherine O'Hara , Russell Peters , Leslie Nielsen , Rick Moranis , Martin Short , Mary Walsh , Rick Mercer , Phil Hartman , Eugene Levy , The Kids In The Hall , Samantha Bee and Jason Jones of The Daily Show With Jon Stewart , and the creator of Saturday Night Live , Lorne Michaels .
In fact , comedians may be what we 're most famous for around the world , but we 've also produced many other famous and not - so - famous painters , architects , dancers , sculptors , playwrights , and stage & film actors as well .
Finally , largely thanks to government funding , through grants and the National Film Board of Canada , we 've produced a large body of incredible documentaries and short films .
For those who like their culture as much as their beer , there 's simply a lot to love here .
7. Stephen Lewis and other Great Canadian Heroes :
This country has had its fair share of selfless heroes over the years , most famously Terry Fox and Rick Hansen .
But today there are even more Canadians than ever out there doing amazing work helping people around the globe , Stephen Lewis perhaps being the most notable .
This former U.N. special envoy for HIV / AIDS in Africa now runs a foundation that , since 2003 , has been helping in the fight against HIV / AIDS throughout sub-Saharan Africa , a region that has been absolutely devastated by this horrific disease .
Working at the grassroots level , the Stephen Lewis Foundation has raised millions of dollars in the past six years , money which has funded over 300 projects in 15 countries , helping tens of thousands of people .
Read more about this Great Canadian here : The Stephen Lewis Rave
And check out The Stephen Lewis Foundation 's website here .
Stephen Lewis , of course , is just one of many Canadians doing incredible humanitarian work .
Here are a few others who I 'd most definitely call personal heroes of mine :
- Jiri Zivny , the B.C. man who died earlier this year while in Cambodia doing humanitarian work ;
- Lorrie Williams , the Vancouver woman who runs a charity called the Canadian Harambee Education Society that helps poor girls in Kenya get an education ;
See the CHES website here ;
- Saskatchewan native Jeremy Wildeman , who founded Project Hope in the West Bank city of Nablus to work with Palestinian youth ;
See the Project Hope website here ;
- Chandrasekhar Sankurathri , or Dr. Chandra , the Ottawa man who , after losing his wife and children in the Air India bombing , has gone on to found a charity that not only educates poor children in India , but also helps thousands regain their eyesight by offering free cataract operations ;

6. Quebec : How does Quebec make Canada a better place ?
Let me count the ways : a ) Regardless of whatever the anti-French bigots , particularly out here in the West , may think , Quebec has given our country a distinct and unique character ; b)
When it comes to just about every single social issue , poll after poll has shown the Quebecois to be more progressive and open - minded than their anglophone counterparts across the country ( part of the reason the anti-French bigots do n't like them , I 'm sure ) ; c) Over the past few years Quebec ( along with Toronto and Vancouver ) has kept Stephen Harper and his Conservatives from forming a majority government in this country ; d) Quebec City is one of the most beautiful cities not just in North America , but in the world ; e) Montreal is so all about culture that the city actually shuts down downtown for two weeks each year for the Jazz Festival ; f ) Quebec has given us the likes of Mario Lemieux , Guy Lafleur , Martin Brodeur , Rocket Richard , Roberto Luongo and Patrick Roy , to name just a few of the hockey legends the province has produced over the years ; and , finally , g ) Quebec gave us poet , novelist , songwriter , hipster , Buddhist monk , and living legend , Leonard Cohen .
5. Education system : Contrary to what conservatives may want you to believe , our education system does not , in fact , need lots more math , science and standardized testing .
Our system is one of the best there is for the simple reason that it creates , breeds and encourages a free - thinking , creative - thinking populace and that 's far more important than science and math will ever be for the good of the country ( though , of course , it is good if our doctors , scientists , engineers , etc , do master their science and math ... which they do with ease .
We 've certainly had no shortage of talented people in all of those fields over the years ) .
4 . The lack of influence by religious wackos - and religion itself - in our political system :
The wacko Christian Right may have huge influence south of the border , but up here things like rational thought , science and reasoned debate almost always prevail , though money and lobby groups often unfortunately dominate as well .
But at least its not religious money and lobbies pushing the political agenda here in Canada .
We may , sadly , have a constitution that states that our country was founded " under the supremacy of God " , but the reality of modern - day Canadian politics is , to Stephen Harper 's great chagrin I 'm sure , remarkably secular and reason - based .
Well , " remarkable " at least when you consider the reality down south , but quite normal I suppose when you look at just about every other Western democracy .
3 . A relatively progressive political culture :
No capital punishment , strong opposition to the Iraq War , legalized gay marriage ( and who would have thought two decades ago that by 2007 70 % of Canadians would decide to go with equality over bigotry and support gay marriage ? ) , public support for the Kyoto Treaty ( even if the politicians from both major parties failed to implement it while in power ) , etc. , etc .
Most obvious example of this political reality : Top local , provincial and federal politicians out celebrating Gay Pride Day in places like Toronto , Montreal and Vancouver each year .
Now that 's a progressive political culture !
2. Universal Health Care system and other universal social programs :
It 's certainly not perfect , but our system of medicine and our ideal of universal coverage for all , regardless of means , is a bedrock foundation of what makes Canada the society it is .
Unlike a certain Richest Nation
In The World to the south , we do n't leave the poor to fend for themselves uninsured .
Read more here : The Tale of Two Sickos Rant ' n ' Rave ( Michael Moore , Grandpa and the Glorious Soapdown ) .
1. Multiculturalism :
To me the greatest single thing about living in Canada is the incredible mix of peoples and cultures we have here and , specifically , the way people of all ethnic and racial backgrounds mingle freely , peacefully and happily throughout the country .
At the core of all this is the continual arrival of new immigrants from all parts of the world and the cultural diversity and fine cuisine , among other things , that they bring with them .
This is particularly apparent in places like Toronto and Vancouver , but you can also see it these days in smaller towns and cities as well .
The key word in the above paragraph is " peacefully " .
Anyone who knows anything about the horrific sectarian violence that is all too common in parts of Europe ( particularly the Balkans ) and especially India and Africa knows just how much we should cherish such peaceful coexistence .
No , screw that , we do n't " peacefully coexist " , we thrive !
And that to me is the thing that makes this country especially wonderful .
Yes , there are exceptions and some rare racist incidents or attacks , and , yes , of course there are still some unrepentant redneck racist pricks out there , but the fact is they 're rapidly becoming a smaller and smaller minority and the vast majority of people in Canada today live harmoniously with all sorts of other Canadians of different ethnic , racial and religious backgrounds .
A Long Way
For those who forget or honestly do n't know what a racist recent past we come from in this country , let me just tell you a quick story from my own family that highlights just what sort of country this used to be :
It was n't that many years ago now - the early - 1960s to be exact - that my grandparents , on the purchase of a new house in The British Properties in West Vancouver , had to sign a contract that forbid them from selling to any " Jews or Asians " .
And at that same time Natives in this country were n't even allowed to vote .
Oh , and we were kidnapping their children and putting them into rape camps , I mean residential schools .
Oh yeah , you better believe it , we 've come a long way baby !
But we 've still got a ways to go yet .

Game lag is history .
EVGA is proud to announce the latest addition to its award winning products : the EVGA Killer Xeno Pro. Designed to accelerate real - time internet gameplay , the EVGA Killer Xeno Pro fights game lag , smoothes game play and boosts frame rate during intense network gameplay scenarios .
Also included is hardware - accelerated voice chat that ensures hiccup free communication .
Gamer - grade network traffic prioritization and security tools further prove that this is not your grandmas networking card .
Get the competitive edge today with the EVGA Killer Xeno Pro !
How does it work ?
Bigfoot Networks ™ technology is optimized for online gaming and real - time communications applications .
The EVGA Killer Xeno Pro uses a 400MHz Network Processing Unit ( NPU ) to offload all networking operations .
The NPU acts as a co-processor dedicated to running the networking portion of games and other applications .
This NPU , along with Bigfoot Networks ™ patented software algorithms , accelerates , prioritizes and shapes the packet stream that goes to and from the computer , thereby allowing EVGA Killer Xeno Pro to bypass the Windows Stack and allow the NPU to handle all the network functions .
This results in the CPU being able to run at full speed , while checking for and receiving network data as fast as possible .
This Process : Optimizes and speeds network operations
Prioritizes game network traffic to ensure game data is always injected into the game the instant it arrives .
Offloads packet processing for latency intensive applications , like VoIP , to provide clear and clean communications
Frees up the CPU to do more game logic and other computations .
As a result , gamers see less lag , better frame rates and smoother , more responsive gameplay during intense action .
In fact , on average , gamers see from 10 % to 20 % increase in frame rate !
With Killer Xeno Without Killer Xeno
What performance increase should I expect ?
The below data points were supplied by Jon Peddie Research , who is a well respected , 3rd party research firm .
It is important to please note that the EVGA Killer Xeno card is not a graphics card , nor is it a CPU , and unfortunately there are no CPU or GPU like benchmarks that can immediately show the impact or performance results .
With that being said , the places where you will see the most significant performance boosts are during intense network scenarios , for example , in a crowded city or raid in World of Warcraft , in a busy Team Fortress 2 server , downloading anything while gaming , etc .
These are the places where you will see performance enhancements , both in framerate , and latency / ping .
The below results from Jon Peddie Research were done on two identical high - end PCs logged onto the same network and thru the same router in the same game , server and character , the machines were tested for thirty minutes , and average framerate and ping were calculated .

The following results are done with each machine under full network load ( two downloads in the background , while gaming )
Click to enlarge Click to enlarge
Here is the conclusion from Jon Peddie 's Report : " Killer Xeno Pro provides a clear performance benefit if the user encounters a heavy online gaming load , like multiple enemies or friends in the same area .
If the user wants to download or upload files while gaming with no impact on performance , the Killer Xeno Pro excels at this task as well .
Finally , if the user communicates with a voice chat program while gaming , Killer Technology and its Hardware Bandwidth Control provide a clear advantage to the gamer . "
Common Misconceptions / questions : Latency vs. Throughput : Latency or Lag is a measurement of delay for a network packet or series of packets .
Latency is a good measure of the real speed of your network connection , low numbers indicate less latency .
Throughput is a measure of your bandwidth - how much data can be delivered to its destination .
For example ; 10 Mbps , 30 Mbs , etc. Latency does not measure throughput .
" 30 Mps " does not guarantee any particular speed .
The Windows operating system is designed to maximize throughput .
Consequently , it is not optimized to lower latency for online games .
The EVGA Killer Xeno Pro is designed to optimize for latency !
In other words , delivering game packets faster than regular NIC's .
Would a fast computer ( fast CPU , memory , etc ) benefit from this card ?
Believe it or not , a faster computer can often benefit more from the Xeno Pro than slower ones !
Reason being as you increase the speed of your CPU , Memory , etc , the network interface becomes more of a bottleneck on your machine .
Would the Killer Xeno Pro card benefit a dual or quad core machine ?
Due to the fact that the Windows Network Stack is not multi- threaded , the Killer Xeno can especially benefit in these cases as well .
The Windows Network Stack always operates on the first CPU core , not only that , all CPU cores must synchronize with this core for network data .
In other words , when the game requires network data that has not arrived , all cores stop .
I do n't play online games , will this card improve my PC 's performance ?
The EVGA Killer Xeno Pro is designed to accelerate real time internet gameplay , there may be a few scenarios outside of gaming that would benefit from this card , however , the goal of this product has always been to improve internet gameplay .
How can this card fix the internet ?
EVGA nor Bigfoot cannot claim to fix the internet ; however , client - side lag ( lag in your PC ) is still where a big portion of overall game lag resides .
This is the problem area where the EVGA Killer Xeno Pro addresses .
Features Smooth Gameplay During Fast Action - Bigfoot Networks Network Processing Unit ( NPU ) frees up vital CPU resources to boost frame rates and smooth out gameplay experiences during the even the most intense action .
Hardware - Accelerated Voice Chat - Hardware - accelerated voice chat is fully offloaded from the CPU , processed on Killer Xeno 's dedicated audio chip and accelerated through Xeno's NPU .
Killer Xeno is bundled with Mumble , a free and open - source , cross- platform voice application .
Optimized for Gaming - Killer Xeno is the only network card that delivers an ideal online experience , with 128MB of onboard RAM , a dedicated network processor , an audio processor for online voice chat and a PCI Express interface .
Faster Frame rates - Smart packet optimization sorts and accelerates time - sensitive Internet traffic , bypasses the Windows ® Network Stack and transfers packets directly to and from games , improving game responsiveness and frame rates for that competitive edge .
Hardware Firewall - High - performance , hardware - based security that keeps intruders out and lets you live worry - free in the DMZ .
( Driver version 5.0.2.0 or later ) Bandwidth Control - The Killer Xeno's Hardware Bandwidth Control technology serves as a Network " Traffic Cop " that smoothes the online experience across all Internet applications - VoIP , streaming video , downloads and web surfing - even while gaming .
Optimized for Applications - 128 MB of onboard RAM allows more Killer technology applications like voice chat and Bandwidth control to be run on the card simultaneously enabling better system performance .
Plug and Play - Delivers Plug - &- Play compatibility with all online games .
The Killer Xeno works with all online games for improved performance right out of the box .

The recent free agent swap between the Houston Rockets and Los Angeles Lakers included two strikingly different players , Trevor Ariza and Ron Artest .
Ariza is known in Los Angeles for his clutch playoff 3 - pointers and game - changing defensive plays .
Artest is known for running into the stands five years ago and attacking a fan who threw beer on him .
The incident earned Artest a 73 - game suspension , and has tarnished his otherwise - impressive career .
Many Laker fans are entering the Artest Era with the trepidation one might encounter when going out on a first date with a girl who is known to have “ issues . ”
When it comes to basketball skills and stats , Artest is clearly the more established player offensively and arguably better defensively .
He brings size and strength to the Lakers that Ariza did not , and he brings the experience needed to guard the league ’s elite players like LeBron , D - Wade , etc .
He can use his size to handle bigger players like Carmelo who previously gave the Lakers match - up problems .
On paper , he ’s a great acquisition and the Lakers have statistically improved .
If NBA Championships were won on paper , though , the Lakers would have won far more titles .
The intangibles affect the game so much that they ca n’t be ignored .
Here , we have two intangibles that I feel are very important :
1. ) Artest ’s sanity .
Will he jump into the stands again ?
Probably not .
But the fact remains that he is a very “ loud ” personality compared to Ariza being a “ quiet ” one .
Will he cause distractions ?
I think many Laker fans are expecting the worst here , and I ’m seeing enough drive in Artest to believe that he ’s here because he wants a ring .
Distractions will make getting a ring harder .
I have faith in Ron ’s ability to tie these things together and squash the issue .
2. ) Fitting in as a player .
Ron ’s style is much different from the rest of the squad .
The Lakers are largely a finesse team ; with even big man Andrew Bynum throwing in a shooters touch on occasion .
Artest is a strength man , and can bully his way anywhere he wants on the court .
He ’s a sharpie and the rest of the team is fine point pens .
I think the Lakers struggled against more physical opponents because they had no one on the team with that style .
I believe he fills a gap in the Lakers defensive strategy .
Do n’t get me wrong - I miss Ariza .
His tenacious defense saved us countless times , and his 3 - point shooting is one of the main reasons the team won .
I wish he stayed , but I lost a lot of respect for him when he took the same money elsewhere .
Perhaps the Lakers back office did n’t show him enough respect , but he only hurt himself and his fans by leaving without a raise .
I asked some of my fellow bloggers to chime in on the subject , and here is what the had to say :
Andrew Ungvari , Sir Charles in Charge
As a Lakers fan I ’m ecstatic for a few reasons .
The most obvious reason being that I think Ron Artest is a definite upgrade over Trevor Ariza .
He ’s a former DPOY who could extend Kobe ’s prime just by taking on the opposition ’s best player night in and night out .
He can guard point guards and power forwards .
How many other teams have someone like that ?
My wish list for the Lakers after they lost to the Celtics in the 2008 Finals was that they got older .
I wanted to see them bring in one or two veterans hungry for their first ring .
That team had one player on its roster in his 30s ( Derek Fisher ) compared to the Celtics who had nine .
They never added that veteran but fortunately for them they played an Orlando Magic team sorely lacking in Finals experience and eliminated them in five games .
Now they have a team filled with guys in their late 20s and early 30s and are poised to make a run at a championship for at least the next two years .
With Kobe ’s looming extension the Lakers will have Kobe , Artest , and Andrew Bynum under contract beyond the next two seasons .
The other reason I love the trade is because Mitch Kupchak sent a message that he was n’t going to get played by Ariza ’s agent , David Lee , or any other agent for that matter .
Lee thought he could get the Lakers to up their offer threatening to take the same offer from another team because his client felt disrespected .
Kupchak turned around and gave Artest the same deal and now Ariza ’s leaving a championship team in his hometown for one that ’s rebuilding for the same amount of money the Lakers had offered him .
As for Ariza , I ’m sorry to see him go .
I wish him the best of luck .
But in reality he ’s a nine points and four rebounds per game player whose agent overplayed his hand .
Adam Best , Lake Show Life
My favorite player of all time is Reggie Miller , who narrowly edges out both Kareem Abdul - Jabbar and Kobe Bryant .
I ’ve been a fan of the Lakers all my life , but I also followed the Pacers closely after they drafted the UCLA Bruin sharpshooter .
That being said , I probably know more about Ron Artest than about 90 % of basketball fans and writers .
Artest is not a bad person .
In the past , he ’s been a well - meaning person with some serious anger - management / self - control issues .
I also think that the fame got to his head a little bit , and he was more concerned with making Ron Artest the best player in the league and a huge crossover star .
Even though he ’s one of the 10 best two - way players in the game and a helluva interesting interview , he was never going to ascend to those heights .
In fact , because of both his game and personality , I would say that Ron-Ron is much better suited playing second fiddle to a better player with a strong personality — a leader .
In Indiana , Uncle Reg was on his way out and Jermaine O” Neal did n’t quite have the talent or leadership abilities to be that guy .
Neither Tracy McGrady or Yao Ming could be that guy in Houston either , both because of injuries and temperament .
Kobe Bryant will be that guy .
Kobe and Pau Gasol will take all of the pressure off of Artest .
In return , Artest will take it upon himself to guard the opposing team ’s best player in most cases ( except for the taller fours and fives , and quicker guards ) .
That will allow Kobe to roam on defense , which is what he does best .
It will also allow him to conserve his energy for the closing stretch .
I would n’t be surprised if Artest won Defense Player of the Year award with his focus turned back to D. Meanwhile , the Black Mamba will be more rested than ever late in games .
The other thing is how many teams have four players who are capable of 20 points , 8 rebounds and 5 assists on any given night ?
How many teams have two players ( Artest and childhood buddy Lamar Odom ) who can guard four different positions ?
How many teams have three non-point guards who can initiate the offense like Artest , Kobe and Odom all can ?
How many teams have three All - Star - caliber playes they can stick on the Carmelos and LeBrons of the L? Phil Jackson managed Dennis Rodman for three years , resulting in three championships .
Ron Artest has largely stayed out of trouble after departing Indiana nearly , what , four years ago ?
He has no pressure on him .
He can come in , focus on defense , rebounding and playmaking , and let the scoring come to him .
Some nights he will be the fourth or fifth scorer .
With the personalities in place — NBA Players Association Prez Derek Fisher , Jackson , Kobe and life - long pal Odom — Artest will stay in check .
Especially with the promise of a ring dangling in front of his nose like a carrot .
I also think that he ’s grown up considerably , or at leas smartened up .
As for Ariza , I loved the guy .
Rising star .
Terrific story .
Local kid .
Playoff hero .
But this is a business , and he and his agent , David Lee , overvalued his value and tried to play hardball .
Mitch Kupchak quickly moved on and acquired a better player .
Artest is far and away the better player , by the way .
Look , the Dominican Dunker was one of the best 25 players in the West during the playoffs .
But when Artest is at his best , he is one of the better all - around talents in the game .
Who knows if Ariza will ever rise to those levels ?
Artest has a track record of playing well for four different teams over a long period of time .
Ariza came out of nowhere during a contract year , hitting shots and making plays in part because he had the best team in the game today around him .
Who knows if that would have been a trend or an aberration ?
Lakers fans will remember Austin Croshere , the Pacers player who came out of nowhere during the 2000 playoffs and Finals against the Lakers .
There you had another young player who was in a contract year , and surrounded by a ton of talent .
He hit all the shots , made huge hustle plays and showed surprising athleticism .
Sounds like someone we know , right ?
Then Pacers GM Donnie Walsh forked over a zillion dollars to Croshere that summer , and Cro never rose to that level again .
The Austin Croshere Effect could be Ariza ’s future .
Some people think that Ron Artest was the gamble .
Not me .
I think a lot of Trevor Ariza , but getting Ron Artest during his prime ( which coincides with Kobe ’s ) for less money is the safer , smarter move .
Kudos to Kupchak .
Chris Shellcroft , Lake Show Life
Essentially , Mitch Kupchak swapped Trevor Ariza for Ron Artest .
What the Lakers lost in athleticism they gained in offensive fire power .
Ariza was a perfect fit for Phil Jackson ’s modern incarnation of the triangle offense .
Trevor ’s skill set made him a hybrid of a poor man ’s Scottie Pippen married with the less evolved offensive prowess of a Toni Kukoc .
Artest is a proven commodity with the kind of game that fills the box score with 20 point outings coupled with a few steals , some solid rebounding and a mean streak that makes Rick Mahorn and Bill Laimbeer blush .
Ariza ’s on - ball defense is not nearly as good as that of Artest .
Trevor ’s quick hands and amazing reflexes allowed him to gamble more often whereas Ron Ron is much better at moving his feet and is capable of frustrating his opponent with his physical style of play .
The biggest question is the most obvious one : How will he fit in ?
Artest is not the same loose cannon that once got face to face with Pat Riley , but his reputation does precede him .
Officials keep guys like Artest on a short leash .
Tim Duncan and Allen Iverson can get away with whining like a 13 - year old girl that dropped her Jonas Brothers tickets in the gutter , while Artest is given technical fouls just for raising an eye brow after a questionable call .
Laker fans remember how difficult it was to watch the brief stint of Dennis Rodman in purple and gold .
Artest is not that off kilter but he ’s sure to garner a lot of the same attention .
There is no other way to see this as anything but an upgrade .
Ariza could develop into a more rounded player one day but he ’s nowhere near the all around talent that Artest is .
So long as Ron can keep his focus on the court and not on the wealth of opportunities that are sure to come his way in the City of Angels , then there is no reason why he wo n’t be able to enjoy the same cheers that greeted Ariza after the NBA Finals .
Let ’s put it this way :
If David Stern gets his dream match up next year , then he might have to ask LeBron to cut another check to the NBA as the King is assured not to want to shake hands with Artest after a grueling series .
Artest is to James what Doomsday was to Superman .
Yeah , I just went comic book nerd on you .

Some of the stupidity being sold as preparedness and survival skills these days is amazing .
The amount of trash is too big to go through all of it .
Survival is on the spotlight these days , specially urban survival , and there ’s an entire market for it .
Seems that these days being thrown into a trunk and learning how to pick handcuffs is one of the most valuable skills to be learned .
Mostly people that do n’t know much about realistic survival situations , they eat all of this up like hot chocolate fudge .
People want to be Jason Bourne .
Its cool , sounds great and the market appeal is terrific .
I loved the Bourne movies people .
They ’re a blast … but its just a MOVIE !
Sorry if I burst anyone ’s bubble .
Where to start ?
Picking handcuffs and being thrown into trunks ?
Kidnappers do n’t throw you into trunks guys , they seat you between two other guys in the back seat and if you move you get shot .
Why throw you into a trunk where you can make a lot of noise whenever they stop ( that thing called traffic ) and alert everyone near by ?
The only cases I know of people that managed to escape , most of them managed to speed away before getting caught , a couple jumped out of the moving vehicle ( and got seriously hurt , unlike TV ) because the kidnappers did n’t plan right where everyone would seat and set the door on childproof .
One neighbor that got kidnapped , he escaped by bending the metal sheath roof of the shack where he was held and escaped from there .
Now serious kidnappers , they ’ll chain you to a bed and have someone watching over you all day .
Newsflash folks , if eight guys seize you with intentions of kidnapping , you ’re going no where , you wont pick your way out of anything .
Instead of worrying about opening trunks you ’ll never be thrown into unless you ’re a movie star and picking handcuffs , worry about not getting caught , because that ’s worth the time and money invested .
Fooling alarm systems , I mean who comes up with all this ?
who convinced people this was useful … other than for thieves ?
Oh , yes , I could come up as well with some far fetched scenario that will never occur even if I get to live 1000 years .
At the end of the day you ’ve practiced a bunch of “ cool ” secret agent tricks , you feel like “ The Jackal ” with your disguises and fake IDs , but you spent your time and money on something of almost no value in much more realistic , more likely situations .
There are skills worth learning , starting a car without the proper keys may as well be one …
AFTER you learned the other 200 or so skills that would prove more valuable and are much more likely to be needed and used .
Want to learn a valuable urban survival skill ?
First , learn to shoot , learn to fight , learn CPR , visit your red cross chapter ( or your local hospital ) , learn to navigate and know your location and the surroundings like the palm of your hand .
Know your own culture or the one of you AO and network for friends .
Learn defensive driving and have REALISIC plans .
Most of all THINK .
It ’s something so rare these days .
People would n’t do ½ of the stupid things they do if they followed that simple advice .
What I ’m saying here is , all skills may come in handy on day and are worthy in their own way .
Leaning to build a canoe using fire and stone tools is a honorable skill , but is it a skill worth my time ?
Freeing yourself from a knot maybe be useful one day if mugged in your home , but how worthy is it to someone that does n’t know home and personal security safety measures , or defensive gun fighting and does n’t practice daily concealed carry ?
Classes that teach you what you see in action movies , leave those to actors and stunt men , and put your money and time to better use .

Republicans have their work cut out for them .
Americans identifying themselves as Democrats outnumber those who say they are Republicans by 10 percentage points , the largest gap in party identification in 24 years .
The gap has widened significantly since President George W. Bush ’s re-election in 2004 , when it was a mere 3 percentage points .
But by the time Mr. Bush left office in January , less than a quarter of Americans approved of his performance .

These days , 38 percent of Americans say they are Democrats , 28 percent call themselves Republicans , and another 29 percent identify as independents , according to an average of national polls conducted last year by The New York Times and CBS News .
Led by former Vice President Dick Cheney , the cat is now out of the bag about how Cheney told the CIA not to let congress know about this particular secret CIA program .
I think no one should be in shock or in awe .
We are talking about Dick Cheney one of the biggest liars walking around here , coupled with the CIA , a recipe for disaster .
Congressional demands for an investigation grew on Monday over new disclosures that a secret CIA program to capture or kill al - Qaida leaders was concealed from Congress for eight years , perhaps at the behest of former Vice President Dick Cheney .
The program , which never got off the ground and remains shrouded in mystery , was designed to target leaders of the terrorism network at close range , rather than with air strikes that risked civilian casualties , government officials with knowledge of the operation said Monday .
The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it publicly .
The program was canceled last month by CIA Director Leon Panetta shortly after he himself first learned of it .

a southern man do n't need him around anyhow "
Thanks to Neil Young , Lynyrd Skynyrd was inspired to write the song " Sweet Home Alabama " .
Without Young 's songs that were so critical of the South 's segregationist and racist attitudes for inspiration , it is doubtful that the band would have produced a song with such a long lasting duration that continues to sell well 30 years after its release .
But the ultimate irony of " Sweet Home Alabama " is that for so many , the song 's implied put down of Neil Young was NOT meant as criticism but as support of Young 's anti-racism .
Thus , for those who think it 's so clever to put down Neil Young using the phrase " Hope Neil Young will remember , a southern man do n't need him around anyhow " little do they realize that they have the meaning backwards .
Every day , someone blogs or tweets the " Neil Young putdown " without comprehending that they 've actually praised him .
( Or even make implied death threats ( note caption ) . )
Similarly , with the State of Alabama using the phrase " Sweet Home Alabama " as an official slogan on license plates , one truly has to wonder what they were thinking the song was about .
Somewhere , Ronnie is still having a good laugh at Alabama officials and Neil Young bashers .
Such is the duality of the southern thing .
Is " Sweet Home Alabama " Really Sweet ?
The history of Lynyrd Skynyrd 's 1974 song " Sweet Home Alabama " has a long and tortured history .
The enormously popular song has an extraordinarily complex backstory involving a wide swath of groups which have laid claim to the song 's message and symbols .
As this article demonstrates , the complicated saga of " Sweet Home Alabama " is anything but sweet .
Rarely has such a widely popular hit song been so vastly misunderstood by so many for so long .
This article came about because I 've long been fascinated with Neil Young 's influence on other bands ever since I heard Lynyrd Skynyrd 's " Sweet Home Alabama " which was written in response to two of Young 's anti-southern slavery songs , " Southern Man " , from the album After the Gold Rush , and " Alabama " , from the album Harvest .
From " Sweet Home Alabama " lyrics :
Well , I heard Mister Young sing about her
Well , I heard ole Neil put her down .
Well , I hope Neil Young will remember
a southern man do n't need him around anyhow .

Known as a response record , such songs " refer directly to a previous hit and usually do it in a catty , mischievous way " .
The lines in " Sweet Home Alabama " are a direct response to Young 's anti-racist , anti-cross burning " Southern Man " and " Alabama " songs .
Lynyrd Skynyrd 's comeback was intended to mean , at first glance , " Thank you for your opinion Neil , now leave us alone . "
It is this perceived " attitude " which has led to Lynyrd Skynyrd earning a reputation as a " racist " band .
Inasmuch as the fact that the band often performed with a Confederate flag as a backdrop , the label and perception has been hard to shake .
" Sweet Home Alabama " : Conservative or Liberal ?
" Sweet Home Alabama " 's enduring popularity with conservatives ( comprised primarily of the wealthy elite and poor whites in the rural south [ source ] ) is quite perplexing given the song 's lyrics and meaning .
The National Review Online 's John J. Miller -- inexplicably and cluelessly -- recently listed it among " The 50 greatest conservative rock songs " and wrote that the song is " a tribute to the region of America that liberals love to loathe , taking a shot at Neil Young ’s Canadian arrogance along the way : “ A Southern man do n’t need him around anyhow . ”
So how could a song championing such liberal causes as civil rights , justice and equality become such an anthem for the policies of segregationist and ultra-radical conservative George Wallace * ?
Much as conservatives on the right fundamentally misunderstood Bruce Springsteen 's " Born in the USA " and Neil Young 's " Rockin ' in the Free World " , again there is a wholesale mis-appropriation of Skynyrd 's message .
( See the 2004 Election in this unbelievably distorted comparison of Lynyrd Skynyrd , George Bush , John Kerry , & Neil Young ) .

Just to start with one example of the ignorance surrounding this song , is the fact that the song " Sweet Home Alabama " has been appropriated by extremist hate groups , such as the neo - Nazi white supremacist band Skrewdriver as a theme song which carries their message of racism .
The following article traces the long arc and full circle of the song 's history , where -- in the end -- you can be the judge and vote along with several thousand others on the song 's true intent and meaning .
Lyrics and Analysis
Lynyrd Skynyrd 's " Sweet Home Alabama " meaning is often interpreted as being " racist " because of the the lyrics reference " In Birmingham [ where a black church was bombed killing 4 young girls ] they love the governor [ George Wallace ] " who was a segregationist .
This interpretation and analysis has been intelligently reasoned , hotly debated , passionately argued , bickered over , volleyed about , and scrupulously dissected .
After singing this line , Skynyrd sing " Boo , boo , boo ! " as if to disapprove of Wallace and his policies of racism .
Four Dead in Alabama and Governor George Wallace
As for the " Boo , boo , boo ! " chorus , some have dismissed it as Skynyrd 's wink at racism .
Joshua Marshall writes in Talking Points Memo : " It always seemed to me more likely that that shadow lyric is a mocking allusion to anti-Wallace protestors . "
Nonetheless , many still regard the song to be a paean to the South 's disregard for the civil rights movement .
The last line in the song is an ad - lib by Van Zant that is rarely understood .
He says , " Montgomery got the answer " .
Some of the original band members revealed this in a radio interview a few years back and possibly references the infamous march from Selma to Montgomery , Alabama , led by civil rights leader Martin Luther King .
George Wallace was the governor of Alabama when this was released and -- apparently -- loved the song , especially the line , " In Birmingham they love the governor . "
At best , this is ambiguous .
At it 's worst , this can be seen as an endorsement of the racist policies of the Alabama state capitol .
Wallace , in the end , made the band honorary Lieutenant Colonels in the state militia .
So is the song " Sweet Home Alabama " racist ?
Immediately after the band sings the verse " Well , I heard Mr. Young sing about her , " one can hear in the background what sounds like the phrase " Southern Man . "
Many believe it was Young 's original recording being played .
However , others claim it to be the album 's producer , Al Kooper , impersonating Young .
Furthermore , Lynyrd Skynyrd sang " Now Watergate does not bother me " .
Sadly , it would seem not only were Lynard Skynard untroubled by racism but were not terribly concerned by corruption at the highest levels of the U.S. government .

Neil Young and Lynyrd Skynyrd : Friends or Foes ?
The response song " Sweet Home Alabama " was inspired by the two Neil Young songs " Southern Man " and " Alabama " .
Specifically , lyrics to " Southern Man " :
" Now your crosses
are burning fast
Southern man "
Better keep your head
Do n't forget
what your good book said
Southern change
gonna come at last
Now your crosses
are burning fast
Southern man I saw cotton
and I saw black
Tall white mansions
and little shacks .
Southern man
when will you
pay them back ?
I heard screamin '
and bullwhips cracking
How long ?
How long ?
And " Alabama " 's lyrics :
Oh Alabama
Banjos playing
through the broken glass
Windows down in Alabama .
See the old folks
tied in white ropes
Hear the banjo .
Do n't it take you down home ?
( Play and listen to a MP3 sample clip of Neil Young 's " Alabama " and " Southern Man " )
In Young 's anthology album " Decade " liner notes , he wrote about " Southern Man " in his usual obliquely ironic fashion :
ADVERTISEMENT
" This song could have been written on a civil rights march after stopping off to watch " Gone With The Wind " at a local theater .
But I was n't there so I do n't know for sure . "
Others have made different interpretations of the contretemps .
In Glide Magazine by Ross Warner , this opinion is ventured on Skynyrd 's song :
" Although the song is perceived as an anthem of southern pride , “ Sweet Home Alabama , ” was actually intended not only as the band ’s fond recollection of their first time in a recording studio but as a reminder to the rest of America that not all southerners were rednecks .
When Skynyrd criticized Neil Young ’s “ Southern Man , ” it was for the sweeping generalization of all southerners as rednecks .
Do n’t condemn southerners now for what their ancestors did .
“ We thought Neil was shooting all the ducks in order to kill one or two , ” Van Zant said .
“ We ’re southern rebels , but more than that , we know the difference between right and wrong . ”
In fact , the band was quite outspoken about their disdain for Wallace ’s policies . "
The " feud myth " was further fueled with the Drive - By Truckers 2002 album " Southern Rock Opera " ( one of the few genuine masterpiece albums released in the early 21st century ) song " Ronnie and Neil " :
And out in California , a rock star from Canada writes a couple of great songs
about the bad shit that went down
" Southern Man " and " Alabama " certainly told some truth
But there were a lot of good folks down here and Neil Young was n't around Now Ronnie and Neil became good friends
their feud was just in song
Skynyrd was a bunch of Neil Young fans and Neil he loved that song
So He wrote " Powderfinger " for Skynyrd to record
But Ronnie ended up singing " Sweet Home Alabama " to the lord
( Play and listen to a MP3 sample clip of Drive By Truckers ' " Ronnie and Neil " )
Drive By Truckers guitarist Patterson Hood explains :
" I wrote this song to tell of the misunderstood friendship between Ronnie VanZant and Neil Young , who were widely believed to be bitter adversaries , but were in truth very good friends and mutual admirers ... "
Street Survivors ( original album cover )

As for Neil Young 's reaction to all of this ?
One widely circulated theory during the 1970's was found in Neil 's stunning response to Lynyrd Skynyrd with On The Beach 's " Walk On . "
I hear some people been talkin ' me down ,
Bring up my name , pass it 'round .
They do n't mention happy times
They do their thing , I 'll do mine .
Little did I realize at the time the symbolism in " Walk On " , but years later as On The Beach surfaces and makes its place with other classics , did some of Neil 's meanings sink in .
( The lyrics in " Walk On " have also been interpreted to refer to bandmates Crosby , Stills , & Nash . )
So were Neil and Skynyrd really friends or foes ?
If you look closely at the cover photo of the last Lynyrd Skynyrd album " Street Survivors " , you can see Ronnie Van Zant wearing a Neil Young " Tonight 's the Night " album cover t- shirt .

Or , as Fred Mills puts it in his book review of Lynyrd Skynyrd : Remembering The Free Birds Of Southern Rock by Gene Odom , " [ Ronnie Van Zant would ] just as soon go onstage wearing one of several Neil Young T - shirts that he owned in order to fuck with any yahoos in the crowd who missed the humor and irony of the “ Sweet Home Alabama ” lyrics . "
And Kenny C. posted on the comments another interesting t- shirt observation :
In the concert film " Rust Never Sleeps " , Billy Talbot , the Crazy Horse bass player , is wearing a Lynyrd Skynyrd t- shirt !
( More t- shirts at bottom of page )
It 's the Skynyrd shirt that looks like a Jack Daniels whiskey label .
Just something else to ponder ...

It seems that whatever grudges Lynyrd Skynyrd had for Neil 's music may have been resolved - if there ever was any feud to begin with .
From an interview with Ronnie Van Zant :
" We wrote Alabama as a joke .
We did n't even think about it - the words just came out that way .
We just laughed like hell , and said ' Ain't that funny ' ...
We love Neil Young , we love his music ... "
As for the rumor that Lynyrd Skynyrd recorded the Neil Young song " Powderfinger " ( see for lyrics analysis ) , here 's an interview in MOJO Magazine , where Young said :
" Lynyrd Skynyrd almost ended up recording Powderfinger before my version came out .
We sent them an early demo of it because they wanted to do one of my songs .
Interviewer Q. Surprising , that .
After all , Lynyrd Skynyrd put you down by name on Sweet Home Alabama , their first hit single ....
Young :
Oh , they did n't really put me down !
But then again , maybe they did !
( laughs )
But not in a way that matters .
Shit , I think Sweet Home Alabama is a great song .
I 've actually performed it live a couple of times myself . "
In addition to the song " Powderfinger " , Young allegedly also gave the band the song “ Sedan Delivery ” and " Captain Kennedy " to record .
Brothers in Arms or Rebels With A Cause ?

It should also be noted that shortly after the band was involved in a fatal plane accident , Neil Young performed a rare live version of " Alabama " at Bicentennial Park , Miami , Florida on 11-12-1977 for Children 's Hospital Charity with The Gone With The Wind Orchestra and he changed the lyric chorus from " Alabama " to " Sweet Home Alabama " .
Recalling the concert tribute in an interview with the Boston Globe , Young said : " I just sang ' I hope you all will remember .
I thought it was a cool thing . "
In a interview on the Rockline radio program ( November 23 , 1981 ) , when asked about " Swee Home Alabama " and Lynyrd Skynyrd , Neil Young said : " Great band , great .
I understand Ronnie once said that I 'll be mellow about it [ SHA ] , not care one way or other .
He was right . "
Back to the Driveby Truckers ( a great band that 's a cross between William Faulkner and Neil Young ) song " Ronnie and Neil " and the implication that Neil Young was a pallbearer at Van Zant 's funeral :
" And Neil helped carry Ronnie in his casket to the ground
And to my way of thinking , us southern men need both of them around "
This is another Neil Young / Lynyrd Skynyrd " urban legend " which is debunked in an interesting essay in Tone and Groove .
As for the rumor that Ronnie Van Zant was buried wearing a Neil Young t- shirt , again this seems to be another example of a myth to propogate the tragic legend .
Even more bizarre , are the rumors that some Skynyrd fans dug up Ronnie 's grave to prove whether Van Zant was buried in a Neil Young T - shirt .
Some of the fans / grave diggers report seeing VanZant 's body in a black Neil Young " Tonight 's the Night " t- shirt , however police reports indicate the coffin was never opened .
Regardless of their motive for desecration of a grave , Van Zant and Gaines remains were relocated to an undisclosed location .
The relocation was prompted by a June 29 , 2000 break - in at the crypts for Van Zant and Gaines at Jacksonville Memory Gardens in Orange Park , Florida where fans had gathered to pay tribute to the band .
And the myths and legends surrounding Skynyrd & Young and racism are again addressed on the Drive By Truckers epic " Southern Rock Opera " song " Three Great Alabama Icons " .
From the song 's lyrics :
" Speaking of course of the Three Great Alabama Icons
George Wallace , Bear Bryant and Ronnie Van Zant
Now Ronnie Van Zant was n't from Alabama , he was from Florida
He was a huge Neil Young fan .
But in the tradition of Merle Haggard writin ' Okie from Muskogee
to tell his dad 's point of view about the hippies in Vietnam ,
Ronnie felt that the other side of the story should be told .
And Neil Young always claimed that Sweet Home Alabama was one of his favorite songs .
And legend has it that he was an honorary pall bearer at Ronnie 's funeral -
such is the Duality of the Southern Thing .
One that certainly exists , but few saw beyond the rebel flag …
And this applies not only to their critics and detractors , but also from their fans and followers .
So for a while , when Neil Young would come to town , he ’d get death - threats down in Alabama …
As for the dangers Neil faced in the south alluded to by the Drive - by Truckers , Young has made statements about never wanting to play in the south .
There are only 2 dates from 1973 where Neil was scheduled to play in the state of Alabama .
Neither show has a known setlist and it is unclear whether Neil has actually ever performed in the state of Alabama .
And while his tours through the south have been limited , this is most likely an economic decision rather than a deliberate avoidance .
From the book Freebirds : The Lynyrd Skynyrd Story by Marley Brant :
" The presentation of the song " Sweet Home Alabama " in concert was accompanied by the unfurling of Skynyrd 's traditional backdrop , a huge Confederate battle flag .
The reaction of the audience was always the same : vigorous , fervent , and instantaneous .
Neil Young 's song " Southern Man " had offended many Southerners by seeming to accuse all people born in the south of being intolerant racists .
Young 's observations were obviously generalized and not accurate and Southerners were ecstatic when Skynyrd defended their honor by releasing " Sweet Home Alabama " with its direct references to Young 's faux pas .
The idea that the Southern man , or woman , did n't need Neil Young around to point out the problems of their society was overwhelmingly supported by Skynyrd fans .
" We thought Neil was shooting all the ducks in order to kill one or two , " Ronnie told Rolling Stone magazine regarding the creation of the answer song .
The band felt that Young 's lyrical content was representative of the shortsighted " Yankee " belief that all Southern men should be held accountable for the verbalizations and actions of a racist minority .
While the rebuttal was heartfelt , Skynyrd held Neil Young in high regard for his musical achievementts and they were n't intending to start a feud of any kind .
" Neil is amazing , wonderful ... a superstar , " said Van Zant .
" I showed the verse to Ed King and asked him what Neil might think .
Ed said he'd dig it ; he'd be laughing at it . "
Ed King says that the tune was not so much a direct attack on Young but just a good regional song .
The song was well received but immediately put a stigma on the band as rednecks .
Producer Al Kooper added .
" Hey , you have to be more careful when you write a song now .
But I 'll tell you something -- Neil Young loved it .
That 's true , he told me so to my face . " "
From Glide Magazine by Ross Warner :
" However , the band had serious reservations about the label they were tagged with .
Particularly troubling was the Confederate flag that often hung behind the stage .
In 1975 , Van Zant mused , “ That was strictly an MCA gimmick to start us off with some label .
It was useful at first , but by now it ’s embarrassing except in Europe , where they really like all that stuff because they think it ’s macho American . ”
The “ stars and bars ” that eventually began popping up in the band ’s crowds became more than embarrassing .
It was bad enough to be portrayed as ignorant hayseeds .
It was entirely another to be categorized as racist . "
From the Second Helping Re-Master booklet :
" The singer 's mock attack on Neil Young and his apparent defense of Wallace branded Skynyrd with controversy which would continue for years .
Young got the joke , however , responding by telegram and by letter to say he was proud to be the subject of Skynyrd 's Southern anthem . '
Perhaps Van Zant sums it up best .
' We 're not into politics , we do n't have no education and Wallace do n't know anything about rock n roll . '
( Read more excepts from the book Freebirds : The Lynyrd Skynyrd Story by Marley Brant )
Some fans vindicate the band as anti-racist by pointing to the lyrics of the song " The Ballad of Curtis Loew " , a tune Van Zant wrote professing his love for a black man 's blues playing .
Old Curt was a black man with white curly hair
When he had a fifth of wine he did not have a care
He used to own an old dobro , used to play it across his knee
I 'd give old Curt my money , he 'd play all day for me
( chorus )
Play me a song Curtis Loew , Curtis Loew
( Complete lyrics for " The Ballad of Curtis Loew " here .
Lynyrd Skynyrd 's " The Ballad Of Curtis Lowe " .
The song " Southern Man " was at the center of an unfortunate event on the 1973 tour and has been recounted by Neil in concert .
The incident ocurred on March 31 , 1973 in Oakland , CA .
During the performance of " Southern Man " , an excited fan approached the stage dancing and having a good time .
A security guard approached the fan and proceeded to " beat the crap out of him " and have him removed .
Young stopped playing the song , left the stage , and abruptly canceled the rest of the performance .
Young believed that the assault flew directly in the face of the song 's message of tolerance and diversity and was sickened by the attack .
A final irony of the Oakland " Southern Man " performance was that the officer was black and the beaten fan was white .
The " urban legends " surrounding the tragedy of Lynyrd Skynyrd are seemingly endless and no doubt fueled by the survivors themselves .
On VH1's show " Lynyrd Skynyrd 's Uncivil War " , keyboardist Billy Powell comments on the lies he told in an interview on VH1's Behind the Music in 1997 , about the plane crash .
Surprisingly ( not really ) , in 2003 , VH - 1 has the Lynyrd Skynyrd versus Neil Young controversy as one of the Top 40 Celebrity Feuds of all time .
What a joke , please .
Pretty ridiculous , but nothing compared to some of the other feuds featured .
Sadly , the folks at VH1 do very little solid research which they pass off as facts .
I guess facts do n't make for good ratings .
And facts are the enemy of truth , as many have observed of the famous quote by Don Quixote .
Warren Zevon mentioned the controversy in his song " Play it all Night Long " with the lyrics : " Sweet home Alabama / play that dead band 's song ... "
Much as John Lennon 's murder put an end to the 1960's love and peace spirit ( albeit some twenty years later ) or Kurt Cobain 's death marked the end of the grunge era , Ronnie Van Zant 's death ended a chapter in Southern Rock history .
The " faux feud " contretemps seem to provide endless fascination for Ronnie and Neil fans .
Lastly , there 's a connection between Young 's " Needle and The Damage Done " and Skynyrd 's " The Needle and The Spoon " .
But we 'll save that analysis for another day . ;)

Geithner Dismisses GOP Socialism Charge as ' Ridiculous '
By Ed O'Keefe
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner admits private investors are worried about investing in new government - backed commercial mortgage securities and dismisses as " ridiculous " a recent Republican National Committee resolution stating that Democratic policies bordered on socialism .
" There 's still a bit of concern about whether , if you participated in these programs , you 'll face in the future some change in the rules of the game , and that 's causing a bit of -- a bit of concern , " Geithner told The Post 's Lois Romano for her continuing " Voices of Power " interview series .
Private investors have expressed interest in the program , the government will work to limit their concern and he anticipates they will be " a good deal for the American taxpayer . "
" That 's the important thing to recognize , " he said , " because you -- you have in this basic structure , investors putting skin into the game , taking risk , making judgments about what the price should be for these securities , and the taxpayer gets to participate in the upside in those judgments .
So we think they 're a good deal for the taxpayer . "
Geithner also defended President Obama against this week 's RNC resolution , stating that the administration " had to do exceptional things to help protect the American economy , help fix this crisis , fix this mess . "
" Where we engage in these areas is with extreme reluctance and only because we think it 's the necessary way to help reduce the risk of greater damage to businesses , to the basic fabric of the American economy , " he said .
" And I say where we do it , we 'll do it only temporarily , try to make sure we get out as quickly as we can . "
The government plans to divest itself of investments in the financial and automotive sectors , " As soon as we can , " Geithner said .

The first step is getting to know all your options , the Journal writes , and one way to do so is by logging on to web - based brokerages that sell health insurance to secure tentative quotes .
You often do n't have to do more than provide limited , anonymous information about yourself to get a ballpark sense for how much a certain plan will cost .
The Journal also advises factoring in other costs beyond premiums , such as related doctor visit charges as well as any annual out - of - pocket maximum fees and benefit limits .

If you 're considering working with an agent ( which they strongly recommended for first - time purchasers ) , make sure you know how they 'll be compensated .
Agents get commissions from insurers for each policy they sell , often calculated as a percentage of a customer 's premiums .
These can range from around 3 % to as high as 20 % , agents and insurance officials say .
You want to know if your agent will make more money from selling you a certain plan .
Also , commissions can be higher in the first year of a policy , an incentive for unscrupulous agents to " churn " clients , or try to get them to switch policies .

Going It Alone When Buying a Health Policy [ Wall Street Journal ]
“ Heart - rending ”
– Denver Post
“ A moving … documentary ”
– Globe and Mail
When a 12 - year - old Palestinian boy was killed in the West Bank city of Jenin by Israeli soldiers who mistook his toy gun for the real thing , it could have been just one more blip on the news : one more war , one more child , one more human tragedy that ripped the heart out of a family and a community , but rippled no further into the world ’s consciousness .
But something extraordinary happened that turned Ahmed Khatib ’s tragic 2005 death into a gift of hope for six Israelis whose lives were on the line : while overwhelmed with grief , Ahmed ’s parents consented to donating their son ’s organs .
Suddenly , amid the violence and entrenched hatred surrounding an intractable conflict , a simple act of humanity rose above the clamor and captured worldwide attention .
Heart of Jenin tells the story of Ahmed ’s tragic death and his father Ismael Khatib ’s journey to visit three of the organ recipients two years later .
One of Ahmed ’s kidneys went to an Orthodox Jewish girl and his other kidney went to a Bedouin boy .
While his parents hesitated to donate Ahmed ’s heart , it now beats in the chest of a Druze girl .
“ I see my son in these children , ” Khatib says .
Crossing from northern Israel to the Negev desert and ending up in Jerusalem , Khatib encounters every complexity of the conflict : deep - seated animosity , hardened judgments , and heartfelt generosity .
While laying bare the deep divisions between Israelis and Palestinians , Heart of Jenin offers a rare vision of common humanity and hope .

Other graduated measures  like a slowdown in issuing visas to Iranian officials seeking to visit Europe and a potential withdrawal of all European ambassadors  would be considered , the diplomat said .
He said Iranian diplomats would be told that the arrest of the embassy employees and the threat of trials were considered a threat to all European Union diplomatic staff members in Iran .

The Iranian authorities accused the employees of fomenting and orchestrating the protests that drew tens of thousands of Iranians into Tehran ’s streets after the June 12 election .
The demonstrations provoked a security crackdown that had largely ended the public protests but not the political ferment over the elections .
The hard - line incumbent president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , has been officially declared the winner by a landslide , but his main opponent , Mir Hussein Moussavi , has vowed to continue his campaign to have the official result declared fraudulent .
Ayatollah Jannati , who is an ally of Iran ’s supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , did not say how many of the detainees would be tried or on what charges , news reports said .
But , in unofficial translations provided by news agencies , he said that the British Embassy had a “ presence ” in the postelection unrest and that “ some people ” had been arrested .
It was “ inevitable ” that they would face trial , he said .
The Guardian Council is an influential panel of 12 clerics whose responsibilities include vetting elections .
On Monday it certified Mr. Ahmadinejad ’s victory , a step that emboldened hard - line officials to warn of a harsher crackdown if protests continued .
Britain has sought diplomatic help from the European Union , which is thought to hold more sway with Iran .
But some European countries , led by Germany , have been reluctant to risk worsening ties with Iran , particularly at a time when European diplomats have been pressing it for concessions over its nuclear program .
They have argued that a withdrawal of envoys , a step urged by Britain , would leave few diplomatic options if the crisis deteriorated further .
But there were signs that the threat of trials had stiffened resolve in other countries .
“ Our solidarity with Britain is total , ” said President Nicolas Sarkozy of France , adding that France favored tightening sanctions .
The Iranian authorities have frequently blamed foreigners for the turmoil , but they have singled out the British as instigators .
They cited Britain ’s covert role in past political upheavals , including the toppling in 1941 of Reza Shah Pahlavi , suspected of having pro-German sympathies during World War II , and the ouster in 1953 of Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadegh after his government nationalized Iran ’s British - dominated oil industry .
It has been a big week for mobile phone regulation , or at least discussion about it .
On Monday a quartet of United States Senators sent the Federal Communications Commission a letter asking the agency to probe whether exclusivity deals between wireless handset makers and mobile services limit consumer choice .
On Tuesday AT&T and Verizon defended the cost of text messaging , insisting that most consumers opt for affordable bulk texting plans .
And on Wednesday the Senate Commerce Committee held a hearing on the " consumer wireless experience , " at which reform advocates continued to press for the unbundling of wireless services and handsets — basically letting consumers pick and choose wireless applications , as they do on wired networks , thanks to the FCC's Carterfone principle .
But behind the scenes , reform groups and the carriers are debating a broader problem : is the wireless industry competitive ?
Asking the question is n't just a good idea , it 's the law .
When Congress created the statutory category of Commercial Mobile Services in 1993 , it told the FCC to submit an annual report on the quality of wireless service .
The agency is now working on number fourteen .
The latest report announced that there is " effective competition " in the market .
The country had 263 million subscribers as of December 2007 , it says — a penetration rate of about 86 percent .
" Mobile telephone service in the United States remains relatively inexpensive on a per minute basis compared with that in Western Europe and Japan , " the survey concluded .
Decline to impose
This sort of talk is good news for carriers , because it allows them to argue that the competitive nature of wireless overall makes the services of an individual provider less of a issue .
Consumers have choices , negating the need for regulation .
" To foster continued growth and innovation the wireless industry is asking the Commission to dismiss the pending Skype Petition seeking imposition of Carterfone - type regulations on CMRS providers ; " argued CTIA - The Wireless Association in its latest comment on the survey , " to decline to impose net neutrality regulations with respect to content , application , or device access obligations on wireless broadband providers or to adopt a new non-discrimination principle . "
That plea probably is n't going to receive as sympathetic an ear from Julius Genachowski's FCC as it did from Kevin Martin's .
Example : interim FCC Chair Michael Copps ' disclosure on Thursday that he wants the FCC to open up a proceeding on handset exclusivity .
And that 's why mobile groups and reformers are rushing their comments to the agency in time for incorporation into the FCC 's 14th survey .
Two of those filings are a study in contrast — one coming from a sextet of advocacy groups , the other coming from CTIA .
The Consumers Union , Free Press , Public Knowledge and three other non-profits argue that the FCC 's 13th annual report skipped a lot of stuff when calculating competitiveness .
A " shallow analysis , " they call the 13th survey .
Here 's some of what they say the FCC missed .
You did n't separate mobile voice from broadband
The reform filing argues that the FCC created a " distorted " picture of the level of competitiveness in wireless because it lumped voice and broadband services together .
Sure , CU et al concede , they 're often bundled to consumers .
But mobile broadband is " disproportionately available to large incumbent carriers , " e.g. , AT&T and Verizon .
They 're the ones , after all , that do n't have to negotiate for the special access services you need for backhaul .
When you focus on the carriers who offer wireless broadband , it 's a much less competitive market .
" A deeper evaluation of these services will indicate a higher degree of concentration and more obstacles to competition among providers of mobile data and mobile Internet access services as compared to mobile voice services , " the filing warns .
Zero for conduct
The CU commentary also suggests that if you take a closer peek at carrier behavior rather than the number of carriers in a given market , you find similar pricing structures that suggest little actual competition .
Forget minute - to - minute , most consumers pay over five hundred dollars a year for wireless access on average , " much more than users in most other developed nations . "
Most voice plans range around 29 to 39 a month .
" Pay - as - you - go options remain costly for customers looking for economical solutions , " the writers note .
The carriers have n't adequately explained their data plan pricing structures either , the services appearing to be " far removed from any possible cost . "
Why does AT&T effectively charge $ 480 for every gigabyte of data consumed above its 5 GB a month plan , the groups ask — this famously delivering a $ 5,000 bill to an Oklahoma consumer .
And sure , bulk texting plans give consumers more options , but why do carriers still charge 20 cents an individual message ( a reality that makes me reluctant to text friends who I know do n't use the service very often ) ?
" Any revenue received by the provider on incremental text message usage is nearly pure profit , " the commentary argues .
" To put these profits in perspective : considering how little data is transferred in an SMS message , at 20 cents per message , consumers pay the equivalent of almost $ 1,500 per megabyte of data transferred , a rate over seventeen times more expensive than receiving data from the Hubble Space Telescope . "
Glaring signs ignored
Then there 's the oft - cited problem of device limits , among them Skype VoIP and SlingPlayer mobile not being allowed on AT&T's 3G network .
" In the Fourteenth Report , the Commission should consider limitations on usage as provider conduct indicating a lack of effective competition , " the groups write .
The filing cites many other practices that it sees as evidence of a lack of competitiveness : early termination fees , mandatory contract extensions that sometimes come with a new data plan , handset exclusivity arrangements between manufacturers and providers , and restrictions on roaming access for new market entrants .
" Past CMRS reports issued by the Commission have ignored many glaring signs of limits on effective competition , as well as numerous factors indicating that the wireless market will not dig itself out without regulatory intervention , " CU and company charge .
On the other hand
But CTIA offers a very different perspective on the problem .
All segments of the industry are " aggressively competitive , " the trade group argues .
" No one carrier holds a dominant share of the wireless market " — the biggest of the top four , AT&T , reaching 28.5 percent of subscribers .
And these carriers are aggressively moving out new broadband services , as evinced by a dramatic growth in cell phone sites over the past eight years , almost double the number in 2001 .
This has dramatic implications for the FCC 's stated goal of getting beyond the broadband duopoly ( telco , cable ) , and establishing a " third pipe " for consumers .
" Although some have bemoaned the lack of a third pipe to the home , this concept has been overtaken by events , " CTIA argues .
" It ignores that many American communities have three , four , five , or more additional choices in the form of mobile wireless broadband competitors providing connectivity to the person . "
Unlimited flat rate plans and pay - as - you - go schedules have become widespread , CTIA continues .
Carriers are pro-rating early termination fees .
And number porting rules allow consumers to switch services easily .
It 's not like CTIA wants the FCC to take a completely deregulatory approach to mobile regulation .
The trade group wants access to more spectrum and " reasonable time periods " for tower applications .
But beyond that , hands - off is the word .
While " certain groups " want the FCC to " consider price or network regulation of the wireless industry , " CTIA says , " hopefully the Commission will look at the consumer performance of those industries that are regulated by agencies versus those — like the wireless industry — that are driven by their customers and competition . "
Will the mobile industry get the same kind of thinking in the 14th CMRS survey that it praised in the last ?
It seems likely that the next FCC will heed at least some of the criticisms that consumer groups have offered on earlier reports .
Then Congress and the agency itself will have to decide what actions to take , based on the Commission 's latest assessment .
The deadline for final comments on the annual survey is June 29 .

* Ex-CEO says moved stock to avoid seizure
* Was “ angry ” at ouster
NEW YORK , June 17 ( Reuters ) -
The former head of ailing U.S. insurance giant AIG told a court on Wednesday that he had a private jet fly a large block of the company ’s stock to Bermuda from New York to prevent AIG from seizing it .
“ It was a reaction to the entire environment that was emerging between AIG and Starr International , ” Maurice “ Hank ” Greenberg told U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff .
“ It was starting to get very ugly . ”
A key witness in the dispute between Starr International and American International Group AIG.N , Greenberg appeared peevish under questioning by the lawyer for his former company , Ted Wells .
Greenberg also admitted to being “ angry ” at suddenly losing his job at the company that he had built into the world ’s largest insurer .
“ Yes .
It was sudden and abrupt .... Yes I was angry , ” he told Wells when asked about his ouster .
AIG is suing Starr International for $ 4.3 billion in damages representing the sale of millions of AIG shares since Greenberg left the insurer and the return of more than 185 million AIG shares that Starr International controls .
AIG accuses Greenberg , chairman of the privately held , Bermuda - based Starr , of illegally taking the stock , worth at one point at least $ 20 billion , in 2005 .
AIG contends the shares were pledged to fund a deferred compensation plan for selected employees .
Starr disputes that saying the beneficiary of the shares was always a charitable trust .
Wells told Judge Rakoff that a private jet was flown from Bermuda to New York in late September 2005 so that Starr representatives , accompanied by bodyguards , could transfer the shares to accounts in Bermuda .
“ If they attached ( or seized the stock by court order ) we would be spending our time in additional lawsuits , ” Greenberg said .
Greenberg said his lawyers advised him to move the stock , and it was not in response to AIG ’s lawsuit seeking to wrest back the AIG shares from Starr International .
The 84 - year - old Greenberg built AIG over 38 years into the world ’s largest insurer .
But in 2005 , he was ousted amid investigations into accounting irregularities .
Until the U.S. government ’s $ 180 billion bailout of AIG , Starr was the insurer ’s largest shareholder .
For some 35 years Starr had funded a deferred compensation scheme for select employs with its AIG stock making “ many , many millionaires , ” Greenberg said .
Judge Rakoff ruled on Monday that investigations surrounding Greenberg ’s ouster , the U.S. government ’s bailout and controversial bonuses to AIG executives could not be brought up at the trial , saying the matters were irrelevant to the case at hand .
The case is : American International Group v Starr International Company Inc 05-6283 in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York ( Manhattan ) .

Microsoft and the European Union have agreed to a compromise to their ongoing disagreement over the default use of Internet Explorer in Windows .
Buyers of Windows 7 on the continent will be offered a choice of browsers at start - up , though the changes may not be made in time for the system 's release .
The European Union has not officially made any final decision on whether Microsoft has breached any competition rules by including Internet Explorer -- and only Internet Explorer -- in Windows .
That verdict does seem extremely likely and the only real question at this stage is what punishment Microsoft will face .
The firm had announced it would ship Windows 7 without a browser of any kind in Europe , though officials quickly noted that was an unsatisfactory solution .
Those objections received relatively little media coverage so , likely to Microsoft 's relief , many will have got the impression that any resulting problems -- such as how you download a browser when you do n't have a browser to start off with -- were entirely the EU 's fault .
Consumers Receive Multiple Choices
However , the two sides may now have reached an agreement .
Microsoft has proposed that the installation process for Windows include a screen allowing the user to choose between several rival browsers .
For its part , the European Union says it " welcomes this proposal , and will now investigate its practical effectiveness in terms of ensuring genuine consumer choice . "
( Source : europa.eu )
The on - screen list would include the five or six most popular browsers in Europe , updated twice a year to reflect use in the previous six months .
At the moment the list would include Microsoft 's Internet Explorer , Mozilla Firefox , Opera , Apple 's Safari and Google 's Chrome .
( Source : statcounter.com )
Interestingly , it was Opera which brought the complaint leading to the investigation , while Mozilla and Google both registered as " interested parties " .
Race On for Sixth ?
The sixth spot , if one was listed , would be a tight - run battle amongst smaller search engines .
While there 's an argument that making this space available would help promote alternatives to the major players , there 's a risk that whichever firm was in sixth spot at launch would hold onto it permanently because of the exposure through Windows .

" If you are watching this message , it is because I was assassinated by President Alvaro Colom with help from Gustavo Alejos . "
Those were Guatemalan lawyer Rodrigo Rosenberg 's last public words on a video he recorded indicating that if he was found dead the President and his aides would be responsible .
His family released that tape to the public posthumously , the day after Rosenberg was shot dead while riding his bike on May 10th , and since then thousands of protesters have flooded Guatemala City to demand President Colom 's resignation .
President Colom has adamantly denied any involvement and has asked the US Federal Bureau of Investigation and a United Nations panel to investigate .
Mr. Rosenberg alleges on the video he recorded that he was perceived as a threat by the president due to his investigation of the death of a governmental aide Khalil Musa .
But the Guatemalan government , whose policies have rattled the country 's conservative elite , has claimed that the allegations are an attempt to destablize the government and the relatively new democracy .
Although President Colom is the Central American country 's first freely elected leftist leaning leader in over 50 years , the country has remained deeply divided since their civil war ended just a century ago between the ruling aristocratic class and the largely indigenous population .
OSCE insults - Russia strikes back :
The case against Poland
Friday July 3 2009 , the Parliamentary Assembly of OSCE passed a resolution comparing Stalinism with Nazism .
For Russia the distortion of history for political ends is unacceptable .
This profound insult to the country that lost over 26 million souls , as it stemmed the Nazi tide , responsible for 90 per cent of Wehrmacht casualties , cannot go unanswered .
OSCE insults - Russia strikes back :
The case against Poland
In occupied Poland the status of Volksdeutsche had many privileges but one big disadvantage : Volksdeutsche were conscripted into the German army .
The Volksliste had 4 categories .
No. 1 and No. 2 were considered ethnic Germans , while No. 3 and No. 4 were ethnic Poles that signed the Volksliste .
No. 1 and No. 2 in the Polish areas re-annexed by Germany numbered ~ 1,000,000 and No. 3 and No. 4 ~1,700,000 .
In the General Government there were ~ 120,000 Volksdeutsche .
Between 1918 and 1924 , Poland invaded all of its neighbors with the exception of Germany .
It was an aggressor before it even became a fascist state .
A military coup of 1926 made it , after Italy , Europe 's 2nd fascist state .
The German - Polish Non-Aggression
Pact was an international treaty between Nazi Germany and the Second Polish Republic signed on January 26 , 1934 .
German ambassador , Hans - Adolf von Moltke , Polish leader Józef Pilsudski , German propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels and Józef Beck , Polish Foreign minister , met in Warsaw on June 15 , 1934 , five months after signing the Polish - German Non-Aggression Pact .
Poland backed and allied itself with Hitler in 1937 and 1938 when the Nazis moved to invade Czechoslovakia .
Hitler , in the Munich Conference of 1938 , represented not only Germany 's claims on the Sudetenland but also land claims of Hungary and Poland .
After Poland annexed Czechoslovakia ’s Tesin district , Hungary took some of Czechoslovakia ’s Sub-Carpathian Ruthenia region , claiming that it had been stolen from Hungary after World War One by the 1920 Treaty of Trianon .
Abandoned by its allies and threatened with civil war , the Prague government hoped that Germany , Hungary and Poland would be satisfied with their immediate territorial demands .
Instead of guaranteeing the new borders , Hitler took advantage of the country ’s internal divisions .
He encouraged Slovakia to declare independence , so that he could more easily take the remaining Czech region .
As enticement , in March 1939 , Hitler promised Slovakia that if it declared independence , he would protect it – from Hungary and Poland .
Hitler gave Slovakia a choice : " On one hand , the autonomous Slovak Government could continue to exist according to the statute granted to it in the previous autumn by the Prague Government – in which case Germany would settle accounts with the Czechs and leave the Slovaks to the mercies of Poland and Hungary .
Alternatively , if Slovakia demanded immediate independence from Prague , the Reich would offer all - powerful protection to the new state , and would shield her from the territorial greed of Warsaw and Budapest . "
Poland invaded Ukraine twice , first against Ukrainian nationalists and then against Soviets .
It also invaded Belarus and took the western provinces from Belarus and Ukraine that were then recaptured by the Soviet Union after Poland 's fall to Germany in 1939 .
Poland also invaded Lithuania capturing and holding its capital city , Tallinn .
Then Czechoslovakia as described previously .
Finally it invaded and captured several key villages around Danzig , which were in neutral League of Nations enclaves and populated entirely by ethnic Germans .
In 1939 , Poland 's leaders Rydz Smigly and Ignacy Moscicki claimed : " Poland wants war with Germany and Germany will not be able to avoid it even if she wants to . "
And they threatened to overrun Germany in three days .
Poland was no different from the Nazi Germany in its actions prior 1939 .
The 1939 Danzig Massacres , for historical accuracy it should be noted , that the Poles committed an unprovoked hostile act ( with British complicity ) , serious enough to trigger war .
This act was the ambushing of a military transport by the Polish secret service , going through Poland to the German city of Danzig ( Gdansk ) delivering the Enigma machine .
( Cypher machine ) .

Therefore , it can be seen that Poland ’s considerable machinations were responsible for the start of the Great Patriotic War .
During wars in Ukraine , the Poles massacred somewhere between 500,000 and 1.5 million Russian POWs that they had taken .
Poland ran concentration camps for Orthodox Christians , while it burned them out of Ukrainian and Belarus provinces , solely for the reason that they refused to convert to Catholicism .
In Poland , 3 million Jews were killed , and only 40 - 50,000 Jews survived in Poland , the majority ( about 240,000 ) survived in exile in Russia or in German concentration camps .
This number of Jews could not have been killed in a short span of 18 months without the active help of the Polish population .
The dehumanization of the Jews made them easy prey .
There was a saying among the Poles under the occupation : “ The Germans will throw stones at Hitler dead , because he brought about the downfall of the German people , but the Poles will bring flowers to his grave as a token of gratitude of his freeing Poland from the Jews . ”
Add to this the fact that Polish nationalists ran the concentration camps in which tens of thousands of German civilians died in 1946 .
Poles never seem to feel guilty about their behavior prior to the war .
They like to portray themselves always as victims .
Poland has continuously failed to enact legislation that requires restitution or compensation for those individuals who had private property seized and confiscated .
So there you have it in the case of Poland .
In the words of the OSCE Resolution : genocide , human rights violations , war crimes and crimes against humanity .

Karim Benzema has revealed that he rejected advances from Manchester United , Barcelona and Internazionale before agreeing a move to Real Madrid .
The former Lyon striker , who signed for £ 30 m , was presented to fans at the Bernabéu last night .
During his time with Lyon , Benzema established himself as one of Europe 's most admired marksmen – he scored 54 competitive goals in the last two seasons – and he was regularly linked with some of the continent 's biggest clubs .
When asked if there had been other suitors , Benzema said : " There were quite a few clubs that contacted me , like Manchester [ United ] , Inter and Barcelona , but I decided to come here .
" Real Madrid are an excellent club .
I 've dreamt about playing here since I was 15 years old .
Florentino [ Pérez ] spoke to me about the team and the project that he wanted to create .
I wanted to play at Real Madrid anyway so he did n't have to convince me of hardly anything . "
Benzema is the fourth new arrival to be unveiled by the Spanish giants since Pérez returned to the presidency at the start of June , following in the footsteps of Cristiano Ronaldo , Kaka and Raul Albiol .
An estimated 80,000 people turned up for Ronaldo 's presentation on Monday , while around 55,000 were in attendance for Kaka 's unveiling last week .
The amount of people that turned up to welcome Benzema last night was considerably less , with around 20,000 in the stands , but the Frenchman was still delighted with his reception .
" It was very exciting .
Real Madrid fans have a special relationship with the players and I am very grateful for that , " he said .
" I felt some strong emotions today and that 's why I kissed the badge . "
Benzema , who has not yet been given a shirt number at his new club , is confident he can be a regular goalscorer at Madrid as well – if he can secure himself a place in what will be a star - studded line - up .
" I do n't want to promise a set number of goals , although I hope to score a lot .
With players like Kaka , Ronaldo and Raul it will be very easy for us to get goals , " said Benzema .
" I 'm aware that there is great competition at the club and maybe I cannot always play , but I 've come here to fight , so it 's not going to be a problem . "

Should Thought for the Day make space for non-religious viewpoints ?
Is it time for the Today programme to allow non-religious speakers onto Thought for the Day ?
A religious broadcast has been part of the Today programme since it began 50 years ago .
For more than 30 years this has taken the form of Thought for the Day - 2 minutes 45 seconds of faith - based reflection at quarter to eight .
While Christian , Muslim , Jewish , Hindu , Sikh and Buddhist thinkers have spoken in the slot , secular or atheist viewpoints have not been used .
Now , speaking on Feedback , Radio 4 controller Mark Damazer has said that the rules for who can speak on Thought for the Day may be up for grabs .
" The BBC Trust is currently considering this question , " he said .
" They may well suggest we should take in a wider range of voices . "
Please turn on JavaScript .

Pressure on the Today programme to allow a non-religious voice on Thought for the Day has been mounting for some years .
In 2002 , more than 100 public figures wrote to the BBC Governors demanding the " ban " on non-religious speakers to be lifted .
In response , Professor Richard Dawkins , a high profile atheist , was asked to broadcast an alternative Thought for the Day , but his thought - that " we have been born and we are going to die , but before we die we have time to understand why we were born " - was broadcast in a different slot on the programme .
Earlier this year , the Humanist Society Scotland launched an alternative Thought For The World podcast for those atheists who switch off the radio at 0745 .
Discussing the issue on the Today programme , regular Thought for the Day speaker Christina Rees , said she thought the programme is already secular enough .
" Over 80 % of people , if not more , have a faith and many more accept a spiritual dimension to life , " she argued .
" Devoting 177 minutes to coverage of world events from a default secular position , it is entirely reasonable to devote 3 minutes to comments on news which reflect an understanding of humanity and life that includes the spiritual . "
But philosopher AC Grayling argues that if a news programme is to have reflections at all , it should draw from ethical thinkers of all varieties , not just the religious .
" Concentrating on one particular kind of perspective , that is a faith - based perspective , leaves out of the counter a great range of perspectives that could be rather useful , " he said .
Do you think the Today programme should change Thought for the Day to allow non-religious speakers ?
Let us know using the form at the bottom of the page .
Thought for the Day is a spiritual moment when a topic or subject can be given fresh insight from a broad range of gifted speakers .
For me I hope it stays multi- faith as secular or humanist contributors could not offer the spiritual aspect .
Keep it as it is , please .
Michael Gear , Nantwich , England
To suggest , as your interview did , that humanism only concerns itself with things you can " see , touch and measure " would be incorrect .
Humanism embraces the spiritual aspect of society and human experience but rejects belief in the supernatural .
I would welcome some secular thoughts for the day - go on , be brave !
( Humanist spiritual asperation . )
Nicholas Hodges , Moretonhampstead , Devon , England
They should get rid of it for being so exquisitely banal .
The verbal equivalent of those interludes of kittens playing that they used to have in the early days of TV .
Malcolm Pryce , Oxford , UK
There are more philosophies in Radio 4 than in all our heavens and earths .
Bring them all on .
Paul Beardmore , London UK
Thought for today should not be changed from its already wide and varied ' faith based ' commentary on current events .
It is always refreshing , and always thought - provoking .
Bryan Beggs , Andover , UK
The weekly output of specifically reserved Radio4 Religious spots : Prayer for the day 6 x 2 mins = 12 ' 00 "
TFTD 6x2 '45 " = 16 ' 30 "
Beyond Belief = 30 ' 00 "
Sunday Worship = 40 ' 00 "
" Sunday " = 45 ' 00 "
TOTAL = 143 ' 30 " ( 2 hrs 23 mins 30 secs ) , or 1.752 % of total output .
Not much , really , for a country whose census shows 8.6 m people had no religion out of 58.9 m people ( 14.6 % ) , meaning that 85.4 % have an attachment to a religion .
Perhaps we should have more religious output on Radio4 , not less .
John , Leics , UK Monopolies of any sort are by their nature exclusive even religious ones so lets have a broader platform .
Allow us the listeners to hear if the humanists , atheists and others are equally stimulating , for after all its surely supposed to be a " thought for the day "
Max Bowman , London
This slot would be much more entertaining if John Humphrys was allowed to interrupt the speaker , as he does rather excel at demolishing dodgy arguments .
As it is I " religiously " switch off for it .
Please consign it to history !
Martin Thomas , Faversham , Kent I am a daily listener to the Today programme but almost always switch off when ' Thought for the Day ' comes on .
I am sure I am not the only one .
Not because it is faith - based but because so often the ' thoughts ' are inane and patronising .
Let 's open it up - to philosophers , atheists and free - thinking people from all backgrounds and beliefs .
John Pelan , Humbie , East Lothian Please keep TFTD as a religious slot .
This is probably the only spiritual content that people are exposed to each day .
Most daily discussion topics include murder , war , theft , corruption , rape - lets have some sanity in all this please .
Charlie Jones , Derby I'm a Christian and I would be fine with humanists and atheists on Thought - it 's only fair , and I 'd be interested in what they have to say .
Although I enjoy listening to Today , Thought for the day is the reason I listen , and if it was taken off , I would likely change to a different station .
Mike Smith , Leicestershire , UK Non-religious contributors should n't be defined by their secular status .
In fact , why draw attention to their non-religious status at all ?
Contributions should be judged on their content , not on whether the contributor has " bishop " or " rabbi " or " imam " in their title , or even " fervent atheist " .
Mike Ranson , Warrington I am a regular listener to Today and a practising Catholic .
Please , please , please get rid of Thought for the Day , ' spiritual ' or secular .
It is invariably banal and seldom of remote interest to those of any faith or none !
David Cadman , London
As an atheist I often find some parts of the talks interesting and thought provoking , but other parts can sometimes be offensive .
I am sure there are philosophers , psychologists and the like , who can bring us very worthwhile views on current events to get us thinking , without the overtone of religious comment .
Derek McComiskey , Stockport , UK
The existing contributors are very respectful of the views or beliefs of others , and never criticise them or proselytise .
They also never speak about what they do not believe in , nor seek to persuade others not to believe in them .
I would propose that atheists on Thought for the Day be required to abide by these same rules of conduct .
They should not attack the beliefs of others or seek to persuade others to change their beliefs , nor should they speak about God or gods , since they do not believe in them .
If they abide by these principles , then yes , let them speak : I for one would like to hear if they then have anything at all to say on Thought for the Day .
Simon Bramwell , Southampton
The rest of the morning is taken over with purely material human concerns .
The fairly frequent shrieking by atheists about the three minute slot that does n't conform to their world view is really rather churlish .
I also seem to recall that the last time a ' humanist ' was given the thought for the day slot , they spent it telling us how silly it was to be religious and that we really did n't need to be .
Yeah , thanks for that .
Obviously as a religious person I 've never thought about my faith at all and just follow it out of sheer habit , thank God for atheists to remind us silly - heads to use our brains ;)
Marie Colwell , Sutton , Surrey Most mornings I miss
Thought for the Day as it is the few minutes between leaving the house and starting the car .
However , when I do catch it , I often think that the speakers are drawn from such a limited pool of faiths and religions - I have yet to hear a Druid or a Wicca speaker .
I think if it were to include a much wider variety of speakers , including secular speakers , it would regain some of its relevance .
Taking time out to reflect is a good thing , and there needs to be a better balance of thoughts to allow this to be relevant to more of the listeners .
Natalie Cole , Exeter , UK
Thought for the day is the one part of the programme that I hate to miss .
It is always a contrast , sometimes surprising and usually thought - provoking .
I think it should be extended to include contributors from other backgrounds , as long as the quality is preserved .
It should continue to provide a space to stop rushing and contemplate issues from a wider perspective than the everyday , immediate ones .
Margaret Aitchison , Whitley Bay I like both Prayer for the Day and Thought for the Day .
I think Thought for the day , which will have more listeners should be kept as a religious based topic .
I also think it ought to be made more use of by the monotheistic speakers and a separate slot in the evenings found for speakers on historic , philosophical and personal opinions .
Marion Holland , Newcastle upon
Tyne I have no objection to foam - flecked militant atheists à la Dawkins .
But I think that in fairness we should be subjected also to foam - flecked creationists and intelligent - designists .
There is no such thing as too much nonsense
Douglas Finney , Cassis France " Thought for the Day " should be something that stimulates thinking .
At present it is often soporific .
It typically takes the form of an often inappropriate biblical analogy rounded off with a facile moral .
It should be open - ended , and controversial , asking : What do you think ?
George Jelliss , St Leonards on Sea , East Sussex I would be very interested to hear a range of thoughts both religious and non-religious .
So not just believers or non-believers in a god or gods but a range of thoughts on ethics would be worthwhile .
Phil Tyrer , London I enjoy the religious content .
It provokes me to reaffirm my atheism almost every day .
James , Ludlow , England I think Thought for the Day could accomodate non-religious speakers such as philosophers .
TftD should not , however , move away from discussing the spiritual .
TftD provides a hopeful , inspiring start to the day .
I do n't think reflection on non-spiritual philosophies would be at all uplifting .
Jennifer Davidson , Perthshire " ... do you like what you hear at 0745 ... " .
No .
What is more I have complained about this finger - wagging , patronising slot a great many times .
Get rid of it Today !
Laing Donaldson , Gtr London
Please retain TfT in its current format - it allows me to safely take a ' fag break ' .
A N Costello , Sheffield South Yorks
In our diverse and often troubled world it is refreshing to hear something of hope .
It is hope that the faith community are attempting to express .
As long as Thought for the Day is a faith slot those who wish to express a non -faith perspective should look elsewhere .
Jane Bowles , Conwy , Wales , UK I listen to " Today " most days from about 8 - 9 am .
Thought For The Day is the only " religious " spot on the programme and lasts a mere 3 minutes - out of a total of 60 minutes that I listen .
So my vote would be keep TFTD religious and expand it to 5 minutes .
Tim Stapenhurst , Aberdeen , Scotland I have to turn over at 07.45 or leave the room .
Thought For The Day usually starts quite sensibly , then they go and mention the G word and spoil the whole thing .
I 'd rather the whole thing was done away with but , if it can't be , please let 's have a rational voice or two in there to counter the deity fantasists .
Dave Plummer , London , UK If Christina Rees is correct ( Today 15 July ) that 80 % of people have religious / spiritual beliefs , what justification can there be for excluding 20 % of the population , who would prefer to hear thoughtful secular , humanist and aetheist views ?
Sue Chawner , Watford
The problem with Thought for the Day is not that it is faith only , but that it employs such a small stable of contributors .
The same voices week after week mouthing the same platitudes week after week .
The repetition of a narrow range of banalities has become the slot 's defining feature .
So yes : open it up to non-religious voices , but failing that , open it up to a wider group of contributors from within the faiths .
There must be lots of other , and more articulate , religious thinkers out there !
Richard Hamblyn , London , UK Surely its the quality of the ' Thought ' that counts ?
Why restrict the selection of speaker based on an arbitrary definition of spiritual ?
Ian Ashton , Leeds , UK I enjoy Thought for the Day and believe that the inclusion of non-religious thinkers would make the programme more interesting and challenging .
David Bell , Harrow I believe that the present format of " Thought for today " is adequately balanced and does not require any wider remit .
IF an input from a non -faith perspective was deemed necessary then it could be catered for by introducing a specific complimentary slot within the " Today " schedule .
Nick Beeton , Salisbury Wiltshire UK
I find the 3 minutes of Christian thinking a very good way of starting a day .
There are far more humanist ideas cluttering up the airwaves , and the 3 minutes give a welcome break between the confrontational comments from the newscasters .
It is a far better way to focus the mind .
ordinarymargaret , Doncaster South Yorkshire , England I feel it important that this slot has relevance to people 's lives - all people .
To me that means encompassing a wide variety of view points including secular or atheist and not just religious thinkers .
If relevance is the key then it is the message within the thoughts that is fundamental .
Sam Dick , Milton Keynes
No and if Anthony Grayling is not happy to live in a country which is religiously liberal and a country with a state religion - then he should move to a country without a state religion , like France .
" Thought for the Day " is a very good 3 mins of sanity and thought .
Isabelle Robinson , Bourdainville , France Please keep
Thought for the Day as it is at the moment with a religious perspective .
It is wonderful to have a space for reflection in amongst all of the news items , many of which make me angry , upset , etc .
There is more to life .....
Lilian Pitt , Beccles , Suffolk A little Enlightenment philosophy is JUST what the nation and this TFTD slot needs .
The enlightenment was / is just that .
It was a period when European thought moved past religion and realised that its OK to think for yourself and have a moral life without old men with big sticks perpetuating a fairy story .
As Heinrich Heine ( 1797 - 1856 ) said " In dark ages people are best guided by religion , as in a pitch - black night a blind man is the best guide ; he knows the roads and paths better than a man who can see .
When daylight comes , however , it is foolish to use blind , old men as guides . "
Derek Ruskin , Worcestershire
Maybe the question should not be whether atheists should contribute to Thought for the Day , but whether a new , specialist , slot should be introduced for them .
Waffle for the Day perhaps ?
Gerald Aves , Leeds UK
I feel it 's a very good and important 3 mins .
surely in our crammed lives it 's vital to allow ' thoughts ' about spiritual aspects .... just to help us keep life in perspective !
I appreciate the fact that it's ' religious ' but if it was a choice between opening it up to secular or getting rid of it ... then I would go for opening it up .

Das Bundesverfassungsgericht hat in einer heute veröffentlichten Entscheidung ausdrücklich festgestellt , dass Beweise verwertet werden dürfen , auch wenn sie auf rechtswidrige Weise gewonnen wurden .
Konkret ging es um die Hausdurchsuchung bei einem Bürger , dem Markenrechtsverletzungen vorgeworfen wurden .
Der Durchsuchungsbeschluss wurde später für rechtswidrig erklärt , weil die Verhältnismä ßígkeit nicht gewahrt war .
Bei der Durchsuchung wurden aber Betäubungsmittel in nicht geringer Menge und zwei Feinwaagen gefunden , was später zu einer Verurteilung wegen Drogendelikten führte .
Diese „ Zufallsfunde “ unterliegen keinem Beweisverwertungsverbot , so das Verfassungsgericht :
Es besteht aber kein Rechtssatz des Inhalts , dass im Fall einer rechtsfehlerhaften Beweiserhebung die Verwertung der gewonnenen Beweise stets unzulässig wäre .
Für die Beurteilung der Frage , welche Folgen ein möglicher Verstoß gegen strafprozessuale Verfahrensvorschriften hat und ob hierzu insbesondere ein Beweisverwertungsverbot zählt , sind in erster Linie die Fachgerichte zuständig .
Diese gehen in gefestigter , willkürfreier Rechtsprechung davon aus , dass dem Strafverfahrensrecht ein allgemein geltender Grundsatz , dass jeder Verstoß bei der Beweisgewinnung einstrafprozessuales Verwertungsverbot nach sich zieht , fremd ist , und dass die Frage jeweils nach den Umständen des Einzelfalls , insbesondere nach der Art des Verbots und dem Gewicht des Verstoßes unter Abwägung der widerstreitenden Interessen zu entscheiden ist .
Ein Beweisverwertungsverbot bedeutet eine Ausnahme , die nur nach ausdrücklicher gesetzlicher Vorschrift oder aus übergeordneten wichtigen Gründen im Einzelfall anzuerkennen ist .
Insbesondere die willkürliche Annahme von Gefahr im Verzug oder das Vorliegen eines besonders schwerwiegenden Fehlers können – müssen indes nicht in jedem Fall – danach ein Verwertungsverbot nach sich ziehen .
Diese Sicht der Dinge hat zur Folge , dass nach wie vor Beweismittel illegal gewonnen werden können – und dies normalerweise keinerlei Konsequenzen für die falsch Handelnden hat .
Weder werden sie , außer in krassen Fällen , dienstlich belangt , noch bleibt ihnen der „ Ermittlungserfolg “ versagt .
Denn die Erfahrung lehrt , dass Gerichte in den allermeisten Fällen das Strafverfolgungsinteresse des Staates weitaus höher schätzen als die Rechte des Beschuldigten .
Gerichtlich bestätigte Beweisverwertungsverbote sind deshalb die große Ausnahme .
Nach meiner Meinung kann nur ein automatisches Beweisverwertungsverbot bei allen Rechtsverstößen , die über Bagatellen hinausgehen , einen Disziplinierungseffekt für die Ermittlungsbehörden herbeiführen .
Wieso dieser nötig ist , steht ja mitunter in diesem Blog .
Pressemitteilung des Gerichts
Enterprise Fleet Management was recognized this week with the 2009 American Business Award ( the “ Stevie ” ) for Environmental Responsibility Program of the Year .
Owned by the Taylor family of St. Louis – which also owns and operates Enterprise Rent - A - Car – Enterprise Fleet Management offers businesses with medium - sized fleets services to efficiently manage their vehicle fleet .
The award comes as no real surprise for this blogger , as Enterprise Rent - A - Car has come to our attention on several occasions for their work expanding their low emissions rental fleet , providing van pool services throughout various cities across the U.S. , funding alternative fuel research , and acting generally as a good corporate citizen .

Offset , analyze , optimize , embrace
Enterprise Fleet Management received the Stevie for its aggressive implementation of programs and initiatives designed to reduce the carbon footprint of its customer ’s vehicles .
Important elements of these initiatives include :
Offsetting Greenhouse Gas Emissions – Enterprise helps customers purchase verifiable greenhouse gas emissions through TerraPass .
Enterprise Fleet Management also matched a portion of each customer ’s carbon offset purchase , for a total of $ 1 million dollars .

– Enterprise provides comprehensive data for measuring fleet emissions , project improvements in fuel efficiency and direct and indirect remediation costs .
Embrace emerging Fuel and Engine Technologies –
With the largest fleet of FlexFuel and thousands of gas- electric hybrids , Enterprise helps customers make smart decisions about new engine technologies .
As a result of these efforts , customers in the program offset an average of 15,000 pounds of CO2 per vehicle in 2008 from their fleets comprised of cars , light and medium trucks , and service vehicles .
Keys to Green
Enterprise Fleet Management has developed a sister website to Enterprise Rent - A - Car ’s consumer oriented Keys to Green to help educate business fleet owners and operators on how to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution .
Walking the talk
I first wrote about Enterprise last summer after speaking with Pat Farrell , now VP of Marketing and Communications , who told me at the time that “ we are not environmentalists . ”
Indeed not , and this is an important point .
Enterprise comes at their various efforts of corporate and environmental responsibility from both a pragmatic and fundamental level .
Enterprise has remained a privately held company since its inception in 1957 .
When I spoke earlier this year with Lee Broughton , Director of Corporate Sustainability , he told me that keeping Enterprise essentially a “ family ” business ( CEO Andy Taylor is the son of founder Jack Taylor ) , has helped the company hold fast to its founding principals and values .
The Taylor family has laid a foundation , according to Broughton and Farrell , of sustainability through core values of customer and employee satisfaction and community involvement : “ Take care of your customers and employees first , and growth and profits will follow ” .
This primary value has led the company into a new century , facing new challenges .
These challenges , combined with its fundamental corporate philosophy , helps Enterprise find innovative ways to address the needs and desires of customers wanting to drive more low emissions cars , commuters seeking an affordable , low footprint ride to work , and businesses wishing to maintain an efficient and cost effective vehicle fleet .
From there to the wider global community , insuring a sustainable business , say Broughton , means taking care , as best you can , of the world in which you operate .
To be sure , Enterprise progresses on its path not without mistakes , setbacks , and detractors .
No business can realistically expect to function without them .
The point , I think , is how mainstream companies like Enterprise can help lead by example to create a sustainable economy .
We may not all be environmentalists or philanthropists , but it is to the environment and to those with whom we interact daily that we will eventually answer .

The BBC Trust has launched an investigation into BBC Radio 4's religious Thought for the Day slot and the possibility of opening it up to secular and humanist points of view .
The Radio 4 controller , Mark Damazer , said it was a " finely balanced argument " whether non-religious speakers should become a part of the long - running Today programme feature .
Responding to listener complaints on Radio 4 's Feedback programme , Damazer said there " may well be quite a strong argument for including secularists and humanists " and said it was " absolutely not a cut and dried issue " .
" You should know that the BBC Trust … is currently considering this question and they will come to some kind of conclusion later on this year , " said Damazer .
" They may well suggest – I have no idea it 's for them and not for me – that we should take in a wider range of voices . "
Damazer said opening up the slot to other voices would make it lose the distinctiveness it has as a religious feature .
The slot not only gave a voice to a wide range of religions , he said , but also to voices from around the UK rather than " metropolitan figures sitting in a studio in Broadcasting House or the news centre in west London " .
" It is I think satisfyingly diverse [ but ] that does not mean that it should never change its remit or the criteria for selection and I think it is worth looking at .
Curiously enough even for people who dislike it , it becomes something of a conversation point quite a lot of the time even when you find yourself being absolutely furious with the speaker 's conclusions . "
Secular and humanist groups have long campaigned for the slot to be opened up to people outside of religious groups , and in January this year a non-religious version , called Thought for the Afternoon , was broadcast on Radio 4 's Saturday afternoon programme , iPM .
One listener told Feedback she found the programme " deeply irritating and quite often quite insulting " .
" I would be quite happy with a Thought for the Day with a secular point , some philosophical dilemma , a little bit of science , maybe anything to stop us for a moment and think about something other than the latest drama in the news , " she said .
" I think it 's a very good opportunity to do that , I just feel annoyed it 's always the Sikhs or the Muslims or the Jews or the Christians or whatever . "

Republican obstructionists in the House can't get anything done -- not that they even want to , as you can tell from the years when they controlled the show under Bush -- so their new tactic of absurdity is to try to force adjournment votes whenever they get angry about anything .
Yesterday they did it twice .
At 2 in the afternoon 22 of the worst right - wing obstructionists tried forcing an abrupt adjournment .
All 235 Democrats and 145 Republicans voted against them , telling them , in effect , to grow up and start remembering that those fat paychecks and great health care plans they get at the taxpayer expense is n't so they can throw temper tantrums .
Mike Pence , who has a bee in her bonnet these days over everything and is suffering some delusions about running for president , led the kooks and nuts like Steve King ( R - IA ) , Scott Garrett ( R- NJ ) , Marsha Blackburn ( R - TN ) , Jeb Hensarling ( R - TX ) , Paul Broun ( R - GA ) and Jason Chaffetz ( R - UT ) into their latest hissy fit .
An hour and a half later they tried again -- and failed again .
The House then proceeded to vote on 4 nonpartisan bills which all passed unanimously even with the same cockamamie obstructionists afraid to vote against things like a Veterans Affairs outpatient clinic and pilot college work study programs for vets .
What a bunch of losers !
One of the stupidest wastes of time in my daily routine is tracking Pence 's moronic tweets .
As you can see from the screenshot , he 's hysterical about fairness ( as in against it ) and obsessed with kissing up to Limbaugh , Hannity and the rest of the right - wing Noise Machine .
Yep , someone who makes Sarah Palin look almost reasonable and well - informed wants to run for president .
How does someone as clownish and so devoid of admirable qualities like Pence keep getting re-elected , you wonder ?
Must be something in the water back home .
With the Democrats in the House on the verge of passing a landmark health care reform bill that will substantively make life better for millions of American families -- including families in Indiana , of course --
Pence is working overtime to bad - mouth their efforts and sow confusion in his home state .
A more worthless representative would be difficult to find anywhere .
This just came through and we do n't know who yet but I could n't resist passing this on .
We should have a video up tomorrow .
" Apparently a Republican candidate here in Virginia just had a Tea Party event and was caught on video saying ' if we lose at the ballot box , we will have to turn to the bullet box .
'" As promised , here 's the video of Catherine Crabill , a crackpot Republican candidate for the House of Delegates blabbling like a moron at a tea - bagger party about her Second Amendment rights and threatening that if the extreme right - wing does n't get its way electorally they can start shooting people .
Today 's GOP : " We have the chance to fight this battle at the ballot box before we have to resort to the bullet box ...
That 's the beauty of our 2nd Amend rights . "
And do n't think it 's just some lunatic fringe Republican in Virginia .
She sounds very much like the lunatic fringe fave in Florida , Marco Rubio , who is about to abandon his run for the Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate seat and try for the Attorney General slot instead .

Letters From London Jul 8 , 2009 The Present Sound of London
I ’ve been lured to London by money at the hottest , stickiest time of year .
Every time I visit , I ’m struck by the noises — not necessarily their volume , but their strangeness and variety in comparison to the quiet humdrum of the provincial town where I live .
So this time I ’m equipped with an audio recorder .
Waterloo Station
Two camp guys cavort around Waterloo station at eight a.m .
They ’re talking too loudly , invading the personal space of their fellow Londoners , but they do n’t care .
Perhaps aware they ’re setting off a chain of disapproving tuts , they stop and make the best apology they can : disapproving sounds of their own .
Beneath Waterloo Station
You have to pay 30 p ( about 50 cents ) to use the gents at Waterloo .
Not long ago it was 20 p .
Recessions even make catching urine a more expensive business .
Small wonder when they ’re installing Airblade hand driers .
These are the Ferraris of electric hand driers .
They do n’t just blow air , they sculpt it .
Noisily .
The invisible air - sculpted cheese slicer flows over your fingertips , scraping the water from your skin like a barber scrapes beards .
The Waterloo and City Line
Rails in curved tunnels create howling screeches as trains creep along them .
Wind in tunnels howls too ; you hear trains coming a long time before you see them .
The winds prowl the pedestrian tunnel network , looking for a way out to the surface .
They push commuters along , blow dust into their faces and their hair , annoy , distract , and sometimes provide blessed cooling relief from the fierce un-airconditioned heat .
Sometimes .
Beneath the River Thames
Everything ’s a robot down here .
The trains speak to you , explaining where you ’ll be taken .
The doors speak , not in Douglas Adams - style wistful sighs , but in stark nagging beeps : get out of our way , get out of our way , get out of our way or we ’ll close on your limbs .
The beeps are high - pitched , designed to annoy and nag .
They chivvy you on board and they chivvy you off again when your journey ’s done .
Those who stay on board — getting off later — cease to listen until they ’re on the threshold once more , foot above platform .
Some Station Somewhere
Everywhere you go in London , you ’re watched .
Everyone knows this .
Look up and you see cameras .
Anywhere and everywhere .
Does this cut crime ?
Does it make the city safer ?
Do Londoners give a damn ?
It seems not .
Do a small number of people make a living creating voice announcements telling unconcerned Londoners that they ’re being watched ?
Yes .
Bank Station
Chep - chep - chep - chep - chep — out from the Tube and onto the street .
Expecting the roar of traffic , but there ’s nothing like that .
All there is to see while ascending the steps is legs at ground level : a businessman ’s pinstriped pants , a woman ’s unnatural fake tan stretching from expensive shoes to expensive hem .
Park Near City Road
In a small park , office workers eat lunch .
One man paces , his suit jacket over one shoulder and a phone held tight to his ear .
He ’s so angry .
As he speaks — and as the person on the other end presumably cowers and makes excuses — his eyebrows leap up to show they share his concern .
Nearby munchers - of - sandwiches watch him impassively ; it ’s impossible to tell which side of the conversation they ’re on .
Bank of England
The streets of the city are unexpectedly quiet .
There ’s not much traffic on a weekday lunchtime near Bank station .
Most of the workers here arrive and leave by tube and train ; the only cars are those of couriers and taxi drivers and the people who deliver sandwiches to the Square Mile ’s thousands of sandwich stores .
So stand on this corner on this day , right next to a crossroads , and the only sound is a thugga - thugga - thugga of a pneumatic drill churning up chunks of ground .
Probably construction work .
A new sandwich shop , most likely .
The Barbican
A busier street corner .
Waiting for the signal for pedestrians to cross .
One American is showing another American around the city .
He ’s absolutely right , they are about a block or so from the Barbican .
Also nearby is the site of Cripplegate , once an important entrance into the city - that - was , before the city came along and destroyed it all .
All you see now at Cripplegate is office blocks looming on all sides , and the flower boxes covering the sides of the Barbican .
There ’s history here , but it ’s not easy to see .
You have to immerse yourself in some good books , then stand between the offices with your eyes closed , and imagine .
Outside Royal Festival Hall
End of the day , and the terrace outside the Festival Hall on the South Bank is heaving with men in men suits and women in women suits .
Everyone looks smart , and gorgeous .
And rich .
The bar here is popular for lots of reasons : it overlooks the Thames and the rest of the city beyond ; it ’s a glorious place to enjoy the London commuter ’s favorite summer after - work activity — standing in a crowded noisy outdoor spot , drinking lager , and balancing your glass on a tiny handrail .
And it ’s near several major rail stations .
A quick drink after work , then another quick drink after the quick drink , then perhaps one more for the hell of it , then home to the suburbs .
Thugga - thugga - thugga .
Chep - chep - chep .
Chivvy , chivvy , chivvy .
It 's a good start .
Now , bring me cheezburgers .

EUCLID -- Maybe Dorothy Richardson was scared , or maybe she was protecting her flower garden .
Whatever the reason , the 75 - year - old Euclid woman is accused of beating a fawn to death .
Richardson faces charges of animal cruelty from the incident , which occurred June 15 at her home near the Cleveland Metroparks Euclid Creek Reservation .
" Everybody 's very upset over this , " said Euclid Animal Control officer Ann Mills , who requested the warrant .
" This is my first for a beating like that -- it makes you sick to your stomach , you know ? "
Witnesses told Mills that Richardson beat the young deer in the head with a shovel because it was sitting in her flower bed .
None of the witnesses who provided statements to police could be reached for comment Tuesday .
That includes Euclid City Councilman Christopher Gruber .
Tuesday evening , a woman matching Richardson 's description adjusted an automatic sprinkler on her property .
When asked if Richardson was home , the woman offered the business card of Gregory Thomas , a Cleveland attorney .
Thomas did not respond to a call seeking comment .
Neighbors , some who declined to give their names , described Richardson as an amiable woman who tends to her garden .
Some were surprised to hear the details of what she is accused of doing .
" That does n't sound right , " said a neighbor who called Richardson friendly and churchgoing .
" That is just not like her . "
But another neighbor who made a statement to police said that he overheard her discussing the killing with another resident .
" ' I killed it -- I killed it dead , ' " he recalled her saying , because she had worked hard on her plants .
" And I 'd kill it again . "
He said he was sympathetic to the attention the incident created .
Clifford Johnson , another neighbor , said , " She 's scared , she 's 75 , she made a horrible mistake , but it 's gotten to the point where people are calling her and talking about killing her . "
Johnson was listed in the police report under the heading " others involved , " but he could not explain why .
The city 's cruelty to animals charge is a first - degree misdemeanor punishable by up to six months in jail and a $ 1,000 fine .
Euclid Law Director Chris Frey said Tuesday that he plans to add a state cruelty charge , which is a second - degree misdemeanor , to give the judge more sentencing options , considering Richardson 's age .
The state charge is punishable by a maximum 90 days in jail and $ 750 fine .
Frey said he has received dozens of e-mails from across the country urging him to prosecute the case to its fullest .
But some neighbors said that the outrage is overblown and that details of the incident have been exaggerated .
" She shoved it on the shoulder and the deer fell over , " said another neighbor , who has spoken to Richardson and did not want to give her name .
" You have to understand where she comes from -- she 's a country girl . "
Female deer leave their fawns in secluded spots while they forage for food .
The fawns avoid being eaten by predators by remaining still until their mothers return .
Young fawns are still nursing and do not eat flowers and other foliage , Division of Wildlife spokeswoman Jamey Graham said .
Plain Dealer reporter Donna J. Miller contributed to this story .
THIS article will self - erase in 10 seconds .
At least it would if it had been written on a film that exploits the colour - changing ability of nanoparticles .
The technology could make it possible to create documents that wipe themselves clean after they ’ve been read .
A team at Northwestern University in Evanston , Illinois , coated gold nanoparticles with a layer of hair - like molecules called 4-( 11 - mercaptoundecanoxy ) azobenzene or MUA .
When zapped with ultraviolet light , these filaments change their shape and charge distribution , causing the nanoparticles to congregate together and change colour ( see diagram ) .
“ The colour of the nanoparticles depends on how close they are to one another , ” says …
Extreme economic problems require extreme solutions , and Wells Fargo Bank has come up with a good one .
They have decided to sue themselves .
Wells Fargo holds the first and second mortgages on a condominium that is going into foreclosure .
As holder of the first , they are suing all other lien holders , including the holder of the second , which is Wells Fargo .
It gets better .
The company has hired a lawyer to defend itself against its own lawsuit .
The defense lawyer even filed this answer to the complaint , " Defendant admits that it is the owner and holder of a mortgage encumbering the subject real property .
All other allegations of the complaint are denied . "
On the website The Consumer Warning Network , Angie Moreschi wrote : " We 've apparently reached the perfect storm for complete and utter idiocy by some banks trying to foreclose on homes . "
Sony is considering developing a cellphone - game gear hybrid in a bid to better compete with Apple 's iPod and iPhone , the Nikkei business daily said on Saturday .
TOKYO ( Reuters ) - Sony Corp is considering developing a cellphone - game gear hybrid in a bid to better compete with Apple Inc 's highly popular iPod and iPhone , the Nikkei business daily said on Saturday .
The Japanese electronics and entertainment conglomerate launched its first Walkman three decades ago , dominating the portable music player market , but it has been running far behind the iPod and iPhone in recent years .
Sony plans to set up a project team as early as July to develop a new product that combines functions of its portable game player and Sony Ericsson 's mobile phones , the Nikkei said .
Sony Ericsson is a cellphone joint venture between Sony and Sweden 's Ericsson .
A growing number of game - makers including Capcom Co Ltd and Square Enix Holdings are now offering software for the iPod and iPhone to take advantage of the Apple products ' popularity , posing a threat to Sony 's PlayStation Portable and Nintendo Co Ltd's DS .
A Sony spokesman declined to comment on the report .

OLBERMANN : A secret rendezvous , including steamy e-mails , an illicit affair with a married co-worker , a vendetta waged against opposing factions , the crisis of the teenage daughter getting pregnant , engaged and disengaged , and the introduction of an important new character , who turned out to have the intellectual depth of Kenneth the Page .
Of course , I could be outlining the plot of any episode of the " Real Housewives of Orange County " or of Atlanta or of New York or especially of New Jersey .

That list of course in order was Sanford , Ensign , Palin , Palin again and Jindal .

But even as the details involving the wild bull of a pompous , and his Maria , Maria , I`ve just met a girl named Maria , continue to unfold , there is a silver lining .
What is bad news for this quartet of GOP front runners is good news for Willard .

BBC North America Business Correspondent , New Haven , Connecticut
New Haven is a place of contrasts .
On the seashore just a few miles outside the centre of this New England town , you 'll find multi-million dollar properties with stunning views of Long Island Sound .
But in the rundown urban areas it is a landscape of boarded up houses .
The range of properties in the area - from the desirable to the unwanted - makes it a good place to take the pulse of the US housing market .
Some commentators have detected signs of life returning .
But that seems premature .
" What I 'm finding is that sales are dropping off and there 's an increasing supply of the housing inventory , " says Gene Picka , a real estate agent at Remax Alliance in nearby East Haven .
In March they resumed foreclosures .
The cancer has n't gone away .
In fact , it 's further advanced .
New Haven bankruptcy lawyer Neil Crane " In some of the towns I 'm seeing anywhere between one to two years supply of unsold homes . "
The latest figures show that the average selling price of a single family home in Connecticut is $ 227,500 ( £ 139,250 ) , down 13.5 % on a year ago .
That is a slower rate of decline than just a few months back , indicating that prices are bottoming out .
But sales in April were the lowest for that month since 1987 .
A total of 1,528 properties changed hands throughout the state , down 21 % on the same month a year ago .
And foreclosures - repossessions - which had been falling in the early part of the year , have suddenly spiked up again .
In Connecticut , 2,174 homes were foreclosed in April , a rise of 25 % .
Falling behind
Two factors have caused this rise in foreclosures .
The unemployment rate in the US has jumped to over 9 % in the past six months and it is still heading upwards .
It 's tough .
You try not to get too emotional .

This means that millions more homeowners are now unable to afford their mortgage payments .
And lenders have become more aggressive in making repossessions .
" In January and February the banks stopped doing foreclosures for political reasons , " says Neil Crane , a bankruptcy lawyer in New Haven .
" They were being questioned at Congressional hearings in Washington .
It was good PR .
" In March they resumed foreclosures .
There 's now a backlog of defaulted mortgages .
The cancer has n't gone away .
In fact , it 's further advanced . "
Tough times Wayne Parks is being repossessed in a few weeks time .
TAKING THE PULSE OF THE GLOBAL ECONOMY
The BBC is Taking the Pulse of the Global Economy , looking at a range of subjects this summer Food prices - which remain a concern particularly in many developing economies
Highly volatile energy prices - which have been a major issue in the past year
The plight of migrant workers - as the global recession takes hold in many economies Housing markets - which have turned from boom to bust in many countries Rising unemployment levels - as firms cut back because of falling orders
BBC World Food Price Index Taking the Pulse explained
He built his house in nearby Fairfield with his own hands 13 years ago .
But his construction business folded when the property market collapsed .
Wayne has filed for bankruptcy .
The family is now looking for rented accommodation .
" It 's tough , " says Wayne .
" You try not to get too emotional .
But there are memories here and that 's difficult .
" We carved our names in the concrete every time we poured something .
My father passed away here .
" But this is the way it goes .
It 's my fault .
I brought it upon myself .
You have to take the emotion out of it otherwise you 'll go crazy . "
The rise in the number of foreclosures means that many more unsold houses will flood on to the market , postponing any chances of recovery .
What 's more , the interest rates on US Treasury bonds , which determine the rates paid on mortgages , have risen sharply in the past month .
So home loans will become more expensive and difficult to afford .
There are a few parts of the United States where the housing market is looking a bit more active .
But on the evidence of this fairly typical New England state , there is no recovery yet and there wo n't be one for at least the rest of this year .

KABUL ( Reuters ) - Afghan law does not protect rape victims and for too long communities have turned to traditional forms of justice which tend to criminalise victims of a profound problem , the United Nations said on Wednesday .
“ This is an issue that is under - reported and to a significant extent concealed , but it is a huge problem in Afghanistan , ” Norah Niland , the United Nations ’ human rights representative in Afghanistan , told a panel of Afghan women .
A U.N. report , the full version of which is yet to be published , described rape as an everyday occurence .
A summary of the report said that in northern Afghanistan , for example , more than a third of cases analysed showed rapists were directly linked to local leaders who are immune from arrest .
Those likely to commit rape are close family members , men who work in prisons or orphanages and men in powerful positions either in state - run institutions or in armed groups and criminal gangs , it said .
In many communities , shame is attached to a victim of rape rather than the criminal , the report said .
Families will often resort to the traditional and religious practices of “ baad ” and “ zina ” to save face , either by insisting the victim marry the rapist or prosecuting her for sexual relations outside of marriage .
Afghanistan ’s penal code does not explicitly address the crime of rape or define it , something which the government must address urgently , the report said .
Sima Samar , head of Afghanistan ’s Independent Human Rights Commission , said the government had been reluctant to face the problem of rape , a taboo in conservative Muslim Afghanistan , but it should implement a new rape law soon .
“ I have to admit that they are not very receptive ... but we have to resist and change that , ” Samar said .
She said existing laws treat adultery and rape as the same crime .
Samar also said that too much attention had been paid to military efforts in Afghanistan , often at the cost of implementing effective programmes which address the country ’s deep social problems .
The report recommended that traditional community meetings and councils , such as “ jirgas ” or “ shuras ” , should not be used to address rape cases because they do not respect women ’s rights and often lead to baad or zina .
Although the panel consisted of urban , educated Afghan women , Samar said that shuras in rural parts of Afghanistan should be receptive to the report ’s message .
“ It depends who takes that risk and breaks that taboo and silence , ” she said .
WASHINGTON  The Obama administration is considering forgoing legislation and issuing an executive order that would authorize the president to incarcerate some terrorism suspects indefinitely , White House officials said Friday .
Such an order would be controversial  seemingly aligning the administration with a disputed legal doctrine of former President George W. Bush , whose lawyers held that the president had sweeping authority in wartime to imprison those he deemed threats to national security .
Obama officials sought to play down the significance of the discussions by an administration panel , saying that consideration of such an order was still in an early phase and subject to change .
They said that lawyers had not written a specific proposal and that nothing had been submitted to the White House for review by senior officials .
Still , the possibility of the order appeared to reflect increasing frustration within the administration over the difficulties posed by the effort to meet Mr. Obama ’s commitment to close the detention center at Guantánamo Bay , Cuba , by January and the dwindling options for dealing with the detainees before then .
A first - of - its - kind RAND Corporation study has linked the rapid growth in health care costs in the United States with job losses and lower output among industries that commonly provide workers with health insurance .
Researchers examined the economic performance of 38 industries from 1987 through 2005 and compared changes in employment , gross economic output and the value added to the gross domestic product for industries where a large number of workers have employer - sponsored health insurance to those industries where few workers have job - based health insurance .
They found that , after adjusting for other factors , industries where a larger percentage of workers received employer - sponsored health insurance had significantly lower employment growth during the study period than industries where health benefits were less common .
Industries with a larger percentage of workers receiving employer - sponsored health insurance also showed lower growth in their contribution to the gross domestic product over time .
" This study provides some of the first evidence that the rapid rise in health care costs has negative consequences for several U.S. industries , " said Neeraj Sood , the study 's lead author and a senior economist at RAND , a nonprofit research organization .
" Industries where more workers receive employer - sponsored health insurance are hit the hardest by rising health care costs . "
The RAND study , published online by the journal Health Services Research , is the first to attempt to assess the economic impact of " excess " growth in health care costs on U.S. industries .
Excess growth is defined as the increase in health care costs that exceeds the overall growth of the nation 's gross domestic product .
The rapid growth in health care costs and health insurance premiums in the United States over the past two decades has raised concern that the trend is harmful to the nation 's economy .
Many observers argue that rapidly rising health insurance premiums force employers to increase employees ' total compensation , since employers cannot easily reduce wages to completely offset premium increases .
For some employers , explicit contracts such as those with labor unions may preclude wage cuts ; other employers may be prevented from reducing wages by the need to pay competitive wages or a desire to avoid damaging worker morale .
Pressure to increase compensation , in turn , may lead employers to reduce health benefits , cut employment and raise prices , ultimately resulting in lower output and profits .
Industries where large percentages of workers receive employer - sponsored health insurance face more pressure to increase compensation and as a result are more likely to face adverse consequences from health care cost growth , according to the study .
" U.S. employers have limited wage growth and reduced health benefits to deal with rising health insurance premiums , but such strategies have not completely offset the growing burden of health care costs , " said study co-author Dr. José J. Escarce , a RAND researcher and a professor at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA .
" Job losses and worse economic performance have been the additional consequences for industries that provide insurance to most of their workers . "
While some worry that the growth in spending on health care is bad for the nation 's economy , others argue that it causes no fundamental harm because more people become employed in the health care industry as such spending grows .
" Of course , health care cost growth increases employment in health care , but other industries face job losses as a consequence "
Sood said .
RAND researchers underscore that their findings do not necessarily mean that rapid growth in health care costs results in large job losses in the overall economy , since losses in industries that provide a high proportion of their workers with employer - sponsored insurance are likely to be at least partially offset by gains in industries that provide a low proportion of their workers with insurance .
" Nonetheless , our findings clearly show that the rapid rise in health care costs has a measurable impact on many industries , and that it leads to a redistribution of workers from industries that provide insurance to their workers , such as manufacturing , to those that do not provide insurance , " Escarce said .
Researchers also point out that their study does not assess the relative impact on the overall economy of the employer - based system of health insurance in the U.S. compared with alternative approaches to financing and providing health insurance , such as the public system in Canada .
Rather , what the study demonstrates is that the employer - sponsored system hurts the economic performance of some industries more than others .

I do n’t normally catch Robot Chicken , but since it was airing a new episode last night and I was still riding the high from their awesome Star Wars : Episode II DVD ( giveaway in progress until this Wednesday ! ) , I flipped it on .
Then there was a skit that I was really , really shocked I ’d never heard of before , especially from Wil Wheaton via Twitter .
In this skit , the writing for the third season of Star Trek : The Next Generation is about to begin , and they acknowledge the fan backlash over Wil ’s character , Wesley Crusher .
How to “ fix ” the problem ?
Well , you just go and watch and find out .
Incidentally ,
Wil says he did n’t lend the voice for the character in this skit but would have gladly done so if asked .

Sarnia residents are planning a cheeky protest against an American electronic systems provider that 's testing its newest technology – an 18 - metre- long balloon equipped with a surveillance camera – on their city from across the border .
The event , " Moon the Balloon , " is scheduled for 5 p.m. on Aug. 15 in Sarnia 's Centennial Park .
Any Canadian with two cheeks and a sense of outrage is invited to join in .
The surveillance technology is being tested by Sierra Nevada Corp. in Port Huron , Mich. , across the St. Clair River from Sarnia .
" The balloon is a clear violation of our privacy and our sovereignty , " said Sarnia Mayor Mike Bradley , who , though he wo n't be taking part in the protest , believes " greatly in freedom of speech and freedom of expression . "
Bradley , who plans to take his fight to the federal government , said the balloon 's camera is capable of reading the name on a boat 14 kilometres away .
" I 've talked to a retired major general who 's the leader on the project .
He does n't understand that we would see this as invasion of privacy .
He just does n't get it . "
The retired major general in question , Mark Lott , did not return numerous phone calls yesterday .
Nor did a Sierra Nevada spokesperson .
Jerry Sweet , 40 , who grew up in Sarnia but lives in Yellowknife plans to attend the protest if not in body , then in spirit – and on paper .
" I have a couple of friends from Sarnia who live in northern B.C.
We 're going to get together and take some pictures , put them on a banner and ship it down to Sarnia so one of my relatives can moon for us by proxy , " said Sweet .
" It 's invasive ... just setting up a big camera and peering into Canada .
And ... kind of rude . "
Unlike mass mooning .
That 's typically polite Canadian behaviour .

Mangelhafte Organisation und bürokratische Abläufe beim Bundeskriminalamt ( BKA ) behindern den Kampf gegen kinderpornographische Inhalte im Internet .
Diesen Skandal hat jetzt eine Äußerung der Parlamentarischen Geschäftsführerin der CDU / CSU - Fraktion , Martina Krogmann , in einem Beitrag auf der Internet - Plattform abgeordnetenwatch .de zutage gefördert . [ 1 ]
Bekannte Webseiten mit Darstellungen von Kindesmissbrauch würden nicht kurzfristig gelöscht , weil Hinweise auf dem Dienstweg versanden , so die Berichterstatterin der CDU / CSU für den umstrittenen Gesetzentwurf zur Einrichtung von Internet - Sperren in Deutschland .
Sie bestätigt damit indirekt die Ergebnisse einer jüngst bekannt gewordenen Studie der Universität Cambridge , nach der kinderpornographische Webseiten wesentlich länger im Netz verbleiben als andere illegale Inhalte .
Krogmann zufolge können solche Seiten bei Hosting - Anbietern im Ausland nicht gelöscht werden , weil das BKA entsprechende Hinweise zunächst auf dem internationalen Dienstweg an die ausländischen Polizeibehörden weiterleitet , anstatt direkt die Provider zu benachrichtigen .
Hiermit wolle das BKA Rücksicht auf die Befindlichkeiten ausländischer Behörden nehmen .
Wörtlich erklärte Krogmann in der Antwort bei Abgeordnetenwatch : Das BKA " informiert die jeweiligen Polizeibehörden über die dafür vorgesehenen internationalen Organisationen .
Dieser
Weg nimmt einige Zeit in Anspruch .
Da die fraglichen Seiten oft nur einige Tage ihre Domain behalten , ist die Seite schon weitergewandert . "
Die Einhaltung des Dienstweges , so Krogmann weiter , rechtfertige das BKA mit der " Achtung vor der Souveränität der Staaten " .
Deutsche Provider zeigen sich auf Nachfrage verwundert über diese Aussagen .
" Wenn ausländische Behörden uns über strafbare Inhalte auf unseren Servern informieren , prüfen wir das genauso wie entsprechende Meldungen aus anderen Quellen " , erklärt Andreas Maurer , Pressesprecher beim Webhoster 1&1 .
" Und dann nehmen wir die Inhalte vom Netz und erstatten gegebenenfalls selbst Strafanzeige bei den deutschen Behörden .
Erst recht bei Kinderpornographie ! "
Für den Arbeitskreis gegen Internet - Sperren und Zensur sind die Aussagen der Unionspolitikerin unfassbar .
" Offenbar sind für das BKA bürokratische Abläufe ein höheres Gut als die Menschenwürde missbrauchter Kinder " , erklärt Alvar Freude , Mitgründer des AK Zensur .
" Löschen statt Sperren ist möglich , aber der ' Dienstweg ' soll dem entgegen stehen ? "
Die Äußerungen von Frau Krogmann erklären zugleich die Ergebnisse einer Studie der Universität Cambridge . [ 2 ]
Demnach sind Banken im Kampf gegen strafbare Inhalte im Netz wesentlich effektiver .
Betrügerische Webseiten , mit denen Kontodaten von Bankkunden ausgespäht werden sollen - so genannte " Phishing " - Seiten - , werden durchschnittlich binnen vier Stunden vom Netz genommen .
Kinderpornographische Webseiten werden dagegen erst nach durchschnittlich 30 Tagen gelöscht , wie die Wissenschaftler Tyler Moore und Richard Clayton der Universität Cambridge in ihrer Studie festgestellt haben .
Dabei existieren schon heute Alternativen zu den ineffizienten Behörden - Dienstwegen .
So kontaktiert etwa das von der EU initiierte internationale Netzwerk INHOPE direkt die Provider , damit kinderpornographische Inhalte an der Quelle gelöscht und Beweise zur Ergreifung der Täter gesichert werden .
Auch der AK Zensur hat mit unbürokratischen Hinweisen erfolgreich zahlreiche kinderpornographische Webseiten abschalten lassen . [ 3 ]
Werden dagegen Internet - Sperren eingesetzt , versagen diese Mechanismen .
Die illegalen Inhalte bleiben weiter im Netz , die Betreiber werden vorgewarnt und der Missbrauch unschuldiger Kinder fortgesetzt .
" Die Befürworter der Netzsperren stellen sich ein Armutszeugnis aus " , zeigt sich die Initiatorin der Petition gegen Internetzensur [ 4 ] , Franziska Heine , empört .
" Frau von der Leyen bekämpft Probleme , die hinter ihrem Rücken das BKA selbst verursacht .
Der Kampf gegen Kinderpornographie im Internet sollte mit mehr Sachkenntnis , Ernsthaftigkeit und wahrem Engagement geführt werden - das sind wir den Missbrauchsopfern schuldig ! "

Über den Arbeitskreis gegen Internet - Sperren ( AK Zensur ) :
Der Arbeitskreis gegen Internetsperren und Zensur ( AK Zensur ) spricht sich gegen die von der Bundesregierung geplanten Internetsperren aus und fordert eine effektive Bekämpfung von Kindesmissbrauch anstatt einer Symbolpolitik , die nur das Wegschauen fördert , den Opfern nicht hilft und dafür eine Infrastruktur einrichtet , die Grundrechte der Allgemeinheit einschränkt .
Er koordiniert die Arbeit der Sperrgegner , freut sich aber gleichzeitig über die vielen Aktivitäten , die dezentral on - und offline stattfinden .
Dem AK Zensur gehören unter anderem an : der Antispam e.V. , der Chaos Computer Club , der FoeBuD e.V , der Förderverein Informationstechnik und Gesellschaft e.V. ( FITUG ) , das Forum InformatikerInnen für Frieden und gesellschaftliche Verantwortung e.V. ( FIfF ) , die Missbrauchs Opfer gegen InternetSperren ( MOGIS ) , netzpolitik.org , ODEM.org , Spreeblick , der Trotz Allem e.V. und zahlreiche Einzelpersonen .

Joseph Gordon - Levitt is speaking with the zeal of a missionary .
“ Most love stories that are told in Hollywood are just bullshit , and everyone knows it , ” declares the star of the upcoming indie romance 500 Days of Summer , opening July 17 .
“ You go there expecting to be sold a bill of goods that you know is wrong .
And sometimes you go anyway , like if a girl drags you or something … ”
Bridezillas , shopaholics , bromances , Matthew McConaughey , the formulaic rom-com — the 28 - year - old actor bemoans these cynical tools of an older , more disconnected generation .
Gordon - Levitt ’s mission ?
To promote romance we can believe in !
To bring hope to the cineplex !
“ The traditional Hollywood sentiment is contempt for the audience .
I ’ve heard executives say , ‘ Audiences are stupid , kids are stupid , ’ but that ’s not going to fly anymore , ” says the actor , who wore a bright - red Obama T - shirt to Sundance , where the film premiered the week of the inauguration .
“ I think Obama is great evidence of that .
This is maybe a sort of pretentious parallel to draw , but it ’s the same with how love stories are told in movies .
500 Days of Summer would n’t have made sense in our parents ’ generation .
It reminds me so much of 2009 . ”
Joseph Gordon - Levitt is intense .
You may have noticed .
The word intense figures in virtually every conversation about the guy :
His 500 Days director , Marc Webb , originally worried he’d be too intense for a romantic lead in a film where “ there ’s whimsy !
And there ’s fucking dances ! ”
And if you consider the actor ’s fiercely focused and critically praised roles — the hyperverbal high - school detective in Brick ; the brain - damaged bank robber in The Lookout ; the oddly innocent male prostitute in Mysterious Skin — you might worry too .
But ultimately , Webb revised his opinion : “ The intensity , I think , is just thoughtfulness . ”
Gordon - Levitt is actually “ intensely relatable , ” says Webb , which is essential to the success of 500 Days of Summer .
Webb , a music - video director , has packed his flashy big - screen debut with gimmicks — split screens , title cards , and the aforementioned dance number .
What prevents the gimmicks from becoming , well , just gimmicky is Gordon - Levitt ’s dead - on , Everyguy performance and Webb ’s disarming conceit .
At the outset , the audience is warned :
There will be no happy ending for twentysomething office boy Tom ( Gordon - Levitt ) .
He will have his heart broken in 500 days by his new co-worker , a girl named Summer ( Zooey Deschanel ) .
No matter how much they both love the Smiths , or how convinced Tom is that Summer will save him from himself , they are doomed .
“ Summer is n’t just a girl , she ’s like a phase of your life , ” Webb says .
“ A lot of romantic comedies are loyal to a form rather than to people ’s experiences — but the writers and Joe and Zooey and I all have had one of those these weird , ambiguous relationships that happen in your twenties , when love dodges our expectations . ”
“ You see this guy onscreen , and you say , ‘ Aw , fuck , man , I know exactly what this feels like ! ’ ” Gordon - Levitt says , speaking in his characteristic rush .
“ Sooo many people !
Over and over again this is what I hear — and I love hearing it , people saying , ‘ God , you got it !
That ’s exactly what I went through .
That so exactly reminded me of my past !’
And that ’s what we wanted . ”
Deschanel is a longtime friend of Gordon - Levitt’s .
She ’s familiar with his fervency , fond of it , and says this is nothing — he has “ relaxed a little over the years . ”
When they met , nearly a decade ago , “ Joe was really , really burned out .
He ’d spent all his high - school years working — and you ca n’t reduce a person to a type , really , without it being sort of hard to take . ”
Gordon - Levitt was born in L.A. , and by age 15 he was an experienced vet of TV movies and sitcoms — until his six - year stint on Third Rock From the Sun threatened to turn him into a teen idol .
He once complained about the “ Fascist cult of celebrity . ”
Today he attributes his bitterness to immaturity .
Fame made him “ selfish , ” he says .
“ I was a kid . ”
He quit acting and California at age 20 , moved to Harlem , studied French literature at Columbia , and eventually started over , on his own terms .
“ I began to care more , ” he says .
“ I was asking , ‘ How do I connect in a meaningful way ? ’
Oh , right — you do that thing that you already know how to do , but you do n’t just do it for yourself … ”
When Gordon - Levitt got back into acting , he went to some dark places — as far from broad comedy as he could get .
“ I play these characters , this guy who ’s been to Iraq [ in Stop - Loss ] or this dude who ’s been in a car accident , horrible circumstances , ” he says .
“ I ’ve never been to a war , but I do know what being brokenhearted is like , and it feels pretty fucking bad .
I wanted that feeling to be there in earnest . ”

In 500 Days , he gets to play his first romantic lead .
Gordon - Levitt is such a die - hard romantic you wonder why it took so long .
Online , at HitRecord.org , his scrappy website for fans and artists , his sign - off in blog posts and videos is “ Again by heart . ”
As he explains it , “ Cord is the ancient word for ‘ heart , ’ so record is just a translation : ‘ Again by heart . ’ ”
But it also implies repetition , one of the actor ’s nagging obsessions .
For a long time after Third Rock , Gordon - Levitt worried about getting stuck in a rut .
Lately , though , he ’s embraced the pluses of doing things over and over — “ the way your heart beats , ” he says .
“ That ’s what life is : repetitive routines .
It ’s a matter of finding the balance between deviating from those patterns and knowing when to repeat them . ”
“ Joe is n’t interested in the same things that interest other young actors , ” says Deschanel , something his website ( a collection of writing , songs , video diaries , and recordings of users ’ poems ) supports .
“ That ’s where he gets his joy , ” Webb says , “ not from parties . ”
( For a glimpse of Gordon - Levitt ’s attitude about the Hollywood scene , Google the title of his short film about paparazzi , Pictures of Assholes . )
More unexpectedly , he fell in love with the Russian clown extravaganza Slava ’s Snowshow in 2004 , watching dozens of shows , night after night , before signing on as a producer for its New York run and , later , studying clowning himself .
But Gordon - Levitt is fully cognizant of Hollywood Career 101 : This summer , in addition to 500 Days , he ’ll be starring as the evil Cobra Commander in his first studio tent pole , G.I. Joe : The Rise of the Cobra — albeit with “ so much makeup you can hardly tell it ’s me . ”
( In other words , if it flops , it wo n’t hurt . )
And he ’s got a nice balance of indie and mainstream lined up again in 2010 :
The low - budget drama Hesher , co-starring Natalie Portman , and the thriller Inception , Christopher Nolan ’s follow - up to The Dark Knight .
In the end , it turns out the repetition that obsesses Gordon - Levitt most is shooting a scene .
“ It ’s a very ritualized practice : First they say ‘ rolling ’ and then they say ‘ speed ’ and then they say ‘ marker , ’ and they clap the marker , then the camera says ‘ set , ’ then the director says ‘ action , ’ ” recites the actor , as if intoning a poem .
“ I ’ve heard that sequence of words ever since I was 6 years old .
It ’s powerful .
I need that . ”

NASA began the first round of job layoffs today as the space agency prepares to retire its fleet of space shuttles .
160 people were notified today their jobs were being cut , the first of 900 jobs that will evaporate in the next five months .
The first wave of layoffs will affect Lockheed Martin and ATK
Thiokol , contractors that support the shuttle program building fuel tanks and rocket boosters in Louisiana and Utah .
The shuttle program employs about 1,600 NASA civil servants across the space agency and 13,800 contractors around the country .
Once the shuttle stops flying , as many as 6,500 jobs could be cut at the Kennedy Space Center alone .
NASA announced the first round of layoffs at a briefing Thursday , where they also announced the launch date for the Hubble Telescope repair mission as May 11 , a day earlier than previously planned .
Making the two divergent announcements at the same news conference was bittersweet .
Officials at the briefing stressed that without an infusion of money in 2010 — for which a detailed budget is expected to be released next week — they had no choice but to continue the gradual shutdown of shuttle operations .
Shuttle program manager John Shannon said several hundred jobs will be lost to attrition and some employees will transfer to other contractors or projects .
The rest will be layoffs .
“ Only if we were directed to fly additional missions would we halt that activity , ” Shannon said .
Bill Gerstenmaier , associate administrator for space operations , said that if $ 2.5 billion proposed recently by Congress budget planners materialized , it could allow a few shuttles to fly past the 2010 retirement date if some shuttle flights got delayed and NASA were unable to complete the construction of the international space station .
He added that , although the shuttle program ’s plans were clear , it was less certain how quickly jobs would ramp up for the shuttle ’s replacement , the Ares I rocket and Orion capsule .
The first launch of Ares I and Orion is planned for March 2015 , but that date is not certain .

Apple rightly has a reputation for making quality gear .
The company does n’t make junk that breaks down in a few months , or even years .
Or even 20 years .
MacMedics , a repair shop in Millersville , Maryland , recently serviced a Macintosh IIci , which was on the blink after two decades of faithful service .
Introduced in September 1989 , the Mac IIci is one of the most popular early Macs .
It was the first to have built - in color video , three Nubus expansion slots , and a 40 or 80 MB hard disk .
It originally sold for $ 6,700 .
The machine was putting up funny patterns on the monitor .
The client thought it was the screen , but it was actually the main logic board .
He ’d been using the machine for 20 years — 20 years ! — and had no interest in upgrading to a modern Mac .
PowerMac 5200 ( circa 1995 ) .
The 5200 features a blazing fast 75 MHz PowerPC chip , a whopping 8 MB of RAM , and a 500 MB hard drive .
It comes in an attractive , all - in - one beige case that includes a 15 ″ color monitor .
MacMedics had to rescue the customer ’s data .
He ’d not performed one backup in two decades .
And here ’s the best part , he had only 2.2 MB of data to rescue .
“ Here ’s a tip , ” says MacMedics .
“ Do n’t wait 20 years to make a back up . ”
In the first part of this article , we focused on 5 traps that hinder our ability to think rationally .
As a quick recap , we discussed :
The Anchoring Trap : Over -Relying on First Thoughts The Status Quo Trap : Keeping on Keeping On The Sunk Cost Trap : Protecting Earlier Choices The Confirmation Trap : Seeing What You Want to See The Incomplete Information Trap : Review Your Assumptions
Now it ’s time to complete the list and expose the remaining 5 dangerous traps to be avoided .
Let ’s dive right in .
6. The Conformity Trap : Everybody Else Is Doing It
In a series of experiments , researchers asked students in a classroom a series of very simple questions and , sure enough , most of them got the answers right .
In another group , they asked the same questions but this time there were actors posing as students , purposefully pushing wrong answers .
This time around , many more students provided wrong answers based on the leads from the researchers ’ assistants .
This “ herd instinct ” exists — to different degrees — in all of us .
Even if we hate to admit it , other people ’s actions do heavily influence ours .
We fear looking dumb : failing along with many people is frequently not considered a big deal , but when we fail alone we must take all the heat ourselves .
There ’s always peer pressure to adopt the behaviors of the groups we ’re in .
This tendency to conform is notoriously exploited in advertising .
Businesses often sell us products not based on their features , but by showing how popular they are : since others are buying it in droves , why would we not join them ?
Conformity is also one of the main reasons why once a book makes into a well - known best - sellers list , it tends to “ lock in ” and continue there for a long time .
People like to consume what “ everybody else ” is consuming .
What can you do about it ?
Discount the influence of others .
When analyzing information , shield yourself from others ’ opinions — at least at first .
This is the best way to decide without being subconsciously swayed by popular opinions .

This is the best way to decide without being subconsciously swayed by popular opinions .
Beware “ social proof ” .
Always raise a flag when someone tries to convince you arguing primarily on the popularity of a choice , instead of on its merit .

Be courageous .
Be willing to overcome obstacles and defend your viewpoints , despite their unpopularity .
Do n’t be afraid to point out that the Emperor wears no clothes .
7. The Illusion of Control Trap : Shooting in the Dark
Have you noticed that the vast majority of lotto players pick their own numbers instead of using the sometimes available ‘ auto - pick ’ option ( where the point of sales terminal chooses the numbers for you ) ?
We all know that however the numbers are chosen does n’t change the chance of winning , so why the strong preference for picking our own numbers ?
Curiously , even in situations we clearly can’t control , we still tend to irrationally believe that we can somehow influence results .
We just love to feel in control .
Of course , it ’s always easier to illustrate this trap with chance games , but the tendency to overestimate our personal control of events influences every aspect of our daily lives .
Unfortunately , contrary to the lottery example above , the outcomes of our decisions are usually complex and interconnected .
It ’s hard to assess to what extent we ’re responsible for the results we get .
While some of the outcomes can be traced back to our own choices , a part of them will surely remain just as well out of our direct control .
What can you do about it ?
Understand that randomness is part and parcel of life .
Although it may be hard to fathom or even admit it , some things are just random — in the sense that they do n’t depend on your effort at all .
Accept responsibility for the things you can influence , but know that for many others there is not much you can do .
Better than assuming or expecting that every event is under your control is to consciously choose how you respond to them .

Accept responsibility for the things you can influence , but know that for many others there is not much you can do .
Better than assuming or expecting that every event is under your control is to consciously choose how you respond to them .
Beware of superstitions .
Consider how much of your decisions are based on things you cannot really explain .
Make those unknowns explicit and put them under scrutiny — instead of pretending you can control them .
8. The Coincidence Trap : We Suck at Probabilities
John Riley is a legend .
He won a one - in - a - million - chance lottery … twice !
That makes it a 1 - in - a- trillion event — which means that the lottery is rigged or maybe John must have been singled out by Lady Luck , right ?
Well , not really .
Let ’s try a little math :
If , throughout the years , 1000 lottery winners keep playing at least 100 times attempting the “ miracle ” of winning it once more , that adds up to a non-negligible chance of 10 % that someone will make it .
This means that the “ miracle ” is not only possible but — given enough attempts — its likelihood increases to a point of becoming almost inevitable .
Another classic example : it takes a group of just 23 people to make it more likely than not that two of them share the same birthday ( day and month ) .
That ’s how unintuitive probabilities are .
What can you do about it ?
Do n’t over - rely on gut estimates .
While useful many times , gut estimates will sometimes be way off the mark .
Make sure you properly discount their importance or that you understand the ramifications of trusting them .

Make sure you properly discount their importance or that you understand the ramifications of trusting them .
Beware of “ after the fact ” probabilities .
One thing is the probability of someone having won the lottery twice — looking at it in retrospect .
Another completely different thing is that a particular person — chosen before the outcome — wins it : that would indeed qualify as a one - in - a - trillion event — and would make anyone seriously doubt the legitimacy of that lottery .
9 . The Recall Trap : Not All Memories Are Created Equal
What ’s your best guess for the probability of a randomly selected flight ending in a fatal crash ?
While many people grossly overestimate it , MIT studies show that in reality these fatal accidents happen at a rate of only 1 in 10,000,000 .
The fact that people suck at estimating probabilities explains only partially this tendency to mis-estimate : if you ask the same question right after a major airplane accident , be prepared for even more biased assessments .
What happens is we analyze information based on experience , on what we can remember from it .
Because of that , we ’re overly influenced by events that stand out from others , such as those with highly dramatic impact or very recent ones .
The more “ special ” an event is , the greater the potential to distort our thinking .
Of course , no one ever bothers about the other 9,999,999 planes that arrive safely at their destinations — so there ’s nothing more natural than forgetting about them .
What can you do about it ?
Get hard data .
As usual , do n’t rely on your memory if you do n’t have to .
Use it , of course , but always endeavor to find data that confirms or discounts your recollection as soon as possible .

Use it , of course , but always endeavor to find data that confirms or discounts your recollection as soon as possible .
Be aware of your emotions .
When analyzing information , try to emotionally isolate yourself from it , at least temporarily .
If you ’re analyzing an event , pretend it happened a long time ago or that it happened to someone else unrelated to you .
Likewise , if asking for opinions , find people who are not emotionally involved with them or their consequences .

Beware the media .
The media is notorious for exaggerating the importance of certain events while conveniently neglecting others .
Always evaluate information on its relevance and accuracy , and not on how much exposure it gets .
10 . The Superiority Trap : The Average is Above Average
A study surveyed drivers asking them to compare their driving skills to other people in the experiment .
Almost all the participants ( 93 % ! ) rated themselves as ‘ above average ’ .
With few exceptions , people have much inflated views of themselves .
They overestimate their skills and capabilities , leading to many errors in judgment .
And this is the reason I decided to close this article with this particular thinking trap .
After making ourselves aware of these many thinking traps , we may now become susceptible to falling into a new one : the belief that we ’re now immune to them .
Of course , the first step to avoid thinking traps is awareness and constant vigilance , but beware : it ’s much , much easier to notice others falling into these traps than us .
What can you do about it ?
Be humble .
Always remember that everyone has blind spots ( yes , that includes me and you ) !
Always remember that everyone has blind spots ( yes , that includes me and you ) !
Surround yourself with honest people .
If we all have blind spots , nothing better than having honest people around us to point them out to us .
If we all have blind spots , nothing better than having honest people around us to point them out to us .
Do n’t go overboard .
These ‘ thinking traps ’ are inherent parts of us : they make us human .
Applying rigor and rational thinking to our decisions is important , but that does n’t mean that intuition has completely lost its place .
Do n’t get me wrong : I still think that knowing about our own thinking traps is very useful — just do n’t get too worked up about them .
Further Resources
These ten thinking traps barely scratch the surface when it comes to how our thinking can be biased .
Wikipedia ’s list of cognitive biases has more than 100 of these traps , making it a hard - to - beat starting point for further learning .
The references for the studies that back up the data in this article can be found on the respective articles on Wikipedia , as well as on the book Smart Choices .
That ’s a marvelous book about decision making , and one which I highly recommend .
Another great book to check out is Thomas Gilovich ’s How We Know What Is n’t So .
I hope you enjoyed the article .
And just in case you missed it , here ’s part 1 , where you can find the first 5 thinking traps we started with .

Only Fools and Horses first appeared on BBC One in 1981 Only Fools and Horses wide - boy Derek Trotter is returning to BBC
One in a comedy drama about his teenage years .
Sex , Drugs and Rock ' n '
Chips , set in 1960 and written by Only Fools scribe John Sullivan , will also focus on Del 's " tarty " mother , Joan , and father , Reg.
Sullivan said it would give viewers an insight " into why Del and Rodney turned out they way they did " .
Filming for the one - off 90 - minute show , which will be shown next year , will start on location in London in August .
The Trotter brothers , Del - played by David Jason - and Rodney - played by Nicholas Lyndhurst - first hit television screens in 1981 .
Dodgy Del Boy , whose catchphrases including " you plonker ! " and " lovely jubbly " , is one of the UK 's best loved TV characters - with Only Fools and Horse consistently topping the polls for best comedy programmes .
' Ruffled feathers ' Sullivan said the new show would be " set in the real 60s , before The Beatles and Mary Quant made London the coolest place on the planet " .
Seven series and 19 Christmas specials were made " The drama will feature South London at its least glamorous , where money was scarce , the staple diet was rock salmon and chips , and the flicks offer the only hint of glamour , " he said .
The BBC said that , while the Trotter family had not yet moved into their flat in Nelson Mandela House , other familiar settings , including the Nag 's Head , would appear .
The plot will revolve around the release of safe cracker Freddie Robdal from prison after serving a 10 - year sentence which will " ruffle some feathers in the Trotter household " .
A teenage Trigger will also appear in the show , as well as Boycie and Denzel .
BBC head of comedy Mark Freeland said the prospect of " once upon a time in Peckham " was " incredibly tantalising " .
" Nearly 30 years since Only Fools And Horses hit our screens , now we 'll have the chance to see the vivid , bittersweet drama that underpinned the iconic series , " he said .
Meanwhile , the BBC has also announced that the classic children 's book Just William is to be made into a Sunday afternoon TV series on BBC One .

On March 4 , 2008 , I wrote an article on this blog entitled " Are the Police Allowed to Lie to Get You to Confess ? "
I answered that question by saying , " [ Y ]es , the police are allowed to lie to you to get you to confess .
The law in Florida is that the use of tricks or factual misstatements by the police do not by themselves make a confession involuntary . "
Although that was a correct statement of the law , there are , nevertheless , interrogation techniques which the police are not allowed to use in obtaining evidence from a suspect .
For example , in the case of State of Florida v. McCord , a Detective Cahir focused his attention on a person named Foskie McCord as being a possible suspect in several armed robberies in Palm Beach County , Florida .
While McCord was in jail on unrelated charges , Cahir met with him , gave him Miranda warnings , and told McCord that he was a suspect in a rape case .
He also convinced McCord to provide him with a DNA sample by telling him that such evidence would prove whether or not he committed the rape .
The problem with all of this was that there was no rape !
Cahir made that up in order to trick McCord into giving him a DNA sample so that he could compare that sample with a sample of DNA that was found at the scene of one of the robberies .
In addition , Cahir never mentioned to McCord that he was a suspect in any armed robberies .
After McCord was charged in the robbery cases , he filed a motion to suppress the DNA evidence on the ground that his consent was involuntary and obtained in violation of his due process rights because Cahir used deceitful tactics to acquire it .
The trial judge who head the motion agreed with McCord and suppressed the DNA evidence .
However , the State Attorney ’s Office appealed the judge ’s decision to Florida ’s Fourth District Court of Appeal–which also agreed with McCord and suppressed the DNA evidence !
The Fourth District Court began its analysis by noting that in the case of Schneckloth v. Bustamonte the United States Supreme Court stated that a warrantless search does not violate the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution if the search is conducted pursuant to a freely and voluntarily - given consent .
However , said the Fourth District Court , such consent can be rendered involuntary if an interrogating officer makes misrepresentations regarding the nature of the investigation .
The Court also observed that insofar as confessions are concerned , " the use of police trickery may result in the exclusion of the confession depending upon the level of trickery employed . "
According to the Fourth District , a " critical factor " in Mr. McCord ’s case was whether Cahir ’s deception undermined the voluntariness of McCord ’s consent .
In concluding that Cahir ’s deception did indeed undermine the voluntariness of McCord ’s consent , the appeals court found it particularly troubling that the detective made up the rape charge in order to obtain McCord ’s DNA .
The Court distinguished this case from those cases cited by the Attorney General ’s Office in which the police used trickery but did not make up stories about nonexistent crimes .
Fox News is running an alarmist story today under the outrageous headline , “ Marijuana Not Only Gets You High , It Damages Your DNA . ”
The ‘ news ’ story , which several other mainstream media outlets are also promoting , is based on a new British study assessing the effects of , ahem , “ calf thymus DNA treated in vitro ( in a Petri dish ) … with the smoke generated from 1 , 5 , and 10 cannabis cigarettes . ”
Yes , really .
So how did Fox “ We report , you decide ” News summarize this non-story ?
Let ’s take a look .
What Fox News reported : “ Smoking marijuana not only gets you high , but it also alters your DNA . ”
What the study actually said : “ [ T ] hese results provide evidence for the DNA damaging potential of cannabis smoke , implying that the consumption of cannabis cigarettes may be detrimental to human health with the possibility to initiate cancer development . ”
What Fox News reported : “ There have been many studies on the toxicity of tobacco smoke , ” researcher Rajinder Singh said in a news release .
“ Cannabis in contrast has not been so well studied . ”
What Fox News did n’t report : From the March 2009 issue of the scientific journal Medicinal Research Reviews , “ Research on the chemistry and pharmacology of cannabinoids and endocannabinoids has reached enormous proportions .
…
[ A ] pproximately 15,000 articles on Cannabis sativa L. and cannabinoids and over 2,000 articles on endocannabinoids ( are available in the scientific literature ) . ”
What Fox News reported : “ Singh said cannabis smoke contains 400 compounds including 60 cannabinoids .
It also contains 50 percent more carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons including naphthalene , benzanthracene , and benzopyrene , than tobacco smoke , Singh added . ”
What Fox News did n’t report : From the November 2007 issue of the scientific journal Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics , “ Vaporization of marijuana does not result in exposure to combustion gases , … and [ was ] preferred by most subjects compared to marijuana cigarettes .
…
The Volcano [ vaporizer ] device is an effective and apparently safe vehicle for THC delivery , and warrants further investigation in clinical trials of cannabis for medical purposes . ”
What Fox News reported : “ ‘ The smoking of 3 - 4 cannabis cigarettes a day is associated with the same degree of damage to bronchial mucus membranes as 20 or more tobacco cigarettes a day , ’ the team wrote in the journal . ”
Except for the fact that it is n’t .
In fact , here ’s what Donald Tashkin of the UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine , Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine , had to say about the subject earlier this month in an interview with the McClatchy newspaper chain .
(** Note : Dr. Tashkin has performed US - government sponsored studies of marijuana and lung function for over 30 years and is considered to be the United States ’ — if not the world ’s — foremost expert on the subject . )
“ What we found instead was no association ( between marijuana smoking and cancer ) and even a suggestion of some protective ( anti- cancer ) effect . …
Early on , when our research appeared as if there would be a negative impact on lung health , I was opposed to legalization because I thought it would lead to increased use and that would lead to increased health effects .
But at this point , I ’d be in favor of legalization ( of marijuana ) .
I would n’t encourage anybody to smoke any substances .
But I do n’t think it should be stigmatized as an illegal substance .
Tobacco smoking causes far more harm .
And in terms of an intoxicant , alcohol causes far more harm . ”
Just for the record , in 2006 , Tashkin led the largest population case - control study ( yes , Dr. Tashkin actually performed research on humans , not ‘ calf thymus DNA ’ ) ever to assess the use of marijuana and lung cancer risk .
The study , which included more than 2,200 subjects ( 1,212 cases and 1,040 controls ) , reported that marijuana smoking was not positively associated with cancers of the lung or upper aerodigestive tract – even among individuals who reported smoking more than 22,000 joints during their lifetime .
Let the folks at Fox put that in their pipe and smoke it .

A costly gesture : Mr Pinho's " cuckold " insult lost him his job
Portugal 's Economy Minister Manuel Pinho has resigned after making a rude cuckold gesture at an opposition MP .
Mr Pinho placed his index fingers on his head , imitating horns .
The gesture was directed at Bernandino Soares , leader of the Communist parliamentary group , who had challenged the government about a mine 's future .
Mr Pinho 's action came during a state - of - the - nation debate in parliament .
The Socialist PM , Jose Socrates , said " nothing justifies this gesture " .
" This was just an episode .
One that should n't have happened and that affects the government 's image , but which has now been corrected this way [ with Mr Pinho 's resignation ] , " he said .
Traditionally the horns signify a man whose wife is unfaithful .
Mr Pinho had been questioned about his handling of talks at the troubled Aljustrel zinc mine in the south of Portugal .
Finance Minister Fernando Teixeira dos Santos will take on his portfolio temporarily , until the general election on 27 September .
Don Ayala – the U.S. Army contractor who pleaded guilty to a revenge killing in Afghanistan – wo n't be going to prison .
Instead , U.S. District Court Judge Claude Hilton sentenced Ayala , a member of the Army 's Human Terrain social science project , to five years probation and a $ 12,500 fine .
Ayala ( pictured , left ) began working in Afghanistan in late September , as part of a Human Terrain Team , which embeds cultural advisers in combat units .
Originally , the program was conceived as a way to find for commanders nonviolent options for stabilizing chaotic areas : Islamic radio broadcasts to mollify Afghan mullahs , shame tactics to nudge out corrupt Iraqi cops .
" In a counterinsurgency , your level of success is inversely proportional to the amount of lethal force that you expend , " lead social scientist Montgomery McFate told Danger Room .
But in a war zone , violence is never far off .
Human Terrain teams became involved in several lethal incidents .
The latest occurred on November 4th when Ayala was on a foot patrol in the village of Chehel Gazni , with teammate Paula Loyd ( pictured , right ) .
Loyd , a social scientist , approached Abdul Salam , who was carrying a fuel jug .
He said he had bought it , to fuel up his motorcycle .
They started talking about the price of gas .
Suddenly , the man doused Lloyd in a flammable liquid and set her on fire , court documents recount .
* Engulfed in a ball of flame large enough to force those near her to involuntarily back away , Paula Loyd screamed in agony as the children that had surrounded her ran away .
In the several seconds following the attack , no one could get near enough to Ms. Loyd to help her .
Panicked , Ms. Loyd ran around briefly before those near her pulled her to the ground .
One of the platoon medics tried to put the fire out with dirt , ultimately grabbing Ms. Loyd by her foot and dragging her into the nearby drainage ditch to douse the flames .
By the time the fire was extinguished , all of Ms. Loyd ’s clothing had been burned off and only her helmet and body armor remained .
Medical personnel would later determine that Ms. Loyd suffered second and third - degree burns over more than 60 % of her body .
*
Ayala chased Salam down , tackled him to the ground , and restrained him with plastic cuffs .
" After about 10 minutes , " according to an Army Criminal Investigation Division affidavit , " a soldier approached the location where Ayala had Salam detained and informed the personnel in the area that Loyd was burned badly .
Ayala pushed his pistol against Salam ’s head and shot Salam , killing him instantly . "
Ayala was taken into custody , and flown to the United States two - and - a - half weeks later .
He was charged with murder — the first military contractor to be charged with such a crime under a 2000 law that allows the prosecution of U.S. government workers who commit crimes overseas .
He later pled guilty to manslaughter – a crime , under federal sentencing guidelines , that call for a prison term of 78 to 97 months .
Federal prosecutors had said they believed Ayala deserved substantial time in prison , the New Orleans Times - Piquayune observes .
Ayala was a former Army Ranger and an experienced military contractor , serving on the security details of both Iraqi prime minister and the Afghan president .
He should have known better than to attack someone in custody .
If left unpunished , the prosecutors said , it could " erase in the minds of young troops , the " most basic rule " of their military training , " that you do not shoot prisoners . "
" For what he did to Ms. Loyd , Salam probably deserved to die , but not when and as he did .
That was not Ayala ’s decision to make , " the prosecutors added .
Ayala 's defense lawyers countered that " any term of imprisonment of Mr. Ayala would ... further compound a tragedy that began with a violent and incomprehensible attack upon an unarmed , vulnerable American woman who was actively working to improve the lives of all Afghans , including her assailant . "
As independent journalist John Stanton notes , the defense then went on to argue that the gruesome attack on Loyd had triggered " dormant combat stress injuries . "
That lead to a " perfect storm " of mental duress .
Ayala simply was n't in control of his own actions , when he shot Salam , the lawyers claimed .
Paula Loyd succumbed to her wounds in January , and became the third Human Terrain researcher to die in nine months .
Her family later asked the court to show leniency for Ayala .
ALSO :
A commenter over at Megan McArdle 's blog defended Goldman Sachs ' ( GS ) taking advantage of government programs by arguing that they 're just taking advantage of programs available to them -- just like corn growers taking advantage of subsidies .
He was quickly shot down by another commenter , saying that Goldman Sachs had significant power over government policy , while the farm grower was a mere , innocent benficiary .
Except of course this is totally false .
Farmers have excellent political clout , and courtesy of Iowa 's first - in - the - nation status , they 've hijacked the entire system of electing a President .
For John McCain to run in 2008 , Mr. Straight Talk Express needed to reverse his position on ethanol and other ag subsidies .
It 's just how the game is played .
Ok , ok .
But they 're just farmers , right ?
And they did n't require a huge bailout in order to avoid collapsing the entire system , so they 've got that going for them .
But while the financial system flamed out spectacularly last fall , the agriculture industry has been waging a quieter war on America .
First , farmers collected over $ 175 billion in subsidies over the last 12 years according to the Environmental Working Group 's Farm Subsidy Database .
That 's not ginormous , it 's just really , really big .
But the costs go beyond that .
As overabundant corn ( and corn syrup , and everything else corn ) is a major contributor to obesity , we need to include that too .
One study from the National Institute of Health estimated that the increased health costs due to obesity were more than $ 90 billion per year .
Over that same 12 - year period , we 'd guess obesity - related healthcare costs are around $ 1 trillion .
What 's more , this $ 1 trillion has n't eliminated obesity .
When we have a financial crisis -- say a systemically important bank winds up with more debt than assets -- at least we know that the money spent will extinguish the problem ( for now ) .
Obesity just sticks around , causing ongoing problems and damaging the lives of the obese .
Granted , we can put it all on ag subsidies and powerful farmers , so let 's just lop off 75 % of that , and say the total bill is $ 250 billion .
That 's still a huge cost that 's not being considered as a cost of the subsidy .
Other areas you 'd want to explore include the cost of ethanol subsidies , and the opportunity cost of having gone down the worst possible avenue towards energy stability , rather than focusing on something that could possibly work .
But here 's the thing .
All this stuff , as we noted above , is a silent war on America .
Sure , there 's outrage from time to time , but it 's slow and it 's not event - related .
And as Nassim Taleb would tell you , our focus on events cloud our judgment .
We remember Lehman and the day that the AIG bonus story came out .
We remember yesterday 's Goldman Sachs earnings .
We do n't remember how our friends got fatter and fatter over the years , slurping soda and corn syrup - laden wheat bread .
Lifestyles of the rich and Republican , representing 2 of the hardest hit districts in the country
Without any help from the national party , a few no -name Democrats came very close to ousting well - entrenched House Republicans last year , and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is poised to do all it can to win those seats this cycle .
Picking up seats in her home state will also be a priority of Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif . ) .
“ California ’s unemployment rate is in double digits and the state has been hit hard by the housing crisis , yet out of touch Republican Members have repeatedly voted against measures to help save and create jobs and restore the economy , ” said DCCC spokesman Andrew Stone , previewing a line of attack that will be used against Golden State GOP incumbents in the months to come .
Representative Mary Bono Mack Refuses to Denounce Radical Right ’s Offensive Remarks Against Judge Sonia Sotomayor
Last week , former Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich joined the fringe voices of the radical right in making the outrageous claim that President Obama ’s Supreme Court Nominee , Judge Sonia Sotomayor , is a “ racist . ” Judge Sotomayor would be the first Hispanic member of the U.S. Supreme Court in American history .
For a week , Representative Mary Bono - Mack refused to denounce Gingrich ’s shameful rhetoric and now , even with the former GOP Speaker himself acknowledging that he should n't have called Judge Sotomayor a racist , Bono Mack remains silent .
Gingrich is headlining a lucrative fundraising dinner to benefit House Republicans on June 8th .
“ For five days , Representative Mary Bono Mack had a simple choice to make :
She could strongly denounce Newt Gingrich ’s shameful rhetoric or stay silent and just take his money , ” said Ryan Rudominer , National Press Secretary for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee .
“ With five days to go until the fundraising dinner with Gingrich , will Representative Mary Bono Mack finally speak out against the radical right or continue to remain silent and take their campaign cash ”
Once again the base of the Republican Party finds itself at odds with the rest of the electorate .
While conservative Republicans strongly disapprove of her nomination , Sotomayor earns at least plurality support from moderate Republicans , independents and Democrats .
If Republicans give in to the right - wing activists calling for a bare - knuckled fight against Sotomayor , they run the risk of alienating not only Hispanics and women ( about 65 percent of whom approve of the nomination ) , but the entire electorate outside of their base as well .
Maybe you remember a big buzz early last month about how the Democratic Party was planning to target as many as eight Republican - held congressional seats in 2010 .
covered it with a 3 - page feature by Josh Kurtz , Democrats See Golden Pickup Opportunities in California .
Normally national Democrats look at California as a political ATM , a place to go for campaign contributions , buta place for serious targeting , primarily because the two very corrupt political parties conspired on an incumbent protection plan that has left the state hopelessly gerrymandered and next to impervious to change .
And then came the 2006 earthquake when a grassroots Democrat , Jerry McNerney -- with nothing from the DCCC but sabotage and antipathy -- ousted one of the most powerful and entrenched Republican incumbents , Dirty Dick Pombo .
With that in mind , even the DCCC could n't help but notice that Obama beat McCain in 8 California congressional districts with Republican incumbents .
Although conventional wisdom has Dan Lungren , Ken Calvert and Mary Bono Mack looking the most vulnerable , the other 5 should n't be looking for a free ride .
The fact that voter registration and demographic trends are all looking bad for the GOP makes it likely that most of them will have vigorous challenges in 2010 .
Today the DCCC fired a shot across the bows of 8 Republicans , Brian Bilbray ( CA - 50 ) , Mary Bono Mack ( CA - 45 ) , Ken Calvert ( CA - 44 ) , Tom McClintock ( CA - 04 ) , Dana Rohrabacher ( CA - 46 ) , Gary Miller ( CA - 42 ) , Kevin McCarthy ( CA - 22 ) and Dan Lungren ( CA - 03 ) .
Some of these districts went for Obama and some did n't , but all of them have significant Hispanic populations that are not happy with the way the first Hispanic nominee for the Supreme Court is being treated by the Republican Party .
Sonia Sotomayor has captured the imagination of Hispanics in California but instead of joining them in their happiness , the GOP and their vicious media surrogates are unfairly targeting her and smearing her .
And none of these Republican incumbents have come to her defense .
Let 's take one of the most likely to be defeated in 2010 , Mary Bono - Mack , an inconsequential backbencher who inherited the seat when her husband , Sonny Bono , skied into a tree and died .
Many in the district thought they were somehow voting for Cher .
Like most members of Congress , she lives in Washington , of course , and has lost touch with her constituents , who have drastically changed in a demographic sense since she was first elected .
But Riverside County is n't even her secondary home !
She recently married far right Florida extremist Connie Mack ( no not a gay wedding ; Connie is a male ) and when they 're not in DC , they 're in their home in Fort Meyers , Florida .
Look at this tweet from yesterday :
If she spent any time in her district it would n't come as something so out of the ordinary for her .
And this year she has a major problem , Palm Springs ' popular mayor , Steve Pougnet .
CA - 45 is one of the most Hispanic districts in the country represented by a Republican -- just under 40 % .
So the message the DCCC sent out today is sure to reverberate : Ken Calvert 's neighboring district is 35 % Hispanic ; Gary Miller 's is 24 % ; Kevin McCarthy 's is 21 % ; Brian Bilbray 's is 19 % ; Dana Rohrabacher 's is 17 % and Lungren 's is 11 % .
Of course it is n't only among Californians or among Hispanics that the Republican instinct to smear is getting it in trouble with voters .
A new survey from Democracy Corps shows that most voters ( 56 % ) approve of the nomination while only 27 % have been taken in by the ceaseless vituperation from Fox , Hate Talk Radio and extremist Republicans like Jim DeMint ( R - SC ) and Pat Roberts ( R- KS ) .

Tall ships are the embodiment of the fascination we feel for the free and abundant energy of the wind .
Already at the time of the sailing ships , it was recognized that it was important to catch the wind at the maximum possible height .
So , the main mast of a tall ship could go up to 30 meters .
Modern wind turbines reach heights of a hundred meters or more .
But Airborne Wind Energy ( AWE ) can tap winds at heights up to thousands of meters .
The present post is a more in depth examination of AWE after a previous post that I wrote on The Oil Drum and which generated a lot of comments and of reactions .
( Image from the Imperial College Yacht Club . ) .
I came in contact with the idea of AWE ( *) ( Airborne Wind Energy ) for the first time - I think - six years ago when someone named Massimo Ippolito wrote to the mailing list of ASPO - Italy proposing the concept on which he was working .
It was a wind power system based on remotely controlled kites .
I remember that I wrote back saying that the concept did n't violate any physical law , but that it seemed to me rather difficult to transform it into something practical .
As I followed the development of the idea , which later became known as " kitegen " , I saw it growing from just a qualitative concept to a full fledged project , refined in all details .
I tried many times to find faults in it , but I never succeeded .
Whatever objection I could raise , Ippolito always had a good answer to it .
Eventually , I ran out of objections and when Ippolito tested a working prototype , in 2008 , I had to count myself among the believers .
In the process , I learned a lot about aerodynamics ; for instance what is the difference between a " drag machine " and a " lift machine " .
The latter is much more efficient in terms of energy generation and is the way the kitegen works .
Here is the basic concept of kite power .

The last doubt I had on AWE was related to the environmental impact of high altitude turbines or kites .
The recent paper by Archer and Caldeira was a small epiphany that dissipated my doubts .
We can obtain plenty of energy from high altitude winds with a minimal environmental impact .
So , I decided to write a post for The Oil Drum , summarizing what I knew and the perspectives of the idea .
Passing the " meat grinder " which is the comments section of The Oil Drum is quite scary .
AWE ( and , in particular , the kitegen ) came out of it somewhat ruffled but , on the whole , it survived the ordeal .
Because of the many questions and comments received ( more than 260 ) , I think it could be interesting to examine AWE more in depth .
I apologize for this post being " kitegen - centered " and I have no intention of disparaging other ideas and projects which are being developed in the world .
There is a lot of atmosphere over there and there is plenty of space for AWE in many forms .
It is just that the kitegen is the project I know best .
So , first of all , let me summarize how a kitegen works in the configuration called " stem " or " yo - yo " .
Here " KSU " stands for " kite steering unit " .
Trajectories of a kitegen in the " Stem " configuration .
From M. Canale , L. Fagiano and M. Milanese , " Power Kites for Energy Generation " IEEE control systems Magazine , Dec. 2007 , p. 25
As you can see in this simulation , in the simplest configuration a single kite is attached to a power generator on the ground , where also the control system ( KSU ) is located .
During the " traction phase " the kite moves sweeping the wind ( green lines ) as it pulls on the generator .
When it has reached a maximum distance from the generator , the kite is placed in a " stall " position and pulled back ( red line ) .
In this phase , very little energy is expended .
In the paper by Fagiano et al . you can see also the results of practical tests that confirm the results of the simulation .
This system is at present being built in Italy in a version which is expected to produce a maximum power of 3MW .
Now , let 's go to the questions and the comments to my previous post .
These can be divided in 4 groups ( I apologize if I forgot someone 's comments - there are just too many of them ) .
1 . Does it work ?
( " It wo n't work because the lines will snap off , kites will get entangled with each other , etc. . " )
2 . Is it safe ?
( " Kites will fall on people 's heads , will destroy planes , etc. " )
3 . How efficient is it ?
( " Wont you affect atmospheric wind circulation ? , etc. . " )
4 . What is it for ?
( " Do we really need all that energy ?
What problems will it solve ? " )
1 . Does it work ?
Here , commenters correctly identified some critical points of the kitegen system .
In particular , the strain on the cables is an important issue and so is the control of the kites .
These problems have been studied in detail and - in my opinion - solved .
The kites are continuously controlled by a sophisticated positioning system that avoids collisions and entanglement of the cables .
About the cables ability to withstand the strain , there have been both theoretical studies and experimental tests .
As a consequence , the winch control system has been designed in such a way to maintain a nearly constant load ; which will reduce the fatigue problem .
It is estimated that cables will need to be replaced every six months of operation but will actually be replaced more often for safety .
That is not a problem for the efficiency of the system and , on this point , Ippolito wrote in the " comments " section that :
Let me say , a coal power plant burn 300 tons of coal to produce 1 GWhe .
A KiteGen to produce the same amount of energy will wear about 100 kg of tether .
Then the rope will be recycled and only the 20 % of the ply will be discarded because too short .
One point that was raised is that , if it was so easy , it would have been done already .
I think the answer is that it is not easy , and so it took some time to produce a working concept .
AWE is not something that came out of the blue ( although , in a literal sense , it does ) .
It is the evolution of a technological line that started with the sailboats of Sumerian times and that has arrived today to giant wind towers , a hundred meters tall .
Technology goes step by step and we should n't be surprised if , to have high altitude wind power , we had to wait the maturing of the conventional wind tower technology .
2 . Is it safe ?
It was somewhat surprising to see so much importance given to the concern that kites could fall onto something or on someone .
Certainly , this is an important point , but also one that should n't be overstated .
So , first of all , in normal conditions , a loss of lift wo n't bring a kite to the ground because it can be retracted faster than it can fall .
Then , of course , we can think of a series of failures that might bring the kites down .
In case of total failure of the mechanical system on the ground , the kites will lose lift and fall .
Other possible causes of kites reaching the ground will be cable failure .
That could occur as the result of fatigue or of a sudden gust of wind .
The problem of fatigue has been extensively studied and modeled , and the cables have been designed in such a way to minimize the problem .
In any case , they will be replaced at regular intervals - as I said in the previous section .
About sudden gusts of wind , in case of bad weather , the system can be quickly shut down by retracting the kites .
At 25 m/ sec retraction speed , it takes always less than one minute to completely retract a kite operated by a stem system .
There would be plenty of time to avoid the occasional twister passing by , although one might try ( perhaps ) to fly the kites into it to slow it down .
I think we may consider kites falling as very infrequent events if the system is carefully designed , as it should be .
Take into account , also , that the kites wo n't be flown over densely populated areas .
Even so , there would always be a small chance of falling kites hitting people or something valuable .
In such case , the damage is expected to be small .
The cables will fall at a speed of 4 m/ sec , being slowed down by aerodynamic drag .
A stalled kite should fall at an even lower speed .
One meter of cable of a 1MW stem weighs less than half a kg while a kite weighs something like 10 kg per square meter .
The cables are made of soft materials , while the kite is mostly fabric .
If a kite or a cable falls on a roof , the most we can expect are a few shingles broken or displaced .
Of course , hitting a person would surely hurt , but it would n't necessarily kill .
Here commenters have correctly raised the problem of the " snapping " of a suddenly broken cable .
That could considerably increase the speed of the cable and do much more damage .
However , snapping is a typical feature of a sudden fracture , as it happens - for instance - for steel cables under stress .
But the kitegen cables are made out of multi-strand dyneema fiber .
Experimental tests have shown that these cables do n't break all of a sudden but tend to " unravel " first and so they dissipate a lot of energy in that process .
No snapping worth noticing was observed in these laboratory tests .
The cables , therefore , should normally fall " flat " on the ground .
In the end , there exists a worst case hypothesis that someone may get badly hurt or even killed by kites or cables crashing down in an extensive failure of the kitegen system .
The data we have show that this possibility is very unlikely and so it can be controlled by known risk management techniques , as it is done practically in all fields of technology .
In ordinary commercial aviation , for instance , we do n't require zero risk of planes falling from the sky , but we strive to reduce this risk to a minimum .
The same approach would work for the kitegen or for any AWE system .
Other safety issues were raised in the discussion , such as the kites interfering with plane traffic and the possibility of damage from lightning .
The first problem does not seem to be difficult to solve .
The atmosphere is crowded with all sorts of flying objects and we seem to be very good in managing air traffic : collisions are very rare .
Kites will have their reserved flying area and active avoidance can be practiced by the control system on the ground , which is equipped with a radar .
Kites can be rapidly retracted or moved out of the way if an aircraft is detected moving too close to the reserved area .
This kind of control could also be used to avoid damage to birds , a point that was not raised in the comments .
About lightning , the issue has been studied and it seems to be a modest risk since the cables are not conductive .
Of course , in addition , the kites wo n't be flown into thunderstorms .
3 . How efficient is it ?
I have cited Archer and Caldeira 's paper estimates the total energy we can extract from the atmosphere without causing a serious environmental damage .
It turns out to be at least 10 times ( or perhaps even 100 times ) the currently produced primary energy in the world .
But can we really reach these limits ?
According to Archer and Caldeira , in order to generate as much energy as we produce today we would need approximately one kite ( or other device ) per cubic km of atmosphere .
This does n't seem to be a lot : one cubic km is a very large space for a kite to fly .
But we can't reserve the whole atmosphere for kites or rotors .
So , we would need more detailed studies to understand exactly how much of the atmosphere we can use for generating energy .
We can say that the total amount is probably large , but it will be surely limited .
The main point at present , anyway , is not so much what is the ultimate total energy that AWE can provide .
It is how fast we can build up renewable power in the face of dwindling supplies of fossil fuels .
That is the critical point , and the one which I emphasized in my previous post .
With the kind of energy yield ( EROEI ) that AWE promises , ( over 100 according to estimates ) we can have the technology grow quickly and replace fossil fuels before we run out of them .
That is by no means demonstrated , so far , but it is at least a reasonable possibility .
4 . What do we need it for ?
Good question and it is one of the points that I was making in my previous post .
In the past few years , we have understood that we have an energy problem and we have placed a lot of resources in developing new gadgets that are meant to solve it .
But often we seem to have misplaced our aim .
One example may be the emphasis we are giving today to biofuels .
We may end up with just a meager source of fuel for our cars in exchange for a serious misuse of agricultural resources which we badly need for producing food .
Airborne wind energy should be a good solution for at least one problem : replacing fossil fuels for the production of electric power .
But how is it going to impact on everything else ?
Perhaps the most worrying observation here is that there has been at least one case , that of France , where the availability of cheap electricity from nuclear plants has not caused a reduction of the use of fossil fuels ( as described in a post by Eugenio Saraceno ) .
Electricity " too cheap to meter " may free financial resources that people could use to drive their cars more or to buy SUVs .
So , it is not completely obvious that AWE would really cut on the use of fossil fuels and , therefore , mitigate the climate problem .
With a bit of luck , however , it would make coal plants obsolete and eliminate at least one of the biggest sources of pollution and greenhouse gases we have .
Nevertheless , it is perfectly clear to me that our problem is not in the availability of energy or resources ; it is in the way we use energy and resources .
This problem has a name " overshoot " and , in turn , it is related to our tendency of favoring short term returns over long term ones .
Over and over in history , we have destroyed the resources that sustained us because of this tendency .
Humans are very good at solving one problem at a time ; much less at understanding and caring for whole systems .
We are excellent gadget builders but terrible planet managers .
AWE can't do much to change the way we think .
Nevertheless AWE on a reasonable scale is one of the most benign form of renewable energy I can think of : it is cheap and relatively simple , so that anyone can use it , anywhere in the world .
It generates electric power , which is very efficient and non polluting .
It has a very small environmental impact ; it uses mostly abundant resources ( steel and fabric , the latter could be obtained by natural sources ) .
So , it gives us a chance of a smooth transition from fossil fuels to renewables .
Whether we 'll be able to do that , is all to be seen , but at least it is a chance - better than no chance at all .
In the end , it is obvious that we still need practical tests , but this discussion did n't evidence fatal flaws in the kitegen concept .
This conclusion can be probably extrapolated to all AWE systems using kites , although those which use rotors or balloons will need a different analysis .
Hence , AWE emerges out as a very promising technology based on sound physical and engineering concepts .
Its development could be stopped only by strangling it with red tape ; something that , unfortunately , governments are very good at doing .
But renewable energy is already changing the world and it is probably impossible to stop it , by now .
AWE would be a further step in the right direction .

The popular social network StumbleUpon has lost a lot of steam when it comes to referral traffic .
Since January 2009 , Stumble Referral traffic is down by more than 66 % according to Google Analytics .
Back in January 2009 , our friends and subscribers were close to the same numbers today , but under a different account .
I know some people may say that your friends hardly have any subscribers , but that is not the case .
Of the 100 friends , more than 30 % have more than 150 subscribers and 20 % have at least 50 to 100 subscribers .
Why has the referral traffic from StumbleUpon fallen off ?
I know this has nothing to do with the original owners buying back StumbleUpon from eBay .
It ’s hard to figure out why the referral traffic has dropped off , but it has significantly .
Here are actual analytics from January 2009 compared to June 2009 .
January – stumbleupon.com ( referral ) 15,524
June – stumbleupon.com ( referral ) 5,007
The chart below suggests that StumbleUpon Unique Visits is up 16.7 % over the last 3 months .
I am not concerned that StumbleUpon traffic has slowed because our Google Organic traffic now makes up more than 48 % of our total traffic .
This means we are doing well when it comes to search engine traffic .
I was excited when StumbleUpon created the share tool , but it really has n’t made an impact when it comes to referral traffic .
The share tool really makes it easy to share a link with all your friends with a couple of clicks .
There ’s no way I am giving up on SU as it brings in more than 5,000 visits per month , but I wish I knew why the referral traffic has dropped off .
Did StumbleUpon make a change in their system ?
Who knows , but I am sure someone will figure out what ’s going on .
July 1 , 2009 --
The FDA warns that bizarre behavior -- including suicide -- is seen in people taking the stop - smoking drugs Chantix and Zyban .
Both drugs now will carry " black box " labels warning that people taking the drugs should be closely watched for signs of suicidal thoughts , depression , hostility , or other changes in behavior .
" We want people to use these drugs carefully and pay attention , " Robert J. Temple , MD , director of the FDA 's office of medical policy , said at a news conference .
" Stopping smoking is a goal we all want to work toward .
We do n't want to scare people off these drugs -- we just want them carefully monitored . "
It 's not at all clear that the drugs actually cause these behavior changes .
Smokers are addicted to nicotine -- and when they quit , their withdrawal symptoms can include many bizarre behaviors , including suicide .
However , Curt Rosebraugh , MD , MPH , director of one of the FDA 's drug evaluation units , said that some of the suicide reports came from Chantix users who were still smoking .
The FDA has been following reports of suicide and bizarre behavior in people taking Chantix .
Indeed , the FAA bans use of the drug by pilots , and the FDA warns people not to operate heavy machinery while using the drug .
But the link between such behaviors and Zyban is relatively new .
Zyban 's active ingredient is bupropion , the antidepressant medication sold as Wellbutrin .
While Wellbutrin and other antidepressants have labels warning of suicidal thoughts , the warning had not been fully extended to people taking Zyban to quit smoking .
" Our attention was focused on Chantix .
It was n't until we started looking through things that we realized Zyban may have the same issues , " Rosebraugh said at the news conference .
The most disturbing reports to the FDA involve suicide :
98 completed suicides in Chantix users
14 completed suicides in Zyban users
188 attempted suicides in Chantix users
17 attempted suicides in Zyban users
These reports have not been fully investigated .
There may be duplicate reports , and the reports have not been definitively shown to be drug side effects .
• Metropolitan Police rules out new investigation • News International : ' Confidentiality obligations ' prevent comment on ' certain ' Guardian allegations • Andy Coulson may face Commons culture select committee • David Cameron defends his communications chief • Gordon Brown : ' This raises serious questions '
The Crown Prosecution Service today said it would undertake an urgent review of evidence in the News of the World phone hacking case , after the Metropolitan Police revealed it did not plan a further investigation of the allegations .
However , Andy Coulson , the former News of the World editor , now the Tory communications chief , could be grilled by MPs for a Commons inquiry into the affair .
Keir Starmer QC , the director of public prosecutions , said he had ordered an " urgent examination " of material provided by the police in the News of the World case three years ago .
He added that the process will take time but he hopes to make a further statement in coming days .
" I have no reason to consider that there was anything inappropriate in the prosecutions that were undertaken in this case , " Starmer added .
" In the light of the fresh allegations that have been made , some preliminary inquiries have been undertaken and I have now ordered an urgent examination of the material that was supplied to the CPS by the police three years ago .
" I am taking this action to satisfy myself and assure the public that the appropriate actions were taken in relation to that material . "
John Yates , the Metropolitan Police 's assistant commissioner , said that no further evidence had come to light since Scotland Yard 's original investigation , which led to the News of the World 's royal editor , Clive Goodman , and a private investigator , Glenn Mulcaire , being jailed for four and six months respectively in January 2007 after they were found guilty of hacking into the mobile phones of royal household staff .
Coulson also resigned after Goodman was jailed in January 2007 .
Speaking outside Scotland Yard in central London , Yates said he was not involved in the original Mulcaire and Goodman investigation and had reviewed the facts of the case with " an independent mind " .
He added that Mulcaire and Goodman targeted potentially " hundreds " of people , but the pair " used the tactic [ of phone - hacking ] against a … small group of individuals " .
He said all those individuals were notified that their phones had been targeted .
" Where there was tapping they were contacted by police , " Yates said .
" In the vast majority of cases [ the Met originally looked into ] there was insufficient evidence to show that tapping had actually been achieved .
No additional evidence has come to light since this [ case ] was concluded … no further investigation is required . "
Yates added that the original investigation had " not uncovered any evidence that John Prescott 's phoneline had been tapped " .
John Whittingdale MP , the Conservative chair of the Commons culture select committee , said today it was " highly likely " to call Coulson to give evidence as part of an investigation into how journalists at the paper obtained information and whether executives knew about the methods they employed .
The investigation has been prompted by the Guardian 's revelations that News Group Newspapers , the News International subsidiary that publishes the Sunday tabloid , has paid a total of £ 1 m in out - of - court settlements to three people whose mobile phones were hacked into .
They included Gordon Taylor , the chief executive of the Professional Footballers ' Association , who received £ 700,000 .
That has prompted a political storm today , with Home Office minister David Hanson forced to take emergency questions from angry MPs on the matter during a hastily - convened session at the House of Commons this morning .
News of the World parent company News International today broke its silence on the phone - hacking affair , but did not deny any of the Guardian 's allegations .
The company said its journalists fully complied with relevant legislation and codes of conduct since February 2007 , after the Goodman case and Coulson 's resignation , but that it was legally bound to not discuss some of the Guardian 's allegations .
" News International is prevented by confidentiality obligations from discussing certain allegations made in the Guardian newspaper today , " the company said .
" Since February 2007 , News International has continued to work with its journalists and its industry partners to ensure that its journalists fully comply with both the relevant legislation and the rigorous requirements of the PCC's Code of Conduct .
At the same time , we will not shirk from vigorously defending our right and proper role to expose wrongdoing in the public interest . "
Gordon Brown , the prime minister , has also mentioned the row about phone - hacking today at a press conference in L'Aquila , Italy , where he is attending the G8 summit .
" I am not aware of the details of what is being talked about , other than that there is an issue on this in London , " Brown said .
" I think this raises questions that are serious and will obviously have to be considered , but I understand that the police are looking at a statement later today and I do not think I should say any more than that . "
David Cameron , the Conservative leader , is facing calls for Coulson to quit as his director of communications .
This morning Cameron was forced to defend the former News of the World editor , telling reporters outside his home in London : " It 's wrong for newspapers to breach people 's privacy with no justification .
That is why Andy Coulson resigned as editor of the News of the World two and a half years ago .
" Of course I knew about that resignation before offering him the job .
But I believe in giving people a second chance .
As director of communications for the Conservatives he does an excellent job in a proper , upright way at all times . "
Some of the most powerful figures in Rurpert Murdoch 's News Corporation media empire will also be asked to give evidence by MPs on the culture select committee when they begin their phone - hacking investigation next Tuesday .
They include Rebekah Wade , the outgoing Sun editor who has been promoted to News International chief executive ; Stuart Kuttner , the News of the World 's outgoing managing editor ; Colin Myler , the current News of the World editor ; and Les Hinton , the former chairman of News International .
Whittingdale also said that Nick Davies , the Guardian journalist who broke the story , will be asked to appear at the hearing about the controversy .
Coulson will be asked to give evidence after that hearing has taken place .
The select committee quizzed Hinton , who ran Rupert Murdoch 's stable of British newspapers until the end of 2007 , about phone hacking at the News of the World during an inquiry earlier that year into self - regulation of the press .
That was prompted , in part , by the arrest of former News of the World royal editor Clive Goodman in August 2006 on charges of obtaining information illegally .
Goodman was jailed in January 2007 , prompting Coulson 's resignation .
Two months later , Hinton told MPs on the culture select committee : " I believe that Clive Goodman was the only person who knew what was going on . "
Hinton is now based in New York as chief executive of Wall Street Journal owner Dow Jones , part of Murdoch 's News Corporation .
The Press Complaints Commission has today said it may reopen its 2007 investigation into phone hacking by newspaper journalists .
The PCC also said it would investigate any new allegations about potentially illegal activity " without delay " .
Culture secretary Ben Bradshaw has said the affair raises questions for the Tory leader .
" David Cameron , the police and the Press Complaints Commission all have questions to answer in relation to today 's Guardian revelations , " he said in a message posted on Twitter this morning .
The Guardian revealed yesterday that Rupert Murdoch 's News Group Newspapers , the News of the World 's parent company , has paid out more than £ 1 m to settle legal cases that threatened to reveal evidence of his journalists ' repeated involvement in the use of criminal methods to get stories .
Gordon Taylor , the chief executive of the Professional Footballers ' Association , received a £ 700,000 payment from News Group .
The methods used by the News of the World came to light after Goodman was jailed .
Coulson was editing the paper at the time and resigned when Goodman was jailed .
News International executives , including Coulson , said they did not know about Goodman 's actions and that he was acting alone .
Former home secretary Charles Clarke told Radio 4's Today Programme this morning : " I think it is outrageous .
I think we do need action immediately .
" News International has to publish the full list of those that they have bugged .
I think that David Cameron has to sack Andy Coulson because his denial is very narrow in the extreme .
I think David Cameron himself has to be much clearer about the situation . "
Former cabinet minister Geoff Hoon said : " It is hard to see how in these circumstances Andy Coulson can continue as David Cameron 's communications chief while such a cloud hangs over his reputation .
David Cameron must make clear what action he intends to take on this matter . "
The Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman , Chris Huhne , said : " At the very least Andy Coulson was responsible for a newspaper that was out of control and at worst he was personally implicated . "
Clarke also told the BBC the police should be asked why they failed to take action after learning about the extent of the phone hacking and the number of people targeted by News of the World journalists .
They included Taylor , former culture secretary Tessa Jowell , Lib Dem MP Simon Hughes , celebrity PR Max Clifford , model Elle MacPherson and football agent Sky Andrew .
News Group denied all knowledge of the hacking , but Taylor last year sued them on the basis that they must have known about it .
" I think that the home secretary should be asking the chief inspector of constabulary for a full report about the police behaviour in this whole incident , " Clarke said .
Former deputy prime minister John Prescott , one of the alleged targets of the hacking , also said he wanted answers from the police .
" I find it staggering that there could be a list known to the police of people who had their phone tapped .
" I 'm named as one of them .
For such a criminal act not to be reported to me , and for action not to be taken against the people who have done it , reflects very badly on the police , and I want to know their answer . "
Prescott also called on Cameron to dismiss Coulson .
Coulson said yesterday : " This story relates to an alleged payment made after I left the News of the World two and half years ago .
I took full responsibility at the time for what happened on my watch but without my knowledge and resigned . "
John Whittingdale , chairman of the Commons culture committee , said he wanted to summon newspaper editors to answer " serious " questions about the allegations .
" There are a number of questions I would like to put to News International on the basis of what the Guardian has reported , " he said .
His committee would examine the issue " as a matter of urgency " at a scheduled meeting later today , he said .
" It may well be that we decide we wish to have somebody from News International to appear before us . "
He said he had seen no " direct evidence " that assurances previously given to the committee by the publisher on the matter had been untrue .
But Whittingdale added : " If that is the case it does beg the question why News International have apparently paid huge sums of money in settlement of actions in the courts .
That is a question I would wish to put to News International . "
It is possible that Coulson could be called to give evidence if the committee decides to reopen its investigation into the affair .
News International executives told the committee in 2007 that they were unaware of Goodman 's activities or those of Glenn Mulcaire , a private investigator who worked for the company .
He was jailed along with Goodman in January 2007 .
The Press Complaints Commission investigated the allegations but failed to find evidence of wrongdoing .
It did not question Coulson as part of its investigation .
The payments to Taylor and two other individuals secured secrecy in three cases that threatened to expose evidence of Murdoch 's journalists using private investigators who illegally hacked into the mobile phone messages of numerous public figures to gain unlawful access to confidential personal data , including tax records , social security files , bank statements and itemised phone bills .
Cabinet ministers , MPs , actors and sports stars were all targets of the private investigators .
The evidence unearthed by the Guardian may open the door to hundreds more legal actions by victims of News Group , the Murdoch company that publishes the News of the World and the Sun , as well as provoking police inquiries into reporters who were involved and the senior executives responsible for them .

Chung was found guilty of passing on secrets about the space shuttle
A Chinese - born engineer in the United States has been found guilty of passing space shuttle technology secrets to China , for more than 30 years .
Dongfan " Greg " Chung , 73 , is the first person to be found guilty under a federal law , introduced in 1996 , to counter economic espionage .
Mr Chung worked for Rockwell International , and then Boeing , until the FBI investigation began in 2006 .
He will be sentenced in November , and could spend decades in prison .
A court statement said the judge in California had found Chung guilty of economic espionage , acting as a foreign agent and making false statements to the FBI .
The trial began on 2 June .
Public domain
Chung , a naturalised American citizen , worked at Rockwell International from 1973 .
Rockwell 's defence and space unit was taken over by Boeing in 1996 .
Chung 's defence team admitted that he took Boeing papers home , but said he had wanted the information so he could write a book .
All the information he had given to China , they said , was already in the public domain .
His lawyer Thomas H Bienert told the court : " Mr Chung walked an interesting line , and a risky line , but not a line that was criminal . "
The defence team says it will appeal against the verdict .
Chung is to remain in custody until his sentencing on 9 November .
He could face up to 90 years in jail .
Obama goes to bat for Bush wiretap program U.S. District Court
US President George W. Bush ( R ) and Vice President Dick Cheney walk to the Rose Garden on July 10 , 2008 for Bush to sign H.R. 6304 , the FISA Amendments Act of 2008 , at the White House in Washington , DC .
The bill would expand legal authority for electronic wiretaps by spy agencies and includes retroactive immunity for telecommunications firms which aided warrantless government surveillance operations following the September 11 attacks .

President Obama is adamant about maintaining the secrecy of a wiretapping program authorized by George W. Bush , an administration lawyer told a federal judge in San Francisco on Wednesday .
Obama " does not intend to use the state - secrets privilege to cover up illegal activities , " said Justice Department attorney Anthony Coppolino .
But in exceptional circumstances , he said , the president will invoke secrecy to protect " the sources and methods of detecting terrorist attacks ... the crown jewel of the United States national security administration . "
Coppolino said the administration will cite national security in seeking dismissal of a lawsuit by telephone customers accusing the government of illegally intercepting phone calls and obtaining phone company records .
Chief U.S. District Judge Vaughn
Walker heard about 90 minutes of arguments and said he would rule later .
The suit is similar to claims filed against AT&T and other telecommunications firms in 2006 , following Bush 's acknowledgement that he had authorized eavesdropping on Americans ' communications with suspected foreign terrorists without seeking court approval .
Walker , in whose court the cases were consolidated , dismissed the suits earlier this year based on a 2008 law that shielded the companies from liability for alleged cooperation with surveillance that Bush had authorized .
That law did not prevent private citizens from suing the government , as long as they could show they were the targets of illegal eavesdropping .
The current suit , filed by most of the same customers who sued AT&T , claims that a " dragnet surveillance " program intercepted millions of messages to mine them for suspicious content .
Although both the Bush and Obama administrations have refused to discuss the extent of phone company participation , several members of Congress have confirmed that the government obtained records from phone companies , the plaintiffs ' lawyer , Kevin Bankston of the Electronic Frontier Foundation , told Walker .
The judge said in a 2006 ruling that AT&T had helped the government in surveillance , citing statements by federal officials and a former AT&T employee .
On Wednesday , he asked Coppolino whether anything had changed that would justify dismissing the latest lawsuit .
The Justice Department lawyer replied that the plaintiffs will have to air classified information in court about " the nature and scope of the government 's surveillance program " to prove their case , and the government will have to do the same to defend itself .
That " would risk exceptional harm to the national security , " Coppolino said .
Walker , however , cited a recent inspector general 's report on U.S. intelligence that said the surveillance was far broader than Bush had described and was on legally shaky ground .
An unclassified version of the report was released last week .
Walker said the full report might show whether officials had violated private citizens ' constitutional rights .

Enlarge By Jose Cabezas , AFp , Getty Images Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton has called past Afghanistan aid efforts a " heartbreaking " failure .
WASHINGTON  The Obama administration 's plan to boost aid to Afghanistan is shaping up as a boon to private contractors , including a company whose previous work on U.S. - funded Afghan aid programs has been criticized by auditors .
Despite Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton 's call to reduce the reliance on foreign aid contractors , the main U.S. aid agency is continuing to award multimillion - dollar contracts as it proposed to increase development spending in Afghanistan to $ 2.8 billion .
Clinton has dubbed past Afghanistan aid efforts a " heartbreaking " failure .
Last month , the U.S. Agency for International Development awarded a $ 150 million cooperative agreement to a partnership led by DAI , a Maryland company whose past Afghanistan contracts have been criticized by USAID 's inspector general .
The program is to promote alternatives to poppy crops .
An inspector general 's audit released May 11 criticized DAI 's performance on a $ 164 million contract to promote local governance .
Success , the audit found , was " highly questionable " in part because DAI " had no overall strategy " for implementing local projects .
DAI was " acting to remedy what shortcoming ( the audit ) found , " company spokesman Steven O'Connor said .
DAI 's poppy eradication program produced results in eastern Afghanistan , he said .
A 2007 inspector general report cited achievements , but said DAI and USAID made mistakes that kept the program from working as well as it could .
USAID relies on contractors because it lacks the staff and technical expertise to implement aid programs itself .
Although the administration is proposing to double the number of USAID employees over the next five years , that hiring has only just begun .
New hires will allow USAID and the State Department to reduce reliance on contractors , Jack Lew , deputy secretary of State in charge of management , told USA TODAY .
At the same time , " We do n't have a year to wait in Afghanistan , and frankly there are certain activities that we would never have enough government employees to do . "
Lew said he and other senior officials are reviewing every contract " in a way that I do n't believe has ever been done before . "
A " dramatic increase " in U.S. civilians on the ground in Afghanistan will enable better supervision of contracts , he said .

SANTA ANA , Calif. , June 12 ( UPI ) --
A father and son were sentenced to two years in prison Friday for stealing more than $ 3 million from a California church where both served as pastors .
Richard Wimberly Cunningham , 76 , of Moreno Valley , Calif. , and Philip Ladd Cunningham , 52 , of Laurinburg , N.C. , appeared in court in Orange County , the Los Angeles Times reported .
Both had pleaded guilty to grand theft .

Prosecutors said the Cunninghams wrote checks to themselves on eight accounts belonging to the Calvary Baptist Yorba Linda Church and School .
They also used church credit cards for personal expenses .
The money was spent on time shares in Hawaii and Palm Springs , Calif. , memberships in country clubs and expensive cars .
The Cunninghams have already paid $ 3.1 million in restitution , the newspaper said .
Geert Wilders is the leader of the Freedom Party in the Netherlands , a political group described as “ Islamophobic ” .
The party performed well in the recent European elections .
Wilders ’ anti-Islamic and anti-EU rhetoric seems to win over more and more Dutch people , mostly those who are scared about immigration and enlargement .
euronews interviewed Wilders in a bunker - like meeting room of the Dutch parliament in the Hague .
That was said to be for security reasons , because Wilders has been granted special protection due to his controversial anti-Koran movie and provocative anti-Islamic speeches .
NATO
euronews : Geert Wilder , welcome to euronews .
Are you concerned for the future of Europe ?
Wilders : I ’m very concerned for the future of Europe .
I believe Europe is a beautiful continent with strong countries , but unfortunately , because of the influx of the mass immigration and the Islamisation of our societies , I ’m afraid that at the end of the day it will cost us our freedom .
So , indeed yes , I ’m very concerned .
euronews :
Why do you think that Islam is a threat for Europe .
What is scaring you ?
Wilders :
Let me first say , I make a distinction between the ideology , the religion Islam , and the people .
I ’ve nothing against Muslims , I ’ve nothing against people .
I have a problem with the Islamic ideology .
I believe it ’s a totalitarian ideology , that it should not be compared so much with other religions , but with other totalitarian ideologies like communism or fascism .
And there is no room in the Islamic ideology for anything else but Islam .
And this is what I think that we should really fear .
euronews :
Do n’t you think that to say that Islam is a totalitarian ideology is dangerous , just from an intellectual point of view ?
Because we see that Iran for instance is fighting for more democracy and they are Muslim .
Wilders :
No , once again , people , I ’ve nothing against people , and I acknowledge that there are moderate people who call themselves Muslims , so there are moderate Muslims , and we should invest in moderate Muslims .
But I do n’t believe in a moderate Islam , I do n’t think that like Christianity - the Old Testament and New Testament , and separation of church and state , and enlightment in the last centuries – that this will ever happen in the [ sic ]
Islam , so I think we should not invest or believe in a European or moderate Islam .
But of course we should invest in people and we should invest in democracy .
euronews :
How should you separate the concept of Islam as a whole , which you say is a totalitarian ideology , a religion , and the single Muslim , that you say he could also be a moderate ?
Wilders : I admit that the majority of the Muslims in our western society today are not extremists , they are not terrorists , they are normal people like you and me , and I believe that there ’s nothing wrong with that .
But I also believe that even though the majority of those Muslims in the western societies today are not extremists or terrorists , that if we will get more of massive immigration we will get also more of the Islamic culture and the Islamic identity and the Islamic ideology in our societies , and then our societies will change : we will have what we are witnessing in the UK today , 85 sharia courts functioning where a woman is less worth than a man , where homosexuals should be killed .
I mean this kind of anti-democratic law , sharia , is part of the Islamic ideology , is exactly what is happening in Europe today .
euronews :
You have said once that all the Muslim people who want , in Europe , to implement the sharia law must leave Europe .
Do you still agree with this statement ?
Wilders : I think sharia , the implementation of sharia is the end of democracy .
If you believe in sharia , you believe that apostates , that everybody who is not a Christian [ sic ] should either be a dhimmitude , and he should be living under the rule of Muslims , or either should be killed .
The same goes for women or homosexuals .
They would have a terrible way of life in a society where sharia is implemented , so I really do believe that if you are in a country and you are in favour of the implementation of sharia that there is very little for you to do .
It means that you believe that women are worth less , half , or even more less then man .
euronews : Sorry but no , the sharia law is very clear .
The UK Islamic court are not hanging homosexuals .
Wilders :
No , but they have a law based on the Koran .
And if we start acting like you are suggesting now , if we start saying that , “ Hey , it ’s only about private law and it ’s not really about the penal code , so please let us allow only this part of the sharia in our society ” I will tell you that there will be a next step and there will be another step , so I think that we should say : no sharia in our western , free , European and other societies , because if we allow “ step A ” , however innocent it might look , and I belive it ’s not innocent at all , that there will be a next step and another step .
And the political elite in the European societies will allow it for politically correct reasons , because they are cultural relativists , they believe that all cultures are equal .
Gordon Brown , the Prime minister of the United Kingdom , is the biggest coward of Europe .
When he sent me away , when I wanted to enter the UK just to show a movie and to have a discussion in the House of Lords .
This is the kind of leaders that we have in Europe today and they should be removed and replaced by more brave leaders .
euronews :
That ’s a problem of public order at home , also for the British …
Wilders : Only in the UK .
He decided , not because there was any threat , because it was not , like I said , I visited many countries for the same reasons , I was welcomed in a very positive way , but the prime minister of the UK was afraid that somebody came and spoke against his views and say something nasty , according to him , against Islam and he feared that .
And there was pressure from Islamic people from the House of Lords , so he gave in , he gave in , he gave up .
He played again the Chamberlain of Europe of 2009 .
euronews :
You are against Turkey joining the European Union … Wilders : For sure … euronews :
Many federalists are against Turkey joining the EU , because they say that it will dilute the EU and the idea of a federal Europe will disappear .
So you should be in favour of Turkey joining the EU …
Wilders : I ’m against a federal Europe .
I want us to stay independent , and Holland to only cooperate in the economical framework , and I ’m against the joining of Turkey .
I ’ve nothing against Turkey , it ’s a very respected ally withinand a good friend of the Dutch people .
But I believe it ’s not a member of the family .
A good neighbour is not the same as being a member of the family , and it ’s an Islamic country .
We will not only pay a very high price when it comes to all the costs , all the money that we will have to pay to Turkey , but it ’s an Islamic country and will get even more immigration to our societies , which is the last thing that we should need .
euronews : Should you open the doors to Ukraine for instance ?
Wilders :
No , I think that no other country should join Europe .
I ’m even in favour of Romania and Bulgaria to leave [ sic ] the EU .
My party voted against the ratification treaty in the Dutch parliament for the accession of Romania and Bulgaria .
euronews : Why ?
What ’s the problem with them ?
Wilders : Because first , the Dutch people believe that Europe is large enough .
They are against any more countries joining and I share their view .
We should have a small Europe with more little tasks , than an enlarged Europe with even more influence .
We are against that , and , secondly , I believe that those countries were not ready at all , were very unready and very corrupt as well .
Mac security researcher Dino Dai Zovi revealed a significant vulnerability in Mac OS X today at the Black Hat conference taking place in Las Vegas this week .
He and other Mac security experts warn that Mac OS X could prove to be an easy target if hackers were to shift significant resources to exploiting any of its security flaws .
Dai Zovi detailed a technique that he calls " Machiavelli , " which can be used to grab data , even if it is encrypted .
Specifically , it relies on an exploit of Safari , the most common attack vector for Mac OS X .
" There is no magic fairy dust protecting Macs , " he told Reuters in an interview .
Dai Zovi's colleague , Charlie Miller , agrees .
" [ Apple is ] advancing .
Our concern is that they are just not advancing as fast as they are gaining market share , " he said .
Miller co-authored The Mac Hacker 's Handbook with Dai Zovi , and is well known for his exploits of Safari which has helped him win the Pwn2 Own contest multiple times .
Miller is also expected to detail an SMS vulnerability in the iPhone OS at Black Hat today .
While Mac OS
X has been nearly free of malware since its introduction , it is n't invulnerable to security problems .
Apple has improved its response to security exploits , issuing multiple patches every year .
And Snow Leopard is expected to include a number of improvements to overall OS security — another reason to encourage rapid adoption of the $ 29 OS upgrade expected to ship this fall .
But that does n't mean Mac users should be care - free about security .
" When the malware authors put out something that 's really sophisticated we are going to have a whole population that is really vulnerable , " Joel Yonts , an expert in Mac security also attending Black Hat , told Reuters .
If Apple continues to grow its market share — which is hovering around 9 percent these days in the US , and about 4 percent globally — the platform could become a more enticing target for malware writers , particularly given the general lackadaisical attitude most users have towards security .
The sky is n't yet falling , but users should be aware of security issues and be prepared to protect themselves accordingly .

RITE AND REASON : Not until the 1998 Good Friday agreement did Irish nationalism come to terms with Irish unionism , writes SÉAMUS MURPHY
THE RECENT murders of two soldiers and a policeman in Northern Ireland by the Continuity IRA and the Real IRA reminded me of the title of a 1970s prize - winning sci- fi novel , The Forever War .
Will our “ war ” never end ?
There is still the view among a minority that the 1998 Good Friday agreement was a betrayal of 1916 Irish republicanism .
It accepted , however temporarily , a unionist “ veto ” and continued British “ occupation ” of Northern Ireland .
That minority view , of the Good Friday agreement as a “ sell - out ” , is consistent with the attitude of the Provisionals in the 1980s , of the IRA during the Border Campaign of the 1950s , and of the anti-Treaty side in the Civil War .
It is also in line with the views of the men and women of Easter 1916 .
When around 1912 it had become clear to even the most optimistic nationalist that Northern unionists would not agree to Home Rule from Dublin or separation from Britain , and that they would fight rather than give in , nationalist Ireland could n’t cope .
In sheer frustration a minority decided in 1916 to start shooting the British .
That has been , under varying circumstances , the enduring element in our “ forever ” war .
Not until the 1998 Good Friday agreement did Irish nationalism come to terms with Irish unionism .
Even still the term “ Irish unionism ” sounds alien to many .
Today we hope for forgiveness and reconciliation .
Perhaps those gifts cannot be had without repentance .
Northern unionists need to repent of discrimination against Catholics .
Nationalists need to repent of the contempt and hatred toward unionists involved in refusing to take seriously their view of Ireland ’s future .
Nationalists need to repent of refusing to accept ( as the Good Friday agreement accepts ) that one could be Irish and British .
Nationalists need to repent of what psychologists call ‘ transference ’ : we could n’t fight the unionists without looking sectarian , so we transferred the aggression to a more PC target and started shooting the British instead , scapegoating them for not coercing the unionists into a united Ireland .
The Easter Rising crystallised those attitudes into a template that some people still follow , no matter how bloody the result .
One ca n’t blame it all on the 1916 leaders .
Later generations of nationalists carry responsibility for romanticising the Easter Rising , treating its political thinking as not merely beyond criticism but normative for Irish political thought .
We refuse to consider that the logic of the Good Friday agreement might be moving us to transcend and move beyond the logic of the Easter Rising .
After the Nazi era , Germans had to face their past : not just the genocide , but also the violent , undemocratic nationalism .
They did it , despite the emotional anguish associated with challenging the tribal gods , and telling one ’s parents that they were wrong .
Like Senator Eoghan Harris , who has given a lead on this , I too had relatives who took up arms in the 1916 era , and I agree with him that their good intentions did not prevent their being wrong .
The Germans have learnt from their history .
Irish nationalists must face the negative impact of the Easter Rising , on pain of it being said that we are incapable of learning from our history .
The charge of “ revisionism ” will , no doubt , be hurled in reply .
Perhaps my critics should advert to Sinn Féin ’s “ revisionism ” , already hard at work at massaging the history of the Provo war of 1969 - 94 , showing it as the legitimate heir of Easter 1916 .
The Rising stalled us for 80 years on the road to the Good Friday agreement .
We are not yet there , for the Rising was still celebrated this year with far more fanfare than the Good Friday agreement .
Openness to the Other , and not just the unionist , is inescapable today , at a time when Ireland ’s destiny and well - being cannot be scripted in isolation .
Our relationships to the EU , to immigrants , and to the global economy are central to our well - being and ought to be central to our identity .
Here Easter 1916 is positively counter - productive , since the dominant note there is of a self - sufficient , autarkic isolationism : our ( nationalist ) selves alone .
We need to transcend that vision , leaving behind 1916 and the ‘ forever ’ war .
It is not often that articles on psychology studies are described as beautiful , but a piece in The Atlantic on the Harvard Study of Adult Development is quite sublime .
The project has followed two groups of men for almost seventy years , tracking physical and emotional health , opinions and attitudes , successes and failures , all in the hope of understanding what makes us happy .
It weaves the staccato train of numerical data with reflections and insights from the men themselves to attempt the impossible – it hopes to record lives .
From their brash early adulthood to their deaths or dotage the stories are brief but profound , sometimes tragic , sometimes joyful , sometimes mundane .
The study itself has generated some remarkable findings , such as the massive impact of relationships , the fading long - term effects of childhood experiences , or the role of defences in managing emotional well - being , but the piece is as much about the life of the project as its conclusions .
It serves as a meditation on the tension between meaning and measurement when trying to understand the individual , and on the potentially futile attempt to extrapolate an experience of a generation to a world of other times , people and places .
But the article also about psychiatrist George Valliant , who has been coordinating the study for over 40 years , and whose life is intricately woven into the project .
The ending of the article is both surprising and poignant , because it questions what we can truly learn from the lives of others .

The TILLER REPORT is a 34 page report containing information gathered by Operation Rescue West 's investigation into America 's most notorious late - term abortionist , George R. Tiller .
Read the startling picture of a man with an overwhelming need for respect and recognition , who is plagued by drug and alcohol addiction , and who distances himself from close personal relationships , yet claims a cultish pseudospirituality .
His propensity toward substance abuse and blame shifting , along with his macabre fascination with death , leads reasonable people to have concerns about his psychological stability .
In addition , this report presents documented evidence of a troubled medical practice with a history of botched and coerced abortions , abortions on minor girls as young as 12 - years old , and an abortion survivor who was mercilessly left to die .
The report shows that Tiller has exhibited cruel , cold - hearted treatment of women .
It exposes Tiller 's death camp incinerator where the broken bodies of his tiny victims are burned in a manner that is reminiscent of the Nazi concentration camp ovens .
The report shows that , time after time , Tiller has managed to dodge criminal prosecution in spite of numerous pieces of legislation that have been passed for the express purpose of limiting his abortion business .
ORW 's investigation also reveals the shocking truth , that members of Wichita 's business , political , and religious communities have aided and abetted Tiller , allowing his killing business to expand and flourish .

Whoops .

Please try again .
One of my recently developed rules : avoid the last minute rush .
I do n't run to catch the Metro train , and I do n't scramble to put my data into some sort of coherent form when I have to give a lab meeting presentation on short notice .
So I 'm not scrambling for my lab meeting talk tomorrow .
My plan is , in the absence of any solid results to present , to go visionary , saying whatever I want to , without having to back it up with supporting data .
And in the spirit of scientific openness , I 'm providing a sneak preview of what may tomorrow turn out to be a terrific mess of a lab meeting talk .
Why should you care about what goes on in our lab meetings ?
Because we work on some of the most interesting problems in science today , that 's why .
Here 's the topic for tomorrow 's lab meeting :
What makes us different ?
Why are individuals of the same species different from each other ?
And how can we explain those differences with physical chemistry ?
How our genes make us different is , of course , what many scientists are interested in .
You can't open an issue of Nature Genetics without finding at least a half - dozen genome - wide association studies , aimed at finding the genetic differences responsible for differences in traits like height , weight , or susceptibility to diseases like stroke , lymphoma , diabetes , or atrial fibrillation .
These studies fall solidly within the realm of genetics , and ultimately what you get out of genetics is a quantitative relationship between a particular genetic variant and a certain trait .
How that variant produces its effect on that trait is unknown .
To put this in the right jargon , we do n't know how a given genotype produces a phenotype .
Personally , I find that unsatisfying .
I work in a genetics department , but really , at heart and by training , I 'm a biochemist .
I like to think in terms of molecules .
My goal is to explain biology in terms of physical chemistry .
Biophysical chemistry is the black box between genotype and phenotype .
But here we run into problem : biochemists do n't think like geneticists , especially population geneticists .
Biochemists are implicitly trained to think of biochemical systems as platonic ideals - when we think about something like Ras signaling in mouse cells , we think of it as being the same in all cells , except when tumorigenic mutations make it go wrong .
In other words , the only time we think about mutations that cause a signaling pathway to operate differently is when we 're thinking about disease .
Yet it 's obvious that perfectly healthy individuals differ from each other genetically .
You and I can have millions of sequence differences in our DNA , and be just fine .
Biochemists ( and molecular biologists , and cell biologists , etc. ) are terrible at thinking about variation .
This is one of those topics that puts the differences in outlook between biological sub - disciplines in stark relief - population geneticists think of nothing but variation .
And in fact , without variation , population geneticists would have nothing to work with .
Variation is their stock - in - trade .
There is a reason that biochemists have avoided genetic variation .
If I want to understand how a particular system works , then I work it out in the most general way possible .
Researchers studying a signaling pathway are interested in how a signal gets relayed from a cell - surface receptor , through various intermediate proteins , down to the ultimate targets of the pathway .
They are interested in the broad features of this pathway that hold true for all individuals .
They want to know which proteins and small molecules are involved in carrying the signal .
And for decades , biochemists have been teasing apart the workings of these pathways , with great success .
Worrying about differences in pathway function among individuals would have been more distracting than helpful in this process .
After years of work , we now know a great deal about many biochemical systems .
In fact , for some systems the details have been so well worked out , that scientists have put together mathematical models of how these systems work at the level of physical chemistry ( meaning here interactions among molecules ) .
With these models , you can run simulations of the system , and see what happens when you perturb it a certain way , and therefore make predictions about what happens when you make mutations in the proteins of the system .
Once you reach this point - where you have a detailed understanding of a particular system , with a working quantitative model - what types of questions should you ask next ?
If we 've already figured out a particular biochemical pathway at this level of detail , what else do you want to know ?
This is a key question to consider , because at some point , you hit a level of diminishing returns ; you learn more details about the system , but those details do n't tell you anything important .
But geneticists know of an extremely important question , one which our mathematical models are very well - placed to answer : how do genetic differences produce physical differences ?
How does genotypic variation generate phenotypic variation ?
This is where we can bring biochemistry ( or systems biology , or whatever ) and genetics together .
We can take our well - characterized systems , ones that we understand at the level of physical chemistry , and ask how the dynamics of those systems vary among individuals .
It works like this :
Our mathematical models depend on physical parameters ( such as the affinity of a transcription factor for a promoter ) .
Our models can tell us which parameters can tolerate large changes without much impact on the system behavior , and which parameters must be precisely tuned to generate a certain behavior .
Genetic changes have an impact on these parameters .
For example , a mutation in the promoter of a gene can weaken the affinity of a transcription factor for that promoter .
If the system behavior depends very strongly on the transcription factor having a certain affinity for a particular promoter , any genetic changes in that transcription factor binding site will cause a significant difference in phenotype .
So our question then is this : where does genetic variation tend to fall ?
Does it occur at highly sensitive points of the pathway , or will we see that genetic variation tends to modify those parameters which have only a small impact on the dynamics of the system ?
Instead of focusing on all aspects of a system , by taking this approach we focus on only those aspects that differ among individuals .
Until recently , it has been impossible to answer this question , because we have n't had the DNA sequencing power and the biophysical models needed to address this .
Framing this question in terms of parameters may not seem that exciting to some of you , but the answer to this question will help us understand other key genotype - phenotype questions .
One of them is this :
Which features of a biochemical system are the functionally important ones ?
Response time ?
Activation threshold ?
Robustness ?
Biochemical pathways are dynamical systems that have all sorts of interesting behaviors , but many of those behaviors can be simply artifacts of the way the system is rigged up , without any important functional role .
Here 's an example from a simulation of a genetic regulatory network in yeast .
The graph shows the pulsed expression of a particular gene over time , in response to a signal acting on the regulatory network controlling this gene .
As you can see , as I change the parameters in the model , I get different behaviors in the pulse of gene expression .
But what is important ?
The amplitude of the pulse ?
The timing of peak expression ?
The breadth of the peak ?
I do n't know .
By looking at what genetic variation does to a biochemical system , we can see which features of a system can change without catastrophic consequences .
For example , let 's say that we have a mathematical model of a signaling pathway , one where a drug or hormone binds to a receptor at the cell surface and initiates a cascade of reactions that ultimately lead to changes in gene expression .
Our model shows us that this pathway has a precisely - tuned threshold for activation , and that the pathway is structured in such a way to produce a very rapid response time if the parameters are just right .
When we go out and sequence a bunch of people , and look at where the genetic variation falls in this pathway , we may find that the variation produces a huge range of response times , but absolutely no changes in the activation threshold .
In that case , we conclude that the response time is n't such a critical feature of the pathway , but the activation threshold is , because the population does n't tolerate any mutations that change the activation threshold .
So , looking at both physical chemistry and genetic variation allows to to learn several things about the relationship between genotype and phenotype : we can understand the effects of genetic variants on the physical behavior of a biochemical system ( by modeling those genetic variants as perturbations in the paramters of the model ) , and we can learn which features of a system have been allowed to change , and which have been kept constant in a population , as a result of by evolutionary pressure .
Right now , we can make some guesses about what to expect about where genetic variation should fall in biochemical systems , but we do n't really know the answer , because the studies have n't been done .
We really do n't know why , at a physical chemistry level , individuals are different from one another .
We also do n't understand very well how biochemical systems evolve .
Different yeast species spend different amounts of time going through the cell division cycle , but what types of changes in the cell division control system had to occur in order to produce the differences in timing among different species ?
There are thousands of questions like this that scientists have been unable to address until recenty .
' Interdisciplinary science ' is a hot buzz - term that will increase your chances of funding success with an NIH study section , but we really are at the point now where taking an interdisciplinary approach creates some unprecedented opportunities to answer some of the most important open questions in biology .
Biochemists and geneticists have borrowed each other 's experimental tools for years , but now it 's time for them to fuse their different intellectual outlooks .
Together they can tell us why we differ from one another , and how our genes affect who we are .
The Origin of Satan
Lucifer and other Fallen Angels
Who was Lucifer ?
God had given Satan a certain amount of power and authority .
But he perverted that power .
Lucifer wanted to exalt himself above God ... rather than " just " being the Angel of God .
If God is so good , then why did he create Satan ?
Like man , the angels were created perfect , and with a free will .
Satan was lifted up because of his beauty , he corrupted the wisdom by reason of his brightness ( This is in Ezekiel 28:17 )
Ezekiel 28:12 ( KJV )
" Son of man , take up a lamentation upon the king of Tyrus , and say unto him , Thus saith the Lord GOD ;
Thou sealest up the sum , full of wisdom , and perfect in beauty . "
13 Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God ; every precious stone was thy covering , the sardius , topaz , and the diamond , the beryl , the onyx , and the jasper , the sapphire , the emerald , and the carbuncle , and gold : the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou wast created .
14 Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth ; and I have set thee so : thou wast upon the holy mountain of God ; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire . "
This is not an earthly king , as the word " cherub " is only used in references to angels .
15 " Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created , till iniquity was found in thee . "
16 By the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence , and thou hast sinned : therefore I will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God : and I will destroy thee , O covering cherub , from the midst of the stones of fire .
The word " covering " is from the Hebrew word cakak , and means : to entwine , to fence in , cover over , protect , defend , hedge in , ( source " The complete word study Old Testament " )
Was Lucifer ’s job to protect the very earth he corrupted ?
Was this one of his duties that gave him so much pride ?
17 Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty , thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness : I will cast thee to the ground , I will lay thee before kings , that they may behold thee .
0 18 Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities , by the iniquity of thy traffick ; therefore will I bring forth a fire from the midst of thee , it shall devour thee , and I will bring thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that behold thee .
Question :
" Where does Satan and the fall fit into all of this ?
He must have been cast down before Adam and Eve were created because he was there to tempt Eve in the Garden ?
Was there , could there have been , a pre-Adamic age - and surly this would have been a catastrophic event ?
Best regards
Amanda S. Q. 6/19/01
Answer :
Satan was cast out of heaven after Adam and Eve were created , because God said the Creation was still " very good " on day 6 after man had been created .
There was nothing and no one here before Adam and Eve.
Read my page disproving the Gap Theory for more information .
Isaiah 14:12
" How art thou fallen from heaven , O Lucifer , son of the morning !
how art thou cut down to the ground , which didst weaken the nations !
13 For thou hast said in thine heart , I will ascend into heaven , I will exalt my throne above the stars of God : I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation , in the sides of the north :
Satan wanted to be God .
The Bible tells us in 2nd Corinthians 4:4 that Satan has become the " god of this world " .
And Revelation 20:10 tells us that he will be eternally punished for it .
15 Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell , to the sides of the pit .
When Lucifer was cast out of Heaven , one third of all the angels were cast out with him .
( Rev.12:4,9 )
Revelation 12:4-9 ( King James Version )
" And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven , and did cast them to the earth : and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered , for to devour her child as soon as it was born .
(5) And she brought forth a man child , who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron : and her child was caught up unto God , and to his throne .
( 6) And the woman fled into the wilderness , where she hath a place prepared of God , that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days .
( 7) And there was war in heaven : Michael and his angels fought against the dragon ; and the dragon fought and his angels , ( 8 ) And prevailed not ; neither was their place found any more in heaven .
( 9) And the great dragon was cast out , that old serpent , called the Devil , and Satan , which deceiveth the whole world : he was cast out into the earth , and his angels were cast out with him . "
Lucifer became Satan , and the fallen angels became Demons .
Why did n't God just destroy Satan ?
Because sin had entered the world , and into the very nature of man through Adams transgression , then for God to destroy Satan , he would also have had to destroy the man he loved .
But God had a better way .
A way of Redemption .
And Christ the Redeemer was on His way !
What does Satan look like ?
We 've all seen pictures of Satan portrayed as a hoofed creature , red in color .. with little horns on his head .
But this description is not Biblical .
The hoofed being we usually see is actually closer to that of " Pan " from Greek mythology .
Perhaps Satan wants this image of himself to be used , because of its absurdity .
Knowing that the day would come when God and the Devil would both be dismissed as " mythical "
Revelation 12:3 speaks of the red horned dragon .
This is not Satan himself , but a reference to him from where these physical attributes possibly originate .
Revelation 12:3 ( KJV )
And there appeared another wonder in heaven ; and behold a great red dragon , having seven heads and ten horns , and seven crowns upon his heads .
The Book of " Ezekiel " tells us what Lucifer really looked like before he sinned .
Lucifer was a being " of perfect beauty " .
He was covered in every precious stone .
He had pendants and jewels of gold ...
Lucifer was beautiful before he sinned .
An expression of Gods own beauty and power .
But like man , Lucifer ’s very nature changed when he sinned .
His ( Lucifer ’s ) physical appearance may have as well .
When did Lucifer fall from Heaven ?
It was not before day 6 like many people believe ( those who believe the " Gap Theory " wrongly claim this ) .
The Bible tells us that Lucifer was in Eden ( which was created on day 6 ) and was still without sin on that day .
Ezekiel 28:13 ( KJV )
“ Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God ; every precious stone was thy covering , the sardius , topaz , and the diamond , the beryl , the onyx , and the jasper , the sapphire , the emerald , and the carbuncle , and gold : the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou wast created . "
In the literature of our society , Satan is almost always shown in robes of red .
Some believe that the color of an angels robes are symbolic of their rank in heaven .
I am unaware of a scripture to support this however .
There is a coming judgment of Satan and his angels .
< center > 2 Peter 2:4 ( KJV ) " For if God spared not the angels that sinned , but cast them down to hell [ the Greek word here is " tartarus " ] , and delivered them into chains of darkness , to be reserved unto judgment ; ”
Jude 1:6 ( KJV )
“ And the angels which kept not their first estate , but left their own habitation , he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day . "
In the day of judgment “ … the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone , where the beast and the false prophet are , and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever .
John 17 : ( verify verse # ) talks of the time of judgment , the prince of this world will be driven out .
Hell was not made for man .
Hell was prepared for the devil and his angels .
But those who do not receive Christ as their Lord and Savior will be sent to Hell , and have their part in the lake of fire .
Satan is " the god of this world " he " has blinded the minds of unbelievers , so that they cannot see the light of the Gospel of the Glory of Christ " ( 2 Corinthians 4;4 )
Satan is a liar .
The Bible tells us he is the father of all lies .
John 8:44 ( KJV )
" Ye are of your father the devil , and the lusts of your father ye will do .
He was a murderer from the beginning , and abode not in the truth , because there is no truth in him .
When he speaketh a lie , he speaketh of his own : for he is a liar , and the father of it . "
He will deceive man in any way he can .
Some are deceived by the New Age Movement , others are deceived by Humanists , Evolutionary lies , etc .

An unhealthy lifestyle may be to blame for the gender divide
The reluctance of men to adopt a healthy lifestyle and visit the doctor may be fuelling a gender gap in cancer cases and deaths , experts say .
Among cancers which affect both sexes , men are 60 % more likely to develop the disease and 70 % more likely to die from it , Cancer Research UK said .
There is no known biological reason for this but it may be because women take better care of themselves , they said .
Experts said men needed to be made aware of the risks they faced .
It is thought half of all cancers can be prevented through lifestyle changes .
For the latest report , published to coincide with Men's Health Week , researchers first analysed data on all cancers from 2006 and 2007 .
Delays in reporting symptoms to a doctor could be helping to fuel this gender gap in cancer mortality
Sara Hiom , Cancer Research UK
They found that overall men are 40 % more likely than women to die from cancer and 16 % more likely to develop the disease in the first place .
But excluding breast cancer and cancers that are gender specific , as well as lung cancer which is more likely to affect men because more men smoke , the difference between the sexes was far greater .
TOP MALE CANCER KILLERS 2007 Lung : 24 % of all cancer deaths Prostate : 13 % Colorectal : 10 % Oesophagus : 6 % Pancreas : 5 % The researchers had expected to see that men and women are just as likely as each other to develop and die from the disease .
However , the figures showed that men are significantly more likely than women to be diagnosed with and die from every one of the specific types of cancer considered , apart from melanoma .
' Surprise result ' Professor David Forman , information lead for the National Cancer Intelligence Network , which helped carry out the research , said : " For many of the types of cancer we looked at that affect both sexes , there 's no known biological reason why men should be at a greater risk than women , so we were surprised to see such consistent differences . "

He added : " Men have a reputation for having a ' stiff upper lip ' and not being as health conscious as women .
" What we see from this report could be a reflection of this attitude , meaning men are less likely to make lifestyle changes that could reduce their risk of the disease and less likely to go to their doctor with cancer symptoms . "
We have to look very much more at how we change the services so they are more male appropriate
Professor Alan White Professor Alan
White , chairman of the Men's Health Forum , said men were generally less aware that factors such as smoking , carrying excess weight around the waist , having a high alcohol intake , a poor diet and family history all contributed to an increased cancer risk .
However , he said more research was needed on the causes of the gender gap and services needed to do more to reach out to men .
Professor
White told the BBC : " Men have got a certain degree of responsibility to look to their lifestyle , but the services also have to be reaching out to men .
" If you think that nearly 14 m men work full - time and of those 28 % are working over 45 hours , then getting to the services is actually very problematic .
" And it 's not just the GP , it 's smoking cessation services , it 's weight loss services .
' Get it checked ' " We have to look very much more at how we change the services so they are more male appropriate .
" I think if you are suffering from something and it's not going away , then get it checked out .
That 's the simple message . "
The government 's cancer tsar , Professor Mike Richards , said there was no doubt of the gravity of the findings .
HAVE YOUR SAY
Men are more reluctant to visit the doctor and monitor themselves for signs of illness Julie , London Prof Richards told the BBC : " I agree with Professor White that the scale of this has come as a surprise even to researchers .
" There seems to be no doubt - there is a higher risk of getting cancer and a higher risk of death .
" That maybe due to different ways of approaching the health services and being less likely to seek help .
" We certainly need to make men aware of these risks , of the lifestyle factors . "
Sara Hiom , director of health information at Cancer Research UK , said : " We know that around half of all cancers could be prevented by changes to lifestyle and it's worrying that this message could be falling on deaf ears for men .
" Delays in reporting symptoms to a doctor could be helping to fuel this gender gap in cancer mortality . "

A deprecated feature in Perl 5 is a feature which is confusing , difficult to support , difficult to understand , difficult to use correctly , difficult to use safely , or an accident of implementation no one wants to maintain in the future .
There 's no written deprecation policy for Perl 5 .
By rough consensus of practice , a deprecation notice must appear in at least one major release of Perl 5 before anyone can consider removing the deprecated feature .
Thus deprecating , for example , the Switch module in Perl 5.10 means that it may not be a core module in Perl 5.12 .
It may remain in core for Perl 5.12 , but you the purpose of a deprecation period is to encourage you to migrate away from it before the release of Perl 5.12 .
( I chose this example deliberately ; the given / when construct backported from Perl 6 to Perl 5.10 obviates the need for the fragile Switch module .
It 's easy to argue for its removal . )
Recent Deprecation Discussions
The issue of removing deprecated features comes up on p5 p periodically .
For example , George Greer suggested removing the Perl 4 pseudo - package separator ; you can use the tick to separate package names like you use double - colons in Perl 5 .
Thus D'oh uses this old syntax where the modern syntax would be D :: oh .
Is this a problem ?
Tatsuhiko Miyagawa gave an example :
use strict ; my $ name = " Joe " ; print " $ name 's birthday is tomorrow
" ;
Add the warnings pragma for a hint at what might be wrong .
If you 're using anything older than Perl 5.10 , good luck at guessing at the problem -- Perl 5.10 's warning message expands the name of the variable to $ name : :s , which is substantially more helpful , if you know that ' is synonymous with :: .
The correct way to write this code with interpolation is :
use strict ; my $ name = " Joe " ; print " $ {name} 's birthday is tomorrow
" ;
That wo n't win any beauty contests .
( Or should I say " That { wo n}'t win any beauty contests . " )
On PerlMonks today , the hash reference question demonstrated code which worked but confused a novice terribly :
% package = ( ' zips ' => { 1,2,3,4} ) ; print % package -> {zips} ;
You can dereference a hash ( not a hash reference ) with the dereferencing arrow , but if you enable warnings , you will receive the message :
Using a hash as a reference is deprecated ...
A Selection of Deprecated Features
If you browse perldiag , you 'll find several other deprecated features .
Some of them are recent .
Many of them have remained deprecated for several years .
( Though it 's tempting to put the Perl 4 pseudo - package separator in this category , it 's more accurate to say that the Perl 5 syntax has superseded it for fifteen years . )
You wo n't get all of them ; you have to dive into the source for all of them .
Yet here are a few of my favorites .
Really old Perl let you omit the @ on array names in some spots .
This is now heavily deprecated .
my @nums = 1 .. 4 ; push nums , 5 ; This throws a compilation error about an undeclared nums when run with strict , but the code gets through the parser .
Really old Perl let you omit the % on hash names in some spots .
This is now heavily deprecated .
This is similar ; you can convince keys to operate on a hash if you omit the sigil as well .
You have used the attributes pragam to modify the locked attribute on a code reference .
The : locked attribute is obsolete , has had no effect since 5005 threads were removed , and will be removed in the next major release of Perl 5 .
This message has been around for a while .
You have used the attributes pragam to modify the unique attribute on an array , hash or scalar reference .
The : unique attribute has had no effect since Perl 5.8.8 , and will be removed in the next major release of Perl 5 .
After 5.10.1 , it should be safe to remove both of these attributes from bleadperl ( what will become 5.12 ) .
defined ( ) is not usually useful on arrays because it checks for an undefined scalar value .
If you want to see if the array is empty , just use if ( @array ) { # not empty } .
This message has been around for a while .
It might be more useful as a parser syntax error .
defined ( ) is not usually useful on hashes because it checks for an undefined scalar value .
If you want to see if the hash is empty , just use if ( %hash ) { # not empty } for example .
This message has been around for a while .
You used a declaration similar to my $x if 0 .
There has been a long - standing bug in Perl that causes a lexical variable not to be cleared at scope exit when its declaration includes a false conditional .
Some people have exploited this bug to achieve a kind of static variable .
Since we intend to fix this bug , we do n't want people relying on this behavior .
This is a newer deprecation ; the state keyword added in Perl 5.10 provides a better way to declare and use static lexical variables in Perl 5 .
The $ [ variable ( index of the first element in an array ) is deprecated .
I believe this is on the removal schedule for Perl 5.12 .
Use of implicit split to @_ is deprecated
It makes a lot of work for the compiler when you clobber a subroutine 's argument list , so it 's better if you assign the results of a split ( ) explicitly to an array ( or list ) .
Michael Schwern posted a patch to Remove implicit split to @_ .
As his message points out , this is another Perl 4 feature deprecated with the release of Perl 5.000 in October 1994 .
What 's the problem ?
The use of split in scalar context .
When you use split that way , Perl 5 clobbers @_ with the list of results .
This patch generated a lot of discussion .
You used the package keyword without specifying a package name .
So no namespace is current at all .
Using this can cause many otherwise reasonable constructs to fail in baffling ways .
use strict ; instead .
This message baffles me , but apparently you can get around declaring variables in some cases if you write package ; .
You tried to use a hash as a reference , as in % foo - > { " bar " } or % $ref - > { " hello " } .
Versions of perl <= 5.6.1 used to allow this syntax , but should n't have .
It is now deprecated , and will be removed in a future version .
I like how the code examples quote hash keys .
This is a newer deprecation notice ; it 's only been around for eight years .
You tried to use an array as a reference , as in @foo - >[ 23 ] or @$ref - >[ 99 ] .
Versions of perl <= 5.6.1 used to allow this syntax , but should n't have .
It is now deprecated , and will be removed in a future version .
This has also been around for eight years .
The Deprecation Argument ( and a possible solution )
The arguments for removing these deprecated features ( with the appropriate deprecation period ) are simple : they simplify Perl 5's internals , they remove confusing syntax corner cases , and they encourage people to write better code .
The arguments for retaining these features are likewise simple : modifying code may cause bugs and removing features may break existing code .
I have less sympathy for the con side ; I find its arguments unconvincing .
The arguments are especially thin as deprecating a feature means adding a warning for it .
This means not only modifying code , but changing its behavior .
The problem , I believe , is that there 's little impetus to migrate away from deprecated features ; features can remain deprecated for 15 years .
As well , there 's too little feedback on the effect of removing deprecated features on existing code .
I ponder the existence of an alternate Perl 5 binary with deprecated features removed ; would DarkPAN developers run it against their test suites and report any results where modifications are onerous ?
Would that provide sufficient data as to the effects of removing these features ?
( CNN ) --
The federal government will give $ 1 billion in grants to law enforcement agencies in every state to pay for the hiring and rehiring of law enforcement officers , Vice President Joe Biden and Attorney General Eric Holder announced Tuesday .
Police officers in Chicago , Illinois , patrol the streets in November 2008 .
The money comes from the stimulus bill -- the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 -- the officials said .
The law is designed to help pull the U.S. out of its recession by providing and saving jobs , and helping those most affected by the downturn in the economy .
Beneficiaries can include state , local and tribal governments .
The Department of Justice received more than 7,200 applications for more than 39,000 officer positions , representing a total of $ 8.3 billion in requested funding .
" The tremendous demand for these grants is indicative of both the tough times our states , cities and tribes are facing , and the unyielding commitment by law enforcement to making our communities safer , " said Attorney General Eric Holder in a statement .
Biden spoke of the bravery of police officers who never know when they might be shot , even on a simple call .
With rows of police officers standing behind him , he pointed out the hazards and uncertainty of police work .
" It 's just astounding to me how much we take for granted what you do , and thankfully how much you take for granted what you do , " said Biden .
" We ask you to go out to defend us , and you 're entitled to be equipped to defend us , " he added .
The Recovery Act includes $ 4 billion in Department of Justice grant funding to local law enforcement .
Some of this money was distributed to states previously to help crime victims , women who are targets of violence , Internet crimes against children and other needs .
The current round of grants will be awarded to 1,046 law enforcement agencies in all 50 states , and will provide 100 percent of the approved salary and benefits for 4,699 officers for three years .
Police departments that receive the money must retain the grant - funded positions for a fourth year .
The grants will be administered by the U.S. Department of Justice 's Office of Community Oriented Policing Services ( COPS ) .
Funding decisions were based on reported crimes for the previous calendar year , community policing activities , budget changes , and poverty , unemployment , and foreclosure rates in the area .
" These officers will go to the places where they are needed the most , " Holder said .
Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey , who attended the news conference , said five police officers were killed in the line of duty in his city between May 3 , 2008 , and February 13 , 2009 .
" So violence is very much a concern here in Philadelphia , " he said .
" There is far too much violence taking place every day on the streets of our city . "
Pennsylvania plans to create or save 93 law enforcement positions statewide by awarding more than $ 20 million to 19 law enforcement agencies .
The Philadelphia Police Department will be able to create and or preserve 50 jobs , according to the statement explaining the grants .
Pennsylvania is one of the hardest - hit states in terms of economic decline , officials said .
More than 19 percent of the families in Philadelphia live in poverty , and the unemployment rate jumped from 6.4 percent in 2008 to 8.8 percent in 2009 .

Greece lags behind the rest of Europe in terms of smoking legislation and attitudes .
The new campaign , banning smoking in public places as of Wednesday , is designed in part to reduce the heavy burden on government finances .
Each year , 20,000
Greeks die from tobacco related illnesses and the cost in terms of health care amounts to 2.14 billion euros ( $ 3 billion ) .
Some 40 percent of all Greeks smoke and 60 percent of the population is exposed to passive smoking in the workplace .
" The moment of truth has arrived , " said Health Minister Dimitris Avromopoulos .
" This ban aims to bring a change that will revolutionize people 's outlook .
Greek society is mature nowadays and ready for the ban . "
Under the new rules , smoking will be banned in hospitals , schools , vehicles and all public spaces .
Billboards advertising cigarettes will be banned .
Small cafes and restaurants with premises measuring less than 70 square meters can choose either to be tobacco free or to admit smoking only patrons .
Bigger establishments can have clearly identified and ventilated smoking areas .
In order to give teeth to the new regulations , smokers who break the law can be fined up to 500 euros .
On the first offence , businesses will be fined 1,000 euros .
Repeat offenders will face even bigger fines , and ultimately on the fourth violation could risk losing their license .
Bad for business ?
Athens nightlife wo n't be the same with the smoking ban
In a country that has grown its own tobacco for centuries and seems to exist within a fog of nicotine fumes , many regard the new law as an infringement of civil liberties .
" It 's going to be bad for business to start with , especially with the Greeks because everybody smokes , " said restaurant manager Lisa Panti as she lit a cigarette outside the Gondola in Corfu 's old town .
" And if they can't smoke in the restaurant they are n't going to come out .
It 's really bad , it 's stupid . "
Panti said in terms of income , the new law is going to be bad for business everywhere .
But Pericles Katsaros at the rival Rex restaurant 100 meters along the same pedestrian street disagreed .
" Look it 's really good for restaurants , because if you stop smoking in closed rooms , it does n't smell bad and customers can enjoy their food , " Katsaros said .
Difficulties enforcing the law
The Health Ministry has promised that its new anti-smoking task force will swoop on premises within twenty minutes of receiving a complaint about cigarettes .
But the head of the unit responsible for implementing the new rules has promised that it will be done gradually .
On paper , it would appear that Greece 's measures look certain to succeed .
But this is a country with a long tradition of defiance .
Parliament is adept at introducing new legislation , but enforcement in many areas is an institutionalized failure .
Will Greeks snub out their smokes the way they 're told ?
Tens of thousands of motorcyclists , for example , routinely ignore rules demanding that they wear crash helmets .
Motorists share a cavalier attitude towards regulations and frequently treat traffic lights as being a suggestion rather than compulsory .
Hundreds of millions of euros have been spent on closed circuit surveillance cameras in Athens and other cities , but they are idle because of public resistance .
Why should smoking be any different ?
There may be occasional blitzes by the authorities , but unless the rules are firmly and consistently applied , they are at risk of failing .
" I really think smoking is a bad habit , " said Anastasia Pettas from the island of Zakynthos .
" But Greeks are not used to following rules . "
Pettas said a fine of 500 or 1,000 euros wo n't force people to quit .
" It 's just the way Greeks react to any regulations , " she said .
" It 's our culture , I think .
We do n't go according to the rules , we go according to our minds . "
Her friend , Denise Patra , agreed .
" When you try to make Greeks do something , it 's worse , " Patra said .
" They do the opposite on purpose and they are going to continue to do so .
But I 'm happy about the new rules , because where ever I go , everybody smokes , and I can't stand the smell .
I hope it works . "

OLATHE , Colo .
—A western Colorado police officer faces a domestic violence charge after a woman claimed he beat her regularly as part of a relationship contract that called for corporal punishment .
Olathe ( oh - LAY ’- thuh ) Officer Michael Percival was arrested June 26 on suspicion of misdemeanor assault .
Town Attorney David Masters says Percival has been suspended pending a hearing .
There was no answer Thursday at a number listed for Percival .
A deputy booking the woman into jail on unrelated charges discovered marks that the woman said came from beatings from a belt .
Investigators say the woman showed them two contracts allegedly written by Percival that concerned her hygiene , sexual behavior and clothing and spelled out punishments , including beatings with a belt .

A s we near the end of the first decade of the 21st century , the challenges of global governance in an increasingly inter-connected and multi-polar world are truly formidable .
Our institutions of global governance , centred on what may be called the UN system , were designed for the most part at the end of the Second World War and reflected the politico - economic realities of that age .
The world was then dominantly bipolar , in the political and military sense , international trade and international capital flows were low , the developing countries were not economically important , indeed most of them were not even independent .
There has been a sea-change since then .
Bipolarity has given way to multi-polarity , the developing countries are not only sovereign states but some group of developing countries have gained in relative economic importance and this trend will only gain momentum .
The world has also become much more interconnected through the expansion of trade in goods and services and expansion of financial flows generated by capital account liberalisation .
Interconnection has in turn greatly increased problems of contagion and vulnerability especially through financial linkages .
Our established institutions of global governance have evolved to some extent in response to these changes , but much less than they should have and the pace of evolution is likely to remain well behind the rate at which the world is changing .
The centre piece of the post - war global architecture is the United Nations , conceived originally as the Parliament of the nations with the Security Council at its apex .
The size of the international parliament has of course expanded and while there is occasional cynicism about how effectively the General Assembly can reflect global opinion , and especially evolve workable solutions on key issues , there is no doubt that it serves a valuable purpose in giving voice to every country .
However , this is not the same thing as saying that we have a structure which is functionally efficient and capable of dealing with the complex challenges the world faces today .
The Security Council has not changed at all and its present structure poses serious problems of legitimacy .
The system of two - tiered membership , which gives a veto to the five permanent members , ie , the nations that emerged victorious after the Second World War , is clearly anachronistic .
Germany and Japan , which have significantly larger economies than Britain and France , both permanent members , are excluded .
China is the only developing country in the P - 5 and it is there for historical reasons , not as a large and economically important developing country .
It is obvious that if the system was being designed today it would be very different .
However , while the problems have long been recognised , efforts to reform the system have made little headway .
The unworkability of the existing structures has led to greater reliance on plurilateral groupings .
Some of these such as the G - 7 , later expanded to the G - 8 , are to be seen as a group of countries with common interest , not necessarily representative of the global community .
The original rationale of the G - 7 was the belief that it would evolve more effective consultation among the more powerful countries on one side of the bipolar world of the 1970s and 1980s .
Its expansion to the G - 8 reflects the disappearance of that particular faultline by the collapse of the Soviet Union .
However , while the Group includes many of the economically powerful nations , it is obviously not representative as it does not include any developing country .
Some years ago the G - 8 has been expanded into the G - 8+5 by adding China , India , Brazil , Mexico and South Africa .
More recently , the group has been expanded even further to include a handful of countries in the name of achieving additional outreach .
While these ad hoc expansions are a useful way of broadening the range of consultation undertaken by the G - 8 , it suffers from two limitations .
The expanded group is not cohesive since the countries included for purposes of outreach do not participate fully in the proceedings , or the preparations , and the expanded group therefore does not have a composite identity .
Second , these groupings do not have any special legitimacy within the UN system .
The deficiencies of the existing system of governance have been dramatically brought home during the recent international financial and economic crisis .
The crisis has highlighted the fact that all economies are now highly inter-connected and problems originating in one part of the world economy can quickly snowball into a global crisis .
It has forcefully exposed fundamental weaknesses in the approach to financial regulation which emphasised light regulation and greater reliance on inhouse controls and market discipline to control risk .
This approach gained popularity in the 1990s and is now perceived to have been overdone .
The issue has revealed the inadequacies in the existing domestic regulatory systems in the industrialised countries and also in the international institutions set up to police these areas and to take remedial action when needed .
Whatever the causes and specific failures underlying the crisis , the world was quick to realise that a global crisis requires a global solution .
It was also realised that the existing institutions of global governance did not permit effective coordination of a global response .
The world therefore responded not by working within the existing system , but by convening a meeting of the G - 20 at the level of leaders .
The G - 20 was established in 1999 at the suggestion of Paul Martin of Canada and has a composition which is somewhat different from the IMFC which meets regularly at the finance ministers level .
The G - 20 has been meeting at the level of finance ministers since 1999 .
Recognising the seriousness of the crisis , the United States convened a meeting of the leaders of the Group of 20 in Washington DC in November 2008 .
The Group met again in London in April 2009 .
Unlike the G - 8+5 , this group has a composite identity since all member countries participate on equal terms including in the preparatory process .
However , the selection of countries remains arbitrary and can be questioned as to its representativeness , especially since it departs from the composition of the IMFC which reflects the representation on the Board of the IMF .
The G - 20 meeting in London certainly achieved a great deal more than normal meetings of this type , especially in two respects .
First , it succeeded in expanding the perimeter of financial regulation and endorsing the establishment of global standards to which national standards can be aligned .
These standards will be developed by the Financial Stability Forum ( now renamed the Financial Stability Board ) which has been expanded to include all G - 20 countries that were not members earlier .
Second , it achieved a significant expansion in funding for the Bretton Woods Institutions .
However , it did not achieve any significant reform of the international financial institutions .
The Group has decided to meet again in September and it remains to be seen whether it will be able to evolve some ideas for making significant reforms by then .
The problems faced by the institutions of governance charged with handling the financial system are also relevant for other international institutions dealing with political and security issues , trade , climate change , etc .
They need to update structures and upgrade work methods ; reform decision - making and ensure effective delivery .
They need to adapt , adjust and accommodate to adequately reflect ground realities , contemporary aspirations , and pressing requirements of developing countries including emerging economies .
India , as the largest democracy in the world and an emerging economy that has achieved the ability to grow rapidly , remains deeply committed to multilateralism .
It has been an active member in global institutions -- the United Nations , Bretton Woods Institutions , World Trade Organisation , International Atomic Energy Agency and so on .
It will continue to be so in the decades ahead , based on commitment to principles and values that define these institutions .
India will seek its due place , play its destined role and share its assigned responsibility , giving voice to the hopes and aspirations of a billion people in South Asia .
It will continue to strive for the reform of the United Nations to make it more democratic ; to fight against the scourge of terrorism and dismantling its infrastructures on the basis of zero tolerance ; to fight piracy on the high seas ; to restructure the Bretton Woods Institutions to create a new financial architecture ; to achieve an early conclusion of the Doha Round of trade negotiations , with its development dimension , and to address climate change issues , guided by the principle of common but differentiated responsibility and respective capability .
India 's view of the world has always been guided by the wisdom of that ancient Indian saying -- Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam -- ' the whole world is one family ' .
This idea found expression in Jawaharlal Nehru 's very first address as prime minister : ' Those dreams are for India , but they are also for the world , for all the nations and peoples are too closely knit together today for any of them to imagine that it can live apart .
Peace has been said to be indivisible ; so is freedom , so is prosperity now and so also is disaster in this One World that can no longer be split into isolated fragments .
That eternal message of the Indian people will guide us in our attempt to seek inclusive global solutions to intractable global problems , and give new hope to humanity . '
For a little while last night , Chris Mortensen was tweeting the names of players drafted in the first annual UFL draft .
It was reminiscent of the NFL Draft back in April , minus the drama and intrigue .
I took notice , but my interest was fleeting .
Even Mort gave up after about an hour .
Perusing the list of draftees , no former Eagles jumped out .
However , I ’m sure there is some diligent blogger out there combing through past rosters searching for an obscure undrafted free agent or practice squad flunky who had a cup of coffee with the Birds a few years back .
That would require intense research and I ’m still exhausted from my wide receiver post on Wednesday .
A few “ big ” names did catch my eye : Chris Perry , the ex-Bengal and former first - round bust is now a proud member of the Orlando ?????
( none of the teams have chosen a surname ) .
The bumbling Adam Archuleta amazingly continues to find work , this time with the Las Vegas ?????.
And BJ Sams , formerly of the Chiefs and Ravens , will be picking up stakes for San Francisco .
( Shockingly , Freddie Mitchell , Todd Pinkston and Tony Hunt went undrafted .
UFL ’s loss , if you ask me . )
Larry Fitzgerald ’s bro Marcus is headed to San Francisco .
He ’s a receiver , who went to Marshall , but that ’s where the comparisons to Randy Moss end .
Family dinners at the Fitzgerald household this fall should be entertaining :
Comment from a drunk Uncle to Larry :
“ Larry , you are lookin ’ unstoppable this year .
Super Bowl bound again !!I can feel it . ”
Comment from same drunk Uncle to Marcus :
“ Where the hell are you playin ’ , Marcus ?
CFL ?
XFL ?
Europe ?
I ca n’t keep track … ”
John David Washington , son of the Oscar - winning Denzel Washington , will also shuffle off to the Bay area .
I ’m certain he will perform at a high level .
Hopefully , he will put on a great act during training camp .
He possesses star quality .
I see glory in his future .
I hear he got game .
Okay , I ’ll stop now .
Steve Sanders was picked by New York .
It seems like yesterday when Steve was chillin’ at the Peach Pit with Brandon and Dylan and Andrea .
I was under the impression Steve lived and breathed beach volleyball .
I had no idea he excelled on the gridiron as well .
Clearly , he ’s a man of many talents .
Since the four UFL franchises require mascots , I thought I ’d give them a helping hand .
I ’m nothing if not charitable .
So , New York , Orlando , Las Vegas and San Francisco are the lucky cities .
I ’ve been tossing around several potential monikers for the last couple days .
I feel confident these are more than suitable .
New York Airbuses – A combination of Giants and Jets . A giant jet = Airbus .
Genius .
Orlando Black Magic –
Ties in perfectly with their roundball neighbors .
Las Vegas Degenerates – A haggard alcoholic with bloodshot eyes and a three - day growth slumped at a $ 10 blackjack table sounds about right .
San Francisco Mighty Pucks – Named after the most hated cast member in the history of The Real World .
The UFL will thank me later .
I ’m not even asking for anything , but I will take a pair of 50 - yard - line seats to the first game , if they are so inclined .
I have a suspicion plenty of tickets are available .
Stay tuned for the UFL , coming to a football stadium near you this October .
Are you ready ?
Microsoft has made its second release under the General Public License in two days with software for the open - source online learning system Moodle .
Microsoft released the Live Services Plug - in for Moodle under the GPLv2 , a move outlined in a blog post by Peter Galli , a community manager for Microsoft 's Platform Strategy Group .
The plug - in adds Microsoft 's Live@edu services such as e-mail , calendar , instant messaging and search directly into the Moodle user experience and makes them available via single sign - on , he wrote .
Moodle is a free open - source course management system that teachers use to create online learning Web sites for their classes , and it has about 30 million users in 207 countries , according to Galli .
The Microsoft Live Services Plug - in for Moodle is the first of what will be a set of software releases for the education community that Microsoft will make available for download online via its Education Labs Web site , the company said through its public relations firm .
Until Monday Microsoft had not released anything under the GPL -- a popular open - source license it 's criticized in the past -- but now the company seems to be embracing it .
While Tuesday 's release certainly is not as significant as Monday 's unprecedented release of 20,000 lines of code to the Linux kernel , including drivers for virtualizing the open - source OS on Microsoft 's Hyper - V software , it is indicative of a trend the company started about two years ago to work more closely with the open - source community .
This trend is in part a nod to the growing heterogeneity of IT environments , in which Linux and proprietary technologies like Microsoft software are increasingly being deployed side by side .
But even while on one hand Microsoft is working more closely with the community , on the other it continues to strike patent deals with open - source companies to collect royalties for patents it says it holds on technologies found in Linux and other open - source software .
In general , Microsoft continues to uphold its proprietary intellectual property licensing strategy -- the opposite of the philosophy behind open source .
The most recent patent deal came last week with the Japanese company Melco Holdings -- the parent company of Buffalo Inc. and
Buffalo Group .
Microsoft and Melco agreed to provide Melco customers patent coverage for their use of Buffalo - branded network - attached storage devices and routers running Linux .
In exchange , Melco will pay royalties to Microsoft .

Odaiba is some sort of shopping , tourist and leisure part of Tokyo and soon waiting with another attraction for the world - visitors .
Right at the moment they build a 18 meter high " Gundam RX - 78 " robot , with a weight of 35 tons , in order to celebrate the 30 anniversary of the robot - anime TV - series .
Wikipedia hold some information about the series , and there is always a lot of things to learn .
The Gundam for example are Real Robots , in opposition to Super Robots .
This means , that they are close to reality , and for example need maintenance on a regular basis and do not have unrealistic super - weapons .
Leaving us with this question behind :
What will happen to the giant Gundam robot in Tokyo in the near future ?
Will it get really to life on some day ?

MANCHESTER , New Hampshire ( Reuters ) - New Hampshire on Wednesday became the sixth U.S. state to authorize gay marriage , deepening a New England niche for same - sex weddings and the spending that comes with them .
New Hampshire ’s Democratic - controlled House of Representatives endorsed gay marriage in a 198 - 176 vote , hours after the state Senate approved the legislation 14 - 10 along party lines , making the state the fourth this year to back gay marriage in the United States .
Governor John Lynch , a Democrat , signed the bill , which goes into effect on January 1 .
“ Today , we are standing up for the liberties of same - sex couples by making clear that they will receive the same rights , responsibilities , and respect , under New Hampshire law , ” Lynch said in a statement .
The law also recognizes out - of - state gay marriages and civil unions , which are legal in just a handful of U.S. states including New Hampshire .
Same - sex couples who have civil unions in New Hampshire will automatically be married January 1 , 2011 .
Last month , the New Hampshire House rejected a similar bill .
But Senate and House members met last week to approve new language giving clergy and religious institutions opposed to gay marriage greater protections , including the legal right to decline to marry same - sex couples .
Opponents , mostly religious conservatives , see gay marriage as a threat to the “ traditional family ” that is ordained by God and the foundation of civilization .
Supporters often compare it to the path blazed by the civil rights movement .
PROTECTING RELIGIOUS BELIEFS
New Hampshire ’s bill says religious organizations , associations or societies will have “ exclusive control ” over their religious “ doctrines , teachings and beliefs ” .
Organizations affiliated with religious groups that operate for charitable or educational purposes can deny marriage services to gay individuals , it adds .
“ The ( changes ) strike the appropriate balance between two important values we believe New Hampshire residents support : equal rights for all and the rights to religious freedom , ” said state Senator Deborah Reynolds , a Democrat .
Senate Republicans said the amendment did little to change a bill they oppose .
Republican state Senator Sheila Roberge said Democrats should support Republican calls for a referendum so voters can decide the issue .
Only a few countries , mostly European nations , allow gay marriage .
Forty - two U.S. states explicitly prohibit same - sex marriage , including 29 with constitutional amendments .
Last week , California ’s supreme court backed a ban on gay marriage by upholding a voter - approved proposition defining marriage as between a man and a woman .
In stark contrast , gay - marriage laws are expanding swiftly on the East Coast , especially in New England where Massachusetts became the first state to allow gay people to marry five years ago .
Gay and lesbian weddings have boosted the Massachusetts economy by about $ 111 million , according to a study by the Williams Institute of the University of California .
Same - sex couples have been getting married in Connecticut since last year and in Iowa since April .
Gay marriage laws in Vermont and Maine are due to take effect in September .
The New York State Assembly passed a gay marriage bill last month , but it faces an uphill battle in the state Senate .
With the vote in New Hampshire , five out of six New England states now have passed legislation authorizing gay marriage , making Rhode Island with its large Roman Catholic population the region ’s only hold - out .
Twenty years later , when the British foreign secretary , Arthur Balfour ( sponsor of the 1905 Aliens Act to restrict Jewish immigration to the UK ) , wanted the government to commit itself to a Jewish homeland in Palestine , his declaration was delayed - not by anti-semites but by leading figures in the British Jewish community .
They included a Jewish member of the cabinet who called Balfour 's pro-Zionism " anti-semitic in result " .
The creation of the state of Israel in 1948 has not put an end to the debate , though the issue has changed .
Today , the question is about Israel 's future .
Should it become a " post - Zionist " state , one that defines itself in terms of the sum of its citizens , rather than seeing itself as belonging to the entire Jewish people ?
This is a perfectly legitimate question and not anti-semitic in the least .
When people suggest otherwise - as Emanuele Ottolenghi did on these pages last Saturday - they simply add to the growing confusion .
Ottolenghi contends that " Zionism comprises a belief that Jews are a nation , and as such are entitled to self - determination as all other nations are " .
This is doubly confused .
First , the ideology of Jewish nationalism was irrelevant to many of the Jews , as well as non-Jewish sympathisers , who were drawn to the Zionist goal of creating a Jewish state in Palestine .
They saw Israel in purely humanitarian or practical terms : as a safe haven where Jews could live as Jews after centuries of being marginalised and persecuted .
This motive was strengthened by the Nazi murder of one - third of the world 's Jewish population , the wholesale destruction of Jewish communities in Europe , and the plight of masses of Jewish refugees with nowhere to go .
Second , you do not have to be an anti-semite to reject the belief that Jews constitute a separate nation in the modern sense of the word or that Israel is the Jewish nation state .
There is an irony here : it is a staple of anti-semitic discourse that Jews are a people apart , who form " a state within a state " .
Partly for this reason , some European anti-semites thought that the solution to " the Jewish question " might be for Jews to have a state of their own .
Herzl certainly thought he could count on the support of anti-semites .
What is anti-semitism ?
Although the word only goes back to the 1870s , anti-semitism is an old European fantasy about Jews .
The composer Richard Wagner exemplified it when he said : " I hold the Jewish race to be the born enemy of pure humanity and everything noble in it . "
An anti-semite sees Jews this way : they are an alien presence , a parasite that preys on humanity and seeks to dominate the world .
Across the globe , their hidden hand controls the banks , the markets and the media .
Even governments are under their sway .
And when revolutions occur or nations go to war , it is the Jews - clever , ruthless and cohesive - who invariably pull the strings and reap the rewards .
When this fantasy is projected on to Israel because it is a Jewish state , then anti-Zionism is anti-semitic .
And when zealous critics of Israel , without themselves being anti-semitic , carelessly use language , such as " Jewish influence " , that conjures up this fantasy , they are fuelling an anti-semitic current in the wider culture .
But Israel 's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip is no fantasy .
Nor is the spread of Jewish settlements in these territories .
Nor the unequal treatment of Jewish colonisers and Palestinian inhabitants .
Nor the institutionalised discrimination against Israeli Arab citizens in various spheres of life .
These are realities .
It is one thing to oppose Israel or Zionism on the basis of an anti-semitic fantasy ; quite another to do so on the basis of reality .
The latter is not anti-semitism .
But is n't excessive criticism of Israel or Zionism evidence of an anti-semitic bias ?
In his book , The Case for Israel , Alan Dershowitz argues that when criticism of Israel " crosses the line from fair to foul " it goes " from acceptable to anti-semitic " .
People who take this view say the line is crossed when critics single Israel out unfairly ; when they apply a double standard and judge Israel by harsher criteria than they use for other states ; when they misrepresent the facts so as to put Israel in a bad light ; when they vilify the Jewish state ; and so on .
All of which undoubtedly is foul .
But is it necessarily anti-semitic ?
No , it is not .
The Israeli -Palestinian conflict is a bitter political struggle .
The issues are complex , passions are inflamed , and the suffering is great .
In such circumstances , people on both sides are liable to be partisan and to " cross the line from fair to foul " .
When people who side with Israel cross that line , they are not necessarily anti-Muslim .
And when others cross the line on behalf of the Palestinian cause , this does not make them anti-Jewish .
It cuts both ways .
There is something else that cuts both ways : racism .
Both anti-Jewish and anti-Muslim feeling appear to be growing .
Each has its own peculiarities , but both are exacerbated by the Israeli - Palestinian conflict , the invasion of Iraq , the " war against terror " , and other conflicts .
We should unite in rejecting racism in all its forms : the Islamophobia that demonises Muslims , as well as the anti-semitic discourse that can infect anti-Zionism and poison the political debate .
However , people of goodwill can disagree politically - even to the extent of arguing over Israel 's future as a Jewish state .
Equating anti-Zionism with anti-semitism can also , in its own way , poison the political debate .

( h/t David E. )
Here it comes .
Been a Democrat for less than a week and already Arlen Specter is backtracking .
Is it any clearer that this Faustian bargain made for those fabled 60 votes is no bargain at all for the majority party ?
On Meet the Press , host David Gregory asks newly rebranded Senator Arlen Specter if it 's true that he told President Obama that he would be loyal to his new party and support Obama 's agenda .
No one could have predicted Specter 's response :
Gregory :
It was reported this week that when you met with the President , you said , “ I will be a loyal Democrat ; I support your agenda . ”
Let me test that on probably one of the most important areas of his agenda and that ’s healthcare .
Would you support healthcare reform that puts up a government - run public plan to compete with a private plan issued by a private insurance company .
Specter : No .
And you misquote me , David .
I did not say I would be a loyal Democrat .
I did not say that .
And last week , after I said I was changing parties , I voted against the budget because the budget has a way to pass healthcare with 51 votes , which undermines a basic Senate institution to require 60 votes to impose cloture on key issues .
Holy cow , where is the damn Senate leadership when you need it ?
Specter gets the attention he craves thumbing his nose at established political lines ( listen to what he had to say when Jim Jeffords left the GOP ) , brags about supporting the stimulus bill but then brags about not supporting a bill that would have enabled Americans to get the healthcare plan the majority of us want without the typical gamesmanship and obstructionism that mark GOP tactics now and brags that he cannot be counted on to support the Obama / Democratic agenda despite the fact that most people think Obama is on the right track .
Woo hoo !
What a great addition to the Democratic Party !
There is nothing new here .
We knew what Sarkozy 's vision of the future was : an " Islam of France " , " métissage " between races and ethnic groups , dissolution of nationalist , regional , and ethnic identities , subjugation to Brussels , openness to socialism , and a Turkey as closely aligned with Europe as possible , etc ...
But it 's always sobering to hear it again , from one who knows Sarkozy personally .
Philippe de Villiers was interviewed by the weekly Famille Chrétienne .
The Catholic blog Le Salon Beige relates part of the interview :
- Why are you so focused on the theme of Turkey and Islamization ?
- Quite simply because we will see the first transformations of churches into mosques in the coming three years .
At any rate , that is what Nicolas Sarkozy told me .
- When ? - I had an in depth discussion with him at Elysée at the end of last year .
He said to me : " You have intuition , I have the figures .
And your intuition is confirmed by my figures .
The Islamization of Europe is inevitable . "
Careful : it 's a process that will not occur overnight , but will take decades .
-
Why does this issue appear to be of central importance to you ?
-
Most politicians have a comforting ignorance of what Islam is and propose transforming Europe into a supermarket of competing religions .
Unaware that Islam is not only a religion since , by melding the temporal and the spiritual , it imposes a law .
But behind this comforting ignorance of politicians , there are those who know . (...)
The reality is that we are headed for a criss - cross [ chassé - croisé ] with , on one side , Europe and its en masse abortions , its promotion of gay marriage , and on the other , immigration en masse (... )
" Chassé - croisé " is virtually impossible to translate .
Originally a choreographic term , it usually refers to a crowded movement in one direction that passes but never encounters a crowded movement in another direction .
Sometimes it is just kept as is in English .
- Are n't you exaggerating the dimensions of the phenomenon ?
- No .
The crux of the issue is simple : Europe is refusing its own demographic future .
And it is working with a fearsome weapon towards this end , written into the Charter of fundamental rights appended to the treaty of Lisbon : the promotion of gay marriage .
This in turn is accomplished through the principle of non-discrimination and the disassociation of marriage from the sex of the spouses ( which appears in article 7 of the Charter of fundamental rights ) .
In reality , there are two weapons being used by European leaders to kill Europe demographically : the promotion of gay marriage and en masse abortions .
And a third : the recourse to immigration that is 80 % Islamic in order to replace the people who are no longer there (...)
As usual there are LSB readers who question Villiers ' sincerity and motives .
But this time , there are also many who applaud his courage .
He is certainly putting more muscle into his words on the eve of the election .
A spokesman for Elysée protested saying : " Philippe de Villiers is not the spokesman for Elysée .
He makes multiple declarations on this topic , declarations that obviously need to be regarded with caution . "
I ran across this while reading this news : Paralysed Kids Buried For Solar Eclipse Cure .
As a parent and an atheist it makes my heart so sad for these children .
Imagine being these kids
Your parents tell you that you might be able to walk and run with the other children .
The solar eclipse has magical healing powers along with the power of god .
The excitement and hope begins to build .
A joyous and miraculous thing is about to happen .
God is going to fix you .
A holy man is praying over you while an astronomical event takes place .
And then nothing happens .
What is going through these people ’s minds ?
( I ca n’t say to know , but I have an idea )
What do the kids think ?
Did I do something wrong ?
Is it my fault ?
Why does god continue to punish me ?
Why does god not hear me ?
What do the parents think ?
God is punishing us for our sins
What can we do to make god fix our child ?
Should I pray more devoutly ?
Do I need to teach my children more about god ?
Do I need to believe more ?
What does the holy man think ?
Sinners .
God is all powerful , it must be their fault if they are not healed .
I feel helpless
What can I do about such a situation ?
I could scoff and call them uneducated , but this kind of thing happens in my own country .
I feel so bad for these kids .
I want to shout ‘ STOP LYING TO YOUR KIDS !’
They really need support from their community and family .
I ’d take a pair of helping hands over praying hands anytime .

The grey clouds glowering over Istanbul on Thursday seemed to match the mood in the paddock ahead of the Turkish Grand Prix .
If Monte Carlo 's sunshine signalled an entente cordiale between the sport 's governing body , the FIA , and F1 Teams ' Association ( Fota ) over the future of the sport then Turkey 's damp weather brought more confusion and uncertainty .
At the Monaco Grand Prix , it appeared that FIA president Max Mosley was prepared to give ground on his plans to impose a 45 m euro ( £ 39.6 m ) budget in 2010 .
It all seemed to be agreed ; the teams would continue to compete under the existing rules and would be able to spend up to 100 m euro ( £ 87.6 m ) next year with the full cap introduced in 2011 .
Mosley was also understood to be ready to sign a new Concorde Agreement - or at least an extension to the one that expired in 2007 - which would give the teams more say in how the sport is governed .
In return , the established teams offered to share knowledge with any new outfits entering next season .
A well - established physical law describes the transfer of heat between two objects , but some physicists have long predicted that the law should break down when the objects are very close together .
Scientists had never been able to confirm , or measure , this breakdown in practice .
For the first time , however , MIT researchers have achieved this feat , and determined that the heat transfer can be 1,000 times greater than the law predicts .
The new findings could lead to significant new applications , including better design of the recording heads of the hard disks used for computer data storage , and new kinds of devices for harvesting energy from heat that would otherwise be wasted .
Planck 's blackbody radiation law , formulated in 1900 by German physicist Max Planck , describes how energy is dissipated , in the form of different wavelengths of radiation , from an idealized non-reflective black object , called a blackbody .
The law says that the relative thermal emission of radiation at different wavelengths follows a precise pattern that varies according to the temperature of the object .
The emission from a blackbody is usually considered as the maximum that an object can radiate .
The law works reliably in most cases , but Planck himself had suggested that when objects are very close together , the predictions of his law would break down .
But actually controlling objects to maintain the tiny separations required to demonstrate this phenomenon has proved incredibly difficult .
" Planck was very careful , saying his theory was only valid for large systems , " explains Gang Chen , MIT 's Carl Richard Soderberg Professor of Power Engineering and director of the Pappalardo Micro and Nano Engineering Laboratories .
" So he kind of anticipated this [ breakdown ] , but most people do n't know this . "
Part of the problem in measuring the way energy is radiated when objects are very close is the mechanical difficulty of maintaining two objects in very close proximity , without letting them actually touch .
Chen and his team , graduate student Sheng Shen and Columbia University Professor Arvind Narayaswamy , solved this problem in two ways , as described in a paper to be published in the August issue of the journal Nano Letters ( available now online ) .
First , instead of using two flat surfaces and trying to maintain a tiny gap between them , they used a flat surface next to a small round glass bead , whose position is easier to control .
" If we use two parallel surfaces , it is very hard to push to nanometer scale without some parts touching each other , " Chen explains , but by using a bead there is just a single point of near - contact , which is much easier to maintain .
Then , they used the technology of the bi-metallic cantilever from an atomic - force microscope to measure the temperature changes with great precision .

" We tried for many years doing it with parallel plates , " Chen says .
But with that method , they were unable to sustain separations of closer than about a micron ( one millionth of a meter ) .
By using the glass ( silica ) beads , they were able to get separations as small as 10 nanometers ( 10 billionths of a meter , or one - hundredth the distance achieved before ) , and are now working on getting even closer spacings .
Professor Sir John Pendry of Imperial College London , who has done extensive work in this field , calls the results " very exciting , " noting that theorists have long predicted such a breakdown in the formula and the activation of a more powerful mechanism .
" Experimental confirmation has proved elusive because of the extreme difficulty in measuring temperature differences over very small distances , " Pendry says .
" Gang Chen 's experiments provide a beautiful solution to this difficulty and confirm the dominant contribution of near field effects to heat transfer . "
In today 's magnetic data recording systems - such as the hard disks used in computers - the spacing between the recording head and the disk surface is typically in the 5 to 6 nanometer range , Chen says .
The head tends to heat up , and researchers have been looking for ways to manage the heat or even exploit the heating to control the gap .
" It 's a very important issue for magnetic storage , " he says .
Such applications could be developed quite rapidly , he says , and some companies have already shown a strong interest in this work
The new findings could also help in the development of new photovoltaic energy conversion devices to harness photons emitted by a heat source , called thermophovoltaic , Chen says .
" The high photon flux can potentially enable higher efficiency and energy density thermophovoltaic energy converters , and new energy conversion devices , " he says .
The new findings could have " a broad impact , " says Shen .
People working with devices using small separations will now have a clear understanding that Planck 's law " is not a fundamental limitation , " as many people now think , he says .
But further work is needed to explore even closer spacings , Chen says , because " we do n't know exactly what the limit is yet " in terms of how much heat can be dissipated in closely spaced systems .
" Current theory will not be valid once we push down to 1 nanometer spacing . "
And in addition to practical applications , he says , such experiments " might provide a useful tool to understand some basic physics . "

Haskell is a beautiful language .
I love Python too , but I fell in love with Haskell at first glance .
However , my problem is that I do n’t know how to make use of it .
Of course , I am definitely an amateur in programming , having had some programming courses in Uni , but mainly relied on internet resources .
But I can figure out more ways of using Python .
So far , what I can do with haskell is to use it for office automation .
Yeah , I kinda of use it the same way I used python .
I am a actuarial student , most of my stuff is in Excel ; for actuarial computing , we use specialized actuairal software .
How can I use Haskell in a more meaningful way ?
How do you use Haskell ?
Especially when you are not a programmer .
Thanks to whoever shares .
Gretchen Carlson of Fox and Friends was all worked up this morning over something she read off the Christian Newswire -- and in typical Fox fashion , proceeded to report on only the religious right 's spin of the event .
The story involves the Pentagon 's decision not to have its Air Force jets do their annual flyover at the " God and Country Family Festival " in Nampa , Idaho last weekend .
She had on Patrick Mahoney of the Christian Defense Coalition , which is constantly on the lookout for " anti-Christian " activities on the part of whatever miscreants it can manufacture .
It produced this exchange :
Carlson :
So when I first read this story , I actually found it hard to believe .
Because for 42 years , at this rally in Idaho , the Pentagon has authorized a flyover .
Suddenly this year , a new president in office , and a new policy .
What do you make of it ?
Mahoney :
Well , we 're stunned , actually , and it's a reminder that our Constitution promises freedom of religion , not freedom from religion .
I think the viewers need to understand , the flyovers that were held for 42 years were not to endorse or promote any religion , but to honor the military , who was there in force .
Actually , the promoters of the event told the local paper otherwise :
Organizers do n't deny the explicitly Christian nature of the annual patriotic rally .
" Yes , it 's about as Christian as you can get — we believe in promoting Christianity , " Syme said .
" And we have no plans to change that . "
Regardless , Mahoney charged on :
Mahoney : I think it causes one to pause and say , ' What changed ?
After 42 years , what changed ? '
And Gretchen , the only indicator we have is that we have a new commander in chief .
And I think that we are wondering , when we look at President Obama :
Is there a culture of hostility toward expressions of faith in the public square -- particularly Christian ?
Let 's put this in context .
Several months ago , the president spoke at Georgetown University ; when he spoke there , he covered a cross , and he covered a sacred symbol for the name of Jesus .
He did not celebrate the National Day of Prayer at the White House , had no events at the White House , and yet just a couple of weeks ago we had a major reception to celebrate Gay and Lesbian Pride Month in June .
So we need to move -- we right now are filing a Freedom of Information Act request with the American Center for Law and Justice , and we want to get to the bottom of this to ensure that no American citizen and no group is denied access to the public square because of their faith tradition .
Of course , I 've never heard that " sucking up taxpayer dollars by employing the military for your entertainment " was a matter of having " access to the public square " before .
It 's a novel concept , but not one likely to fly in court .
But Carlson notes that of course the eeeeeevil Daily Kos endorses the Pentagon 's enforcement of its longstanding policy .
So I went looking and discovered that she was referring not to a front - page piece but rather a diary by Chris Rodda -- and a very good one at that , which explains that the Pentagon was actually finally responding to complaints filed by the Military Religious Freedom Foundation .
And what happened was that the Pentagon finally agreed to enforce its longstanding policy against permitting military participation in religious events :
Looking into this issue for MRFF ( in what I wrongly thought was going to be a very temporary job ) , I found that the Stone Mountain event was far from an isolated incident .
The military was regularly providing flyovers at countless evangelical Christian events all over the country , not only violating the regulations prohibiting military participation in religious events , but spending millions of dollars of taxpayer money in the process .
MRFF began exposing these events , which included flyovers on the five holidays when flyovers at civilian events are permitted , and even a few at National Day of Prayer events , and began to see some decline in their frequency , but we were n't sure if the number of flyovers at these events was really decreasing , or if the military and organizers of these events were just being more careful not to make the nature of the events so obvious .
Well , needless to say , the following letter denying , for the first time in 42 years , the request for a flyover at one Christian rally , released on many websites in conjunction with a Christian Newswire article titled " Pentagon Denies Flyover of Patriotic ' God and Country Rally ' in Nampa Idaho Because of its Christian Content , " was the best 4th of July present MRFF could have asked for .
The letter read in part :
Your Air Force aviation support request does n't fall into either approved category , as such , we are unable to approve it .
Air Force and DoD policy prohibit support for events which appear to endorse , selectively benefit , or favor any special interest group , religious or ideological movement .
With an increasingly high operations tempo and limited resources to meet our training and operational commitments , we are required to take a hard look at all of our requests and carefully follow our policies and guidelines .
In denying your request , we are not questioning the worthiness of the event , but rather enforcing DoD and Air Force policy to preserve the operational and training requirements of our aviation units and to practice the prudent stewardship of taxpayer - financed resources .
Of course , one of the ways you can tell whether or not these kinds of " issues " have any validity is by looking at the people who are raising a stink about them .
One name that keeps popping up is that of Brandi Swindell :
Christian activist Brandi Swindell sent a text message about the lack of the flyover from Wednesday night 's event at the Idaho Center amphitheater .
She followed up with another message Thursday .
" This is unbelievable and deeply troubling , " Swindell wrote .
" The Pentagon does not have the authority to discriminate against Christian groups or events .
This type of religious bigotry is unconstitutional .
How sad to see this lack of respect and level of blatant bias surrounding the 4th of July celebration . "
This is the same Brandi Swindell who ran for Boise City Council on an explicitly ( and rabidly ) anti-abortion platform , replete with bizarro antics and insane pronunciamentos .
She was also kicked out of the Idaho House after she had one of her patented anti-abortion meltdowns in the office of the Republican Speaker .
Hearing a complaint about " anti-Christian bias " from the same people who are most aggressively trying to shove their " Christian nation " ideology down everyone else 's throat is only mildly amusing .
Seeing them attack President Obama as anti-Christian is pretty disturbing .
In the bizarre and rule - bound world of quantum physics , every tiny spec of matter has something called " spin " - an intrinsic trait like eye color - that cannot be changed and which dictates , very specifically , what other bits of matter the spec can share quantum space with .
When fermions , the most antisocial type of quantum particle , do get together , they pair up in a wondrous dance that enables such things as superconductivity .
For the first time , researchers at Rice University have succeeded in creating and observing an elusive and long - sought quantum state - a superfluid of fermions with mismatched numbers of dance partners .
Despite more than 40 years of theoretical musings about what would occur in such a case , the result - a cluster of matched pairs surrounded by a cloud of would - be dance partners - was largely unexpected .
The research , which appears online this week , is slated to appear in an upcoming issue of the journal Science , together with a paper from MIT reporting related results .
The experiments offer physicists a new window into two of the least understood and most intriguing phenomena in physics - superconductivity and superfluidity .
Both phenomena result from a change in the phase of matter .
Anyone who has seen ice melt has seen matter change phases , and when electrons , atoms and other specs of matter change quantum phases , they behave just as differently as do ice and water in a glass .
Superconducting and superfluid phases of matter occur in fermions - the antisocial particles that can't share quantum space - only when quantum forces become dominant .
Because thermodynamic forces are typically so powerful that they overwhelm quantum interactions - like loud music overwhelms the whisper of someone nearby - superconductivity and superfluidity only occur in extreme cold .
In the Rice experiment , when temperatures drop to within a few billionths of a degree of absolute zero , fermions with equal but opposite spin become attracted to one another and behave , in some respects , like one particle .
Like a couple on the dance floor , they do n't technically share space , but they move in unison .
In superconductors , these dancing pairs allow electrical current to flow through the material without any resistance at all , a property that engineers have long dreamed of harnessing to eliminate " leakage " in power cables , something that costs billions of dollars per year in the U.S. alone .

The superconducting and superfluid phases are analogous except that superconductivity happens with particles carrying an electrical charge and superfluidity occurs in electrically neutral particles .
In superfluids , fermionic pairing leads to a complete absence of viscosity - like a wave rippling back and forth in a swimming pool without ever diminishing .
" Conventional theory tells us superconductivity or superfluidity occurs only in the presence of an equal number of spin - up and spin- down particles , " said lead researcher Randy Hulet , the Fayez Sarofim Professor of Physics and Astronomy .
" Physicists have speculated for almost 50 years about what would happen if this condition were not met .
" Because of the pristine and controlled nature of our ultracold atoms , we 're able to offer definitive evidence of what happens with mismatched numbers of spin - up and spin - down particles . "
Ultracold experiments at temperatures just a few billionths of a degree above absolute zero are Hulet 's specialty .
It 's only been technically possible to chill atoms to these temperatures for the past 10 years , but in that time , this ability has proved remarkably useful for testing the predictions of quantum mechanics and for exploring the properties of what physicists call " many - body phenomena , " including superconductivity and superfluidity .
In the latest experiments , Hulet 's team - which includes graduate students Guthrie Partridge , Ramsey Kamar and Yean - an Liao and postdoctoral researcher Wenhui Li - cooled a mixture of fermionic lithium - 6 atoms to about 30 - billionths of a degree above absolute zero .
That 's far colder than any temperature in nature - even in deepest interstellar space - and it's sufficient to quell virtually all thermodynamic interaction in the atoms , leaving them subject to superfluid quantum pairing .

Using radio waves , Hulet 's team altered the ratio of spin- up and spin - down atoms in the cooled atoms with great precision .
They found that the superfluid was able to tolerate an excess of up to 10 percent unpaired fermions with no detrimental effects .
Hulet 's team found that increasing the ratio of spin-up to spin - down atoms eventually caused a phase change .
When unpaired spin - up atoms rose above 10 percent of the total sample , the unpaired loners were suddenly expelled , leaving a core of superfluid pairs surrounded by a shell of excess spin - up atoms .
It is the unbalanced yet seemingly unaffected superfluid , however , that is capturing most of the scientific attention at the moment .
" The gas behaves as if it is still perfectly paired , which is quite remarkable given the excess of spin - up atoms , " Hulet said .
" This was unexpected , and it could signal a new , exotic form of superfluidity that may be akin to the electron pairings in unconventional superconductors or to the quark soup that 's predicted to exist at the heart of the densest neutron stars . "
In the largest neutron stars - known as " quark stars " - a mass about five times greater than the sun is pressed into a space smaller than the island of Manhattan .
Some physics theorists believe gravity is so strong at the heart of these stars that it creates something called a " strange matter , " a dense superfluid of up quarks , down quarks and strange quarks .
