GOP Congressman Fails Basic Constitution Question
Democrats are n’t the only ones who do n’t seem to know or care what the Constitution they swore to uphold says .
Turns out some in the GOP need to go back to their high school civics lessons as well .
Congressman LoBianco could not tell the 1st Amendment – which restricts the government from interfering in religion , speech , press , petition and assembly – from Article I – which creates the very legislature where he serves .
I do n’t expect everyone to be a constitutional scholar but I do expect law makers to have a basic understanding of the document which grants them the authority they have .

Another day , another experimental CPU cooling method that may or may not come to pass .
We 've seen " thermal paste " from IBM and polyethylene from MIT , and now researchers at the University of Rochester have developed a method for coaxing water along nanometer - scale grooves carved into silicon .
So hydrophilic are the patterns that water will even flow against gravity ( and we 've got the video to prove it ) .
Not only are the structures so precise and nondestructive that the surface feels smooth to the touch , but they also trap photons , according to The New York Times , " so the grooved silicon appears pitch - black . "
And who knows ?
Maybe your next PC will be cooled by streams of water flowing freely inside the case .
It 's a nice image , anyways .
Peep the video after the break to see it in action for yourself .
Like it or loathe it , 3D is everywhere , the 21st century equivalent of the snood .
Last week ,
Sky launched its new 3D channel by screening Chelsea 's victory at Old Trafford in a " revolutionary " format designed to bring the excitement of the Premier League right into your local .
All the major electronics companies are bombarding us with promos for 3D TVs which , we are assured , are the next generation in home entertainment , making boring old HD TVs " so 2009 " .
Meanwhile , cinema distributors have become so addicted to the profit potential of 3D movies ( thanks to the box office bonanza of Avatar ) that even films shot in 2D ( Alice in Wonderland , Clash of the Titans ) are being hastily re-versioned into 3D to cash in on the latest craze .
This last area is particularly worrying because in the entire history of 3D cinema ( which is almost old as the history of cinema itself ) there are only a handful of moments which justify the headache - inducing horrors of " stereoscopy " .
The sight of the creature from the Black Lagoon looming out of the depths to give Fifties drive - in viewers a thrill ; or that moment in Flesh for Frankenstein where our hero is impaled upon a spike which hoiks out his guts and dangles them dripping in front of the audience .
Others of certain age may have fond memories of the eyeball extraction scene from Friday the 13th Part III which caused audiences to duck for fear of flying jelly .
And I 'd be lying if I said I was n't sneakily thrilled by Tinto Brass 's announcement that he 's working on a 3D " erotic film " which will " revisit an abandoned project about a Roman emperor that was ruined by Americans " and which sounds suspiciously like a rollicking 3D remake of Caligula .
The thing these movies have in common is that they are essentially trash – sleazy , crass and exploitative and owing more to the carnival sideshow tradition than to any history of narrative cinema .
As such , they are perfectly suited to the phoney - baloney gimmickry of 3D , in the same way that Polyester suited Odorama and The Tingler needed the hidden seat buzzers of Percepto to put a spark into its audiences ' collective arses .
Beyond that , however , 3D exists not to enhance the cinematic experience , but as a pitiful attempt to head off piracy and force audiences to watch films in overpriced , undermanned multiplexes .
It is a con designed entirely to protect the bloated bank balances of buck - hungry Hollywood producers .
It is not a creative leap on a par with the advent of colour or sound , as demonstrated by the fact that the so - called " 3D revolution " has already faltered on several occasions ( the first 3D movie patent was filed in the 1890s and studios pushed the format in the Fifties , Seventies and Eighties to little effect ) .
I know it , you know it , but fewer and fewer people are able to say it thanks to a multimillion dollar campaign which has fostered the lie that only wonky - eyed old farts do n't get 3D .
Before you buy into this myth , take a look at what the champions of the format have to say .
Top of the pile is James Cameron who , to give him his due , really seems to believe in 3D .
He went to great lengths – and costs – to design and shoot Avatar in 3D and is genuinely passionate about its merits .
Yet as anyone who has watched Avatar in both 2D and 3D versions will know , the wow factor of this sci-fi Smurfahontas is more the result of adventurous digital landscaping than any forced stereoscopic illusion .
Plus , thanks to the unavoidable 30 % colour loss which comes with 3D ( along with the added joys of those damned glasses ) , the film is just far sharper in 2D .
If you do n't believe me , try taking the glasses off in the middle of a 3D screening and see how much brighter the future looks , even when it 's out of focus .
Cameron may have been the standard bearer for 3D , but like some cinematic Oppenheimer he 's already expressed dismay at the way the technology he pioneered is now being used for evil ends .
Having made 3D not only bankable but " respectable " , the director is now railing against studios for forcing film - makers to go stereo and , worse still , for retro-fitting 2D movies into 3D via a " slapdash conversion " process .
This process , which perfectly demonstrates the fraudulence of 3D , takes a 2D image and enforces an artificial stereoscopy to make certain elements appear " closer " than others , thereby creating the illusion of depth .
Except that it does n't .
It just makes a load of " flat " elements look like they 're floating around on opposing planes of flatness , as demonstrated by the shallow 3D experience offered by Clash of the Titans .
Even Michael Bay , director of Transformers and reigning antichrist of artistically bankrupt blockbuster cinema , says he is " not sold right now on the conversion process " .
Which is rather like Max Clifford declaring that he 's worried about certain forms of press coverage lowering the general tone of news reporting .
The film which those at the upper end of the pro-3D debate always cite is Alfred Hitchcock 's Dial M for Murder , a rare early example of a " serious " film - maker having a bash at the format .
Pixar pioneer John Lasseter could be heard waxing lyrical about Dial M when doing the publicity rounds for Bolt and Up , claiming that the maestro " really understood " the potential for an " immersive " cinematic experience .
" Immersive " is the word most regularly rolled out to counter the claim that 3D is all about pointy - pointy flimflam and to suggest that the format pulls you into the picture rather than simply waving things out of the screen at you , like the flying pickaxes of My Bloody Valentine .
It 's a good argument , sadly undermined by the fact that a ) almost no one saw Dial M in 3D , yet few complained that the 2D version was in any way " non-immersive " ; and b) Hitchcock never went near 3D again .
Similarly , the great horror classic House of Wax , which 3D fans cite as the high - water mark of " immersive " stereoscopic shocks , was famously directed by André de Toth , who was blind in one eye and could only see the film in 2D .
And apparently he thought it looked pretty good .
If 3D has a creative future , it seems more likely to be in the arena of home entertainment than in expensively refitted cinemas .
And it 's not sports coverage but computer gaming , with its key facet of interactivity , which seems most perfectly poised to explore the virtual reality capabilities of 3D .
As for 3D movies , I 've seen two productions which did n't utterly underwhelm me .
One was a spin - off of Honey , I Shrunk the Kids , the other was Terminator 2 : 3D , Cameron 's dry - run for Avatar .
Both were short films , projected on to screens vast enough to ( almost ) overcome 3D 's bizarre propensity for miniaturisation ( remember Jaws 3D , in which audiences were threatened not by a Great White but a Gawping Guppy ) .
More important , both were theme park rides accompanied by vibrating seats , steam showers , laser shows , blasts of hot and cold air and live actors running around the auditorium .
They were fun , a reminder that cinema started life as a carnival sideshow .
Today , studio executives are attempting to drag us all back to the fairground , to take the Pirates of the Caribbean formula to its logical conclusion and simply replace art with the roll - on roll - off mechanics of the critic - proof thrill ride .
There 's nothing new about this – in fact it 's the oldest trick in the book .
But then 3D has never been the future of cinema .
It is , was , and always will be the past .
Today has just been unreal !
Three new Dell Android phones leaked within a couple of hours of each other , and now we ’re given a treat that we never thought we ’d see : Android has been ported to the iPhone .
I came across this link thanks to fabled Android ROM developer Cyanogen , who simply pasted the URL to the blog posting in a tweet on his Twitter account .
The catch is that this only works on 2G iPhones for now , but this is a huge break through in Android development !
Everything is n’t smooth , and not everything works ( some things will need special drivers ) but WiFi is confirmed to be working , and it seems functional enough to make this a notable achievement for the developer who managed to scrap this together .
The developer has stated that a port to the 3G should be fairly easy , and while a 3GS port would require a bit more work , it should be doable as well .
Rob has always told me “ we need someone manning the ship even in the late hours .
What if the iDroid with Android 3.0 gets announced ? ” .
Turns out , he was right ( partially , anyway ) and I ’m just stoked to see that this is even possible .
What about you guys ?
Do you want to see continued development for Android ’s iPhone 2G port ?
Would you try this out on your own old iPhone ( he provides detailed instructions on his blog ) ?
A woman looks out the window of her one - room hut at a squatter camp for poor white South Africans at Coronation Park in Krugersdorp , March 9 , 2010 .
A shift in racial hiring practices and the recent global economic crisis means many white South Africans have fallen on hard times .
Researchers now estimate some 450,000 whites , of a total white population of 4.5 million , live below the poverty line and 100,000 are struggling just to survive in places such Coronation Park , a former caravan camp currently home to more than 400 white squatters .

European airline pilots warned governments and safety regulators today against making " rash " decisions to allow planes to fly through volcanic ash clouds amid growing pressure from airlines across Europe to create " safe flying corridors " to get flights moving again .
Tonight the UK's air safety watchdog , the Civil Aviation Authority , announced it was reopening the UK's airspace after holding meetings with national air traffic controllers , airline executives and Lord Adonis , the transport secretary , to discuss flying through zones with small amounts of ash .
But the European Cockpit Association , told the Guardian today that any attempts to establish " safe flying corridors " through airspace where ash was present should not be rushed .
Martin Chalk , a professional pilot and president of ECA which represents 40,000 pilots across Europe , said : " I do n't think there is a definitive answer to whether it is safe or not …
We do n't have much of the knowledge we would need to certify flight through low levels of volcanic ash .
The three areas are regulation , technical solutions and training for the flight crew .
ECA is concerned that such far - reaching decisions would be taken under such enormous human , political and commercial pressures . "
Chalk warned that engine failures caused by the ash , a potentially lethal mix of rock and glass , could have serious consequences .
" Were a plane to lose all power halfway across the Atlantic and have to ditch , tragedy is almost certain because of the temperature of the water , " he added .
To add to the woes of stranded passengers , the government 's emergency strategy to get them back to Britain was beginning to unravel .
Gordon Brown had said there were 100 coaches waiting in Madrid to help transport passengers flying in from Asia , Africa and North and South America to continue the journey back home .
But consular officials there faced angry and weary travellers at the city 's Barajas airport who discovered that the promised coach service did not yet exist .
Embassy officials said they were working hard on the logistics but , for the moment , their advice was for everyone to make their own way to the Channel .
Brown 's dramatic plans to send Royal Navy ships to repatriate stranded Britons were also thrown into doubt .
The prime minister announced the move yesterday but defence officials told the Guardian today that neither the aircraft carrier Ark Royal nor HMS Ocean would be used to pick up passengers at Calais – not least because the commercial ferry operators seemed to be coping well , and both ships were too big to get into the Channel port .
While Ark Royal will sail to an exercise in the Atlantic as previously planned , officials said Ocean was ready to make for Cherbourg if required to do so later in the week .
One navy ship did join the rescue operation .
HMS Albion set sail from Santander in northern Spain with 280 British civilians and 200 troops aboard earlier today .
It is due to dock in the UK tomorrow night or Thursday morning .
Airport operators condemned the present " blanket approach " to banning flights .
The airports claimed other European countries were already operating more flexible policies as the Iceland volcano eruption continued to paralyse air travel in and out of Britain for a sixth day .
The CAA board is expected to discuss whether there is enough meteorological and test flight data to gauge the risk in implementing safe flight corridors this afternoon .
On Monday , EU transport ministers agreed to split the continent 's airspace into three areas : a no-fly zone around Iceland and the Eyjafjallajokull volcano ; safe corridors ; and flight paths to be opened by aviation regulators despite the presence of ash .
The Association of Airport Operators ( AOA ) warned that the country would remain " closed for business " unless the UK adopted measures recommended by Eurocontrol , the pan-European navigation organisation , to EU transport ministers yesterday .
The operators stoked the row over UK policy as they tried to persuade the air safety regulator , the Civil Aviation Authority , Nats and the government to move more quickly on adopting a pan-European policy of airspace closures suggested yesterday .
A proposal by Eurocontrol , the intergovernmental air traffic body , to European transport ministers suggested the implementation of a no- fly zone limited to the visible ash plume as determined by satellite images and adequate buffer areas which could be updated on a six - hour basis .
The AOA chairman , Ed Anderson , said : " The cost of ongoing disruption for the airlines and airports industry alone is £ 130 m a day .
Add to that the cost to businesses dependent on flights to move goods and people and the effect on the wider economy is critical .
The government is also losing £ 5.5 m a day in air passenger duty .
" Many thousands of UK citizens remain stranded abroad , unable to get home .
Unless the UK gets its policy on airspace closure into line with the rest of Europe , Britain will remain closed for business . "
A spokesman for the CAA said : " As far as I am aware , this is still being discussed in Brussels … it is not there yet . "
Anything decided would supersede the different policies across European states , but he pointed out Britain was nearer the volcano than other countries .
British Airways is preparing to divert about 16 incoming long - haul flights that took off from the far east , Mauritius , Mexico and the US west coast earlier today in the hope they could land at Heathrow later this evening or in the very early morning .
It made contingency plans for them to land at other European airports .
It cancelled another dozen planned incoming flights because of restrictions on flight crew hours .
EasyJet said any UK flights were unlikely and Ryanair cancelled northern European operations including the UK until at least Thursday at 1 pm .
Flights between the UK and Ireland will not resume until Friday .
Aer Lingus also cancelled all flights today , while Thomson Airways will not lay on outbound flights until at least Thursday .
The National Air Traffic Services said that from 1 pm to 7 pm only part of Scottish airspace , including Aberdeen , Inverness and Edinburgh airports , would be available for flights in addition to airspace south to Newcastle airport .
That meant no flights after 1 pm from Glasgow , which was among the airports that were able to open earlier .
An update this afternoon said that from 7 pm Glasgow and Teesside airports could open .
However , flights are crossing UK airspace above 20,000ft .
Traffic was light even at some airports that were open .
Graeme Mason , head of planning and corporate affairs at Newcastle international airport , said : " We have got about eight flights out of a normal 120 to 130 , so a very , very light schedule for sure . "
But there was hope that an end to the crisis may be in sight .
Europe 's largest short - haul airline , Ryanair , said it hoped to resume normal operations by 1 pm on Friday as weather conditions improve .
The Dublin - based carrier added that it expects to restore much of its European schedule by Thursday , including flights from the UK to the continent .
Flights between the UK and Ireland will not be restored until Friday , however , to allow Ryanair to position its flights .
The low - cost airline , which has gained notoriety for its charges , said it was waiving baggage and check - in fees " for a number of days . "
Well , that ’s it for Star Wars … or as it is known today “ Star Wars : Episode IV : A New Hope ” .
We have a couple of additional flashback strips to one or two scenes that we missed at the time which we will eventually upload , but for now we are moving on .
We ’re moving into that in - between void in which Luke taught himself more about the Force , Leia and Han started angsting for one another and Vader started searching for Luke .
It ’s actually quite a significant gap .
It always surprised me just how much time seemed to have past for the rebels and the main characters .
I felt like I was being cheated one more rip-roaring adventure in the style of A New Hope before things got all dark and grim .
Do n’t get me wrong , I love Empire Strikes Back , but I basically wanted a full year long series of Star Wars to precede it .
Blue Milk Special is n’t exactly going to fill that void in any serious sense .
That ’s a bit outside our scope as a fan webcomic strip , but we will be running with some spin - off ideas of our own , based on loose - ends and interesting extras .
Then , of course there are the Holiday Special and the novelization Splinter of the Mind ’s Eye .
Both NEED to be BMSed perhaps more so than the trilogy .
But , at three strips a week The Empire Strikes Back is not far away .
We ca n’t start Empire right now even if we wanted to skip the spin - off material because Leanne ( the primary artist behind BMS ) is wrapped up with professional commitments for another month .
A lot of the material you ’ll be seeing in the interval has been put together by myself , not just to keep the strip going , but to explore a lot of really fun ideas and silliness that can occur more freely outside the plots of the movies .
As an extra bonus we thought we ’d link to Leanne ’s very first Star Wars strip .
It ’s a commentary on the travesty that was the hamfisted Peter Cushing mockery standing in as a younger Grand Moff Tarkin in Revenge of the Sith .
This could very well have been the strip that inspired Blue Milk Special into existence !
We seldom discuss the Prequels here at BMS for good reason .
We have even entertained the idea of eventually BMSing the Prequels albeit in a more abridged format than with the Original Trilogy , however I am afraid that rather than writing gags , I ’ll just be spitting vitriol and deconstructionist commentaries .
It ’s far easier to poke fun at The Original Trilogy which is far more honest about its flaws , but much more cohesive and meaningful as a piece of storytelling .
With the prequels its hard to know where to start and where to stop .
Plus… becoming that negative could turn me to the dark side .
Just a final note that we appreciate all the support that we ’ve gained through the first year of our webcomic adventure .
Our following may be tiny , but its the quality of the followers that counts .
Starting next week we will be posting one rare Star Wars photo per day via our Twitter account .
You can also join our Facebook group and join in a conversation about your favorite strip to date .
We LOVE hearing from you .
Just remember , we do n’t get paid to do BMS .
We do it for love and share it in the hope that others will be able to understand and hopefully laugh every now and then !

Where Steve Jobs leads , Microsoft follows -- how 's that for shaking up the hornet 's nest ?
It 's said in jest , of course , but we 've just come across a post from the General Manager for Internet Explorer , Dean Hachamovitch , and the perspective expressed by him on the subject of web content delivery broadly agrees with the essay penned by Jobs yesterday on the very same subject .
Echoing the Apple CEO 's words , Hachamovitch describes HTML5 as " the future of the web , " praising it for allowing content to be played without the need for plug-ins and with native hardware acceleration ( in both Windows 7 and Mac OS X ) .
He goes on to identify H.264 as the best video codec for the job -- so much so that it 'll be the only one supported in IE9's HTML5 implementation -- before turning to the dreaded subject of Flash .
This is where it gets good , because he literally repeats one of Jobs ' six pillars of Flash hate : " reliability , security , and performance " are not as good as Microsoft would like them .
Where Hachamovitch diverges from Apple 's messiah , however , is in describing Flash as an important part of " a good consumer experience on today 's web , " primarily because it 's difficult for the typical consumer to access Flash - free content .
Still , it 's got to be depressing for Adobe 's crew when the best thing either of the two biggest players in tech has to say about your wares is that they 're ubiquitous .
Wonder how Shantanu Narayen is gonna try and spin this one .it's notable that in multiple paragraphs of discussing " the future , " Microsoft 's IE general fails to once mention the fabled Silverlight , itself a rich media browser plug - in .
Given Silverlight 's featured role in the Windows Phone 7 infrastructure and other things like Netflix , we doubt it's on the outs , but there are sure to be some sour faces greeting Hachamovitch this morning .

Last week was pretty big for Evony , but probably not in the way its developers hoped .
Though Evony Age II saw its final launch , the game gained much more public attention because of the lawsuit it was embroiled in with a critical blogger .
Ars Technica 's own feature about Evony generated a lot of responses : the general consensus among readers who commented or sent in e-mail responses was that both the game and the various companies associated with it were definitely behaving in shady ways .
One somewhat unexpected result from our original story was that vice director of development for Evony , LLC and an executive from associated - corporation , Regan Mercantile , sat down for a phone interview with Ars that was courteous and civil .
A few hours after the initial article ran , we were contacted by a representative from a US - based PR firm that had been recently hired to represent Evony .
While we were working on the first article , we attempted on more than one occasion to get an interview with someone from the game 's development team about the accusations we mentioned .
We had no luck .
Once the article was live , though , we were informed that the vice director of development for Evony , LLC was now eager to talk to us .
When the interview took place , we spoke with Benjamin Gifford of Evony , LLC , and Walt Yarbrough , the vice president of operations on the East Coast for Regan Mercantile .
Both men made a point of stating that they were happy to answer any questions we had , and politely addressed a few concerns they had about the first article we ran .
While you might not have heard of Gifford before now , Yarbrough is a familiar name to the MMO industry .
He originally started working as a developer for Mythic Entertainment on Dark Age of Camelot , and gradually moved through the ranks over the past decade .
Since his start , he has served as a producer at Electronic Arts , an executive producer at Turbine , Director of Quality Assurance and Customer Service at Quick Hit , and now holds his current position with Regan Mercantile .
His involvement with Evony makes the game seem less dubious than we had initially been led to believe .
Concerns about the initial article
The major clarification Gifford and Yarbrough wanted to make was that the game is free to play , despite concerns and accusations that enjoying the game 's full content is impossible unless you 're willing to shell out some cold hard cash .
According to Yarbrough , this perception is inaccurate ; he used his own experience with the game as an example .
Before he came to work for Regan Mercantile , Yarbrough was an active Evony player and has never spent a dime on the game ; he is a member of the top - ranked alliance on the server he plays on and was so before he joined the ranks of Regan Mercantile .
" In Evony , you can do everything in the game without ever paying .
Much of that is based off of the random nature of the game , " said Yarbrough .
" In many battles , you get awarded random items which are things you would normally pay for — or that you would pay for from a convenience perspective — but many of our highest - level players have never paid for the game ... you can take any aspect of our game ... and say , ' well , this is what I want to do , but I have n't gotten that item randomly yet , so the game is forcing me to pay for it , ' and that 's just not accurate ... there 's nothing that you have to do that you have to pay for . "
That said , Yarbrough also admitted that items and abilities in the game are purchased by players for the sake of convenience ; " we 're selling that convenience , " he candidly stated .
Yarbrough and Gifford also took time to say that Evony is not and does not contain malware .
While we never claimed this was the case , we did link to a blog post indicating it might be a possibility .
Since the article ran last Monday , Evony 's website has been updated for the launch of Evony Age II to include a Google certification that the site contains absolutely no malware and has never been documented as acting as an intermediary for such software .
Yarbrough and Gifford also addressed the rumors surrounding iEvony , particularly with how it was perceived as a source of spam across the Web .
According to Gifford : " I took a keen interest in it ... we said and gave a warning to everyone that if they were going to abuse the system , not only would they be blocked out of the iEvony client ... but they would be blocked out of the game as well ...
When I did receive emails from a few companies saying that people were spamming their websites and blogs , I worked with them to identify who that person was and dealt with it through administration to get rid of it as fast as possible . "
The story behind those horrible ads , and other things
As mentioned previously , Evony has become infamous for its borderline - pornographic banner ads .
Those advertisements are actually going away in the near future , because , according to Yarbrough , " What we 've seen is that our return on investment on strategic ads is better ... than the earlier ad campaigns , so we 're shifting to that for the near term .
It 's not a spigot : you can't turn it off immediately , as there that are things already in the channel .
As we move forward , particularly with Age 2 , we 'll get away from those ads . "
When asked about the nonexistent lover that potential players were encouraged to save , Yarbrough explained that there are quests in Age 2 that make those ads relevant , but he somewhat defended using them for the past couple of years , too .
" [ The campaign ] has been very effective : we have over 16 million customers . "
Yarbrough also stated that Regan Mercantile was a much smaller company at the time the controversial ad campaign began , and had actually contracted someone else to create the banners : " [ We were ] dealing with an outsourced ad campaign ; you 're going with somebody else who is creating the ad on a spec and then you 're approving it and tracking the effectiveness afterwards .
There are lots of ads that are out there that proved ineffectual , but are still out there . "
When asked which company created the infamous advertisements , Yarbrough stated that he was n't sure because it happened before his time at the company .
We also discussed some of the other notable points in the article , particularly accusations of plagiarized art assets , the game 's relationship with Universal Multiplayer Game Entertainment ( UMGE ) , and the recently - dropped defamation lawsuit against Bruce Everiss .
A celebrated religious scholar from Princeton University and best - selling author spoke to an overflowing University of Wisconsin crowd Thursday night in a lecture that centered on the cultural effect of the biblical book of Revelation .
Elaine Pagels , author of “ The Gnostic Gospels ” and the recent New York Times best - seller “ Beyond Belief : The Secret Gospel of Thomas , ” addressed UW as part of the school ’s Year of Humanities Chancellor ’s Lecture series .
Pagels focused largely on the book ’s historical and religious origins as well as its vast impact on the world of art .
“ It is the strangest book of the Bible , ” Pagels said .
“ It consists of visions , dreams and nightmares , [ and is ] astonishingly influential . ”
Throughout the lecture , Pagels presented slides of artwork inspired by Revelation ’s images and themes .
Pagels cited such literature as Milton ’s “ Paradise Lost ” and the song lyrics from “ The Battle Hymn of the Republic ” as just a few examples of the book ’s widespread influence .
In examining Revelations , Pagels has aimed at taking a scholarly , rather than a religious , approach to John ’s vision of the end times .
She asserted from a sociological perspective the book of Revelation ’s author ’s colorful references to the destruction of tyranny and worldly kingdoms were actually aimed at the former Roman Empire , under whose rule John was living when he wrote the book .
“ John wants you to know [ Revelation ] is about real events , ” she said .
“ What he creates is anti-Roman propaganda . ”
Pagels also said biblical passages referring to catastrophic images such as “ blazing mountains ” may have been allusions to actual natural disasters like the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius .
She noted interpretations of the book ’s figurative prophecies have frequently been believed to have been manifested in events such as the Black Plague in Europe or the appearances of Napoleon or Adolf Hitler .
The audience responded favorably to Pagels ’ presentation , giving a lengthy round of applause at her conclusion .
UW graduate student Nick Jacobson was one of the attendees lured by the author ’s notoriety .
“ It just seemed interesting , ” he said .
“ [ ‘ The Gnostic Gospels ’ ] was on a list from The Modern Library ’s 100 Best Novels and that was a real draw . ”
When Pagels opened the floor to questions at the end of her presentation , she continued to avoid offering a religious interpretation of the book and several times deflected questions that dealt with non-historical factors .
Regarding Pagels ’ insistence on an academic reading and the lecture ’s traditional , narrative approach to the book ’s origins , attendees like Jacobson were somewhat disappointed .
“ [ Growing up ] with a religious background , I was surprised because I expected something new , something more for her to add [ to the debate ] especially with how highly she was recommended , ” Jacobson said .
Chancellor Biddy Martin gave an introductory statement to Pagels ’ lecture on behalf of the university .
She said the role of the Year in Humanities Chancellor ’s Lecture series is to bring these types of philosophical and academic debates to the forefront of public discussion .
“ The purpose is to ensure that the humanities are visible and vibrant across the campus and the community , ” she said .

Update : I strive to maintain accuracy on my blog and spend time verifying issues before posting them .
However , further investigation has led me to question whether my understanding of applications automatically accessing “ publicly available information ” is actually correct .
I plan on doing more thorough research this weekend on such access and will update this post accordingly .
Update 2 : See my full correction .
Original Post
I ’ll admit , I was intrigued .
Facebook informed me that a good friend had become a fan of page proclaiming that “ 94 % of the people fall asleep immediately when seeing this picture ” .
That would be quite a picture .
Who would n’t want to give it a shot ?
Over 270,000 people must have agreed , since that many people gave into the page ’s demand that you become a fan before seeing the amazing photo .
In the past I ’ve simply ignored such scams , but this time , I did a bit of investigation and became intrigued once more .
I ’ve come across many pages and applications that promise a tempting reward if you simply complete a few steps , which usually involve authorizing the app or becoming a fan of the page ( I refuse to say “ fanning the page ” ) and then inviting all of your friends to do the same .
Rewards include tracking all visitors to your profile or getting a nice gift card .
I would argue that it does n’t take much evaluation to figure out why such scams are bogus , but untold Facebook users fall prey to them daily .
Next time you ’re tempted by a Facebook free lunch , remember that authorizing an application grants the developer access to all of your private info .
Becoming a fan is n’t quite as drastic , but as you may have discovered , that ’s rarely the last step in such offers .
Let ’s get back to the hypnotizing pic .
When you first load the page , it opens a tab tantalizingly entitled “ THE PICTURE ” .
Ah , but before the powerful picture loads , you have to complete “ two simple steps . ”
First , become a fan .
But you have to click the button at the top – if you click the representation of it in the instructions , a dialog pops up saying you have to use the top button “ to get access to the scantron hack . ”
Come again ?
Oh and the picture in that dialog is for another fan page entitled “ How to Change Your Profile Layout . ”
Anyway , become a fan and you ’ll see step two : “ Suggest this page to your friends . ”
Again , clicking the instructions brings up a dialog emphasizing you must invite at least 40 friends “ to bypass the human verification gateway ” ( sounds high - tech ) .
The picture this time is for some fan page involving “ hot ” girls .
If you click step 3 ( see the picture ! ) without inviting your friends first , you instead encounter the dreaded human verification gateway .
Of course , if you did annoy 40 friends first , I ’m pretty sure you ’d still see the gateway , which ironically offers for you to take a survey entitled “ How DUMB are YOU ? ”
As with so many similar pages , this page is entirely fake .
First clue : the page has all wall posts ( Correction : wall posts are hidden by default , but not disabled ) , reviews , and discussions disabled , so nowhere can “ fans ” actually share whether the trick worked or not .
Oh wait , “ THE PICTURE ” tab does include a comment box with testimonials from a few fans .
However , if you actually click some of the profile links , you ’ll find that the names do n’t always match up .
If you try adding your own comment , I can assure you from scanning network traffic that your feedback is not recorded .
The comment box is simply a bit of static code made to look legitimate .
In fact , I assumed “ THE PICTURE ” tab was using the Static FBML application to load its contents .
But the tab actually loads a special application called “ sleeps ” ( whose URI includes the string “ heyhaha ” ) .
What does “ sleeps ” do ?
It displays the page you see on “ THE PICTURE ” tab .
Why bother with a custom app simply to load static code ?
When you visit an application , it has access to your “ publicly available information ” ( for new readers , that includes your name , networks , friends list , location , content marked available to “ Everyone , ” pages you ’re a fan of , etc. ) without you ever clicking a button or granting specific permission .
While only Facebook could say for certain , I ’m guessing that “ sleeps ” takes advantage of this access and takes note of everyone who stops by .
( See update at the top of this post . )
Applications have to get their code from somewhere besides Facebook , though , and “ sleeps ” loads it from the charmingly - named web site “ www.drysnuff.info”.
By examining the full source code of the page , we can see exactly what happens when you click on fateful step 3 .
The page loads an inline frame that links to a file on drysnuff .
info called cpa.php .
As I ’ve looked at various scams and attack over the last year or so , I ’ve often encountered a particular type of trick that involves a CPAlead gateway .
I have no idea what the motives are of the people behind CPAlead or how trustworthy their company is , but I can attest that CPAlead gateways are constantly exploited by untrustworthy people who are looking to make a quick buck .
Our sleep - inducing fan page is no exception : that “ human verification gateway ” is simply another CPAlead setup .
The gateway asks you to complete a survey , which loads in a separate window .
Once you ’ve finished the “ offer , ” the gateway gets confirmation and grants you access to whatever it ’s hiding .
But finishing the survey will likely require you enter a mobile phone number , a very common online scam that will lead to plenty of unwanted charges on your next bill .
And I can save you the trouble – in this case , it ’s not hard to discover what you would see once the gateway verified your humanity .
If five racy images of “ The sexiest girls from MAFIA WARS ” make you fall asleep , then you ’re one of the 94 % .
( Update : Apparently that ’s another scam from the same people , and using the hypnotizing fan page may take you to a different destination – albeit still fake . )
I took the time to walk through this particular scam for two reasons .
First , I find it fun to explore the code and figure out exactly what ’s going on ( CPAlead employs several obfuscation techniques in their JavaScript , for instance ) .
Second , this story does have some important ramifications .
At first , it may appear no different from many other online scams that pop up when a user clicks some flashy advertisement .
As I said , I ’ve encountered CPAlead many times before , and other sites have written at length about the dangers of offers that require your mobile phone number .
What makes this case different , however , is the Facebook integration .
The scam artists behind this fan page quite literally know who their victims are .
When you simply visit the page out of curiosity , the owners know you by name , along with a link to your profile and some basic information about you .
This happens whether you fall for the offer scheme or not .
( See update at the top of this post . )
Also , several clues in the fan page indicate that its owners run other pages with similar setups .
Given the number of advertising - driven fake applications I ’ve seen , it ’s likely they have apps as well – and if you visit one of those apps , all of your private information can be connected to your profile .
Facebook requires developers to destroy most of that data after 24 hours , but has no way of enforcing or verifying compliance with that rule .
It ’s entirely possible that the swindlers behind all these cons have built a sizable database of information on millions of Facebook users .
I ’m not trying to simply spread FUD ( fear , uncertainty , and doubt ) here .
I cannot definitively prove these claims , but I think they are quite realistic based on my history of investigating Facebook applications and news stories on various scams and rogue apps I ’ve tracked .
And even if this scenario has not happened yet , the determination of past online scammers and the ease of executing such a setup lead me to believe it ’s only a matter of time .
LONDON — Essentially , two World Cups were awarded to South Africa for 2010 .
Most visible was the 32 - team soccer tournament that is the world ’s largest sporting event .
Less observable — and more contentious — were business arrangements that have raised serious questions of conflict of interest between the public and private sectors .
A book released Wednesday by the Institute for Security Studies in South Africa , titled “ Player and Referee : Conflicting Interests and the 2010 FIFA World Cup , ” details six case studies regarding stadium building , official suppliers , bidding practices and government oversight that cast a harsh light on the lack of transparency and public benefit of such arrangements .
The case studies , written by investigative journalists from South Africa and Britain , charge that competing interests among those seeking to benefit financially have left preparations for the 2010 World Cup vulnerable to “ manipulation through the use of influence , political pressure , bribes , fraud and extortion . ”
Many of these accounts have a familiar ring , addressing issues that occurred at previous World Cups .
FIFA , soccer ’s world governing body , has regularly faced charges of secrecy and corruption .
Prosecutors are claiming that a federal judge is hampering a criminal investigation into a webcam scandal at a Philadelphia suburban school district .
The evidence prosecutors are seeking is connected to a federal civil lawsuit in which the plaintiff 's lawyers claim that the Lower Merion School District secretly snapped thousands of webcam images of students using school - issued laptops without the pupils ' knowledge or consent .
U.S. District Judge Jan DuBois , who is presiding over the civil case , two weeks ago ordered that evidence should only be disseminated to those connected to the civil lawsuit .
( . pdf ) U.S. Attorney Michael
Levy wrote the judge , saying Friday that the freeze order " interfered with the government 's obligation to investigate possible criminal conduct occurring within this district . "
Levy asks the court to " modify its order to permit the government access . " ( .pdf ) Among other things , Levy wants to examine what plaintiffs lawyers contend are thousands of screenshots school - supplied MacBooks took of an unknown number of children , some of which might include nude or partially clothed shots .
While it remains unclear whether the secret and remote filming of students is a federal crime , taking nude images of children is likely criminal conduct .
A federal grand jury and the FBI are said to be looking into the district 's actions .
The lawsuit accuses a district IT admin of downloading " pictures of students who were naked while in their home " –- allegations the woman staunchly denies . ( .pdf )
When the story broke in February , the district said the cameras were activated a handful of times when a laptop was reported stolen or missing – an assertion lawyers suing the district say is false .
The district has deactivated the webcam - tracking program secretly lodged on 2,300 student laptops .
The 6,900 - pupil district , which provides students from its two high schools free MacBooks , was sued in federal court in February on allegations that it was undertaking a dragnet surveillance program targeting its students .
The lawsuit , which seeks class - action status , was based on a claim by sophomore Blake Robbins that school officials reprimanded him for " improper behavior " based on photos the computer secretly took of the boy at home last fall .
Another picture shows him asleep at home in October .
That " behavior " turned out to be pill - popping .
The family said their son was eating Mike and Ike candy .

Similar home - made gins are common across Africa
Some 80 people have died in Uganda after drinking illegal home - made banana gin laced with methanol , a health official says .
Patrick Tusiime said so many people had died because relatives did not want to admit that people had been drinking the gin , known as waragi .
The deaths have occurred over the past three weeks in the south - western Kabale district , he told Reuters news agency .
He said the authorities were conducting house - to - house searches for the gin .
The BBC's Joshua Mmali in the capital , Kampala , says waragi is drunk across Uganda , often by those who cannot afford industrialised alcohol .
He says deaths from drinking it are not uncommon but this is the largest number killed at one time for several years .
About 120 jerrycans of waragi have been seized , reports Uganda 's Daily Monitor newspaper .
" All the alcohol found has been confiscated but people are stubborn and have found ingenious ways of hiding it , " Mr Tusiime said .
He said those affected became blind and suffered liver and kidney failure before dying .

A $ 4 bracelet is getting one Florida student into big trouble after , he says , his school objected to the bracelet 's anti-cancer messages .
Fourteen - year - old Frankie Rodriguez had been wearing the bracelet around his wrist for the past month .
It reads , " I love boobies " and " Keep A Breast . "
School officials at Tomlin Middle School say its a huge distraction , but Rodriguez says he wears the bracelet to support family members who have fought breast cancer .
" They just took it as sexual , and it was n't anything like that at all , " he told MyFoxOrlando.com .
Last Friday , school officials took the bracelet away , but later returned it .
Then on Monday , he wore the bracelet to school again , and administrators threatened him with suspension when he did n't turn it over .
" The student was disciplined for being disrespectful and inappropriate behavior because he was disrespectful to the teacher and school resource officer .
It was not about the bracelet itself , " school spokesperson Linda Cobbe told MyFoxOrlando.com .
With the school threatening suspension , Frankie has decided not to wear the bracelet anymore .
" I kind of just do n't want to get into trouble anymore , " he told MyFoxOrlando.com .

eBay has become one of the biggest online auction sites Online auction bidders have been given a " wake - up call " after a man was prosecuted for bidding against himself to raise prices .
Trading standards officers warn it is illegal to push up a price artificially by bidding against yourself or by getting family or friends to do so .
The process is known as shill bidding and breaks new European Union fair trading rules .
Offences carry a maximum fine of £ 5,000 in UK law .
First case Minibus hire firm boss Paul Barrett , 39 , from Stanley , County Durham , pleaded guilty to 10 offences at Skipton Magistrates '
Court after using two separate eBay accounts to bid on and increase the prices of his own items .
He told the court he was unaware that bidding on his own items , including a pie- and pasty - warmer , was against the law .
The case was adjourned for sentencing at Bradford Crown Court on 21 May .
Claire McKinley , trading standards officer , told the court : " Mr Barrett placed bids on items he himself owned to raise the price and left positive feedback on his own eBay site , leading buyers to believe his reputation was better than was the case . "
Jo Boutflower , of North Yorkshire Trading Standards , said : " I think people do it either themselves or by getting friends and family to bid on their items and do not think they are doing anything wrong , but actually they are breaking the law .
" We certainly hope this case is a bit of a wake - up call to people who do trade on eBay , or other auction sites . "
Speaking after the hearing on 16 April , Vanessa Canzini of eBay said : " Shill bidding is illegal and it is important for people to understand that there is not , nor has there ever been , room for illegal activity on our site .
" We invest over £ 6 m each year in state - of - the - art technology to detect shill bidding and other illegal activities .
" This acts as a strong deterrent to the small minority who attempt to use our site inappropriately but , more than this , it helps us to work with law enforcement agencies to secure successful prosecutions if anyone decides to try their luck . "

The phone supports high - definition video and surround sound
The first handset to use the Symbian operating system since it became open source has been announced by Nokia .
The N8 phone has a 12 megapixel camera and allows people to record and edit High Definition video clips , as well as watch web TV services .
Analysts said the phone was a " pivotal device " in efforts " to make Nokia 's high end phones credible again " .
It is also a chance for Symbian to prove itself alongside Google 's Android operating system and Apple 's iPhone .
Despite being the world 's most popular smart phone software , Symbian has lost " mindshare " against more high - profile software , according to industry experts .
Analysts at CCS Insight described the Symbian 3 software as " evolutionary not revolutionary " but said it was a " key first step if it proves reliable " .
Cinema support
It is the first version of the software since the Symbian foundation announced that it had made its code open source in February .
The Foundation - which includes Nokia , Motorola and Samsung amongst others - gave away the code to developers for free in the hope that it would help speed up the pace of improvements .
Any organisation or individual can now use and modify it .
The software in the N8 allows the phone to have multi- touch and multi-tasking , meaning more than one application can be open at any one time .
The device will be Nokia 's flagship smartphone .
It can be plugged into home theatres and supports surround sound as well as high - quality video .
Social networks , such as Twitter and Facebook , can be displayed on the home screen in a single application .
Lee Williams , executive director of the Symbian Foundation , said he was " stoked " that Nokia had chosen to use the operating system on its phone .
The phone will ship in the third quarter of 2010 , following delays .

Joel Tenenbaum , the second P2P defendant to take his case to trial in the US , may never pay the $ 675,000 judgment currently filed against him — but someone on his legal team will soon be paying something .
Judge Nancy Gertner has ruled that both Tenenbaum and his lawyer , Harvard Law's Charles Nesson , are " jointly and severally liable " for some fees incurred by the RIAA during the trial .
The ruling comes after the defense team inexplicably posted the very songs at issue in the case to the Internet , and Nesson posted a public link on his blog for anyone to download them .
This behavior prompted a discovery request from the record labels , which wanted to know more about why the defense was now doing the very thing it had been accused of doing in the lawsuit .
Nesson did n't want to tell them .
The labels then filed a " motion to compel " the information .
The judge sums it all up :
[ Nesson 's ] terse response to plaintiffs ' motion to compel merely stated that , in his personal opinion , the plaintiffs ' requests were not relevant to this litigation .
As indicated in this Court 's June 16 , 2009 , order , plaintiffs ' request for information relating to the defense 's unauthorized distribution of the very copyrighted works on which plaintiffs ' claims were based was clearly relevant to such issues as the willfulness of the defendant 's conduct and the amount of damages to be awarded by the jury .
Lawyers who win a " motion to compel " are entitled to have their costs for that particular motion reimbursed ; it 's a way to keep opposing lawyers from dragging their feet on discovery requests with no good reason .
The labels have asked that these fees be paid by the defense , and Gertner on Tuesday agreed .
On June 18 , 2009 , the judge made clear her displeasure with Nesson 's behavior in the case , so this week 's ruling is n't a surprise .
The Court 's indulgence is at an end .
Too often , as described below , the important issues in this case have been overshadowed by the tactics of defense counsel : taping opposing counsel without permission ( and in violation of the law ) , posting recordings of court communications and e-mails with potential experts ( who have rejected the positions counsel asserts ) on the Internet , and now allegedly replicating the acts that are the subject of this lawsuit , namely uploading the copyrighted songs that the Defendant is accused of file - sharing .
It also did n't help that Nesson filed no response to the record label motion against him .
The labels have until March 8 to file with the court " an affidavit containing an itemized statement of the expenses they incurred in filing the motion to compel . "
Nesson , who took on the Tenenbaum case pro bono , may now being paying out of his own pocket for the privilege of defending Tenenbaum .

Apple iPad
To see how others compare , we have to look at the superstar , even though , by now , there 's a small chance you might be just a little tiny bit oversaturated with iPad coverage .
But for the sake of context , here 's what the iPad is , and what it can and ca n't do .
G/O Media may get a commission Subscribe and Get Your First Bag Free Promo Code AtlasCoffeeDay20
With the iPad , you 're getting a tablet computer with a 9.7 - inch ( 1024x768 ) LCD display running iPhone OS 3.2 .
It 's got a 1GHz Apple ARM A4 processor , and is available with either 16GB , 32GB , or 64GB of flash storage .
You can opt for Wi -Fi only or 3G , and the prices range from $ 500 to $ 830 .
By all accounts , it 's a fast little bugger .

Sounds good !
Until you hit the creeping list of the iPad 's faults :
No camera .
No USB , just one 30 - pin port ( with an optional camera - only USB add - on ) .
Ca n't play Flash animation or video .
Problematic on - screen keyboard .
And of course , no multitasking , though this one may get resolved in a coming OS update .

That 's a lot of compromises to make , and a lot of holes for the iPad argument .
The following seven devices — from tablets to smartbooks to netbooks to ebook readers — are alternatives that come with many of these holes already filled in .

Notion Ink Adam Android Tablet
Notion
Ink does n't have much of a track record in the United States , but a clean slate may work to its advantage .
Their Android - based Adam tablet boasts a sleek enough design , but more impressive are its Tegra 2 guts and promised 16 - hour battery life .
It 'll output at 1080 p on its 10 - inch , 1024x600 display , which the iPad can't .
It has a 3MP camera — on a swivel , for front and back facing — HDMI and USB ports where the iPad has none , and yes , a browser that supports Flash .

Secret Weapon : The Adam's Pixel Qi screen is downright revolutionary .
It 's got a backlit LCD mode for web browsing , but can be easily switched to a low - power electrophoretic reflective mode — which looks a lot like E - Ink — that 's easier on the eyes for eBook reading and bumps battery life up to a purported 160 hours .

Achilles Heel :
The screen , the manufacturer and the device are all untested .
Aside from a hands - on with a prototype at CES and some leaked video , we have n't seen much of Adam , and wo n't be able to even passively endorse it until we do .
It 's one thing to promise the moon ; it 's another to deliver it .

Dell Mini 5 Android Tablet
The Dell Mini 5 is the smallest tablet on our list , but that 's not necessarily a bad thing .
Mark found it " very light and comfortable to use " in his hands - on at CES , and also lauded Dell 's iteration of Android for its ease of use .
The Mini 5 's multitouch 5 - inch LCD display makes it conceivably pocket - sized , and it's got a speedy 1GHz Snapdragon processor under the hood along with Wi -Fi , 3G and Bluetooth connectivity .
The two features that really stand out , though : a 5 MP camera , and the ability to make phone calls .
Dell 's been coy on other specifics like price and release date , but the Mini 5 occupies a unique space as a truly portable tablet / phone .

Secret Weapon : That SIM card .
While holding the Mini 5 up to your head may look a little Zack Morris - esque , it 's a device that answers the question of why you 'd ever want — or be able afford — both a phone and a tablet .
It 's an all - in - one solution that , at least in our first impressions , seems competently executed .

Achilles Heel :
The size .
As the Sony Rolly proved once and for all , " unique " does n't necessarily equal " good . "
In the case of the Mini 5 , the screen seems too small to fully enjoy content on , while the device is too big to comfortably use as a day - to - day phone .

HP Slate Windows 7 Tablet
While Android seems to be the operating system of choice for most tablets coming out this year , HP has thrown its lot in with Microsoft .
That 's given their Slate a high - profile CES introduction from Steve Ballmer , and the confidence to tout their Flash capability .
And at a reported $ 540 MSRP , it 's at least competitive with iPad pricing , though it wo n't launch until June at the earliest .
So wait : a tablet from a reputable company that 's got more functionality than the iPad and costs around the same ?
I 'm listening .

Secret Weapon : HP clearly thinks
Flash is going to be the differentiator , and they 've been hitting that point hard in their marketing so far .
But the more important point may be that the Slate 's going to be packing more processing firepower than most of the competition .
If they can find a way to harness that without sacrificing too much battery life , it 'll be a formidable device .

Achilles Heel : Even though HP will put a TouchSmart skin on top of Windows 7 , it 's still Windows 7 .
And as Jason pointed out last month , Windows - based tablets have a terrible track record .
Why would Microsoft 's newest Tablet PC do any better than a decade of flops ?
This Windows Phone 7 tablet concept — and the mysterious Courier OS lurking somewhere on the horizon — has us wondering if HP even chose the right Microsoft platform .

Lenovo Skylight Smartbook
Smartbooks are a bit of a sleeper category , since no one really knows what they are yet .
Lenovo's Skylight has the form factor of a very thin netbook and the guts of a very powerful smartphone .
Think of it as a tablet with a physical keyboard .
It 's an aesthetically pleasing , light - weight Wi-Fi device that 'll be paired with AT&T for 3G .
It runs a custom OS that 's fun and easy to use , and Lenovo 's pre-loading it with several " web gadgets " ( apps , basically ) to round out your experience .

Secret Weapon :
That keyboard .
If smartbooks are going to succeed at all , it 'll be because people will tire of the unsatisfying on - screen typing experience tablets provide .
And at our hands - on at CES , it was much more comfortable and convenient be able to email and navigate at full speed .
Advertisement
Achilles Heel : Apps .
When the rest of the competition has Android , the Apple App Store , or whatever Windows brings to the table , Lenovo going solo is either a bold move or a stupid one .
There 's no question that the Skylight rates high in usability , but when it 's released it may not offer all that much to use .

Acer Aspire One 532g Netbook
During the iPad unveiling , Steve Jobs notably said that netbooks " are n't better than anything . "
But there 's a slew of netbooks coming this summer that may be better than the iPad .
The first of these is going to be the Acer Aspire One 532g , with Intel 's latest and greatest netbook processor , the Atom N450 and a next - gen Nvidia Ion processor with Nvidia Optimus technology .
What 's all that mean ?
That it 's going to be the most capable netbook ever , and far more powerful than any tablet .
You 'll even be able to play 3D games on it .
Advertisement
Secret Weapon : That Nvidia Ion 2 / Optimus combination is going to change some minds about what netbooks can and can't do .
The Aspire One 532g is going to have up to 10 hours of battery life , and you 'll be able to stream HD video , play World of Warcraft , and generally handle graphics processing better than any netbook of this generation .
Advertisement
Achilles Heel :
It 's going to be a great netbook ... but it 's still a netbook , which does n't quite scratch the same itch that the iPad does .
It 'll be bulkier .
It may cost more .
And it wo n't have the same instantly gratifying app experience .

Kindle Ebook Reader
The Kindle is the granddaddy of eBook readers , and it 's still our favorite on the market .
It 's got a crisp , sharp display , a solid refresh rate and most importantly its e-ink display is easy on the eyes .
That 's an important contrast for people tempted to use their iPad primarily as an ebook reader : Apple 's LCD screen is going to wear out some people 's eyeballs .
The Kindle may be one - dimensional , but its price reflects that :
At $ 260 it's about half the cheapest iPad 's cost , and a lifetime of 3G connectivity is included in that fee .
Throw in a full week 's worth of battery on a single charge , and the Kindle starts to look pretty appealing for the literary set .
Advertisement
Secret Weapon : Being different .
Going the straight black - and - white book route , and being the best at that particular game , will win some people over .
But Amazon is n't going to rest there .
They are also exploring more tablet - like multitouch concepts for their device , which may prove to be yet another powerful tool in the arsenal .
Advertisement
Achilles Heel : Even though Amazon opened up an SDK recently ( with partners like Zagat and EA already on board ) , the Kindle 's still a very long ways off from being anything other than an ebook reader .
The black - and - white screen may just be too boring , and too slow .
And although they have a lot of clout , their goal of a more multicolored multitouch experience may prove too little too late .

Spring Design Alex Ebook Reader
When John got a hands - on with the Spring Design Alex , he saw it as an ebook reader " for hardware nerds . "
Sounds promising .
The Alex is a dual - screen Android ebook reader , with one large e-ink display coupled with a ( still sizable ) secondary LCD screen .
Best of all , it 'll run apps written for other Android devices , though getting them installed at this point is not an easy feat , since it does n't have Android Marketplace on board .
Advertisement
Issues aside , the Alex represents the best of both worlds : a full app experience coupled with a soothing e-ink display for reading .
And while Borders is n't as flashy a content partner as Barnes & Noble or Amazon or Apple 's iBooks store , you 'll find a plentiful selection and competitive pricing .
Currently , you can only pre-order a Wi -Fi version , and because of heavier broadband demands than , say , Kindle , if a 3G Alex does show up it 'll likely require a monthly data plan .
Advertisement
Secret Weapon : The Barnes & Noble Nook has a dual screen as well , but only the Alex has a browser , and lets you push content from the LCD up to the e-ink display .
That means you can navigate to a web page and let it render on the bottom screen , then view it on e-ink .
It 's more than just a parlor trick :
The ability to read web pages on the larger screen will make long usage periods much more manageable for your eyeballs .
Advertisement
Achilles Heel :
That price is a little out of control ; it 's hard to imagine paying $ 400 for an ebook reader — however many apps it can run , and however clever the hardware set - up — when you can get a content - spewing tablet for just a hundred dollars more .
Besides , although we have n't run our review yet , it 's clear that this device will be limited , in some ways , to tinkerers who want to push its Android possibilities .
Guru has passed away yesterday morning ( April 19 ) after a long battle with cancer .
According to Solar , Guru suffered from the malicious illness for over a year and after numerous special treatments under the supervision of medical specialists failed , the legendary MC succumbed to the disease .
Guru always tried to keep this harrowing diagnosis in private but in early 2010 he had to admit himself to hospital due to serious effects caused by the disease .
Since the onset of illness , Guru tried to live a “ normal ” life as an influential and outstanding musician , loving father , family man , and best friend .
Doctors encouraged Guru to think positive that the cancer can be arrested and that a full recovery is possible but several special treatments including hard hitting chemotherapies failed .
While in hospital with terminal cancer , Guru wrote a letter , which was provided by Solar , to his fans addressing his illness , his shining music career , his family and loved ones .
“ I , Guru , am writing this letter to my fans , friends and loved ones around the world .
I have had a long battle with cancer and have succumbed to the disease .
I have suffered with this illness for over a year .
I have exhausted all medical options .
I have a non-profit organization called Each One Counts dedicated to carrying on my charitable work on behalf of abused and disadvantaged children from around the world and also to educate and research a cure for this terrible disease that took my life .
I write this with tears in my eyes , not of sorrow but of joy for what a wonderful life I have enjoyed and how many great people I have had the pleasure of meeting , ” read the official Guru statement .
“ My loyal best friend , partner and brother , Solar , has been at my side through it all and has been made my health proxy by myself on all matters relating to myself .
He has been with me by my side on my many hospital stays , operations , doctors visits and stayed with me at my home and cared for me when I could not care for myself .
Solar and his family is my family and I love them dearly and I expect my family , friends , and fans to respect that , regardless to anybody ’s feelings on the matter .
It is my wish that counts .
This being said I am survived by the love of my life , my sun KC , who I trust will be looked after by Solar and his family as their own .
Any awards or tributes should be accepted , organized approved by Solar on behalf myself and my son until he is of age to except on his own . ”
The statement reads on , “ I do not wish my ex-DJ to have anything to do with my name likeness , events tributes etc. connected in anyway to my situation including any use of my name or circumstance for any reason and I have instructed my lawyers to enforce this .
I had nothing to do with him in life for over 7 years and want nothing to do with him in death .
Solar has my life story and is well informed on my family situation , as well as the real reason for separating from my ex-DJ .
As the sole founder of GangStarr , I am very proud of what GangStarr has meant to the music world and fans .
I equally am proud of my Jazzmatazz series and as the father of Hip - Hop / Jazz .
I am most proud of my leadership and pioneering efforts on Jazzmatazz 4 for reinvigorating the Hip - Hop / Jazz genre in a time when music quality has reached an all time low .
Solar and I have toured in places that I have never been before with GangStarr or Jazzmatatazz and we gained a reputation for being the best on the planet at Hip - Hop / Jazz , as well as the biggest and most influential Hip - Hop / Jazz record with Jazzmatazz 4 of the decade to now .
The work I have done with Solar represents a legacy far beyond its time .
And we as a team were not afraid to push the envelope .
To me this is what true artists do !
As men of honor we stood tall in the face of small mindedness , greed , and ignorance .
As we fought for music and integrity at the cost of not earning millions and for this I will always be happy and proud , and would like to thank the million fans who have seen us perform over the years from all over the world .
The work I have done with Solar represents a legacy far beyond its time and is my most creative and experimental to date .
I hope that our music will receive the attention it deserves as it is some of the best work I have done and represents some of the best years of my life . ”
Guru , born Keith Elam , rose to fame in the 80’s as the founder of the legendary rap group GangStarr .
The group released the classic single Words I Manifest followed by their critically acclaimed debut album No More Mr. Nice Guy ( 1989 ) and the classic album Step In The Arena ( 1991 ) .
Guru was the first artist to truly blend Hip - Hop with Live Jazz beginning in 1993 , and seeing the vast influences his Jazzmatazz concept has had on the industry , it is clear that Guru ’s musical contributions have been way ahead of their time .
Guru has worked with such great artists as Herbie Hancock , Isaac Hayes , Donald Byrd , Ramsey Lewis , Roy Ayers , Chaka Kahn , Branford Marsalis , David Sanborn , Bob James , Erykah Badu , The Roots , Common , Angie Stone , Jamiroquai , Macy Gray and Damien Marley , to name a few .
Despite the fact that Guru is n’t hailing from New York , he is noted as a pioneer of the New York sound and true lyrical Hip - Hop .
Guru later on joined forces with hit producer Solar and formed his label 7 Grand Records with the goal to keep “ real ” Hip - Hop alive .
Guru ’s longtime partner , Solar , issues an official statement about the lost of the legendary MC which you can read below :
“ The world has lost one of the best MCs and Hip - Hop icons of all time — my loyal best friend , partner , and brother , Guru !
Guru has been battling cancer for well over a year and has lost his battle !
This is a matter that Guru wanted private until he could beat it but tragically this did not happen .
The cancer took him .
Now the world has lost a great man and a true genius .
For the fans that reached out with love and support , I ca n’t tell you how much that meant to Guru and myself .
Guru prepared this letter [ read above ] while he was in the hospital for the fans .
I hope now that Guru has moved on to a better place !
Guru is a great Black American
Hero and should always be remembered as such and he is much more that just a Hip - Hop icon — he has changed the world for the better .
I salute my fallen brother Guru !
He will be missed tremendously ! ” Solar stated .
We will sorely miss Guru , both from a personal and from a professional standpoint .
Our warmest condolences to Guru ’s family and loved ones at this difficult time .
WASHINGTON , April 6 ( UPI ) --
About half of U.S. residents support President Barack Obama 's plan to develop high - speed rail corridors , a poll released Tuesday indicated .
The Canadian polling company , Angus Reid Public Opinion , found 49 percent of those surveyed said they support high - speed rail .
About one - third , 32 percent , said they would use the service rather than driving or taking a plane .

One -quarter of respondents , 26 percent , said they oppose building high - speed rail corridors .
Respondents were shown a map of proposed routes , which cover much of the country except the Plains and mountain states of the West .
Obama has proposed high - speed rail in California and linking Portland , Ore. , Seattle and Vancouver in Canada .
Democrats were twice as likely as Republicans -- 70 percent to 34 percent -- to support high - speed rail .
Among independents , 44 percent support high - speed rail and 35 percent oppose it .
While 44 percent of Democrats would use high - speed rail , only 24 percent of Republicans and 30 percent of independents said they would .
Angus Reid surveyed 1,005 adults online March 31 and April 1 .
The margin of error is 3.1 percent either way .
Update : On 23 March 2010 the IDF Spokesperson stated that the MAG had given instructions to launch an investigation .
On 1 January 2012 the MAG Corps informed B’Tselem that the investigation had been concluded and the case file sent to a military prosecutor for review .
On 13 May 2013 the MAG Corps informed B’Tselem that the supplementary investigation required for the case had also been concluded and the case file sent to a military prosecutor for review .
On 25 Feb. 2015 , the MAG Corps informed B’Tselem that the case had been closed .

On 20 March 2010 , soldiers killed two youths in the village of ' Iraq Burin , near Nablus .
The IDF Spokesperson stated that the two had been killed by rubber - coated metal bullets while participating in a violent , illegal demonstration .
Several days after B'Tselem published its findings regarding the incident , which contradicted this statement , the Judge Advocate General 's Office announced a rare decision that the Military Police would investigate the incident .
On Saturday , 20 March ' 10 , in the middle of the day , villagers demonstrated in ' Iraq Burin , mostly in the eastern section of the village .
During the demonstration , stones were thrown at soldiers and border policemen .
Four Israeli jeeps were stationed on the main road leading to the village 's western section .
B'Tselem 's investigation indicates that around 3:30 P.M. , a service taxi coming from Nablus stopped on the main road .
A small group of people was standing by the road , and several minutes earlier , Israeli security forces had hurled tear - gas canisters in the area .
Some ten people got off the taxi , among them Muhammad Qadus , 15 , and Usaid Qadus , 17 , residents of the village .
Muhammad noticed a friend of his among the group of people standing by the roadside , about 100 meters west of the jeeps , and joined him .
Usaid went and stood on the opposite side of the road .
Mere moments after that , Usaid was struck by a single shot in the head .
As Muhammad ran to him immediately , and was struck by a single shot in the chest .
Several people put the two into the taxi in which they had come , and the driver took them to a hospital in Nablus .
A few minutes after arrival , Muhammad died of his wounds .
Usaid arrived in critical condition .
He underwent emergency surgery and remained in the Intensive Care Unit .
He died of his wounds at 4:00 A.M. the next day , 21 March .
On the day of the event , the IDF Spokesperson announced that IDF forces that had come to the village encountered a crowd of Palestinians who threw stones at them .
According to the announcement , the forces had responded with means for dispersing demonstrators , which included the firing of rubber - coated metal bullets , and saw that two Palestinians who had been injured were evacuated .
The announcement stressed that the forces had not used live ammunition , and that the Palestinians had been struck by rubber - coated metal bullets that were fired in accordance with procedures .
The findings of B'Tselem 's investigation blatantly contradict this announcement .
First , they indicate that only a handful of people were standing on the main road where Muhammad and Usaid Qadus were shot , and that the most of the demonstration had taken place in the eastern section of the village , in the hours preceding the event .
Furthermore , even if stones were indeed thrown at soldiers in the western section , Muhammad and Usaid had stood some 100 meters from the forces - clearly in no position to pose a grave threat to their lives .
Second , the medical findings raise grave suspicion that the two were struck by live fire .
An X - ray of Usaid 's head , which shows the bullet lodged inside his head , and photographs of the entry and exit wounds in Muhammad 's body indicate that the two were not struck by rubber - coated metal bullets .
These findings raise serious doubts regarding the IDF Spokesperson 's statement that only rubber - coated bullets had been used .
In addition , eyewitnesses gave testimony to B'Tselem that during the demonstration , the forces had fired live bullets too .
B'Tselem 's findings generated media discussion of the event .
On 23 March , the IDF Spokesperson announced that the judge advocate general , Maj. Gen. Avichai Mandelblit , had ordered a Military Police investigation into the circumstances of the incident .
This decision is exceptional as in the vast majority of cases in which security forces kill Palestinians , the army refuses to open a Military Police investigation and suffices with an operational debriefing carried out by the unit in charge of the incident .
B'Tselem wrote to the office of the Judge Advocate for Operational Affairs , suggesting that the organization give the Military Police its investigative findings and information relating to the incident .

The Uniplate library contains many traversal operations , some based on functions in SYB ( Scrap Your Boilerplate ) .
SYB providesfor bottom - up traversals andfor top - down traversals .
Uniplate providesfor bottom - up traversals , but has no operation similar to .
This article explains why I did n't include aoperation , and why I believe that most uses ofare probably incorrect .
Theoperation applies a function to every node in a tree , starting at the bottom and working upwards .
To give a simple example : Callingon the inputgives .
We can writein terms of the Uniplate operation , which applies a function to every child node :
On every application ofthe argument always consists of a root node which has not yet been processed , along with child nodes that have been processed .
My thesis explains how we can guarantee a transform reaches a fixed point , by callingagain before every constructor on the RHS of any clause :
Nowis guaranteed to reach a fixed point .
Theoperation is predictable , and naturally defines bottom - up transformations matching the users intention .
Unfortunately , the ordering and predictability ofis significantly more subtle .
We can easily defineHere the transformation is applied to every child of the result of .
Withevery node is processed exactly once , but withsome nodes are processed multiple times , and some are not processed at all .
The first clause of , which returns , does not result in the root ofbeing processed .
Similarly , our second cause returns two levels of constructor , causing the innerto be both generated and then processed .
When people look atthe intuitive feeling tends to be that all the variables on the RHS will be processed ( i.e. ) , which in many cases mostly matches the behaviour of .
Being mostly correct means that many tests work , but certain cases fail - with our function , the first example works , butresults in .
The original version of Uniplate contained , and I spent an entire day tracking down a bug whose cause turned out to be a function whose RHS was just a variable , much like the first clause of Before describing the solution to top - down transformations , it 's interesting to first explore where top - down transformations are necessary .
I have identified two cases , but there many be more .
Firstly , top - down transformations are useful when one LHS is contained within another LHS , and you wish to favour the larger LHS .
For example :
Here the second LHS is contained within the first .
If we perform a bottom - up transformation then the innerexpression will be transformed to , and the first clause will never match .
Changing to a top - down transformation allows the larger rule to match first .
Secondly , top - down transformations are useful when some information about ancestors is accumulated as you proceed downwards .
The typical example is a language with let expressions which builds up a set of bindings as it proceeds downwards , these bindings then affect which transformations are made .
Sadly , cannot express such a transformation .
The solution to both problems is to use theoperation , and explicitly control the recursive step .
We can rewrite the original example using
Here we explicitly callto continue the transformation .
The intuition that all variables are transformed is now stated explicitly .
In this particular example we can also common - up the three subexpressionsin the second clause , giving a more efficient transformation .
If needed , we can add an extra argument toto pass down information from the ancestors .
After experience with Uniplate I decided that usingcorrectly was difficult .
I looked at all my uses ofand found that a few of them had subtle bugs , and in most cases usingwould have done exactly the same job .
I looked at all the code on Hackage ( several years ago ) and found only six uses of , all of which could be replaced withwithout changing the meaning .
I consider top - down transformations in the style ofto be dangerous , and strongly recommend using operations likeinstead .
Are you interested in either generics programming or Haskell ?
Are you going to ICFP 2010 ?
Why not : Submit a paper to the Workshop on Generic Programming - Generic programming is about making programs more adaptable by making them more general .
This workshop brings together leading researchers and practitioners in generic programming from around the world , and features papers capturing the state of the art in this important area .
Offer a talk at the Haskell Implementors Workshop - an informal gathering of people involved in the design and development of Haskell implementations , tools , libraries , and supporting infrastructure .
I'm on the program committee for both , and look forward to receiving your contributions .
First of all , I will admit that I blew off some steam yesterday by taking issue with the shoddy officiating .
I am not perfect , and neither are NHL referees .
Like Jose Canseco before me , I had a Twitter meltdown yesterday , and I ’m not proud of it .
My comments were made mostly in jest , but there seems to be a growing number of Canuck fans that actually believe Gary Bettman and his Board of Shadowy Figures are out to get them .
Media - types are getting flooded with tweets on the subject , most of them of the embarrassing variety .
Can we be reality for a second here ?
Take the tinfoil hat off for a moment and be honest with ourselves about what ’s happened in this series so far .
I ’ll be the first to admit , the optics are not good .
Mike Murphy , VP of Hockey Operations for the NHL and the official ‘ overseer ’ for this series , is a former player , coach and assistant GM for the L.A. Kings .
In an interview with Kings.com earlier this season he offered this unnerving little nugget : “ I think it would be so neat to see the Kings succeed and win a Stanley Cup because it would do just a tremendous amount for the Southern California market and the Kings franchise . ”
Ah yes , so neat .
Murphy also worked as an assistant coach for the Canucks at one point , which evens the scales somewhat , but still , it does n’t look good .
But when has this league ever cared about optics ?
Right now there ’s a major upset in the making in the desert , as Phoenix is currently up two games to one on the Western Conference powerhouse Red Wings .
This is a team that the NHL literally owns and has an invested interest in seeing succeed .
It would be so easy to pull the conspiracy card in that series , and indeed , many are .
But for their part , the Coyotes appear to be winning games on merit .
For the most part , so are the Kings .
The Canucks currently have issues that go far beyond a few botched calls here and there , egregious as they may be .
Daniel ’s waved - off goal does n’t change the fact that Roberto Luongo was on the bench when he “ scored ” it .
It does n’t change the fact that the team ’s penalty - kill is clicking at what must be one of the worst rates in playoff history .
You ca n’t even point to missing Ryan Johnson ( who really is n’t that good anyway ) , because all three of the Kings powerplay goals last night were scored while the first unit was still on the ice .
Kesler and Burrows , our dazzling short - handed scoring threats , our Selke candidates , are not doing what they should .
After two strong games at home , Roberto looked more like Reboundo last night , and the defense are not doing their usual job of hopping on those loose pucks and clearing them out .
Michal Handzus is being allowed to sit right on the door - step unchecked and bang them home into an open cage .
The intensity needed to win in the post - season is conspicuously absent far too often .
The team comes on in waves and goes long stretches where they just look disinterested .
You can get away with pouring it on in the third period in the regular season , but this is the playoffs .
Last night ’s second period was an unacceptable effort by just about every measure , not the least of which that for most of the frame the team looked like they were coasting through a mid-season snoozer .
It was a similar story in Game 2 , where they took their foot off the gas after establishing an early lead .
If you are n’t going to play with killer instinct , you just are n’t going to win , it ’s as simple as that .
The Sedins are playing too cute , and it ’s costing them .
Clearly Terry Murray ( who I wash dishappointed to learn doesh NOT shound jushh like hish brudder ) has been alerted to the fact that the twins use the drop - pass when they run into coverage , because every single drop - pass is being jumped on and cleared .
They ’re trying to force their magic by passing right into sticks , skates and opposition players .
Kyle Wellwood , for all the glorious chances he created ( and subsequently fanned on ) last night , is just as guilty of this .
I lost count of how many times I shouted at the television last night in disbelief that the team was STILL trying to pass into traffic .
Pavol Demitra has been abysmal and needs to be removed from the first unit powerplay immediately .
Now , the officiating is n’t doing the Canucks any favours .
But this is n’t a team that should need them .
We ’re using spotty penalties as a railing point to distract from the fact that the team ca n’t kill off a damned penalty to save their lives , and that needs to stop .
There is no conspiracy .
There have been bad calls , but that ’s hockey .
At every level and against every team , it happens .
It has n’t all been bad news .
Ryan Kesler , who seems just the type of player to step it up in the playoffs , is finally doing just that .
Michael Grabner , when he actually sees ice - time , has looked fantastic and was one of Vancouver ’s best players last night .
An encouraging sign for the future , but a troubling sign for right now — where are the real top players ?
When will Alex Burrows make his mark on this series ?
It ’s not over .
And a wake - up call like this is exactly what this team needs right now .
I wonder if they themselves underestimated the Kings .
I know I did .
If you ’re going to need a wake - up call in the playoffs , it ’s best to get that adversity out of the way now .
But this is n’t a team that should need that .
We should n’t be relying on breaks from the refs , or Michael Grabner to be one of our more dangerous scoring threats .
There are problems with this team that are far more serious than a blown goal call , a missed stick through the helmet , or a curious too - many - men penalty .
The officiating anger has boiled up over the course of three games , sure , but lets not let it distract us from the real issues here .
This was supposed to be a team that could make their own luck .
A team with the # 2 offense in the league .
I ’m still waiting for that team to show up in this series .

CDC Retracts Update That Coronavirus Can Spread Through Air
What terrible force is causing scantily - clad coeds to drown in bubbling , red waters of their own blood ?
That 's right - it's a mega piranha , whose powers include largeness and destruction of small towns from the air .
Ah , Syfy original movies .

Syfy 's next original movie is Mega Piranha , which might not be as catchy as Chihuanhas , but is still packing enough goofy , fishy action that you wo n't want to miss it .
When times are tough , people scrimp and save .
But what ’s with all the bras stacked up across the pond ?
A new survey has revealed that British women own a staggering 124 million bras — enough to stretch nearly three times around the world .
The survey , by market researchers onepoll.com , polled 3,000 women aged 18 to 65 .
It found that the typical female owns 13 bras but wears only eight of them regularly .
“ Most women have a bra for each outfit or occasion , but many get condemned to life in a drawer ” after one or two wears , says a website spokeswoman .
At an average cost of 28 British pounds , that means 3.47 billion pounds — $ 5.32 billion — of bras never see the light of day , the survey indicates .
Bra hoarding sounds a little odd but it is n’t at all shocking to Liliana Mann , a lifelong lover of lingerie who has kept abreast of the undergarment - wearing trends of women for decades .
Toronto ’s resident `boob expert ’ says it ’s not just Brits who hoard their bras , noting that most women in developed countries do so , particularly in recessionary times .
“ It ’s an easy pick - me - up and the least expensive luxury for women , ” says Mann , who runs four Linea Intima lingerie shops in Toronto .
“ You may not be able to afford a car or a vacation right now , but you can create a fantasy at home .
“ It ’s a hard item to resist , ” continues Mann , whose stylish and sexy bras run from $ 60 to $ 250 .
“ Women usually say they ’re shopping for two or three but end up buying five , even now . ”
Mann ’s 25 - year - old business has not sagged but instead has held steady in this recession , to the point where she was able to open up her fifth location in London , Ont. in 2008 , “ right when all hell broke loose ” in the economy .
Mann also just put the finishing touches on a renovation to her Bayview Village location to make it look more like a boudoir .
BRA HOARDING also relates to the very practical nature of the fairer sex , whose favourite bras worn in regular rotation still tend to be nude , black and white to match most clothing .
“ Women especially do n’t like to give up their things , even when they ’re old or falling apart or do n’t fit anymore , because we always think we can use them again down the road , ” says Mann .
“ And a bra is such a small item that it does n’t take up hardly any space so it ’s easy just to leave them in a drawer . ”
She ’s not surprised that the poll also revealed 42 per cent of women have never been properly measured for a bra , while many had no idea what their correct size was .
She offers customers professional bra fittings on site and claims to be able to tell in a matter of seconds whether a woman is wearing the right bra for her figure .
“ Our breasts have different sizes , shapes and weights .
Some women are heavier or have sloped shoulders ...
That ’s really why I ’m on a mission here , because it has an effect on your well - being and your self - confidence when you look better , and it all starts under your clothes . ”
She never recommends going bra-less after puberty .
“ It ’s okay if you ’re in the south of France , or if you ’re at home engaging in some hanky - panky .
Otherwise , I do n’t think so . ”
Since the survey relates to women in England , Mann says she suspects a couple of the royals have a few extra bras lying around .
They could clearly use some help getting strapped into a proper one , she adds .
“ I would love to do a fitting with the Queen of England and Camilla Parker Bowles ( Duchess of Cornwall ) .
It ’s a shame because they shop at Harrods and Rigby & Peller , which are great , but because they ’re royalty , they ’re probably being told what they want to hear .
“ I tell it like it is because once you find a good bra you never go back .
It can make you look up to 10 pounds lighter and 20 years younger . ”
Mann would like to help two Americans in particular , Meg Ryan and Laura Bush , noting the former first lady “ always has nice lipstick and hair and clothes but her breasts are hanging down around her waist . ”
A rule of thumb when you ’re unsure is to go for a smaller width and possibly a bigger cup , she tells us .
For instance a lot of the women who think they are 34B are often 32C , but they do n’t account for the give in elasticity from both washing and wearing .
She equates new bras to new shoes .
“ A bit tight is better than too wide because they will conform to your shape . ”
Earlier this month , in Madison , WI , Professor Noam Chomsky reflected on :
His early personal exposure to anarchism and activism through people we would n’t today call ‘ intellectuals ’ , but the insight of ‘ everyday people ’ ;
The crushing of liberation ventures by “ fascism , Stalinism and liberal democracies ” and the “ miraculous sympathy and humanity ” of the most brutally oppressed from Vietnam to Palestine to Southern Colombia ;
His introduction to the “ intellectual class ” of “ liberal democrat ” gatekeepers during his graduate studies and its manipulation of the word “ enemy ” for “ conquerors ” , ‘ radical rewrite ’ of John F. Kennedy ’s “ legacy ” to communicate him as a “ dove ” after the Tet Offensive , ‘ liberal imperialists ’ and their ‘ unprincipled ’ objection to the U.S. invasion of Iraq as a “ strategic blunder ” showing its ‘ deeply rooted imperial mentality ’ ;
The validity of the “ Tea Party Movement ” , the “ big business community ” and their love for Obama , the “ owners of society ” and how policy is engineered for “ their interests ” ;
The “ global shift in power ” from the “ workforce to multinational capital ” making China a giant “ assembly plant ” , the financial community ’s ‘ rational externality ’ of “ systemic risk ” for “ institutional reasons ” provided by the “ Nanny State ” , the “ doom loop ” of government bailouts that provide incentive for those in power to create “ financial crises ” ;
The “ moving ” and “ articulate ” , though “ ridiculed ” , “ manifesto ” of terrorist Joe Stack before his suicide bombing ( 57:48 ) :
I do n’t have to say how pleased and grateful I am for this honor , which also offers an occasion to look back over the years .
What comes to mind with particular salience is the earliest years , perhaps because I ’ve been thinking a lot about them lately , for other reasons .
They were , of course , formative years for me personally , but I think the significance unfortunately goes beyond .
I ’m just old enough to have memories of Hitler ’s speeches on the radio 75 years ago .
I did n’t understand the words , but could n’t fail to grasp the menace of the tone and the cheering mobs .
The first political article I wrote was in February 1939 , right after the fall of Barcelona .
I ’m sure it was nothing memorable .
I can recall a little of it , but much more clearly the mood of fear and foreboding .
The article opened with the words : “ Austria falls , Czechoslovakia falls , and now Barcelona falls ” — and Spain with it , a few months later .
The words have always stayed in my mind , along with the dread , the sense of the dark clouds of fascism gathering over Germany and then Europe and perhaps beyond , a growing force of unimaginable horror .
Though no one could foresee the Holocaust , Kristallnacht had taken place just a few weeks before and the desperate flight of refugees had been building up for years , many of them unable to believe what was happening .
In those years I also had my first experience with radical intellectuals — though they would n’t be called “ intellectuals ” as the term is standardly used , applying to people with status and privilege who are in a position to reach the public with thoughts about human affairs and concerns .
And since privilege confers responsibility , the question always arises as to how they are using that responsibility , topics very much alive in those years in work by Erich Fromm , Russell and Dewey , Orwell , Dwight MacDonald , and others , which I soon came to know .
But the radical intellectuals of my childhood were different .
They were my working - class relatives in New York , mostly unemployed during the Depression , though one uncle , with a disability , had a newsstand thanks to New Deal measures and so was able to help support much of the family .
My parents could , too , in a small way .
As Hebrew teachers in Philadelphia , they had that rare gift of employment , so we had a stream of aunts and cousins staying with us periodically .
My New York relatives mostly had limited formal education .
My uncle , who ran the newsstand and was an enormous influence on my early life , had never gone beyond fourth grade .
But it was one of the most lively intellectual circles I have ever been part of , at least on the periphery as a child .
There were constant discussions about the latest performance of the Budapest String Quartet , the controversies between Stekel and Freud , radical politics and activism , which was then reaching impressive peaks .
Particularly significant were the sit - down strikes , just a step short of workers taking over factories and radically changing the society — ideas that should be very much alive today .
Along with being a major factor in New Deal measures , the rising labor activism aroused great concern in the business world .
Its leading figures warned about “ the hazard facing industrialists [ with ] the rising political power of the masses , ” and the need to intensify “ the everlasting battle for the minds of men , ” and instituted programs to overcome this threat to order and discipline , put aside during the war , but taken up afterward with extreme dedication and scale .
The U.S. is unusual among industrial societies in its highly class - conscious business community , relentlessly fighting a bitter class war , in earlier years with unusual levels of violence , more recently through massive propaganda offensives .
Some of my relatives were close to the Communist Party , others were bitterly anti-Communist from the left ; and some , like my uncle , were anti-Bolshevik , from farther left .
Among those close to the party , while there was ritual obeisance to Russia , I had the feeling that for most the focus was right here : the civil rights and labor movements , welfare reform and badly needed social change .
The party was a force that did not anticipate quick victories , but was always present , ready , persistent , dedicated to moving from temporary defeat to the next struggle , something that we really lack today .
It was also connected with a broader movement of workers ’ education and associations and , not least , an opportunity for my unemployed seamstress aunts to spend a week in the country at an ILGWU resort and other escapes from what should have been a very grim world , though I remember it from my own personal experiences — limited of course — as a time that was full of hope , quite unlike today under circumstances that are objectively much less severe .
By 1941 , I was spending as much time as I could in downtown Manhattan , gravitating to another group of radical intellectuals in the small bookstores on 4th Avenue run by anarchist refugees from the Spanish revolution of 1936 , or the office of the Anarchist Freie Arbeiter Stimme in Union Square nearby .
They , too , did n’t fit the standard formula for intellectuals .
But if by the term we mean people who think seriously about life and society , their problems and possible solutions , against a background of knowledge and understanding , then they were indeed intellectuals , impressive ones .
They were quite happy to spend time with a young kid who was fascinated with the 1936 anarchist revolution , which I thought then , and still think , was one of the high points of Western civilization and in some ways a beacon for a better future .
I picked up a lot of material that I used 30 years later when writing about the topic , most of it not then in print .
Among the most memorable of these materials is a collection of primary documents about collectivization , published in 1937 by the C.N.T. , the anarcho - syndicalist union that is celebrating its centenary this year .
One contribution has resonated in my mind ever since , by peasants of the village of Membrilla .
I would like to quote parts of it :
In [ the ] miserable huts [ of Membrilla ] live the poor inhabitants of a poor province ; eight thousand people , but the streets are not paved , the town has no newspaper , no cinema , neither a café nor a library … .
Food , clothing and tools were distributed equitably to the whole population .
Money was abolished , work collectivized , all goods passed to the community , consumption was socialized .
It was , however , not a socialization of wealth but of poverty … .
The whole population lived as in a large family ; functionaries , delegates , the secretary of the syndicates , the members of the municipal council , all elected , acted as heads of a family .
But they were controlled , because special privilege or corruption would not be tolerated .
Membrilla is perhaps the poorest village of Spain , but it is the most just .
These words , by some of the most impoverished peasants in the country , capture with rare eloquence the achievements and promise of the anarchist revolution .
The achievements did not , of course , spring up from nothing .
They were the outcome of many decades of struggle , experiment , brutal repression — and learning .
The concept of how a just society should be organized was in the minds of the population when the opportunity arose .
The experiment in creating a world of freedom and justice was crushed all too soon by the combined forces of fascism , Stalinism and liberal democracy .
Global power centers understood very well that they must unite to destroy this dangerous threat to subordination and discipline before turning to the secondary task of dividing up the spoils .
In later years , I have sometimes been able to see first - hand at least a little of the lives of poor people suffering brutal repression and violence — in the miserable slums of Haiti at the peak of the terror in the early ’90s , supported by Washington though the facts are still suppressed and highly relevant to today ’s tragedies .
Or in refugee camps in Laos , where tens of thousands of people were huddled , driven from their homes by a C.I.A. mercenary army after years of trying to survive in caves under relentless bombing that had nothing to do with the war in Vietnam , one of the gravest atrocities of modern history , still largely unknown and still killing many people because the land is saturated with unexploded ordnance .
Or in Palestine and southeastern Turkey and many other places .
Among them , particularly important to me for personal reasons , is southern Colombia , where campesinos , indigenous people and Afro-Colombians are being driven from their devastated lands by terror and chemical warfare , called here “ fumigation , ” as if we somehow have the right to destroy other countries on pretexts that we manufacture – people capable of the most miraculous sympathy and humanity , despite the awful suffering in which we play a major role , while looking the other way – though not in Madison , thanks to the work of the Colombia support group here .
One of the things I learned in the anarchist bookstores and offices 70 years ago was that I had been wrong in taking the fall of Barcelona in 1939 to be the death knell for freedom in Spain .
It rang two years earlier , in May 1937 , when the industrial working class was crushed by the Communist - led repression and Communist armies swept through the countryside destroying the collectives , with the assistance of the liberal democracies and with Hitler and Mussolini waiting in the wings — an immense tragedy for Spain , even though not quite the victory that the predators had anticipated .
A few years later , I left home for graduate studies at Harvard , where I had my first extensive experience with the elite intellectual world .
On arrival , I went to the standard faculty - run party for incoming students and was regaled by a very distinguished philosopher with an account of the Depression – which , he assured me , had not taken place .
It was a liberal fabrication .
There were no rag - pickers coming to our door in desperation in the early ’ 30s , no women workers being beaten by security forces while on strike at a textile factory that I passed on a trolley with my mother when I was about five , none of my unemployed working class relatives .
A few businessmen might have suffered , but there was nothing beyond that .
I was soon to learn that this was far from an exception , but I do n’t want to suggest that this was typical of Harvard intellectuals .
Most were Stevenson liberals , people who applauded when Stevenson said at the U.N. that we have to defend Vietnam from “ internal aggression , ” from the “ assault from within , ” as President Kennedy put it .
Words that we hear again today , for example , last Sunday , in The New York Times , where we read that after the conquest of Marja in Helmand Province , the Marines have collided with a Taliban identity so dominant that the movement appears more akin to the only political organization in a one - party town , with an influence that touches everyone .
“ We ’ve got to re-evaluate our definition of the word ‘ enemy , ' ” said Brig .
Gen. Larry Nicholson , commander of the Marine expeditionary brigade in Helmand Province .
“ Most people here identify themselves as Taliban … We have to readjust our thinking so we ’re not trying to chase the Taliban out of Marja , we ’re trying to chase the enemy out , ” he said .
A problem that has always bedeviled conquerors , very familiar to the US from Vietnam , where the leading U.S. government scholar in a widely praised book lamented that the enemy within was the only “ truly mass - based political party in South Vietnam ” and any effort of ours to compete with it politically would be like a conflict between a minnow and a whale , so we had to overcome their political force by using our comparative advantage , violence — as we did .
Others have faced similar problems : for example , the Russians in Afghanistan in the 1980s , an invasion that also elicited the outrage that we muster up for the crimes of enemies .
Middle East specialist William Polk reminds us that the Russians “ won many military victories and through their civic action programs they actually won over many of the villages ” — and in fact , as we know from reliable sources , created substantial freedom in Kabul , particularly for women .
But , to go on with Polk , “ over the decade of their involvement , the Russians won almost every battle and occupied at one time or another virtually every inch of the country , but they lost … the war .
When they gave up and left , the Afghans resumed their traditional way of life . ”
The dilemmas faced by Obama and McChrystal are not quite the same .
The enemy whom the Marines are trying to chase out of their villages have virtually no outside support .
The Russian invaders , in sharp contrast , were facing a resistance that received vital support from the U.S. , Saudi Arabia and Pakistan , who were rounding up the most extreme radical Islamic fundamentalists they could find — including those terrorizing women in Kabul — and were arming them with advanced weapons , while also carrying forward the program of radical Islamization of Pakistan , yet another one of Reagan ’s gifts to the world , along with Pakistan ’s nuclear weapons .
The goal of these U.S. operations was not to defend Afghanistan .
It was explained frankly by the C.I.A. station chief in Islamabad , who was running the operations .
The goal was to “ kill Soviet Soldiers . ”
He boasted that he “ loved ” this “ noble goal , ” making it very clear , in his words , that “ the mission was not to liberate Afghanistan , ” which he did n’t care about .
You ’re familiar I ’m sure with Zbigniew Brzezinski ’s somewhat similar boasts .
By the early 1960s , I was deeply engaged in antiwar activities .
I wo n’t go into the details , though they tell us a lot about the intellectual climate , particularly in liberal Boston .
By 1966 , my own involvement was deep enough so that my wife went back to college to get a degree after 17 years because of the likelihood of a long prison sentence — which came very close .
The trial was already announced , but canceled after the Tet offensive , which convinced the business community that the war was becoming too costly and , in any event , the major war aims had been achieved – another long story I wo n’t go into .
After the Tet offensive and the shift in official policy , it suddenly turned out that everyone had been a long - term opponent of the war — in deep silence .
Kennedy memoirists rewrote their accounts to present their hero as a dove – untroubled by the radical revisions or by the extensive documentary evidence showing that JFK would consider withdrawal from a war he knew to be domestically unpopular only after victory was assured .
Even before the Tet offensive there were growing doubts in these circles , not about the sentimental notions of right and wrong that we reserve for the crimes of enemies , but about the likelihood of success in beating back the “ assault from within . ”
Perhaps , a paradigm was Arthur Schlesinger ’s reflections when he was beginning to be concerned that victory might not be so easily at hand .
As he put it , “ we all pray ” that the hawks will be right and that the surge of the day will bring victory .
And if it does , we will be praising the “ wisdom and statesmanship ” of the U.S. government in gaining military victory while leaving “ the tragic country gutted and devastated by bombs , burned by napalm , turned into a wasteland by chemical defoliation , a land of ruin and wreck , ” with its “ political and institutional fabric ” pulverized .
But escalation probably wo n’t succeed and will prove to be too costly for ourselves , so perhaps strategy should be rethought .
Little has changed today when Obama is hailed as a leading opponent of the Iraq invasion because it was a “ strategic blunder , ” words that one could also have read in Pravda by the mid-1980s .
The imperial mentality is very deeply rooted .
It is sad to say , but not false , that within the dominant spectrum the liberal imperialists are “ the good guys . ”
A likely alternative is revealed by the most recent polls .
Almost half of voters say that the average Tea Party member is closer to their views than President Obama , whom fewer prefer .
There ’s an interesting breakdown .
Eighty - seven percent of those in the so - called “ Political Class ” say their views are closer to Obama’s .
Sixty - three percent of what are called “ Mainstream Americans ” say their views are closer to the Tea Party .
On virtually all issues , Republicans are trusted by the electorate more than Democrats , in many cases by double digits .
Other evidence suggests that these polls are recording distrust rather than trust .
The level of anger and fear in the country is like nothing I can recall in my lifetime .
And since the Democrats are in power , the revulsion over the current social - economic - political world attaches to them .
Unfortunately , these attitudes are understandable .
For over 30 years , real incomes for the majority of the population have stagnated or declined , social indicators have steadily deteriorated since the mid-1970s after closely tracking growth in earlier years , work hours and insecurity have increased along with debt .
Wealth has accumulated , but into very few pockets , leading to probably record inequality .
These are , in large part , consequences of the financialization of the economy since the 1970s and the corresponding hollowing out of domestic production .
What people see before their eyes is that the bankers who are primarily responsible for the current crisis and who were saved from bankruptcy by the public are now reveling in record profits and huge bonuses , while official unemployment stays at about 10 percent and in manufacturing is at depression levels , one in six , with good jobs unlikely to return .
People rightly want answers and they are not getting them , except from voices that tell tales that have some internal coherence , but only if you suspend disbelief and enter into their world of irrationality and deceit .
Ridiculing Tea Party shenanigans is a serious error , I think .
It would be far more appropriate to understand what lies behind them and to ask ourselves why justly angry people are being mobilized by the extreme right and not by forces like those that did so in my childhood , in the days of formation of the C.I.O. and other constructive activism .
To take just one illustration of the operation of really existing market democracy , Obama ’s primary constituency was financial institutions , which have gained such dominance in the economy that their share of corporate profits rose from a few percent in the ’ 70s to almost on - third today .
They preferred Obama to McCain and largely bought the election for him .
They expected to be rewarded and were .
But a few months ago , responding to rising public anger , Obama began to criticize the “ greedy bankers ” who had been rescued by the public and even proposed some measures to constrain them .
Punishment for his deviation was swift .
The major banks announced prominently that they would shift funding to Republicans if Obama persisted with his offensive rhetoric .
Obama heard the message .
Within days , he informed the business press that bankers are fine “ guys . ”
He singled out for special praise the chairs of two leading beneficiaries of public largess , JP Morgan Chase and Goldman Sachs and assured the business world that , “ I , like most of the American people , do n’t begrudge people success or wealth ” — such as the bonuses and profits that are infuriating the public .
“ That ’s part of the free market system , ” Obama continued , not inaccurately , as the concept “ free market ” is interpreted in state capitalist doctrine .
This should not be a great surprise .
That incorrigible radical Adam Smith , speaking of England , observed that the principal architects of power were the owners of the society , in his day the merchants and manufacturers , and they made sure that policy would attend scrupulously to their interests , however “ grievous ” the impact on the people of England , and , worse , the victims of “ the savage injustice of the Europeans ” abroad .
British crimes in India were a primary concern of an old - fashioned conservative with moral values , a category that a Diogenes might search for today .
A modern and more sophisticated version of Smith ’s maxim is political economist Thomas Ferguson ’s “ investment theory of politics , ” which takes elections to be occasions when groups of investors coalesce to invest to control the state by selecting the architects of policies who will serve their interests .
It turns out to be a very good predictor of policy over long periods .
That should hardly be surprising .
Concentrations of economic power will naturally seek to extend their sway over any political process .
It happens to be extreme in the U.S. , as I mentioned .
There is much fevered discussion these days about whether , or when , the U.S. is going to lose its dominant position in global affairs to China and India , the rising world powers .
There is an element of truth to these laments .
But apart from misconceptions about debt , deficits and the actual state of China and India , the discussions are based on a serious misconception of the nature of power and its exercise .
In scholarship and public discourse , it is common to take the actors in international affairs to be states that pursue some mysterious goal called “ the national interest , ” divorced from the internal distribution of power .
Adam Smith had a sharper eye and his radical truism provides a useful corrective .
Bearing it in mind , we can see that there is indeed a global shift of power , though not the one that occupies center stage : a further shift from the global work force to transnational capital , sharply escalating during the neoliberal years .
The cost is substantial , including working people in the U.S. , starving peasants in India and millions of protesting workers in China , where labor share in national income is declining even more rapidly than in most of the world .
Political economist Martin Hart - Landsberg observes that China does play a leading role in the real global shift of power , having become largely an assembly plant for a regional production system .
Japan , Taiwan , and other advanced Asian economies export parts and components to China and provide most of the sophisticated technology .
Chinese labor assembles it and exports it .
To illustrate , a Sloan Foundation study estimated that for a $ 150 iPod exported from China , about 3 percent of value added is by China , but it is counted as a Chinese export .
Much concern has been aroused by the growing U.S. trade deficit with China , but less noticed is the fact that the trade deficit with Japan and rest of Asia has sharply declined as the new regional production system takes shape .
A Wall Street Journal report concluded that if value added were properly calculated , the real U.S. - China trade deficit would decline by as much as 30 percent , while the U.S. trade deficit with Japan would rise by 25 percent .
U.S. manufacturers are following the same course , providing parts and components for China to assemble and export , mostly back to the U.S.
For the financial institutions , retail giants , ownership and management of manufacturing industries and sectors closely related to this nexus of power , all of this is heavenly .
Not for American workers , but as Smith pointed out , their fate is not the concern of the “ principal architects of policy . ”
It ’s true that there is nothing fundamentally new in the process of deindustrialization .
Owners and managers naturally seek the lowest labor costs ; efforts to do otherwise , famously by Henry Ford , were struck down by the courts , so now it is a legal obligation .
One means is shifting production .
In earlier days , the shift was mostly internal , especially to the southern states , where labor could be more harshly repressed .
Major corporations , like the U.S. steel corporation of the sainted philanthropist Andrew Carnegie , could also profit from the new slave - labor force created by the criminalization of black life after the end of Reconstruction in 1877 , a core component of the American industrial revolution , continuing until World War II .
It is being reproduced in part during the recent neoliberal period , with the drug war used as a pretext to drive the superfluous population , mostly black , back to the prisons , also providing a new supply of prison labor in state or private prisons , much of it in violation of international labor conventions .
For many African - Americans , since they were exported to the colonies , life has scarcely escaped the bonds of slavery , or sometimes worse .
More recently the shift is mostly abroad .
Returning to the charges against “ greedy bankers , ” in fairness , we should concede that they have a valid defense .
Their task is to maximize profit and market share ; in fact , that ’s their legal obligation .
If they do n’t do it , they ’ll be replaced by someone who will .
These are institutional facts , as are the inherent market inefficiencies that require them to ignore systemic risk : the likelihood that transactions they enter into will harm the economy generally .
They know full well that these policies are likely to tank the economy , but these externalities , as they are called , are not their business , and cannot be , not because they are bad people , but for institutional reasons .
It is also unfair to accuse them of “ irrational exuberance , ” to borrow Alan Greenspan ’s brief recognition of reality during the artificial tech boom of the late ’90s .
Their exuberance and risk taking was quite rational , in the knowledge that when it all collapses , they can flee to the shelter of the nanny state , clutching their copies of Hayek , Friedman and Rand .
The government insurance policy is one of many perverse incentives that magnify the inherent market inefficiencies .
In brief , ignoring systemic risk is an inherent institutional property and perverse incentives are an application of Smith ’s maxim .
Again , no great insight .
After the latest disaster occurred , it has been agreed by leading economists that an “ emerging consensus ” has developed “ on the need for macroprudential supervision ” of financial markets , that is , “ paying attention to the stability of the financial system as a whole and not just its individual parts ” ( Barry Eichengreen , one of the most respected analysts and historians of the financial system ) .
Two prominent international economists add that , “ There is growing recognition that our financial system is running a doomsday cycle .
Whenever it fails , we rely on lax money and fiscal policies to bail it out .
This response teaches the financial sector : take large gambles to get paid handsomely and do n’t worry about the costs — they will be paid by taxpayers through bailouts and other devices and the financial system “ is thus resurrected to gamble again — and to fail again . ”
The system is a “ doom loop , ” in the words of the official of the Bank of England responsible for financial stability .
Basically the same logic applies elsewhere .
A year ago , the business world recognized that the insurance companies and big Pharma , in sharp defiance of the public will , had succeeded in destroying the possibility of serious health reform — a very serious matter , not only for the people who suffer from the dysfunctional health system , but even on narrow economic grounds .
About half of the deficit that we are instructed to deplore is attributable to unprecedented military expenditures , rising under Obama , and most of the rest to the increasing costs of the virtually unregulated privatized health care system , unique in the industrial world , also unique in its gifts to drug companies — opposed by a mere 85 percent of the population .
Last August , Business
Week had a cover story celebrating the victory of the health insurance industries .
Of course , no victory is enough , so they persisted in the struggle , gaining more , also against the will of the large majority of the public , another interesting story I ’ll have to put aside .
Observing this victory , the American Petroleum Institute , backed by the Chamber of Commerce and the other great business lobbies , announced that they are going to use the model of the health industry campaigns to intensify their massive propaganda efforts to convince the public to dismiss concerns about anthropogenic global warming .
That has been done with great success ; those who believe in this liberal hoax have reduced to barely a third of the population .
The executives dedicated to this task know as well as the rest of us that the liberal hoax is real and the prospects grim .
But they are fulfilling their institutional role .
The fate of the species is an externality that they must ignore , to the extent that market systems prevail .
One of the clearest and most moving articulations of the public mood that I have seen was written by Joseph Andrew Stack , who crashed his small plane into an office building in Austin , Texas , a few weeks ago , committing suicide .
He left a manifesto explaining his actions .
It was mostly ridiculed , but it deserves much better , I think .
Stack ’s manifesto traces the life history that led him to this final desperate act .
The story begins when he was a teenage student living on a pittance in Harrisburg , PA , near the heart of what was once a great industrial center .
His neighbor was a woman in her ’ 80s , surviving on cat food , the “ widowed wife of a retired steel worker .
Her husband had worked all his life in the steel mills of central Pennsylvania with promises from big business and the union that , for his 30 years of service , he would have a pension and medical care to look forward to in his retirement .
Instead he was one of the thousands who got nothing because the incompetent mill management and corrupt union ( not to mention the government ) raided their pension funds and stole their retirement .
All she had was social security to live on ” ( quoting ) ; and Stack could have added that there have been concerted and continuing efforts by the super rich and their political allies to take even that away on spurious grounds .
Stack decided then that he could n’t trust big business and would strike out on his own , only to discover that he could n’t trust a government that cared nothing about people like him , but only about the rich and privileged , or a legal system in which , in his words , “ there are two ‘ interpretations ’ for every law , one for the very rich and one for the rest of us . ”
Or a government that leaves us with “ the joke we call the American medical system , including the drug and insurance companies [ that ] are murdering tens of thousands of people a year , ” with care rationed largely by wealth , not need .
All in a social order in which “ a handful of thugs and plunderers can commit unthinkable atrocities … and when it ’s time for their gravy train to crash under the weight of their gluttony and overwhelming stupidity , the force of the full federal government has no difficulty coming to their aid within days if not hours . ”
And much more .
Stack tells us that his desperate final act was an effort to show that there are people willing to die for their freedom , in the hope of awakening others from their torpor .
It would n’t surprise me if he had in mind the premature death of the steel worker that taught him about the real world as a teenager .
That steel worker did n’t literally commit suicide after having been discarded to the trash heap , but it ’s far from an isolated case ; we can add his and many similar cases to the colossal toll of the institutional crimes of state capitalism .
There are poignant studies of the indignation and rage of those who have been cast aside as the state - corporate programs of financialization and deindustrialization have closed plants and destroyed families and communities .
They reveal the sense of acute betrayal on the part of working people who believed they had a fulfilled their duty to society in a moral compact with business and government , only to discover that they had been only instruments for profit and power , truisms from which they had been carefully protected by doctrinal institutions .
Reading Joe Stack ’s manifesto and a great deal more like it , I find myself recovering childhood memories and much more that I did not then understand .
The Weimar Republic was the peak of western civilization in the sciences and the arts , also regarded as a model of democracy .
Through the 1920s , the traditional liberal and conservative parties entered into inexorable decline , well before the process was intensified by the Great Depression .
The coalition that elected General Hindenburg in 1925 was not very different from the mass base that swept Hitler into office eight years later , compelling the aristocratic Hindenburg to select as chancellor the “ little corporal ” he despised .
As late as 1928 , the Nazis had less than 3 percent of the vote .
Two years later , the most respectable Berlin press was lamenting the sight of the many millions in this “ highly civilized country ” who had “ given their vote to the commonest , hollowest and crudest charlatanism . ”
The public was becoming disgusted with the incessant wrangling of Weimar politics , the service of the traditional parties to powerful interests and their failure to deal with popular grievances .
They were drawn to forces dedicated to upholding the greatness of the nation and defending it against invented threats in a revitalized , armed and unified state , marching to a glorious future , led by the charismatic figure who was carrying out “ the will of eternal Providence , the Creator of the universe , ” as he orated to the mesmerized masses .
By May 1933 , the Nazis had largely destroyed not only the traditional ruling parties , but even the huge working - class parties , the Social Democrats and Communists , along with their very powerful associations .
The Nazis declared May Day 1933 to be a workers holiday , something the left parties had never been able to achieve .
Many working people took part in the enormous patriotic demonstrations , with more than a million people at the heart of Red Berlin , joining farmers , artisans , shopkeepers , paramilitary forces , Christian organizations , athletic and riflery clubs , and the rest of the coalition that was taking shape as the center collapsed .
By the onset of the war , perhaps 90 percent of Germans were marching with the brown shirts .
As I mentioned , I am just old enough to remember those chilling and ominous days of Germany ’s descent from decency to Nazi barbarism , to borrow the words of the distinguished scholar of German history Fritz Stern .
He tells us that he has the future of the United States in mind when he reviews “ a historic process in which resentment against a disenchanted secular world found deliverance in the ecstatic escape of unreason . ”
The world is too complex for history to repeat , but there are nevertheless lessons to keep in mind .
There is no shortage of tasks for those who choose the vocation of critical intellectuals , whatever their station in life .
They can seek to sweep away the mists of carefully contrived illusion and reveal the stark reality .
They can become directly engaged in popular struggles , helping to organize the countless Joe Stack who are destroying themselves and maybe the world and to join them in leading the way the way to a better future .

Facebook CEO
Mark Zuckerberg appears to have been outed as not caring one whit about your privacy – a jarring admission , considering how much of our personal data Facebook owns , not to mention its plans to become the web 's central repository for our preferences and predilections .
Also interesting is how this came about :
Not in a proper article , but in a tweet by Nick Bilton , lead technology blogger for the The New York Times ' Bits Blog , based on a conversation he says was " off the record " and which he may have confused with " not for attribution . "
" Off record chat w/ Facebook employee , " begins Bilton 's fateful tweet .
" Me : How does Zuck feel about privacy ?
Response : [ laughter ]
He does n't believe in it . "
Ouch .
Zuckerberg 's apparent disregard for your privacy is probably not reason enough to delete your Facebook account .
But we would n't recommend posting anything there that you would n't want marketers , legal authorities , governments ( or your mother ) to see , especially as Facebook continues to push more and more of users ' information public and even into the hands of other companies , leaving the onus on users to figure out its Rubik 's Cube - esque privacy controls .
Facebook has been on a relentless request over the past six months to become the center of identity and connections online .
The site unilaterally decided last December that much of a user 's profile information , including the names of all their friends and the things they were " fans " of , would be public information – no exceptions or opt-outs allowed .
Zuckerberg defended the change – largely intended to keep up with the publicness of Twitter , saying that people 's notions of privacy were changing .
He took no responsibility for being the one to drag many Facebook users into the net 's public sphere .
Then last week at its f8 conference , Facebook announced it was sending user profile information in bulk to companies like Yelp , Pandora and Microsoft .
Thus , when users show up at those sites while logged in to Facebook , they see personalized versions of the those services ( unless the user opts out of each site , somewhere deep in the bowels of Facebook 's privacy control center ) .
On Tuesday , four Senators asked the company to only push data to third - parties if users agree to it , a so - called " opt- in " that social networking sites like Facebook , Twitter and Google Buzz eschew since it radically cuts down on participation and thus revenues .
Facebook is also pushing a " Like " button , which lets sites put little Facebook buttons on anything from blog entries to T - shirts in web stores .
Clicking that button sends that information to Facebook , which publishes it as part of what it calls the Open Graph , linking your identity to things you choose online .
That information , in turn , is shared with whatever sites Facebook chooses to share it with – and to the sites you 've allowed to access your profile .
It 's an ambitious attempt to rewrite the web as a socially linked network .
But many see Facebook 's move as trying to colonize the rest of the web , and keep all this valuable information in its data silos , in order to become a force on the web that rivals Google .
So it 's no laughing matter that the head of Facebook appears not to care about privacy .
( We asked Facebook to clarify Zuckerberg 's privacy stance but have yet to hear back . )
For his part , Bilton fired off a number of salvos defending his understanding of the the ground rules which governed the conversation he had .
" ' Off record ' means there is no attribution to who it is but conversation can be used in story .
' On background ' means I can not repeat it , " wrote Bilton .
He took over the Times ' technology blog in the last few months , after a long stint working with its technology - development team .
Unfortunately , he 's wrong about the definitions .
" ' Off the record ' restricts the reporter from using the information the source is about to deliver , " reads NYU 's Journalism Handbook , in one definition of the phrase .
" If the reporter can confirm the information with another source who does n't insist on speaking off the record ( whether that means he agreed to talking on the record , on background , or not for attribution ) , he can publish it . "
" On background " usually means that information can be used , but can't be attributed to a specific person .
Bilton later responded to our request for clarification , saying , " My source said it was OK to quote them , just not say who they are . "
So apparently , this Facebook employee wanted this information to get out , for whatever reason .
Now , the die has been cast :
The world knows that a Facebook employee thinks his CEO " does n't believe in " privacy , which should scare the bejesus out of anyone with a Facebook account – and that encompasses just about everyone reading this now .

Le Fonds monétaire international ( FMI ) a préconisé mardi une ligne dure contre les plus grandes institutions financières , conseillant à ses Etats membres de se donner les moyens d'éliminer les risques qu'elles pourraient poser à l'ensemble du système .
C'est le principe du " too big to fail " qui est directement visé .
La publication de ces recommandations intervient en plein débat législatif , aux Etats - Unis et dans plusieurs pays européens , dont la France , l'Allemagne et le Royaume - Uni , sur la réforme des structures de régulation financière .
D'après le FMI , les propositions actuellement discutées ne vont pas assez loin pour empêcher une réédition de la crise qui avait suivi la chute de la banque d'affaires américaine Lehman Brothers en septembre 2008 .
La faillite de la banque , que la Federal Reserve ( banque centrale des Etats - Unis ) avait refusé de sauver , avait entraîné un plongeon des marchés financiers .
POUVOIRS D'INTERVENTION
" Il y a eu un déluge de propositions de régulation après la crise financière " , a relevé lors d'une conférence de presse à Washington un économiste du Fonds , Juan Solé .
" Mais une caractéristique que nous avons remarquée dans la plupart de ces propositions est un manque de détails sur la conception et la mise en œuvre des mesures auxquelles appelaient ces propositions de réforme " , a -t - il poursuivi .
Dans un chapitre , publié mardi , de son " Rapport sur la stabilité financière mondiale " semestriel , le FMI se dit sceptique sur la création d'autorités surveillant le risque systémique si elles ne sont pas dotées de pouvoirs d'intervention suffisants .
En d'autres termes , il souhaite que les pouvoirs publics puissent supprimer à la racine tout risque de faillite pour des " mégabanques " , qui sont des rouages essentiels à la fois dans l'activité de financement de l'économie et sur les grandes places financières du monde .
" Il peut être nécessaire pour les régulateurs de concevoir la régulation de sorte à empêcher les institutions de poser des risques systémiques " , a -t - il déclaré .
" LIMITER LA TAILLE DE CERTAINES ACTIVITÉS "
Le risque systémique , mis en lumière par le pic de la crise financière de l'automne 2008 , illustre " l'idée que les difficultés que connaît un établissement financier peuvent avoir des retombées négatives sur d'autres " , voire sur l'ensemble du système , rappelle le FMI .
L'institution lance ainsi une proposition qui consisterait à " limiter directement la taille de certaines activités " des plus grandes institutions financières .
Aucun exemple n'est cependant donné .
En revanche , le FMI développe un mode de calcul de nouvelles normes de fonds propres pour les banques , pondéré en fonction des risques pris et posés par chacune .
Le dispositif proposé augmente le niveau de capital immédiatement disponible exigé auprès des banques en fonction des actifs risqués qu'elles détiennent , ce niveau s'élevant automatiquement en période de tensions financières .
" A notre connaissance , c'est l'une des premières tentatives d'élaborer un mécanisme concret pour lier formellement les exigences en capital à la multitude des connexions systémiques d'une institution " , a souligné la directrice de la division marchés de capitaux et monétaires du FMI , Laura Kodres .
Le FMI est membre du Conseil de stabilité financière , une institution de coordination entre régulateurs financiers de 24 pays associée aux travaux du comité de Bâle pour redéfinir le cadre réglementaire et comptable international s'appliquant aux banques .
Le Monde avec AFP
Italian soldiers in Afghanistan are veterans by 72 hours of fights .
During a joint operation for controlling of some of the strategic outposts near Bala Morghab , in west of the Country , “ soldiers of afghan security and of Isaf , between which the Italian soldiers - command in Herat explains - have been subject to repeated attacks by more than 60 insurgents “ .
No wounded between the Italians .
The News :
http://www.tgcom.med … articolo470061.shtml
I challenged Caldwell about reports of 90 percent illiteracy in the Afghan security forces .
He answered : “ The recruits may not know how to read , but they are incredibly street - smart .
They ’re survivalists .
Basic soldiering here does not require literacy .
We give them a course in how to read and issue them pens afterwards .
They take tremendous pride in that .
In Afghanistan , a pen in a shirt pocket is a sign of literacy .
We ’re three or four years behind Iraq in building an army , but if the ground situation improves , like in Iraq , political and media pressure will dissipate , and that will buy time . ”
A deal with the insurgents constitutes another part of a withdrawal strategy .
While becoming more organizationally formidable since 9/11 , the Taliban have also modified their behavior .
Mullah Omar has sent out a directive banning beheadings and unauthorized kidnappings as well as other forms of violent and criminal activity , according to both Al - Jazeera and ISAF officials .
“ In a way , we ’re seeing a kinder , gentler Taliban , ” said both Commander Eggers and General Flynn .
Moreover , in working with the tribes in the spirit of Churchill ’s Malakand Field Force , Flynn , the intelligence chief , went so far as to suggest that the insurgent leaders Jalaluddin Haqqani and Gulbuddin Hekmatyar are both “ absolutely salvageable . ”
“ The HIG already have members in Karzai ’s government , and it could evolve into a political party , even though Hekmatyar may be providing alQaeda leaders refuge in Kunar .
Hekmatyar has reconcilable ambitions .
As for the Haqqani network , I can tell you they are tired of fighting , but are not about to give up .
They have lucrative business interests to protect : the road traffic from the Afghanistan - Pakistan border to Central Asia . ”
Lamb , the former SAS commander , added : “ Haqqani and Hekmatyar are pragmatists tied to the probability of outcomes .
With all the talk of Islamic ideology , this is the land of the deal . ”
Again , the resemblance to the 1980s is telling , with leading anti-Soviet combatants like Haqqani and Hekmatyar central to the military equation , and a partially irrelevant Karzai : today ISAF officials talk quietly about working around Karzai by dealing directly with the ministries of interior and defense , and with the offices of the provincial governors , all of which they are fortifying with Western advisers .
The possibility of reaching an accommodation with some insurgents against others , as elusive as it may be , suggests how nonlinear the future is , and how deterministic a linear perspective can be .
As in Iraq , surprises lie in store , and they might even be good ones : in so many places in Afghanistan , I saw the raw potential of this country .
Despite a deadly , intimidating geography of steep and icy peaks that seem to stretch into infinity when seen from the air , in Afghanistan ’s cities I encountered many an intellectual in a cold room with boxy furniture , passionately seeking to move beyond ethnic politics to a democratic , liberal universalism .
They reminded me of the civil - society types I had met in Eastern Europe during the Cold War , in cities that , like Kabul , stank of lignite in winter .
Then there was Herat , an old Silk Road nexus in western Afghanistan , which , despite 30 years of war , had changed remarkably for the better since I had last seen it , as a backpacker in 1973 .
Back then it was a ramshackle , Wild West town with barely a paved road .
Now it is a sprawling , bustling city with malls , on the same level of development as many places in central Turkey that I knew from the 1980s : an improvement replicated in Mazar - e - Sharif , Jalalabad , and other urban areas here , with Kandahar being the striking exception .
“ Despite 30 years of war , ” McChrystal said , in his office , rubbing his eyes from lack of sleep , “ civilization grows here like weeds . ”
Now the American military is about to bear down hard on Greater Kandahar , where Taliban - and Karzai - affiliated warlords hold considerable sway .
“ We will get to about 33 percent of the Afghan landmass in the next 15 months or so , affecting 60 percent of the population , ” Rodriguez assured me .
Once again , we might be poised to overcome the vast , impersonal forces of fate , even as we contribute to our own troubled destiny as a great power .

CSI Global Tax Enforcement : Come Kiss The Ring
The IRS held a presser to announce their new crack squad dedicated to sniffing out wealth held by Americans abroad .
The head of this posse calls it the “ globalization ” of tax enforcement .
Captain Sulman says :
“ So what ’s our game plan here ? ” Shulman said .
“ At least initially , we will be looking at individuals with tens of millions of dollars of assets or income .
Going forward , we will take a unified look at the entire web of business entities controlled by a high wealth individual , which will enable us to better assess the risk such arrangements pose to tax compliance and the integrity of our tax system .
Of course tax evasion may be a problem , but often this is merely an excuse to reduce tax competition .
It ’s a fine line .
Dan Mitchell has covered similar efforts to tighten the screws on tax havens and discreet , low tax jurisdictions here .
Acoustic levitation is some day going to be used to brush the dust off machinery on Mars .
Learn why sound can lift objects off the ground and see an acoustic levitation chamber in action .

" Sticks and stones may break your bones , but words will never hurt you . "
This saying is repeated by schoolteachers , parents , and bitter Io9ers who tried to fight off their muggers by yelling " Muad ' Dib . "
Sound is generally categorized as essentially different from action .
Although the ideas and feelings that sounds convey may be powerful , noise itself is considered harmless .
Advertisement
But sound is action , and under the right circumstances it can have a very visible effect .
Creating a sound is a little like shoving someone at the end of a long line .
That person knocks into the next person in line before righting themselves .
Each person only moves a little , getting shoved forward and then back , but the overall compression travels all the way down the line .
Sounds are basically compressions of air hitting a human ear drum .
When something makes a noise , it vibrates , compressing the air around it a certain number of times .
The individual air molecules get shoved around just a little bit , moving up and then back – but the compression itself travels forward .

Now imagine that the person at the front of the line has a short temper and does n't care who they take it out on .
When they get pushed , they turn around and push back .
The compression travels back down the line to the original person who started pushing .
Given that that original person is the kind of jerk who likes to shove entire lines full of people for no reason , that person pushes the unfortunate individual in front of them again , and the wave travels back and forward .
Maybe the original person does n't wait to be pushed back and start shoving once every five seconds .
Advertisement
( Do n't tell me you would n't be tempted . )
The pulses move down the line , and back up , again and again .
If both sides time it just right , the different pushes , shoves , and general idiocy would come to a kind of equilibrium called a standing wave .
Compressions would move through the line as usual , but while certain parts of the line would get pushed one way or the other like they 're on swings , the person at the center getting slammed by both sides at the same time , carrying the momentum from one side to the other while staying in roughly same place , like the center ball in the toy they used to sell in The Sharper Image stores .
Advertisement
That person is the node of the standing wave – the place that , in a longitudinal wave – moves the least .
It is there where the objects accumulate in acoustic levitation .
It 's only at the node that they can accumulate , since when they move away from the node , they get shoved right back .
Advertisement
Instead of people , sound waves are moving around air molecules , and although air molecules do n't pack a lot of punch , the combined force of a lot of them pushing together is enough to levitate up to a few kilograms worth of material .
At least , it 's enough to in large , well funded facilities .
At home the most people can hope for is light Styrofoam or a few drops of water .
To make an acoustic levitation chamber , it takes a speaker hooked up to equipment that can make a precise , consistent sound wave .
It also takes something that will reflect the wave back , to allow a standing wave to be established .
It 's best if both of these things are curved .
Advertisement
After that , it takes patience , power , and waterproof equipment .
You too , can do this .
Or this .
Just do n't try it out with people in line .
It wo n't end well .
You really can't be sure that the guy with the bad temper is all the way at the other end .

The American Dream is Over , It Was A Wonderful Life
“ Just a minute - just a minute .
Now , hold on , Mr. Potter .
You 're right when you say my father was no businessman .
I know that .
Why he ever started this cheap , penny - ante Building and Loan , I 'll never know .
But neither you nor anyone else can say anything against his character , because his whole life was - why , in the twenty - five years since he and Uncle Billy started this thing , he never once thought of himself .
Is n't that right , Uncle Billy ?
He did n't save enough money to send Harry to school , let alone me .
But he did help a few people get out of your slums , Mr. Potter , and what 's wrong with that ?
Why - here , you 're all businessmen here .
Does n't it make them better citizens ?
Does n't it make them better customers ?
You - you said - what 'd you say a minute ago ?
They had to wait and save their money before they even ought to think of a decent home .
Wait ?
Wait for what ?
Until their children grow up and leave them ?
Until they 're so old and broken down that they ...
Do you know how long it takes a working man to save five thousand dollars ?
Just remember this , Mr. Potter , that this rabble you 're talking about ... they do most of the working and paying and living and dying in this community .
Well , is it too much to have them work and pay and live and die in a couple of decent rooms and a bath ?
Anyway , my father did n't think so .
People were human beings to him .
But to you , a warped , frustrated old man , they 're cattle .
Well , in my book he died a much richer man than you 'll ever be . ” – Jimmy Stewart as George Bailey in It ’s a Wonderful Life
The year was 1946 .
It marked the inauguration of the last High in America .
A Crisis had begun abruptly with the 1929 Black Tuesday stock - market crash .
After a three - year financial free fall , the ensuing Great Depression prompted FDR ’s New Deal social welfare programs , an enormous extension of government , and expectations for a revitalization of our national community .
After the attack on Pearl Harbor , America planned , mobilized , and manufactured for conflict on a level that made possible the colossal D - Day invasion .
Two years later , the Crisis mood eased with America ’s unexpectedly painless demobilization .
Director Frank Capra produced and directed one of the most beloved movies of all - time in 1946 – It ’s a Wonderful Life .
The movie is a beloved Christmas classic .
It is a story of hope , redemption , belief in the goodness of man , and belief in God .
If you are down in the dumps or depressed , watch this movie and your spirits will be lifted .
What is less evident , but more pertinent today , is the distinction between the America that we were versus the America we could have become .
The America we did not want to become was controlled and manipulated by an evil , soul - less banker .
It was a dark foreboding Gomorrah - like world of bars , strip joints , casinos and tenement housing .
The citizens were angry , rude and mistrustful .
In the movie , George Bailey , played by Jimmy Stewart , is able to see how his small town would have turned out if he had never been born .
In the real world , people and countries do n’t have an opportunity to see how their decisions will affect the future .
The American people and their elected leaders have made some dreadful decisions since 1946 that have drained the life out of the American Dream .
God and morality have lost their meaning and importance in modern America .
When the distinction between good and evil is blurred by the media and intellectuals , the degradation of society and morality leads to a downward death spiral .
The movie ’s setting takes place between 1910 and Christmas Eve 1946 in the mythical town of Bedford Falls .
The basis for the town was Seneca Falls , New York .
The themes of the movie are good versus evil , David versus Goliath , egocentric self interest versus contributing to the greater community , good small town bankers versus bad corporate bankers , and whether one person ’s life has a greater meaning .
The movie opens with God hearing the many prayers for George Bailey from the townspeople of Bedford Falls on Christmas Eve 1946 .
He assigns Clarence , angel second class , to save George .
Joseph , the head angel , reviews George ’s life for Clarence .
At the age of 12 , George saved the life of his younger brother Harry who had fallen through the ice on a pond , with George losing the hearing in one ear .
Later , as an errand boy in a pharmacy , George saved his grief - stricken boss , druggist Mr. Gower , from mistakenly filling a child 's prescription with poison .
George 's lifelong dream was to see the world .
On Harry 's graduation night in 1928 , George ’s father , who runs the local Building & Loan had a stroke , which proved fatal .
Mr. Potter , a heartless slumlord and majority shareholder in the Building and Loan , tries to persuade the board of directors to stop providing home loans for the working poor .
George persuaded them to reject Potter 's proposal , but they agreed only on the condition that George himself run the Building and Loan .
He selflessly gave his college money to his brother .
When Harry graduated from college , he unexpectedly brought home a wife , whose father had offered Harry an excellent job in his company .
George could not deny his brother such a fine opportunity .
Once more , George set aside his ambitions .
After their wedding , as George and Mary leave town for their honeymoon , they witnessed a run on the bank that left the Building and Loan in danger of collapse .
Potter offered George 's clients " 50 cents on the dollar , " but George and Mary quelled the panic by using the $ 2,000 earmarked for their honeymoon to satisfy the depositors ' needs until confidence in the Building and Loan was restored .
George started up Bailey Park , an affordable housing project .
Residents no longer had to pay Potter 's high rents .
When World War II erupted , George was unable to enlist , due to his bad ear .
Harry became a fighter pilot and was awarded the Medal of Honor for shooting down 15 enemy aircraft , including one that would have slammed into a U.S. transport ship full of troops .
On Christmas Eve , 1946 , Uncle Billy was on his way to deposit $ 8,000 for the Building and Loan when he ran into Mr. Potter .
He proudly showed Potter the front - page article about Harry receiving the Medal of Honor .
Potter grabs the newspaper angrily and later discovers the money inside ; he keeps it .
When Uncle Billy goes to deposit the money , he finally realizes it is missing .
Frantic searching fails to turn it up .
In desperation , George appeals to Potter for a loan to save the company , but Potter turns him down and swears out a warrant for his arrest for bank fraud .
George , facing " scandal and bankruptcy and prison " , gets drunk to escape his woes .
Driving wildly in a snowstorm , he crashes his car into a tree near a river .
Completely devastated , George staggers to a bridge that spans the river , intending to commit suicide , and feeling he is " worth more dead than alive " because of a $ 15,000 life insurance policy .
Before George can leap in , however , Clarence jumps in first and pretends to be drowning .
After George rescues him , he reveals himself to be George 's guardian angel .
Clarence then proceeds to show George how many lives would have been changed for the worse if George had never been born .
The scene that convinces George he needs to live is seeing his younger brother ’s tombstone showing 1902 – 1911 .
[ George has discovered his brother Harry 's tombstone ]
Clarence : [ explaining ]
Your brother , Harry Bailey , broke through the ice and was drowned at the age of nine .
George Bailey :
That 's a lie !
Harry Bailey went to war - he got the Congressional Medal of Honor , he saved the lives of every man on that transport .
Clarence : Every man on that transport died !
Harry was n't there to save them , because you were n't there to save Harry .
Clarence : Strange , is n't it ?
Each man 's life touches so many other lives .
When he is n't around he leaves an awful hole , does n't he ?
The Idea of America
“ Here in America we are descended in blood and in spirit from revolutionists and rebels - men and women who dare to dissent from accepted doctrine .
As their heirs , may we never confuse honest dissent with disloyal subversion . ” – Dwight D. Eisenhower
The Founding Fathers risked their lives in order to escape the tyranny and imperial oppressiveness of the British Empire .
They dreamed of a country where all men were created equal .
They believed that all citizens were endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights that among them were Life , Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness .
They did their best to create a country where everyone had an equal opportunity to succeed or fail .
It is said that , at the close of the Constitutional Convention , a woman approached Benjamin Franklin and asked him what type of government had been decided upon by the delegates .
Franklin stated :
" We have given you a Republic , if you can keep it . "
Franklin also deemed that the Constitution could only endure as long as the citizens themselves could sustain it :
" In these sentiments , sir , I agree to this Constitution with all its faults ; if they are such ; because I think a general government necessary for us , and there is no form of government but what may be a blessing to the people if well administered ; and I believe , further , that this is likely to be well administered for a course of years , and can only end in despotism , as other forms have done before it , when the people shall become so corrupted as to need despotic government , being incapable of any other . "
The men who created this Republic were practical realists .
They were skeptical of all forms of government .
They knew that a government would only be as good and honorable as the people who represented the citizens .
It was up to the citizens to keep those they elected from abusing their power .
Each generation , each individual , needed to pay this price anew each and every day .
In the words of Thomas Paine , " Those who expect to reap the blessings of freedom , must , like men , undergo the fatigues of supporting it . "
For many decades the citizens did undergo the fatigues of supporting it .
They defeated the British in the War of 1812 .
They spilled the blood of 600,000 men in the War Between the States .
They died in the trenches of France in World War I .
They saved the world from Nazism and Fascism in World War II .
Despite these remarkable sacrifices , the idea of America has been lost along the journey .
The American Dream has become a nightmare as we have allowed individualism , materialism and selfish greed to override being a good citizen , good neighbor , and going as far as your ability and hard work would take you .
The American Dream is that dream of a land in which life should be better and richer and fuller for everyone , with opportunity for each according to ability or achievement .
It is a difficult dream for the European upper classes to interpret adequately , and too many of us ourselves have grown weary and mistrustful of it .
It is not a dream of motor cars and high wages merely , but a dream of social order in which each man and each woman shall be able to attain to the fullest stature of which they are innately capable , and be recognized by others for what they are , regardless of the fortuitous circumstances of birth or position .
The freedom now desired by many is not freedom to do and dare but freedom from care and worry . "
- James Truslow Adams , The Epic of America , 1931
Mr. Adams captured the spirit of America , a nation of opportunity .
He saw it slipping away back in 1931 .
We ’ve made fateful choices in the last century that have methodically stolen the spirit of the American Dream .
Opportunity for each according to their ability or achievement has been replaced by - from each according to his ability , to each according to his need .
The twist to the Communist Manifesto is that those with ability who worked hard have had their wealth redistributed to the rich and the poor .
The 1 % ruling elite have utilized their positions of power , with the help of their benefactor - the Federal Reserve , to amass 40 % of all the wealth in the country .
The bottom 50 % of Americans on the income scale , pay no income taxes and receive the majority of entitlement payments .
That leaves the middle class on a permanent treadmill trying to achieve the American Dream , but never reaching the destination .
The loss of the American Dream can be traced to 1913 .
The creation of the Federal Reserve by powerful banking interests and corrupt politicians marked the beginning of the end for the U.S. dollar .
The implementation of a personal income tax opened Pandora ’s Box and unleashed incalculable horrors upon the American public .
The top marginal tax rate in 1913 was 7 % .
It reached 94 % by 1944 .
The tax code has grown from 400 pages in 1913 to 67,500 pages today .
Politicians have exploited the tax code to recompense political contributors and punish their enemies .
The amalgamation of a fiat currency being printed by a Central Bank resulting in a 95 % loss in purchasing power and ever increasing tax burdens to support welfare program redistribution have devastated the middle class .
With these monetary support mechanisms in place , politicians have been able to promise voters more and more benefits without bothering about future consequences .
The American people have voted themselves more and more goodies .
They have ignored their obligation to the past and the future .
The Founding Fathers created an imperfect Republic .
Ben Franklin knew its future depended upon people administering it well .
Unborn future generations are dependent on their parents and grandparents to make choices that do not burden them with an anchor of unbearable debt .
We have failed our brave forefathers and have sold our unborn into slavery .
The people have been corrupted and the country is on course towards despotism .
Today ’s “ progressives ” in the media and government have manipulated the fact that the Founders did not want a national religion to be misrepresented as keeping religion out of America .
The Founders were religious men .
They believed religion and morality were vital to the country being administered in a moral ethical way and guided by a code of conduct .
As God , religion and morality have been denigrated by those in power we have moved further and further from the letter and spirit of the Constitution .
Only a people with a strong moral backbone can be trusted to honor the Constitution .
“ We have no government armed in power capable of contending with human passions unbridled by morality and religion .
Our Constitution was made only for a religious and moral people .
It is wholly inadequate for the government of any other . "
- John Adams
Niall Ferguson , Harvard historian , recently detailed that the choices and decisions we ’ve made as a nation have put us on a path of collapse .
The believers in American Exceptionalism think it is sacrilege to mention the decline of the American Empire .
They estimate that any decline would play out over a century or more .
Ferguson notes the widely held belief that :
“ Great powers , like great men , are born , rise , reign and then gradually wane .
No matter whether civilizations decline culturally , economically or ecologically , their downfalls are protracted . ”
But what if they are wrong ?
What if the speed of the modern world also translates into the speed of declines ?
Ferguson understands that any grain of sand that falls on an instable portion of the sand pile can lead to collapse :
“ What if collapse does not arrive over a number of centuries but comes suddenly , like a thief in the night ?
Great powers are complex systems .
There comes a moment when complex systems ‘ go critical . ’
A very small trigger can set off a ‘ phase transition ’ from a benign equilibrium to a crisis -- a single grain of sand causes a whole pile to collapse . ”
Lack of courage , political corruption , greed , immorality , laziness , and materiality has left the country on the brink .
Ferguson assesses the facts and concludes that collapse of the American Empire is closer than most people think :
“ Most imperial falls are associated with fiscal crises .
Alarm bells should therefore be ringing very loudly indeed as the United States contemplates a deficit for 2010 of more than $ 1.5 trillion -- about 11 % of GDP , the biggest since World War II .
A complex adaptive system is in big trouble when its component parts lose faith in its viability .
Empires behave like all complex adaptive systems .
They function in apparent equilibrium for some unknowable period .
And then , quite abruptly , they collapse . ”
How did we get to this point ?
In 1946 America sat on top of the world .
America – 1946 – Bedford Falls
“ There is nothing wrong with America that faith , love of freedom , intelligence , and energy of her citizens cannot cure . ” – wight D. Eisenhower
Europe , Russia , and Japan were devastated by World War II .
Their populations , cities , infrastructure and industries were ravaged .
Only America remained unscathed by war .
The rest of the world looked to the U.S. to lead and be the beacon of light on the hill as the shining example of capitalism , freedom , and morality .
As the only country whose manufacturing base was still intact , America had huge economic advantages .
Despite these advantages , the seeds of destruction were being planted .
Almost 30 % of our economy was based upon producing things the rest of the world wanted to buy .
Another 12 % of GDP was from the productive functions of agriculture and mining .
Americans were settling into their post - war suburban oasis , leading to 15 % of the economy being driven by retail & wholesale sales .
Finance and professional services accounted for only 14 % of the economy .
Today , manufacturing accounts for 11 % of the economy , while finance & professional services account for 33 % of the economy .
This dramatic shift has had a profound effect on the nation .
It 's a Wonderful Life teaches us that family , friendship , and virtue are the true definitions of wealth .
It also broaches the subject of small town America where small business owners and hard working Americans were treated with respect by small town bankers and valued as lifelong customers .
The movie clearly distinguishes between the small town banker who believes that every townsperson deserved a chance at a better life and the big time banker who treated people like cattle and only cared about how much profit he could generate by keeping those people under his thumb .
Mr. Potter represents every evil banker that has ever walked this earth and taken advantage of the poor and middle class to enrich himself .
George Bailey represents the kind of banker that built this country by making loans to his fellow hard working Americans .
This was a very early picture of how allowing a single all - powerful corporate banker to exercise monopolistic control would ultimately destroy the community and enslave the citizens .
The scene when Potter offers the depositors 50 cents on the dollar for their shares of Bailey Building & Loan is representative of how thug like corporate bankers will resort to anything in order to put small banks out of business and steal the deposits of average Americans .
“ You sit around here and you spin your little webs and you think the whole world revolves around you and your money .
Well , it does n't , Mr. Potter .
In the whole vast configuration of things , I 'd say you were nothing but a scurvy little spider . ” – Jimmy Stewart as George Bailey
The tension between big business and small business is clearly defined in the movie .
Frank Capra concludes that allowing bankers to control a society would result in a sordid , dark , ruthless , selfish , materialistic culture .
Amazingly , the FBI thought otherwise .
It may shock you that our government did n’t like the movie so much .
The FBI considered the theme of the movie to be pro-Communism propaganda .
A report was written by the FBI stating that the portrayal of bankers and the rich was part of a Hollywood Communist plot .
Here is a portion of the actual report :
There is submitted herewith the running memorandum concerning Communist infiltration of the motion picture industry which has been brought up to date as of May 26 , 1947 ....
With regard to the picture " It 's a Wonderful Life " , our source stated in substance that the film represented rather obvious attempts to discredit bankers by casting Lionel Barrymore as a " scrooge - type " so that he would be the most hated man in the picture .
This , according to these sources , is a common trick used by Communists .
In addition , our source stated that , in his opinion , this picture deliberately maligned the upper class , attempting to show the people who had money were mean and despicable characters .
He related that if he made this picture portraying the banker , he would have shown this individual to have been following the rules as laid down by the State Bank Examiner in connection with making loans .
Further , he stated that the scene would n't have " suffered at all " in portraying the banker as a man who was protecting funds put in his care by private individuals and adhering to the rules governing the loan of that money rather than portraying the part as it was shown .
In summary , he stated that it was not necessary to make the banker such a mean character and " I would never have done it that way . "
As you watch this film next Christmas , remember that it is not a poignant story about how each of us , no matter how apparently insignificant , has the power to make a difference , and that the measure of our humanity has nothing to do with fame or money , but with how we live our life on a day - to - day basis .
Remember , it does n’t teach us that family , friendship , and virtue are the true definitions of wealth .
It is proclaiming the Marxist view of the world .
The absurdity of this government report in 1947 was a warning that our leaders would come down on the side of big banks in the coming decades .
The point of the movie , that money wo n’t buy happiness and that good works are more important than consumerism , was cast aside by America with assistance from the bankers who control the Federal Reserve .
The result is a country of bureaucrats , paper pushers , and government lackeys , producing nothing and borrowing at ever increasing amounts in order to live the good life today with no thought about tomorrow .
The message of materialism has been preached by the holy trinity of bankers , government , and corporate media .
Path of Least Resistance
America will never be destroyed from the outside .
If we falter and lose our freedoms , it will be because we destroyed ourselves .
– Abraham Lincoln
The things that will destroy America are prosperity - at - any - price , peace - at - any - price , safety - first instead of duty - first , the love of soft living , and the get - rich - quick theory of life .
– Theodore Roosevelt
Americans were lured into believing they could live the good life without making the sacrifices necessary to obtain that life .
They chose to take “ 50 cents on the dollar ” from Potter .
They borrowed the other 50 cents from Potter and let the Bailey Building & Loan go out of business .
In the world Americans have chosen , George Bailey committed suicide .
The United States government made a choice too .
The politicians who hold the reins of power in America ’s Gomorrah , Washington D.C. , sold their souls to the devil of fiat currency printed by corrupt bankers .
All the power of the Federal Government has been put in the ravenous claws of the Federal Reserve , a private bank owned and controlled by the biggest banks in the world .
Politicians hit the jackpot in 1913 with the creation of the Federal Reserve and the institution of an individual income tax .
These fateful decisions have allowed slimy depraved elected officials to promise their constituents trillions of dollars in unfunded entitlements , tax credits for their buddies , and promises of safety and security in order to buy votes .
The government made a pact with the banking cartel which has unleashed a torrent of debt that has skyrocketed to levels never conceived by the Bedford Falls America of the 1940’s .
Net U.S. debt now exceeds $ 52 trillion , a full 372 % more than GDP .
Total U.S. debt as a percentage of GDP now exceeds the levels at the depths of the Great Depression by 24 % .
Ask yourself who profits from printing money and ever increasing levels of debt .
Bankers and politicians profit .
Who loses from ever increasing levels of debt ?
The middle class , who have been ensnared by banker deception and phony promises into the belief that possessing extravagant objects is real wealth while sinking ever deeper into debt , are today ’s losers .
Unborn future generations who will be stuck with the bill for the Baby Boomer orgy of materialism are the real losers .
The current fascination with the affluent , the influential , and the celebrated was not found in Bedford Falls .
To Frank Capra , the well - to - do and elite had none of the critical traits to safeguard liberty in America , nor did they display any of the core cultural values the country was built upon .
The country was built upon the hard work of small close knit communities supported by small town banks and freedom to succeed or fail without government interference .
An entrepreneur with a good idea could attain a higher place in the social order through their brains and work ethic .
The choice of government to support monopolistic mega corporations and mega banks has destroyed the vital values of the country .
Profit and wealth have become the ends , with the means being inflation and debt .
Credit card debt did n’t exist until the late 1960s because credit cards did n’t exist .
Until 1970 Americans bought things by saving money until they accumulated enough to make the purchase .
Noble bankers were able to put their luminous minds to the task and created the credit card to “ help ” all Americans .
We are now referred to as consumers rather than citizens .
The chart above chronicles the “ success ” of this banker invention .
They did n’t have another such outstanding “ success ” until the creation of the subprime mortgage , the credit default swap , and the no doc Option ARM .
There are 310 million Americans and 1.5 billion credit cards in circulation .
The top 10 banks control 88 % of the credit card market .
Americans owe these banks more than $ 800 billion .
In 1980 , at the outset of the great credit hurricane , a credit card application was 700 words and fit on one sheet of paper .
Today , a credit card application is 30 pages of unintelligible legalese .
Did bankers increase the complexity to help consumers or mislead , bamboozle , and confuse them ?
I ’m sure their motives were honorable .
Comparison between 1980 and 2010 Credit Card Applications
Source : Barry Ritholtz
The ethical bankers are so concerned about young Americans they have managed to issue , on average , 4 credit cards per undergraduate student in the country .
They are surely looking out after the best interest of these teenagers .
Through devious marketing , with the help of the mainstream media that glorifies the rich and famous , the largest banks in the land convinced a vast majority of Americans they deserved to live like kings .
They deserved a McMansion castle , a BMW chariot , a flat screen to watch fools entertain them , and instead of gold coins as real wealth – a gold Amex to create faux wealth .
The banking elite hit the jackpot when they “ invented ” derivatives that allowed them to package credit card and mortgage debt and sell it to unsuspecting suckers .
This opened the door to unheard of wealth for the banking elite , as their models told them they could loan money to people who had no chance of paying you back , package the loans , bribe S&P and Moody ’s to rate the package of shit as AAA , and sell it to pension funds , small towns , and grandmothers .
Wall Street surely cared about their responsibility to the community at large .

America – 2010 – Potterville
“ All the perplexities , confusion and distress in America arise , not from defects in their Constitution or Confederation , not from want of honor or virtue , so much as from the downright ignorance of the nature of coin , credit and circulation . ” – John Adams
“ A free America ... means just this : individual freedom for all , rich or poor , or else this system of government we call democracy is only an expedient to enslave man to the machine and make him like it . ” - Frank Lloyd Wright
America had an option in 1946 .
We had a choice between Bedford Falls and Pottersville .
Sadly , over time , Americans came to a fork in the road and took it .
Life is about choices .
As a nation we have undoubtedly made more ghastly choices than superior ones .
Essentially , the choices were the same ones faced by George Bailey .
Do I act in the best interest of myself or do what is best for the community as a whole ?
Do I choose the path that will give me the most benefits and greatest personal wealth , with the least sacrifice ?
Or , do I choose a path based upon the values we hold dear like hard work , sacrifice , charity , and loving thy neighbor .
A civilization cannot be sustained with making money as its chief pursuit .
In that scenario we are no more than animals .
Our transition to a brutish society began when citizens became consumers .
A citizen is concerned with their civic responsibility , fiscal accountability and obligation to future generations .
A consumer devours whatever they can get their grubby little hands on and cares not about debt or unborn generations .
Americans bought into two huge lies .
They believed that “ free market capitalism ” and “ globalism ” would make their lives better .
These fabrications were spread by the monopolistic mammoth corporations that control Washington D.C. and their puppets in Congress .
Big media spread the gospel of free markets and the benefits of a global economy incessantly .
The fact is free markets are n’t really free and global markets meant your job was shipped to China or India .
Americans fell for the hook of cheap goods sold by mega-retailers and produced by slave labor in Far East countries and paid for with loans at 19.99 % .
This was not free market capitalism , but predatory capitalism .
The capitalism that thrived in Bedford Falls was humane capitalism .
It was a capitalism where one 's commitment to being benevolent took priority over greedy self interest ; when the welfare of the person was rooted in the best interests of the society , and when the profit motivation was employed to meet societal needs , rather than Potter - like inhumane bankers and gluttonous corporate CEOs .
These monsters of capitalism have the same contempt for the American people as displayed by Henry Potter .
They are as bigoted towards America 's working class just as Potter referring to the townsfolk as suckers , riff raff , and garlic eaters .
Frank Capra depicted bankers as prejudiced predators , angling to direct America toward a rapacious existence under their sphere of influence .
In my opinion , he was too generous , as the Wall Street bankers of today personify pure evil .
Only soulless parasites could create subprime , no doc , and Option ARM mortgages , sell them as packages to pension funds , bet they would collapse , beg for a taxpayer rescue , use the money to gamble in the stock market , and pay themselves billions in bonuses .
That defines American capitalism today .
The banking elite have been so successful , the average American has n’t realized their standard of living has been steadily declining for decades .
Even using the fraudulent government manipulated CPI , real average weekly earnings are below the level of wages in 1964 .
Average Americans are making less than they did 46 years ago .
In a fascinating coincidence , Alan Greenspan and his minions began “ tweaking ” the CPI calculation downward in the early 1980 ’s just as banks opened the spigot on easy revolving credit .
Using the true CPI , as calculated by economist John Williams , real weekly earnings are 70 % lower than they were in 1964 .
Revolving credit outstanding per household has risen by 1,100 % since 1980 .
Knowing the average American does n’t understand the concepts of inflation , interest or debt has allowed bankers and politicians to convince Americans they were getting richer when they were really descending into the abyss .
Here we sit in 2010 .
We are blessed with 4,300 Wal - Marts , 2,200 Home Depots , 1,500 Lowes , 1,000 Best Buys , 15,000 McDonalds , 11,000 Starbucks and 2 million other retail stores .
Americans need to ask themselves whether cheap economy packs of tube socks were worth allowing small town America to disintegrate and blow away .
Small businesses that were the heart of America in 1946 have been methodically driven out of business by predatory mega-retailers .
The free market capitalists claim this has been good for America .
Is it free market capitalism when these companies use their billions to buy politicians , zoning boards , and local officials ?
The next time you drive through a small town and see boarded up stores , for lease signs , and decaying infrastructure think about the true cost of big business capitalism .
Succumbing to corporatism and debt financed materialism has resulted in a society marred by divorce , broken families , decaying cities , drugs , murder and police chases - the Potterville of It ’s a Wonderful Life .
Was it worth it ?
Sympathy for the Devil
“ I read in the newspapers they are going to have 30 minutes of intellectual stuff on television every Monday from 7:30 to 8 . to educate America .
They could n't educate America if they started at 6:30 . ” – Groucho Marx
" When plunder becomes a way of life for a group of men living together in society , they create for themselves , in the course of time , a legal system that authorizes it and a moral code that glorifies it . "
- Frederic Bastiat
Please allow me to introduce myself
I 'm a man of wealth and taste
I 've been around for a long , long year
Stole many a man 's soul and faith
Pleased to meet you
Hope you guess my name
But what 's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game
Rolling Stones – Sympathy for the Devil
Frank Capra ended his movie on an optimistic note .
This makes sense , as the U.S. was just entering a new High .
There were bad people in the world , but the good people had just defeated the bad people in a World War .
Good people had the support of God and his angels .
Every time a bell rang , an angel got their wings .
Today , every time a bell rings , a Goldman Sachs banker gets a bonus .
The depressing truth is that Capra ’s faith in Americans was misplaced .
Evil has won out over good .
The men of wealth and taste have stolen our souls and our faith .
They ’ve used their superior knowledge of money and power to obscure the nature of their game .
This country was founded upon the rights of the individual , respect for property , freedom to succeed or fail , and power at the local level .
Judge for yourself on the political and economic continuum below , where we stand today .
I contend that we are much closer to a centralized military corporate fascist state than a true democratic Republic of the people , for the people , and by the people .
Both political parties have been successful in shoving us in the direction of big government , corporate & banking oligarchic monopolies , never ending warfare , fiat currency , entitlements for the many , and riches for the few .
If Americans understood the concept of systematic inflation , as practiced by the Federal Reserve , they would comprehend how the American Dream has been stolen by a narrow subset of privileged elite .
These people live in penthouses , are chauffeured to their nightly galas , summer in the Hamptons , have prominent politicians over for dinner , and direct the largest banks and corporations in the world .
Do you think they care about the George Baileys of the world ?
These are the people who expounded about the benefits of a global marketplace .
Who received the benefits ?
Global markets were n’t free .
The admired U.S. corporate titans like General Electric , Intel , Apple , and IBM shipped the $ 30 an hour American jobs to China where they only needed to pay $ 1 per hour .
Corporations are designed for one purpose – to make money .
When corporations and the people who run them are given unfettered control over society , money making and debt proliferation to support the money making become the only goals .
Corporate media and corporate manipulated government officials then hammer the message that being rich is a noble goal .
Mega - banks must be saved , we are told , because our way of life is dependent upon these modern day Potters .
The wealthy elite keep the masses distracted with electronic igadgets that never leave our hands , new and improved five bladed razors , $ 5 cups of flavored foamy hot water , sexcapades of golfers , color coded terrorist warnings , military surges , and 600 HDTV channels with nothing worth watching .
While Boobus Americanus was pre-occupied , the bankers stole their wallets .
If it seems like we have a financial crisis every five years which “ threatens the financial system ” , you are right .
Have the wealthy bankers created these crisis episodes on purpose ?
Fifteen years ago , the combined assets of our six biggest banks totaled 17 % of our GDP .
By 2006 , that number was 55 % .
Right now , it stands at 63 % .
The big four have 50 % of the market for mortgages and 67 % of the market for credit cards .
Five banks have over 95 % of the market for over - the - counter derivatives .
Three U.S. banks have over 40 % of the global market for stock underwriting .
Does it make sense that after every crisis precipitated by the Federal Reserve and the mega banks that control it , the Fed accumulates more power ( new Consumer Protection Agency ) and the top 5 or 6 banks accumulate more assets as hundreds of small banks go out of business ?
Frank Capra thought a suburban oasis , as reflected in Bailey Park , would protect Americans from Henry ’s Potter ’s nightmare world .
He was wrong .
America ’s suburban sprawl has actually encouraged the onset of Pottersville .
The suburbanization of America corroded much of what remained of community values .
With its cookie cutter McMansions , lack of meaningful community space , suburbia fostered not neighborhoods , but individualized rampant consumerism .
Americans live next door to people for five years without saying more than hello .
This reality made it effortless for Americans to turn inward and disregard all but their own self interest .
Instead of community identity flowing smoothly from the communication of citizens and neighbors , as in Bedford Falls , suburbia took on the personality of a sprawling concrete meca of four lane highways , regional malls , power centers , strip centers and stand alone 350,000 sq ft palaces of consumerism .
The average family of 2.5 Americans huddles in their 3,500 square foot brick and vinyl castle on ¼ acre of chemical treated land during the week and crosses the drawbridge on the weekends in their $ 60,000 leased Mercedes SUV chariot to venture out to the jousting matches at the local mall , charging the entertainment on a 4 inch sliver of plastic .
In the end , America is left to extend and pretend .
With a National Debt of $ 12.4 trillion and $ 4.4 billion of debt being added to that number every day , no amount of obfuscation by the Federal Reserve , elite bankers and corrupt politicians will successfully camouflage the road to ruin we are on .
Is it too late to turn back ?
Until Americans experience another dose of horrific pain inflicted upon them by the ruling elite , they will not learn the simple lesson :
You ca n’t always get what you want , but you get what you need .
Only then will they have a chance to be the richest man in town , like George Bailey .

Some wildlife photographers spend months immersed in muck to capture the perfect shot .
The Burrard - Lucas brothers decided to let an RC car do the dirty work .
Their BeetleCam came face - to - face with lions , elephants , and buffalo and captured these stunning shots :

The BeetleCam is the ingenuous creation of Will and Matt Burrard - Lucas , two acclaimed UK wildlife photographers who wanted to get up close and personal with some of Africa 's most dangerous animals ( with a wide - angle lens , natch ) .
They strapped a Canon EOS 400D on top of a four - wheel drive buggy and rigged up one controller to operate the entire contraption .
The photographs , recovered only after the BeetleCam was " promptly mauled , and carried off into the bush " by a pride of lions , show the animals from a unique , " I'm - a - small - rodent - about - to - get - snacked - on " perspective .

Editorial cartoonist Mark Fiore may be good enough to win this year 's Pulitzer Prize , but he 's evidently too biting to get past the auditors who run Apple 's iPhone app store , who ruled that lampooning public figures violated its terms of service .
Fiore irked Apple 's censorious staffers with his cartoons making fun of the Balloon Boy hoax and the pair that famously crashed a White House party , according to Laura McGann at the Neiman Journalism Lab .
Update 4/16 - Reacting to the bad publicity , Apple called Fiore and asked him to re-submit his app , which Fiore did Friday morning .
Fiore won a Pulitzer Monday for animations he made for the SFGate , the online home of the San Francisco Chronicle .
But Fiore , who is a freelancer who runs a syndication business , was rejected by Apple in December for an app called NewToons that features his work .
According to a Dec. 21 e-mail reprinted by Neiman , Apple rejected his app because it " contains content that ridicules public figures and is in violation of Section 3.3.14 from the iPhone Developer Program License Agreement which states :
Applications may be rejected if they contain content or materials of any kind ( text , graphics , images , photographs , sounds , etc. ) that in Apple ’s reasonable judgment may be found objectionable , for example , materials that may be considered obscene , pornographic , or defamatory . "
Neither Fiore nor Apple responded to requests for comment .
The news of the rejection comes not long after Apple decided to purge its
App store of content that included nudity , a retroactive ban that included apps from respected German publications such as Bild and Der Spiegel .
Fiore 's rejection may be especially disconcerting to news and media organizations , many of which are betting heavily on iPad apps as a way to get users to pay to read magazines and newspapers , and to get advertisers to pay print - ad prices for online content .
( Online ads cost a small percentage of what ads in glossy magazines cost , in no small part because the net has almost infinite advertising space . )
Apple has built a little slab of Disneyland with its iPad , which is meant to be an experience unsullied by provocative or crude material .
It 's beautiful and enticing – the company has already sold more than a half million of them in the first two weeks it 's been available – but it's not the real world .
Publishers , including such august organizations such as The New York Times , The Wall Street Journal and Wired.com 's parent company Condé Nast , see a solution to their declining dead - tree ad sales in building a pay - to - play attraction in that park .
But they need to understand that to do so , they have to play by Mickey Mouse 's rules .
The signs have been there from the start , as Wired.com 's Brian Chen pointed out in February .
Apple banned an e-book reading application once because it figured out that iPhone users could use it to read a free version of the Kama Sutra .
Then last week , Apple abruptly banned apps developed using programs that translate apps into multiple platforms .
Adding the news of Fiore 's ban to that , the publishing world is now officially on notice that the iPad is Apple 's , and unlike with their print and web editions , they do n't have the final say when it comes to their own content on an Apple device .

The independent party finance watchdog began looking into the adequacy of the far - right party ' s2008 statement of accounts at the start of this year , but the case has now become an investigation .
" It is important to note - particularly during an election period - that no conclusion has been reached and therefore no assumption should be made as to whether a breach of the rules has occurred , " an Electoral Commission spokesperson said .
The investigation was just the latest trouble to beset the beleaguered extremist party .
It was recently forced to adapt its whites - only membership policy while facing legal action from the Equality and Human Rights Commission .
HARDCORE fans of The Beatles legend John Lennon uncovered where in the grounds of his Surrey , southern England , home he hid his stash of LSD more than 40 years ago .
Builders digging up the lawn of his old house , Kenwood , came across the remains of a leather holdall containing several large broken glass bottles , The Sun reports .
Legend has it that Lennon buried a large quantity of the drug in his garden in 1967 when The Beatles declared they had given up drugs in favour of transcendental meditation .
But when the band returned from India , John decided he had been a bit hasty and tried to dig it up - but never found it .
Now fans are convinced these bottles contained the missing treasure - though they will never know for sure as the one bottle found intact had a cracked cork , so it was empty .
Ubisofts creative director Maxime Béland has told VG247 in an interview that DRM is vital to the developer ’s success .
He said that the heavy DRM now attached to new Ubisoft releases is helping the company to continue to develop “ creative and innovative games ” .
“ We consider that protecting our PC games is vital to our business , ” said Béland , “ and will allow us to continue investing in the development of creative and innovative games on the PC platform . ”
The DRM , which forces gamers to be online while they access any part of the game , has sparked controversy among the PC community .
It was also thought that a withdrawal of Silent Hunter V and Assassins Creed II from Steam was due to the issue - in fact it was just down to an unrelated business decision .
Steam said ,
“ The games listed are available for sale in all other countries on STEAM .
The fact it is not available on STEAM UK has nothing to do with the DRM but is linked to a local business discussion between Ubisoft and Steam in UK . ”
The restricting technology has again come under fire recently when it emerged that Splinter Cell would be delayed for the PC until April 29 - which again , Ubisoft claims , is unrelated to DRM .

After the country 's judiciary slammed Google for failing to keep a tight enough leash on user - uploaded content , we 're now hearing that its local version of Wired magazine is putting forward the internet as a candidate for the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of its contributions to " helping advance dialogue , debate and consensus . "
Right then .
Just in case you think this is all a bit silly -- and you should -- we 're also hearing Nicholas Negroponte and 2003 Nobel laureate Shirin Ebadi are both in support of the idea , which has been described as " a Nobel for each and every one of us " by Internet for Peace , an organization set up specifically to promote the web 's candidacy .
That 's a pretty succinct way of putting it , but it also shows what 's wrong with the idea : nothing devalues a prize 's worth and meaning quite like handing it out to everyone .
Just imagine icanhascheezburger.com slapping a legitimate Nobel laureate badge up on its homepage and you 'll know what we mean .
WASHINGTON ( AP ) 
The planned withdrawal of nearly 45,000 U.S. troops from Iraq by the end of August is on track in spite of a recent increase in attacks by militant forces , the top U.S. military commander in Iraq said Sunday .
Army Gen. Ray Odierno said that al - Qaeda 's strength in Iraq is steadily degrading .
Unless there 's a dramatic and unforeseen change in the security situation , the U.S. troop drawdown will go ahead as scheduled , he said .
There are now about 95,000 U.S. troops in Iraq , according to Odierno .
The U.S. plans to cut that number to 50,000 by Aug. 31 , when it will end combat operations .
" I fully expect us to be at 50,000 by the first of September , " Odierno said on Fox News Sunday .
As part of an agreement with Iraq , the U.S. will withdraw all forces by the end of 2011 .
Odierno 's remarks came as he prepared to leave Iraq at the end of the summer as part of a scheduled rotation .
His replacement will be Lt. Gen. Lloyd Austin , the staff director for the Joint Chiefs of Staff , The Associated Press reported last week .
The announcement has not been formally made by the Pentagon .
" Nobody has contacted me yet about leaving , " said Odierno , who has been the senior U.S. commander in Iraq since 2008 .
A wave of deadly bombings in and around Baghdad following Iraq 's disputed March 7 parliamentary elections raised doubts about whether Iraqi security forces were prepared to protect the country as American forces began to leave .
But Odierno described al - Qaeda in Iraq as an enemy on the run .
The number of attacks and casualties to civilians and military personnel dropped in the first three months of 2010 , he said .
" Iraqi security forces are now in the lead at going after al - Qaeda , " he said .
Neighboring Iran continues to play a destabilizing role , providing lethal aid and training for insurgent elements , Odierno said .
Asked if he'd like the authority to go into Iran and take out the training camps , he said he does n't think it is necessary to conduct such operations .
" I think what 's more important is to build up the Iraqi capability to protect their own homeland , " he said .

1. Solid first 10 Fehr the last two games and it changes everything about the contest .
As Capitals right wing
They do n't necessarily have to take a lead , but how about not giving up two goals in the first 10 minutes for a change ?
The Canadiens have scored within the first 9:09 in each ofthe last two games and it changes everything about the contest .
As Capitals right wing Eric Fehr said , when Montreal has the lead it can sit back and play what is , in effect , a neutral - zone trap .
When the Habs are trailing , they can't sit back because they have to score and that usually opens space for the Capitals to work their magic .
Washington has to get out of the first 10 minutes without giving up a goal , and scoring first Wednesday night is just as imperative .
1 . Another Roy - like game from Halak Halak would be something , that 's for sure .
Halak has stopped 90 of 92 shots over the last two games to lift his team back into this series .
The Capitals say he's not in their heads and they 're not thinking about him , but every player in Washington 's locker room Monday night was crediting Halak -- and only Halak -- for Montreal 's win .
If he 's not in their heads , than how come the Capitals are saying Halak was the only reason Montreal won ?
Montreal might need another stunning performance from its Slovak goalie to beat the Capitals , and by now he 's certainly proven he can do it .
But can he do it one more time ?
Itwould be something , that 's for sure .
Halak has stopped 90 of 92 shots over the last two games to lift his team back into this series .
The Capitals say he's not in their heads and they 're not thinking about him , but every player in Washington 's locker room Monday night was crediting Halak -- and only Halak -- for Montreal 's win .
If he 's not in their heads , than how come the Capitals are saying Halak was the only reason Montreal won ?
2. Perseverance
It took their 51st shot to finally score on Halak in Game 6 .
Hopefully for the Caps it does n't take that long in Game 7 , but no matter what they have to keep firing away at Green the Habs ' net and hope the dam breaks at some point .
The key , as Mike Green pointed out Tuesday , is getting traffic in front of Halak .
They scored in Game 6 when Green 's shot was re-directed by Fehr right at the doorstep .
If no one is in front of Halak , he 's proven he 's going to stop the puck .
2 . More sublime penalty killing
Coach Bruce Boudreau and captain Alex Ovechkin get asked about the Caps ' broken power play every day now , and they keep saying it 's because they 're not doing enough Markov to score goals , they 're trying to be too cute and they are n't gritty enough .
What we have n't heard is either Boudreau or Ovechkin complement the Canadiens on what has been a marvelous penalty kill .
Washington is 1 - for - 30 on the power play , but that means the Canadiens are 29 - for - 30 on the penalty kill .
They were downright spectacular during a three - on - five for 75 seconds in the first period Monday , and that probably was the turning point in the game .
The Habs are giving themselves a chance to win with their penalty kill .
3 . A power play goal
Imagine , if you will , that the Capitals got a power - play goal in Game 7 .
Now , imagine if it came early in the game -- say , the first Ovechkin period .
It might be hard to do right about now considering the Capitals are 1 - for - 30 on the power play in this series , but what a huge lift it would give the team to get one in the most important game of the series .
This was the League 's best power play in the regular season and it 's seriously broken right now .
There 's no better time to fix it than the present .
If not , they might not get another chance to score a power - play goal until October .
3 . Better puck possession
As good as Halak has been , 54 shots on goal are way too many to give up in one game , and the Canadiens know it .
Asked late Monday Cammalleri night how the Habs are keeping the Capitals down , Michael Cammalleri answered honestly by saying that they 're not .
He 's right .
Washington is getting too many quality chances and eventually they 're going to start going in the net .
It would n't be wrong to predict for that to happen Wednesday because you have to wonder how long players like Ovechkin , Nicklas Backstrom , Alexander Semin , Mike Knuble and Mike Green can be held down .
The Habs have to limit the chances the Capitals get because it could be the end of them if they do n't .
4 . A goal from Semin and / or Fleischmann
Similar to the power play , a goal from Semin or Fleischmann in Game 7 may not be an absolute must - have for the Caps to win , but boy would that ignite them .
Semin scored 40 Semin goals in the regular season , but now has gone 13 straight playoff games without scoring .
Fleischmann had 23 goals in the regular season , but has just 3 goals in 22 career playoff games .
Semin leads all players in the playoffs with 36 shots on goal , but he is tied for last in goals with a big fat zero .
Fleischmann has eight shots in the series , but his last two have been splendid chances that he just missed on .
An interesting stat about Semin is this year he went six straight games without a goal twice , but he broke out of both slumps with 2 goals in the seventh game .
Well , he 's gone six straight games without a goal now , so does he have a pair on his stick Wednesday night ?
4 . Protection for the goalie
If the Capitals , as everyone expects , crash the net hard Wednesday , the Canadiens better have some bodies there to protect Halak .
One way to rattle a hot goalie is to get into his Gill kitchen and frustrate him , force him to retaliate and perhaps even take an unsportsmanlike - conduct penalty .
That 'll get him out of his zone in a heartbeat .
Players like Knuble , Brooks Laich and Jason Chimera will run over Halak if given the chance .
It might even be worth taking a goalie - interference penalty if it happens early in the game .
You always want to protect your best asset , and Montreal has none better right now than Halak .

Conservationists say the area is a biodiversity hotspot
The UK government has created the world 's largest marine reserve around the Chagos Islands .
The reserve would cover a 545,000 - sq - km area around the Indian Ocean archipelago , regarded as one of the world 's richest marine ecosystems .
This will include an area where commercial fishing will be banned .
But islanders , who were evicted to make way for the US air base on the island of Diego Garcia , say a reserve would effectively bar them from returning .
UK Foreign Secretary David Miliband said establishing the reserve would " double the global coverage of the world 's oceans under protection " .
It will protect a treasure trove of tropical , marine wildlife for posterity
William Marsden
Chagos Conservation Trust
He commented : " Its creation is a major step forward for protecting the oceans , not just around BIOT [ British Indian Ocean Territory ] itself , but also throughout the world .
" This measure is a further demonstration of how the UK takes its international environmental responsibilities seriously . "
Conservationists say the combination of tropical islands , unspoiled coral reefs and adjacent oceanic abyss makes the area a biodiversity hotspot of global importance .
The archipelago , which has been compared to the Galapagos Islands and to Australia 's Great Barrier Reef , hosts the world 's biggest living coral structure - the Great Chagos Bank .
This is home to more than 220 coral species - almost half the recorded species of the entire Indian Ocean , and more than 1,000 species of reef fish .
William Marsden , chairman of the Chagos Conservation Trust , commented : " Today 's decision by the British government is inspirational .
It will protect a treasure trove of tropical , marine wildlife for posterity and create a safe haven for breeding fish stocks for the benefit of people in the region . "
Mauritius has asserted a claim to sovereignty over the islands ; and the UK has agreed to cede the territory when it is no longer required for defence purposes .
But in a letter to the Sunday Times newspaper earlier this year , Mauritius ' High Commissioner Abhimanu Kundasamy said : " There can be no legitimacy to the [ marine protected area ] project without the issue of sovereignty and resettlement being addressed to the satisfaction of the government of Mauritius . "
The former residents of the islands , who were evicted from the British overseas territory between 1967 and 1971 to make way for the US Air Force base on the largest island , Diego Garcia , have fought a long - running battle in the UK courts for the right to return .
Of the islands , only Diego Garcia , which has played a key role in the US - led operations in Iraq and Afghanistan , is currently inhabited .
Resettlement fight Some Chagossians claim the marine protected area ( MPA ) would " severely jeopardise " any resettlement , because it would prevent them from fishing - their main livelihood .
The islanders ' legal saga is not over ; Chagossians are now pursuing their cause through European courts .
In a statement on its website , The UK Chagos Support Association said the Foreign Secretary 's announcement left several key questions unanswered and called on Mr Miliband to involve Chagossians in the marine protection project .
We do n't want another state to come and exploit the area , do massive construction of hotels and bring in commercial fishing .
Then the area will be finished
Allen Vincatassin
Diego Garcian Society
The association said the announcement did not make clear whether zones could be established within the MPA in which " limited , sustainable fishing could take place " .
The statement also criticised the timing of the decision : " It is ... bitterly disappointing that the government has felt it appropriate to make its announcement now , whilst parliament is [ in ] recess . "
In his statement , Mr Miliband pointed out that the decision had been taken following a consultation ( in which 90 % of those who responded supported greater marine protection ) .
He also said the Foreign Office intended " to continue to work closely with all interested stakeholders " .
He added that the decision over the protection zone " is , of course , without prejudice to the outcome of the current , pending proceedings before the European Court of Human Rights " .
' Conservation legacy ' Some Chagossian representatives back the reserve .
Allen Vincatassin , from the UK - based Diego Garcian Society , told BBC News : " I am personally delighted that the Foreign Secretary has made the brave decision to protect the ( BIOT ) . "
Mr Vincatassin told me he regarded the issue of the MPA as separate from the question of the right to return : " If a resettlement occurs in future on the outer islands , the marine protected area can be adjusted .
These are two separate issues and I think there has been a deep misunderstanding . "
He called the exile of the Chagossians " a great injustice " , but added : " We do n't want another state to come and exploit the area , do massive construction of hotels and bring in commercial fishing .
Then the area will be finished . "
The islands are home to almost half the coral species in the Indian Ocean Conservationists said the 545,000 - sq- km ( 210,000 - sq- mile ) protection zone - an area twice the size of the UK - would prohibit activities such as industrial fishing and deep - sea mining .
Alistair Gammell , from the Pew Environment Group , said he was " thrilled " with the decision , adding that the oceans " desperately need better protection " .
He commented : " In 2010 , the International Year of Biodiversity , the UK has secured a conservation legacy which is unrivalled in scale and significance , demonstrating to the world that it is a leader in conserving the world 's marine resources for the benefit of future generations . "
The Foreign Office said it had been advised that the BIOT was crucial for repopulating coral systems along the East Coast of Africa and hence to the recovery in the marine food supply in sub-Saharan Africa .
The conditions of the MPA are expected to be enforced by the territory 's patrol vessel .

A new malware scam is trying to dupe BitTorrent users into coughing up serious cash for illegally downloading copyrighted material .
The code displays a box with the message " Warning !
Piracy detected ! " and opens a web page purportedly run by a Swiss company " committed to promoting the cultural and economic benefits of copyright . "
The fake company , the ICCP Foundation , also claims to be backed by the Recording Industry Association of America , the Motion Picture Association of America and others .
" It appears to scan the user 's hard drive for . torrent files and displays these as ' evidence ' of an earlier infringement , " wrote TorrentFreak , which first disclosed the malware .
Victims are are warned of possible imprisonment and fines , and given the option of " settling " the " case " for a one - time payment of $ 400 , by credit card .
The scam seems intended to capitalize on the recent news that an independent filmmakers association is targeting thousands of BitTorrent users in federal lawsuits , with the aim of reaching quick settlements .
Security researcher Dancho Danchev quipped Monday that the scam " is perhaps the first recorded case of cybercriminals ignoring the basics of micropayments , and emphasizing on profit margins by attempting to extort the amount of $ 400 . "
He thinks those behind the latest malware are associated with the Koobface worm and a money - mule recruitment campaign .
As F - Secure Labs advises : " Refuse to pay money to these clowns ! "

Indeed the universal implications must be known in order to have a controlled life .
Indeed when such thoughts arise in the mind , feelings of insanity might arise as well .
The universe works in sequences , rhythms , patterns and cycles .
It could be frustrating realizing this concept , watching everything repeat itself could get annoying , especially when the ones around you do n’t realize that humanity and the rest of the world are part of an endless cycle .
The benefit of knowing this concept outweighs the negative aspect of it .
Instead of complaining about the cycle , realize you start the motions .
You can either start a negative or positive motion ; the power lies in your hands .
If you start a negative motion it will repeat itself until you realize it and stop it , or else it will just spin and spin .
Realize that you are a soul and not a body .
The body is just the soul ’s instrument , and when the instrument becomes old and rusty , does n’t work as it used to , the soul discards the body and gets another one .
There is no such thing as “ death ” really .
It is only a moment in one ’s life when the body becomes too weak to work anymore and is not a benefit for the soul any longer .
One could say it is also a time when the soul ’s mission is complete , however only for that period of time because it will return and have a new objective .
Nevertheless , there is one general objective the all souls must strive to carry out , that is spirituality , to be connected to the supreme soul while having its presence on earth .
However , through many births this objective in majority of cases has been neglected and forgotten .
Through many births the soul consciousness has been replaced by body consciousness , this means that the body rather than the soul governs actions .
This means that majority of people will do things if there is a benefit for them .
This means that anger , jealousy , egotism , arrogance , selfishness , ignorance , attachment to physical objects , thirst for power , lust , become apparent in one ’s life .
Those who live by soul consciousness would never live by such negative aspects .
A soul sees everyone as a brother or a sister ; the soul sees everyone as one .
The soul sees everyone pure as crystal water .
The soul will never fully attach itself to a physical object , knowing that physical objects sooner or later will crumble to nothingness .
It knows that by seeking happiness in physical objects , that happiness will last as long as that physical object or as long as one has an attachment towards it .
It knows that happiness through materialism is temporal ; through soul consciousness happiness is eternal .
It is logical to consider the fact that when one is dependent on an external factor , the fulfillment will not last due to the fact that nothing is permanent .
Therefore , if one is merely dependent on one ’s internal nature , which is everlasting , the fulfillment is eternal .
In order for this to occur , one needs to reach a certain spiritual plateau from which this internal fulfillment will arouse .
By living with a body consciousness , a person will be living in an a illusion believing it is reality .
The mental perspective of the world itself is an illusion .
The world you live in is the world that lives within your mind .
Your perspective is only due to your state of mind , each mind equals a different world .
However , by going back to soul consciousness , one awakes from their illusionary dream and sees the world with clarity and truth .
By living a righteousness life and meditating and by reading spiritual material one can gain such clarity .
Soul and body consciousness are of the same essence , tails and heads of a coin .
Spirituality is not a religion , it is not a way of life , it is life , true essence of life .
There are no rituals , no customs , no worship ; all that is required is to live with a soul consciousness , to be righteous and to be aware of the universal laws .
Spirituality is the core of religions , it is the core and the religions are the seeds , which have grown to be what they are due to their environment and time .
In essence they are pretty much the same .
The problem is that they have been interpreted wrongly and manipulated ; one must look upon without attaching oneself to it and with an open mind to see the meaning with a wider perspective .
It is mostly written metaphorically and the meaning lies deeper , it is important not to take it literally .
Most of the stories , which are taken literally have a certain meaning but lose their true meaning .
For example , many will disagree with this but many will agree , it depends on the state of mind .
The main figurehead other than God , of the Bible is Jesus .
He has been portrayed as a son of God , as a messiah who came down to earth , he was indeed .
However , Jesus said that he is the son of God indicating that everyone else is a son or daughter of God .
He did n’t say it to indicate that he is all powerful and that everyone must obey him .
He also said that everyone could be him if they wanted .
Furthermore , anyone who comes here , earth , to elevate humanity and to preach peace and love is a messiah .
He came down to play his role ; everyone has their role to play .
This is an example of manipulation ; the Christian scholars , the apostles got people to worship a man , like an idol , which is against their law .
Yes he had spiritual powers but everyone can achieve them if they tried hard enough , perhaps to a lesser degree , that was one of the things Jesus preached about .
Muhammad is very similar to Jesus , pretty much preached the same words .
However , Muhammad said he is no God and must not be worshipped , that he is only a man .
One does not need to seek out to find a meaning to life or to seek out to find truth , does not need a God to worship but only acknowledged , truth and meaning lies within oneself .
There is a whole world waiting to be discovered within you .
The purpose of life is to give it a purpose , the truth of life is hidden within you .
Meditating is not a religious aspect , nor a Buddhist or Hindu practice .
It is a universal aspect ; it is a natural method and a very powerful method of transforming the mind .
It is not used to empower breath control or just to relax , even though they are part of it , but the main point is to enlighten the soul by connecting it to a higher source .
Just close your eyes and watch how it brightens your soul and how the light envelops your mind .
The absence of spiritual light leads to darkness , the negativity and sorrow in one ’s life .
While being internally dark , the words you speak and the actions you perform will release the darkness , resulting in more sorrow for yourself and the people around you .
The outer world will be only a reflection of the inner darkness ; things might seem meaningless and distressful .
However , when the inner light is shinning the opposite occurs , being that darkness and light are complete opposites , one ’s eyes glitter exposing the inner peace .
One ’s actions and words are performed with care and love .
By sharing the light with others and seeing people benefit from it and become happier results in more happiness inside .
Due to the inner light , the outer world in result shines as well .
One should realize that one ’s actions are judged and are returned to him , this is the law of Karma .
The family that you have , the friends , everyone you meet , the situation that you are in , the hard times you have the good times you have , everything in your life , it might sound unfair but they are all fruits of your creation .
The seeds you plant are the flowers that you will get .
There is no one to blame but yourself .
It is more logical to blame yourself rather than God , after all He did give you free will , the way you use it is your choice .
To blame God is to say that He is cruel and loves hurting people , that He is blood thirsty and loves to see people suffer
This perhaps answers the question , why do innocent suffer ; well perhaps they are not innocent after all .
This is due to their past life or actions that they did in the past , the actions that they carried in their past life or what they did in the past have returned to them .
This does n’t mean that one has to suffer due to his actions forever ; any negative situation is a sign that something needs to be changed .
By changing your actions you change your present state , which changes your future .
Nothing is coincidental , there is no luck or miracles , everything happens for a reason and everything has a meaning .
By going deep inside yourself you will find the real self .
You will find your role and your purpose in life .
Good things do n’t come easy but bad things do , the harder you try the better the feeling when you get the result .
It is a hard journey but the most important journey .
Another year , another version of iOS .
However , little did people think that another version of iOS would run on the iPad 2 !
Released in early 2011 , The iPad 2 has had quite a remarkably long life .
It was sold alongside the iPad 3 , iPad 4 and iPad Air before being finally discontinued in 2014 .
However it lived on as the up until recently sold iPad Mini 1 , which is merely a miniaturised iPad 2 .
The iPad 2 also lives on in its installed base , it was the iPad with the highest usage base until quite recently , and despite being overtaken by the iPad Air , it still holds a respectable usage share for a 4 and a half year old tablet .

Microsoft developer Garrett Serack , has announced the development of CoApp , the Common Opensource Application Publishing Platform which " intends to bring a little joy into the hearts of Open Source aficionados on the Windows platform " .
CoApp is planned to be a Windows native equivalent of Unix / Linux 's tools for building applications .
On Windows , it is more common to use pre-compiled binaries of libraries when building an application .
This is , according to Serack , because of the variation in development environments , tools and practices between Windows developers .
On Linux / Unix systems , much of this variation is already handled by years of community consensus and tools such as configure scripts .
CoApp plans to offer a distributed community driven package management system , but , rather than adapt a Linux / Unix system which would bring its own conventions , Serack plans to create a Windows specific system .
This means it would allow the use of IDEs rather than forcing Windows developers to use make at the command line , create MSI based installer packages , allow coders to create optimised binaries using Profile Guided Optimization and allow for integrating Windows Error Reporting .
Serack believes this is a " Tall order " , but has spent several months working on proof - of - concepts while developing the currently fluid specification .
In a later blog posting , Serack explained that he had begun reaching out to open source developers at ApacheCon last year .
He says that Microsoft have recognised the value of the project and have offered to let him work on it full time .
The project will be run as a community development , with no vetting of it by Microsoft .
" This really makes my job a dream job " , he added , " I get to work on a project that I 'm passionate about , make it open source and let it take me where it makes sense " .
The project has a Launchpad project and a wiki at CoApp.org and Serack invites interested developers to offer input and contributions .
CoApp will be released under the Simplified BSD licence .

Timothy Geithner has apparently penned a letter to Representative Scott Jarrett ( R - NJ ) telling him that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac 's obligations are not sovereign debt .
Of course , the United States government believes that supporting this debt is crucial to saving the economy .
But just because we 're not - so - implicitly guaranteeing this debt , does n't mean that you should treat it like government debt .
Geithner . . . said debt from the two government - sponsored enterprises is n't the same as U.S. Treasurys , but that support for the two firms " is crucial in helping to stabilize the housing market and the overall economy .
The Treasury 's actions regarding the two firms , which have been under government control since September 2008 , " should leave no uncertainty about Treasury 's commitment to support Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , " Geithner wrote .
This is exactly the sort of nudge - nudge , wink - wink , now - we - guarantee - it - now - we - do n't behavior that allowed the companies to get themselves ( and by extension us ) in so much trouble in the first place .
If we want companies that get the attractive low borrowing rates available to the US government , we should make them a government agency and be done with it .
If not , we should sell off their assets and dissolve the companies .
But " neither fish , nor fowl , nor good red herring " is not a healthy state for a financial firm .

Scan most reviews of Final Fantasy XIII and you 'll find a single accusation binding the lot of them :
That Square Enix 's action - roleplaying game is stiflingly linear , undeviating for too long , and restrictive to a fault .
GamesRadar : " 2D side - scroller levels of linearity . "
CVG : " 15 hours of dead straight single - path linearity is a little overkill . "
1UP : " Chop -- there goes the nonlinearity . "
GameSpot : " Exceedingly linear exploration and character progression . "
Wired : " Final Fantasy XIII is relentlessly linear . "
They 're not wrong .
The game leads off straight as an arrow , though it opens wide dozens of hours later , with as much to explore and accomplish on your own terms after you 've polished off the Big Bad as there was leading up to the main story 's frenetic final beats .
But let 's talk about those " linear " opening hours , because they 're on everyone 's lips .
When the game begins , after the pre-rendered intro deposits you on The Hanging Edge inside a kind of electric green shell , your first chance to interact is a battle .
Your second is a follow - up battle to the first .
And your third ?
A stroll along a wreckage - littered sky - highway toward ... yep , more battles .
With rare exception , Final Fantasy XIII 's following 25 hours are battles followed by more battles punctuated by non-interactive story exposition .
You control the rate of advance by steering your party at or away from enemy mobs , but that 's all the control on loan at the outset .
Even classic RPG - like features get the boot in an attempt to excise all gameplay flab .
Towns ?
You 'll encounter several in the game -- as detailed as they 've ever been -- but here you battle through them instead of dropping by during interludes to solicit trite one - liners from wandering folk , or to grab a few winks and heal up at an inn .
Shops ?
Snipped along with the leisure side - trips and melded instead with the save point system .
Access a save node in Final Fantasy XIII and you 'll have the option to browse themed shops that start with just a few simple items , cycling in more advanced stock as you progress .
Why cut that stuff ?
Because trawling for shallow chitchat and to identify weapon - armor - item stores is frankly -- hands over ears , hardcore fans -- down - tempo and disruptive .
As well , because Final Fantasy XIII 's major narrative plays out over a brief span in story - time .
Sandwich an entire world to explore between the major plot beats instead of toward the end and you compromise your ability to establish then maintain brisk pacing .
As such , Final Fantasy XIII looks less like a roleplaying game and more like a battle simulator than any of its predecessors .
In fact it probably has more in common with its ' Tactics ' series offshoot : Discrete battles linked by automatic narrative development .
Instead of turns , the battles play out in real - time , but the basic formula 's similar .
Brookfield , Connecticut ( CNN ) --
Ireland , one of the world 's most Catholic countries , has been reeling from the revelation that Catholic leaders there covered up child abuse , including sexual abuse , by priests for decades .
But not all of the victims were Irish .
The Emerald Isle exported many priests over the years .
And that 's how one of Ireland 's most prolific , known child abusers ended up in Rhode Island in the late 1960s .
Helen McGonigle was 6 when , she says , the Rev. Brendan Smyth fondled , raped and sodomized her .
She says she remembers him , dressed in white priest 's robes , at the back sliding glass door of her bedroom .
" All I wanted to do was to escape , to fly away .
There were little cubbies in my room -- a twin bed with a headboard that had little cubbies , " she remembers .
" I just wanted to be tiny enough to hide in those little cubbies so he could n't see me . "
McGonigle , now a 48 - year - old lawyer in Connecticut , says Smyth abused her , her sister and even her mother over a period of two years .
She believes the abuse drove her mother mad and drove her sister to suicide .
" My mom 's breakdown was caused by this .
There 's no question , " she said .
Her mother was found hysterical , half - naked , on her front lawn , screaming , " The pope owes me , " McGonigle remembered .
She was acting " like she was a rape trauma victim , " the lawyer said .
" I believe Smyth attacked her .
I believe that 's what caused her breakdown , " she said .
" You have to understand my mom was also a devout Catholic .
Her brother was a seminarian .
So for the same person to be on the front lawn saying , ' The pope owes me , ' she was really mad , " McGonigle said .
Brendan Smyth was ultimately convicted of dozens of counts of child abuse in the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland .
He died in prison in 1997 .
But his victims on two continents , like Helen McGonigle , are living reminders of the crimes of this pedophile priest at the center of a sex scandal in the Irish Catholic church .
By the time he reached Helen McGonigle and her family , this Irish priest had already abused dozens .
Records dating back to the 1950s show Smyth was moved from parish to parish : Ireland to Scotland to Wales to Northern Ireland to Rhode Island , back to Ireland , then to East Greenwich , Rhode Island , and Langdon , North Dakota -- each time under a cloud of suspicion , or worse , after a family came forward to report the priest was an abuser .
Helen McGonigle says Smyth tended to abuse children in the same family .
" That seems to be a common pattern , " she said .
But McGonigle was never able to get her sister to tell her about abuse by Smyth .
" She could n't handle it .
... I think she was asked by my mother not to say anything , " she said .
" I mean , this is something that she probably swore to my mom that she would never bring up . "
Helen 's sister , Kathleen , took her own life in 2005 .
McGonigle is now suing the Catholic Diocese of Providence , Rhode Island .
The church is already paying for her therapy .
She says six others from her parish have come forward to say they , too , were abused by Smyth , including one of her childhood friends , a neighbor .
What she wants most of all from the church , she says , is an apology for destroying her family -- and an acknowledgment that the church knowingly placed a pedophile into her parish .
So far , she says , she has received neither .
The Diocese of Providence has refused to comment , citing two pending lawsuits involving abuse allegations against Smyth .
Smyth 's superior in Ireland admitted that the diocese where the priest was sent in the United States was not told of his history of abuse .
Smyth was finally arrested in 1994 .
He was sent to an Irish prison , where he died of a heart attack .
History UVITOR : A New Paradigm in Transportation and Energy Mankind has long sought the most efficient means to transport people and cargo .
In this era of jet aircraft and space flight , the next step for mankind is to move beyond the nearest objects ( the moon , Mars , etc ) and to explore other planets , as well as to actually leave our solar system to examine other stellar entities .
To achieve this daunting goal , there must be a radical shift in the way we view the world and transportation .
Some of the most daunting challenges facing aerospace scientists are : to discover new propulsion methods which either eliminate or drastically reduce the need for propellant , to discover methods to achieve the shortest possible travel times and to discover new modes of on - board energy generation to power spacecraft .
It is with these challenges in mind that Dr. Gennady Shipov , a Russian physicist , and his team developed the 4 - D Warp Engine , a state of the art project for v-teleportation of a macro system .
The prototype of the 4 - D warp engine creates a twist and curve in space - time in front of itself and " falls " into it .
The theoretical foundation for this type of motion is called v-teleportation by vacuum metric engineering and operation of warp and the local space - time continuum .
Vacuum metric teleportation occurs when the vehicle / object teleports itself due to changes in the local space - time metric .
The system is both guided and monitored by computer software programs developed using Dr. Shipov 's pioneering equations .
Although it sounds like science fiction , this is the first step towards topological teleportation , when an object " falls " into a " wormhole " and appears in a different space - time point .
It is also an answer to the antigravity problem of space travel , as the engine is able to operate without the use of friction and with no interaction with any other medium .
A future project will target the development of a prototype that will be controlled and guided vertically .
In addition , this breakthrough technology is exciting not only because of its obvious advantage for space travel .
The principles discovered in this research can be universally applied to other types of vehicles , as well .
So , the 4 - D warp engine can be used to power conventional land vehicles , marine craft , etc .
Advantages of this type of propulsion include :
The ability to instantly change direction and speed
No breaks in the motion and no starter required
Movement is due to the control of the local properties of the space - time continuum
Movement occurs without reaction to friction or mass
Movement is more efficient than with conventional vehicles
Able to move in any media ( on land or water , under water , in the air or space )
Less fuel is used , an important consideration for long distance space travel
Increase in energy efficiency ( jet engine 2 - 10 % vs. 4 - D warp engine 40 - 60 % )
Increased speed and traveling distance
Less harmful impact on the environment
Decreased overall weight of the transportation system
The potential market for the 4 - D warp engine is quite extensive .
Potential customers include all segments of the aerospace industry , manufacturers of automobiles and other ground transportation , marine and submarine vehicles , as well as manufacturers of general industrial equipment .
The development of this revolutionary technology is at a critical stage .
There are currently working prototypes in the Uvitor laboratories in Bangkok which operate on a maximum frictionless surface or in water .
The results of experiments on the prototypes have been particularly encouraging .
However , there is still much to be done to bring this revolutionary method of transport to fruition .
What is needed now are investors , partners or financiers with foresight and courage , unique individuals or institutions who do not simply say " it ca n't be done " , but rather dream of what can be reality one day soon .
Remember , they all told the Wright brothers " it will never get off the ground " .
Background to the New Paradigm Imagining a car moving at 800-900 km/h and instantly changing direction without changing its velocity is not difficult for us today .
Hollywood and special effects have contributed to this .
We watch fantasy planes and spaceships in films and we are not surprised by their piloting skills and maneuverability , although such vehicles do not exist in reality .
Yet !
However , what is being built by the UVITOR scientists is shifting current technology to a new level : a propulsion system ( based on new principles ) to move physical objects without propellers , wheels , internal combustion engines or other external devices , and without reacting on any external media ( for example , propellers push the air back or wheels react with road surfaces ) .
Patents have been filed in Europe and Thailand for a self - action device .
Technologies today are developing at such speed people are not able to keep up with them .
Time is running faster than we are .
It is important not to lose a moment when opportunity appears to shift to a new level allowing a breakthrough in technological development .
Industry is open to positive innovations that are economical and simplify manufacturing processes .
The critical issue is to initiate the technological improvement .
Progress will not permit it to stop .
These new technologies generally become possible due to a small circle of likeminded friends , who share their ideas and efforts and are willing to invest their own time and money for the benefit of all humanity .
Marina Alexandrovna Lobova , Vice President of the Thai Russian Association of Technology and Economic Development , and Gennady Ivanovich Shipov along with his team of Russian scientists are such people .
Today , they have several patents and know - how that have no comparison : the 4 - dimensional wrap drive , the simplest rotator oscillator , and the 4 - dimensional engine generator , built by v-metric engineering .
These discoveries are based on new breakthroughs in fundamental physics .
At the end of the 60's , Shipov became interested in searching for a solution to the Unified Field Theory .
His former scientific supervisor , Professor Rem Victorovich Kholov warned that although he might discover something new in this field , he would be working the rest of his life to prove his position .
The theory of physical vacuum proposed by Shipov explained our world and its numerous manifestations with the help of formulas and strict scientific logic and offered a solution to the Program Minimum and Program Maximum of Albert Einstein .
Based on this theory , special structures ( torsion fields , created by the rotation of bodies ) were investigated and described .
It was found that these fields are not affected by distance and spread instantaneously in space .
Torsion fields interact with material objects by exchanging information .
Shipov and Lobova met in the mid 90's and the idea to initiate a project to investigate the 4 - dimensional engine was born .
This project opens new horizons in the creation of the next generation of automobiles and other means of transportation with reduced energy consumption , as well as higher speed and safety .
In 1999 , Lobova , with Shipov and 10 Russian scientists , established a research laboratory in Thailand .
Throughout 8 months of the following year , investigations and trials of several models of 4 - dimensional engines were successfully performed .
In 2002 , the Thai Russian Association for Technology and Economic Development was established .
Its purpose is to achieve understanding and cooperation between Russian and Thai scientists and businesspeople .
Within its framework , UVITOR ( Universal Vacuum Inertial Torsion Technologies ) was implemented .
The project has now reached the third stage of its development , where from the point of view of contemporary physics , the motion of the propulsion system looks as if it controls the sign and value of mass .
The next stage is to control mass in the vertical plane , thus enabling vertical takeoff .
UVITOR is working hard to optimize the model and increase its energy efficiency to 50 - 90 % .
In comparison , the energy efficiency of a rocket engine is about 2 % .
The scientific investigation has been joined by the State Space Scientific Production Center via the execution of a mutual agreement .
To implement and manage a project which leads to a revolutionary breakthrough in fundamental physics is difficult .
Complications arise due to the tradition mindset of conservative scientists around the world and the reaction of large transportation manufacturers .
However , the opinion of scientists should be based on truth and verifiability , and transport manufacturers must come to understand the necessity of such transportation systems and their inevitable entry into the marketplace .
The invention of the 4 - dimensional engine opens our vision into the future .
At the same time it revises 300 years of the history of science .
It takes Newton 's theory , the foundation of school textbooks , and expands it , adding new constants that differ from what we wrote in our notebooks .
However , this new paradigm does not reject the theory of the great scientist ; it only extends and enlarges it .
The Theory Eighty years ago Einstein proved that space - time is curved .
Now Russian physicist Gennady Shipov and his team have demonstrated that not only is space - time curved , it is also twisted and thus creates torsion .
Their results go beyond Newton 's three laws of mechanics and may necessitate a revision in the principles of physics .
Shipov predicted certain results , set up experimental protocols to test them , and developed software to conduct , measure , and report the process .
The results confirmed Shipov 's predictions and demonstrated that inertial mass and gravitational mass are neither equal nor the same .
An equal and opposite reaction is not a necessary result of the forces of inertia .
( Inertia : a property of matter by which it remains at rest or in uniform motion in the same straight line unless acted on by some external force . )
This factor makes motion much more efficient , since there is no resistance to overcome and velocity can be maintained or accelerated with a minimal input of energy .
Until now , little attention has been paid to the four forces of inertia : centrifugal , translational , rotational , and coriolis .
Shipov 's results indicate that vehicles propelled by inertial force can operate in any medium with 70 - 90 % energy efficiency and are ecologically friendly .
The research focused on " twisted " space - time , or torsion in space , as the propulsion source .
Shipov 's prototype ( a small vehicle without gears , propellers , or any emissions ) moves along the ground , on water , and when suspended in air .
With this motion , unlike conventional jet - propelled motion , inertial mass is not expended , degraded , or emitted ; it remains controlled by the local metric engineering of warp .
The experimental unit weighs 1.7 kg and has a traction force of 170 grams .
Controlled by the computer software through an attached cable ( in the future , it will be just a microchip ) , the test vehicle moves at a speed of 2 meters per 10 seconds ( 1.4k / h ) and can accelerate .
Calculations indicate that a vehicle weighing around 1.5 tons could travel 1000 meters ( 1 km ) in 4 seconds or 900 k/h. Shipov 's inertial force research and demonstrations point to the need to revise or supplement Newton 's three basic laws of mechanics .
The Theory of Physical Vacuum that underlies these demonstrations successfully explains phenomena of classical mechanics such as fields or forces of inertia created by the rotation , or torsion , of space .
Up to now , the primary thinkers on rotation have been Frenet , Ricci , and Cartan , who did not translate theory into practice .
Shipov 's work does .
Here is the concept : Objects fall because of curvature according to conventional Newtonian thinking .
" Torsion " would be a more accurate term to describe the phenomenon .
Shipov 's vehicle also moves by torsion .
But , it creates its own torsion .
The torsion is not derived externally .
A somewhat parallel phenomenon is a black hole in space .
The traction or pulling force , of such a vehicle relates to the topological properties of the space where it is located and to its non-holonomic ( open ) rotational coordinates .
The ability to control this kind of motion should lead to the development of vehicles that move in space , on the ground , on water , and underwater using the same engine and without propellers , emission of gasses or liquids , etc. Some Final Thoughts
If someone says that you are " empty " , believe him , because it 's true .
You , me , the table , the computer sitting on it , and the whole visible material world is emptiness .
Everything is made of vacuum .
Its energy gives birth to , penetrates , and feeds the whole world of existence .
Clever scientists know this , but only smile skeptically .
New representations of the nature of physical vacuum do not fit the picture of the world created by classical science .
But , the idea of the Great Emptiness , the Dao , was known in China 5000 years ago .
Today , this idea is promising a cataclysm in natural science , technology , and all spheres of life .
Along comes Shipov with his formulas .
His equations of physical vacuum explain and unite all types of interactions present in nature .
These formulas should help provide unexpectedly new and unusual answers in a number of areas - transport , communications , medicine , etc .
The solutions are so improbable that they are difficult to believe .
Why has Shipov so exasperated the strict , mistrustful scientific world ?
Even the subject of his research , " mysterious torsion fields " , is like a nail in the shoe of physicists , very inconvenient !
But , scientists today are recognizing that " spinning fields " really do exist .
Just as electromagnetic fields are caused by a charge and gravitational fields are caused by weight , torsion fields are created by any rotating objects .
This idea was first introduced by the French mathematician R. Cartan in 1913 , then by Einstein .
Within the framework of Cartan - Einstein theory , the existence of these fields has been permitted .
But , they are weak , cannot be observed , and seem to have no practical application .
Shipov states the opposite .
This is connected to his theory of physical vacuum and the " mysterious ether " Newton wrote about .
For the last 30 - 40 years , scientists have been trying to analyze the properties of physical vacuum , although from an electromagnetic or gravitational approach .
In our early school years , we were taught that the world consists of solid bodies , liquids , gases , and elementary particles .
Shipov states that these 4 levels form just the material world .
Contemporary physics is involved in the study of this particular world .
But , in micro - world research , this approach leads to a dead end .
Elementary particles must appear from somewhere .
What is their origin ?
It is obvious that there must be other levels .
The fifth level is the primary torsion field , with its unique properties .
For example , torsion fields do not have a property called velocity .
They occur in the universe simultaneously and penetrate everything .
And there are more levels : Primary vacuum ( occurring before torsion fields ) and Absolute Nothingness .
Everything begins from this " nothingness " and comes to an end in " nothingness " .
But , vacuum is not at all a " dead zone " , says Shipov .
It is similar to a " boiling broth " .
Particles are being born and dying instantly in it .
It is something like " pre-matter " or " the pre-condition of substance " .
It is not yet matter , but it already has a plan of how it ( matter ) will be arranged .
In all its variety , physical vacuum continuously influences both living and non-living matter .
Its hidden energy penetrates everything .
Any breakthrough in science or technology begins with doubts about the correctness of existing postulates … .
We believe that a major breakthrough in the way science views the world is clearly at hand .
The UK's Labour government , partnering with the Conservatives , yesterday pushed through the controversial Digital Economy bill over opposition from Liberal Democrats and some in its own party .
The bill allows the UK courts to order complete blocks on websites , it requires ISPs to start sending P2P warning letters from copyright holders , and it opens the door to throttling and Internet disconnection for repeat infringement .
As we discussed yesterday , the bill was moved quickly through the " wash - up " process that occurs at the end of a Parliamentary session .
Opponents and critics of the bill argued that such changes to the UK's Internet were too important to head through Commons after a couple hours of debate ; surely they could wait until after the election ?
Conservatives have been promising that , should they win the May 6 election , they will patch up any problem areas in the hastily passed bill .
This argument was blasted yesterday during the bill 's third reading , when one MP said ( read the debate transcript ) :
" I was rather taken aback yesterday to hear someone — I think it was the Conservative Front Bencher — say , ' Let 's just get this Bill through and if there 's anything wrong with it , we can put it right . '
Ten years into being here , I know that if we do things in a hurry and get them wrong , the law of unintended consequences always kicks in .
It would be far better to remove [ controversial ] clauses 11 to 18 and have a period of reflection . "
No such reflection was allowed .
The bill was voted on for the second time in two days , it passed Commons ( and previously passed the Lords ) , and now waits only for the automatic Royal Assent to become law .
The bill has at least prompted both Labour and Conservatives to pledge support for 2 M bps minimum broadband everywhere in the UK .
There is also a robust appeals process for those who want to contest copyright infringement notices ( though at their own expense ) .
That did n't appease the Open Rights Group , which today replaced its homepage with this :
Egyptian forces pumped gas into a cross - border tunnel used to smuggle goods into the Gaza Strip on Wednesday , killing four Palestinians , Hamas officials said .
Egypt has been under pressure to seal off the hundreds of tunnels that are a key economic lifeline for the blockaded Palestinian territory but which are also used to bring in weapons for the Islamic militant group .
Gaza - Egypt Border Light at the end of Gaza tunnel could be new car Reuters Israel wants to close down smuggling tunnels between Egypt and Gaza Strip , but tunnelers have become so good it 's now possible to drive a car through them , literally Light at the end of Gaza tunnel could be new car
Israel and Egypt have kept Gaza 's official border crossings closed since Hamas seized control of the coastal strip in 2007 from forces loyal to Western - backed Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas , who now only governs in the West Bank .
A Hamas security official in charge of the tunnel area along the border said the Egyptians filled the passage with some type of crowd dispersal gas .
He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to give his name .
The Hamas Interior Ministry later said in a statement the gas used to try to clear the tunnel was poisonous .
Besides those killed , six people were injured , it said .
" The Interior Ministry confirms that the citizens ' cause of death was the Egyptian security forces spraying poison gasses into one of the tunnels , " the statement said without elaborating .
A doctor at a hospital in the Gaza border town of Rafah , Hamdan Abu Latifa , said the dead smugglers suffocated .
An Egyptian border security official refused to comment Wednesday .
' Hold those responsible accountable '
Egyptian security forces have sprayed gas into tunnels before , according to Hamas officials and tunnel operators .
But Wednesday 's incident was the first time people have died as a result , they said .
A Hamas official demanded an explanation .
" This is a terrible crime committed by Egyptian security against simple Palestinian workers who were trying to earn their daily bread , " Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum to The Associated Press .
" It was a killing in cold blood .
Hamas and all the Palestinian people condemn it strongly . "
" We demand that Egypt explain its position about what is happening and investigate the circumstances of this terrible crime and show the truth to the entire world and hold those responsible accountable , " he said .
The United States and Israel have been pushing Egypt to do more to try to close the tunnels , which provide Hamas with a lifeline helping it to stay in power in Gaza .
Weapons and other contraband regularly move through the tunnels .
But the 1.5 million residents of the impoverished Gaza Strip also rely on the tunnels to bring in food and commercial goods like refrigerators and clothing .
Israeli aircraft have targeted the tunnels in bombing runs in the past , particularly during its military offensive against Gaza more than a year ago to stop daily rocket attacks .
Tunnel workers have also been killed when passageways accidentally collapsed .
Many of the tunnels , dug with electrical drills and running side by side under the border , are just high enough to enable workers to move on all fours .
Their entrances are covered by tents and they are equipped with motorized pulleys to haul goods and generator - powered lighting .
Palestinian officials in Rafah say Egypt has stepped up a crackdown on smuggling in recent months , blowing up numerous tunnel entrances on its side of the border , setting up checkpoints in the area and confiscating contraband .
Since December , Egypt has also been building an underground steel wall to block the tunnels .
Rafah officials have said about four miles ( six kilometers ) of that barrier — covering roughly half of the border area — is already complete .
The officials say the Egyptian measures have led to a sharp slowdown in tunnel traffic in recent months , pinching the local economy .
Imagine a world where you do n’t have to go through hundreds of books or lectures to attain knowledge , one where knowledge can be ‘ downloaded ’ to your brain from the internet .
Or imagine looking at the person next to you in the bus and seeing his name , address and background flash in front of you .
Most young people alive today will live to see a world of such wonders and more , according to Dave Evans , ‘ chief futurist ’ at networking firm Cisco ’s Internet business solutions group ( IBSG ) .
“ It ’s very nascent right now , but you could make a case for network - based telepathy .
If I can read your thoughts and encapsulate it into data packets of some sort and send it , then I can implant it in someone else ’s mind …
As we understand more and more how the brain works and we can read from and write to the brain directly , we would see a world in which we communicate in a very different way .
We would be able to ‘ download ’ knowledge directly from the network , ” Evans , ‘ present ’ in India through Cisco ’s ‘ Telepresence ’ application , said .
IBSG is Cisco ’s strategic consulting arm and Evans specialises in “ scanning the horizon for the next big thing ” in communications technology , to assist his clients with negotiating technological change .
“ Technological change over the coming two decades will be like an avalanche , ” Evans says .
“ It will hit over the next two decades and is quite destructive .
You can ride it or get crushed under it , ” he warns .
Evans intentionally tries to keep himself grounded , sprinkling his conversations with words like ‘ pragmatic ’ and ‘ skeptical ’ , but believes most people today have little anticipation of how human life will be transformed in the next 2 to 5 decades .
Simultaneous advances are happening in networking , computing and storage that will redefine how human beings live and do business .
“ Our children today do n’t know a world where the Internet did not exists .
The children of tomorrow will not know a world where , for all intends and purposes , unlimited computing did not exist , ” he says , pointing specifically to the death of ‘ Moore ’s law ’ that has governed the advancement of computing power over the last five decades .
Evans believes the conventional silicon - based computing model , where calculations are made by altering or ‘ flipping ’ transistors inside a silicon chip off and on , will be upended within a decade by quantum computing , which uses the quantum state of molecules for calculation .
Not only are molecules infinitely smaller than transistors , they can also hold multiple values instead of just ‘ off ’ and ‘ on ’ — massively increasing the number of unique ‘ states ’ or combinations a group of them can represent .
“ Take 5,000 planets the size of earth and cover them with traditional computers .
A molecule - sized quantum computer has the equivalent processing power , ” he says .
Assuming the human brain does 100 trillion calculations per second , “ by 2050 , a $ 1,000 computer will have the equivalent computing power of all the humans on the earth , ” he points out .
So , what can you do if you have near unlimited storage , networking and computing power ?
“ In the near term , the ability to fabricate objects through 3G printing is very viable .
Once it gets sophisticated , one can imagine downloading the recipe and fabricating the object through 3G printing , ” he points out .
The computing power and networks can be used to study the structure of the human being too , and recreate or fabricate a new one , he says .
As the brain - machine interfaces — currently very crude — achieve sophistication , brains would be able to communicate with each other without having to go through the sense organs such as the eye or the ear .
But before that would come ‘ augmented reality ’ , which feeds information from the network to our sense organs in real time .
For the eye , he says , it would first be through glasses and later through altered eye - lens or retina .
“ For example , when I look at you , I may see information about you - background , name etc. .
If you open up a book on the solar system , you could see them animations of planets revolving around in front of you .
You could literally bring the book to life ...
Currently , we have a 64 bit retina and we would improve the coming decade , ” he says .
For all that , however , VR glasses are yet to replace the computer monitors or movie theatres .
The reason ?
“ The fidelity of the experience has n’t been achieved yet ...
The secret is , therefore , significantly enhancing the fidelity of the experience and blending it seamlessly with the real ...
Within a decade , we would certainly see glasses with augmented reality on them . , ” he assures .
It seemed like a really good idea at the time
You know me , I like making people laugh .
As such , April Fools day is my unofficial holiday , where each year I pull some elaborate heist over a nearby friend , making an extremely trivial change that is extremely difficult to do , like swapping my friend ’s car from one side of the street to the other while he sleeps .
This year , I turned my brain towards a simple , yet massive prank :
In between the hours of midnight and five AM , I was going to move the WH PoS one moon to the left , then , send a corp mail saying “ har har i wuz spy and stole your iskies ” .
Plans were made .
I wrote the letter , made safespots to hold the ships and cargo , and sat patiently and waited for the day of reckoning .
Part A of the plan was to move all the ships , using the Orca or my handy ship command skills to move the ships , then the cargo , to the safe , which was about 15 AU off grid .
Part B was to use a blockade runner to unanchor the guns , then the empty corp hangar , then the PoS , re-anchoring it one moon to the left , anchor corp hangar n such , guns , send the mail and go off to sleep .
Predictably , things started to go horribly , horribly wrong around Part A and continued to fail explosively for the rest of the night .
At midnight , the American players in corp had gone to bed and the UK ones were not scheduled to wake up for another five hours , I started unanchoring the spare corp hangar while moving the ships from the maint bay to the safespot .
I managed most of the hulks , all the Gallente ships and all other ships that would fit into the maint bay of my Orca .
Then , the first problem of the night struck .
Raath ( maker of staticmapper.com , for all your WH static needs ) , had recently purchased a Falcon , intended for use in all things jamming and currently floating in space next to the maint bay .
This would normally not present a problem , since the falcon fits in the Orca ’s maint bay , but he had left a module in it .
For the uninformed , when a ship has a module in it it ca n’t be stuffed into a maintenence bay on another ship , and since I had n’t taken the five week training session on “ how to fly Caldari t2 cruisers ” , the ship was going nowhere .
While I was perfectly willing to leave Raath ’s Typhoon ( Minmatar Battleship ) floating in empty space for about twelve hours , a 100 mil Falcon hull was an entirely different story .
To leave the Falcon safe , I made a a plan to scan an exit , get a small tower in with an alt , have the alt put up the tower where the old tower was in the name of the altcorp while I put up the Caldari large tower on the one moon to the left .
I start scanning , find a C5 , which goes to a C6 .
Russians .
To make matters worse , Russians with two carriers , two dreads and various tech 2 ships , including a Vulture ( Caldari Command Ship ) , a ship whose skill training time is just under a third of a year .
To make matters even worse , ships were appearing and vanishing along with capsules , so they were active .
I drop sister probes , do a 32 AU scan and recall probes .
two sigs in system , I look at the size of the red sphere , look at the planets that it encapsulates , pick one on the edge , and warp to it , drop probes again , scan , wormhole .
Mindful of the fact that if WE saw scan probes in system , we would immediately close the connecting WH .
I pop into their static and look around .
Static C4 , end of lifetime , which means that I can’t risk getting an alt and tower in .
I speed back through to our C6 , get the Orca ( 250,000,000 kg ) and a calculator , and pass BS and Orca through until the WH goes critical .
Making the first smart choice all night , instead of blindly passing the Orca through , I move my scan alt into the connecting WH , then jump the Orca through .
Then watch , as the WH closes , leaving all of my alts on the wrong side of the WH , and no - one but me has the BM for where the ships are .
I web the orca through the Russian C6 ( noticing scan probes as I do so ) , flee through the end of lifetime C4 link and logoff he Orca , then start scanning the 35 sig system .
Literally , the last sig is the WH , C2 , highsec static , Orca gets out , Covops out .
After a string of cursing , I tear through the Russian WH and wake up a corp mate .
The corpmate , who logs in his Myrmidon ( Gallente Battlecruiser ) , says that he needs combat probes to scan out the 1.5 bil pile of ships .

Thankfully , someone with more foresight than me had put combat probes in the “ we ’re screwed ” container , which I had somehow missed in my initial “ move everything to the safe ” stage .
He finds the ships , gets them back to the PoS , and we all log at about …five in the morning .

OTHER EDIT : i made the tentacle add on pattern and here it is [ link ]
Miami , Florida ( CNN ) -- Former Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega was put on a plane to France on Monday after U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton signed extradition orders .
Clinton signed a surrender warrant , the last step making Noriega 's extradition possible , State Department spokesman Charles Luoma - Overstreet said .
France has been seeking to prosecute Noriega for allegedly using its banking system to launder drug money .
Noriega 's extradition came after he spent 20 years in a U.S. federal penitentiary in Miami , Florida .
Noriega was convicted in 1992 of cocaine trafficking , racketeering and money laundering .
His sentence ended 2 ½ years ago , and his next destination has been the subject of a court battle .
With U.S. marshals by his side and wearing handcuffs , Noriega shuffled his feet as he was escorted to the commercial Air France flight at Miami International Airport .
The move came as a shock to the Miami attorneys who have defended Noriega for more than 20 years .
" I would have hoped , if an order was signed , that the State Department would have the courtesy to respond to his lawyers and tell them an order was signed , " said Frank Rubino , Noriega 's criminal defense attorney .
" I'm in total shock they did this without the common courtesy of a phone call , " he added .
Noriega and his attorneys had argued that the United States was violating the Geneva Conventions by not sending him back to Panama , where he was seized by U.S. troops after the United States invaded Panama in 1989 .
U.S. federal courts repeatedly ruled against him .
His last shot had been an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court , which in January declined to hear his case .
U.S. forces removed the ex-dictator from office during Operation Nifty Package , the 1989 invasion of Panama .
Noriega had fled his offices and tried to seek sanctuary in the Vatican Embassy in Panama City .
U.S. troops set up large speakers around the compound , blaring music at all hours , a psychological ploy to rattle the general .
He surrendered January 3 , 1990 , and was quickly escorted to the United States for civilian trial .
After his drug conviction , Noriega was given POW status .
His federal sentence , originally for 30 years , ended in September 2007 after time off for good behavior .
In Panama , Noriega is wanted for the murder of a political rival .
Panama has requested his extradition , but the U.S. is honoring France 's request instead .
France has convicted Noriega in absentia of money laundering but has promised him a new trial .
While in U.S. custody , Noriega dealt with prostate cancer and had a stroke .
Last month , in an exclusive interview with CNN , Noriega 's grandson Jean - Manuel Beauchamp said that he had grown to admire his grandfather .
He was only 4 months old when the U.S. invaded Panama .
" When I was a kid , I did n't grow up knowing he was in prison .
I thought he was in school , " Beauchamp said .
" I 've spent quality time with him but not private time , " he said , alluding to prison security and the monitoring of conversations .
" He 's the smartest man I know .
He 's so friendly , outgoing , knowledgeable .
He 's always looking to teach or give advice .
The U.S. government has portrayed Noriega as the ultimate crooked cop , a man who was paid millions by the Medellin drug cartel in Colombia to protect cocaine and money shipments .
Panamanians remember him as a cruel dictator .
The thoughts I express here come from my experience working with scores of physicians as director of a physician wellness program , as well as 30 years experience in teaching and practice — both public and private -- in both medicine and psychiatry .
Like most of us , I ’ve had my share of challenges trying to get patients the care they need in the chaos of the current system .
I ’d like to start by sharing one of these experiences with you ( all details changed for confidentiality ) :
My heart went out to this patient when she first came to my office , with a severe depression caused by the unexpected death of her father .
This sweet and bright young woman was so distraught , she spent her sessions sobbing in the corner of my office couch , and so suicidal she required 24 - hour observation to keep her from jumping in front of a car or subway .
Realizing she needed urgent admission , I made several calls to her insurance company to let them know I was admitting her , and to make sure the hospital was in their network .
Fortunately it was , and this young woman had a hospitalization that not only saved her life , but turned it around — she is now thriving .
Unfortunately , her family is now facing what might be called " iatrogenic bankruptcy " as their insurance company — who never informed us of this requirement -- denied reimbursement for her expensive hospitalization on the grounds that it had not been properly preauthorized !
Sir William
Osler said that being a physician is a " noble calling " that " provides the greatest opportunity to exercise the mind and heart , " and I agree : even in these difficult times for our profession , it is still an incredible privilege to be someone ’s doctor .
However , given the challenges we are currently facing , it seems that fewer and fewer of us are actually able to experience these noble rewards .
There is good evidence that physicians across the country are experiencing a pervasive malaise .
For example , a 2002 study of physicians ’ satisfaction found that 87 % of the doctors surveyed felt morale had declined significantly in the last 5 years ; 58 % said that their own enthusiasm for practicing medicine had lessened ; and almost half said they would not recommend medicine as a profession .
We all know the problems : Mountains of paperwork , more and more patients in less and less time , and more time arguing with insurance representatives than working with our patients !
Often it is difficult to find time to do an adequate diagnostic interview , much less to build the relationships that are so important for maintaining trust and optimizing adherence .
Physician autonomy is compromised when every decision is second - guessed by 3rd party payers , and the much - trumpeted " patient choice " is meaningless when patients cannot choose their own doctor if he or she is not " in network , " and when longstanding doctor - patient relationships are ended abruptly because of the loss or change of insurance policies or jobs .
The average physician ’s office deals with over a dozen different insurance companies , and spends a great deal of time and money doing so .
A recent study found that the average physician spends 3 weeks per year dealing with health insurance related administration , and primary care physicians spend 1/3 of their total practice time doing so !
We all know and complain about these problems , but do we consider how many of them may be caused by our present healthcare system ?
I believe this system has a very detrimental impact — not only on our patients ’ health , but on all aspects of our practice .
It goes to the heart of how we feel about our work and ourselves and affects much of our day - to - day practice experience .
Here I ’d like to share another recent incident from my practice :
A middle - aged woman I cared for over 10 years needed an urgent detox admission , when her chronically excessive drinking got out of control after a devastating job loss .
At the time of admission she was not only on the brink of a prescription drug overdose , but was dangerously hypertensive and tachycardic from alcohol withdrawal .
The insurance company refused to cover her hospitalization on the grounds that it was not " medically necessary . "
She was discharged after 1 1/ 2 days , still emotionally and physically tremulous , to finish the detox alone in her apartment , with only a distant brother and myself to watch out for her .
Those of you who have seen patients through such situations — and much worse — will understand the anxiety and concern I felt for these patients and their families , as well as my intense frustration .
Certainly this is not how — or why — I learned to practice medicine : to stand helplessly by as unconcerned , self - interested insurers deny and limit care for needy patients , and undermine the relationships I have worked so hard to create !
And how do such experiences affect us ?
How do they affect our spiritual and emotional well - being ?
Our ethics ?
What can it mean for us doctors , who went into medicine to help people , to find ourselves participating — willingly or not — in a system that turns patients away because they can’t pay our fees ; or to watch our patients suffer and even die because they can’t afford insurance and / or needed healthcare ; as do approximately 45,000 Americans / year ?
Many commentators point to the presumed greed of health care providers in contributing to the costs and problems of our current system .
Perhaps , given the recent hijacking of our healing mission , it is not surprising that some of us turn to monetary rewards to replace the deeper rewards of our work that have gone missing .
In the June 9th issue of the New Yorker article , Dr. Atul Gawande explored how the medical culture of profit and self - interest in one Texas county has caused extreme overutilization of medical treatments and procedures , leading to the highest per capita medical costs in the nation and creating a culture of providers who seem to have lost sight of our healing mission .
Such trends , in contrast with the dedicated attempts of many providers to improve and reform healthcare , do represent , in Dr. Gawande ’s words , " a battle for the soul of medicine , " and a battle also for its future .
Dr. Gawande believes that this battle will be won by changing the culture of medicine itself .
While such cultural changes are clearly essential , in order to restore meaning and effectiveness to our work , it is also essential that we change the system by which health care is organized and paid for .
Some of our colleagues may be engaged in healthcare profiteering , but they contribute little to the overall costs of healthcare , and are vastly outnumbered by those of us who desperately want a system that allows us to provide good care for our patients and to believe in our work again .
What , then , would it be like to be part of a healthcare system that really worked , for our patients and ourselves ?
A system in which no patient is turned away because of inability to pay , or suffers pain or disability because they have inadequate to no health insurance ?
A system in which we have time to ask patients about what ’s going on in their lives , and how it ’s affecting their health .
How much more could we do with time and reimbursement for patient - centered services like a careful history to diagnose Mr. Jones ’s stomach distress , or counseling Ms. Smith about caring for her son ’s asthma ?
Imagine being able to do the operation your patient needs , not the one the insurance company will pay for .
Imagine never having to spend another minute on the phone fighting with an insurance company , or losing another patient because they no longer have a job or an insurance policy .
And finally , imagine coming back to our noble calling , and being the kind of doctor you really want to be .
A utopian vision ?
Perhaps .
But we physicians can bring it closer to reality by speaking out for our unique viewpoint .
A recent survey found that more than a third of physicians supported the " public option , " but how many of us have actually expressed our opinions publicly ?
Now is the time for us to speak out loudly and strongly for the healthcare system we and our patients desperately want and need .

As an academic with an interest in economic analysis , the downfall of the English teams in the Champions League this season did not surprise me , even while it disappointed me as a Manchester United fan .
Earlier this season , I was actually expecting that the English teams would “ under - perform ” in the competition , when set against general expectations , and now that United have followed Arsenal , Chelsea and Liverpool out of the Champions League , they have done so .
Except I would argue they did not actually under - perform ; they did what economic analysis suggested might happen .
The main reason I thought they could struggle is the downfall of the pound .
No doubt there will be intense debate now about “ the decline of the Premier League ” .
Obviously there is not one single reason for the present situation , but there is one major reason that has not , in my view , been given proper consideration : the pound has lost around 25 per cent of its value over the last two years .
Therefore the purchasing power of English clubs has decreased significantly .
To ensure the kind of dominance observed by top English clubs in the 2003 - 2009 period , the Premier League needs constantly to buy talent , the best talent , from all over Europe .
With the pound reaching peak values over the period 2001 - 2008 , and with the help of rich investors , English clubs have bought lavishly and have ruled the continent , broadly speaking .
But the pound has since fallen sharply ( see graph , left , courtesy of Wolfram| Alfa ) .
The pound was still at 1.30 euros to £ 1 in mid 2008 , ahead of the summer transfer window before the 2008 - 2009 season .
But with the pound flirting with euro parity in early 2009 , and at around 1.17 in mid 2009 , it is easy to see how some clubs could be hampered in last summer ’s transfer market .
Other contributing factors to lower spending by England ’s clubs include a lower than previous amount of investment by Roman Abramovich in his Chelsea team , the debt burdens at Liverpool and Manchester United , and the inflation in wages for top players , pushed partly by Manchester City ’s spending on players and pay under the regime of Sheik Mansour .
To put it simply , English clubs sold stars in 2009 , and bought fewer players themselves .
This was notable among the “ big four ” especially .
Look at key trades from last summer alone and you can see the big clubs were letting go more valuable ( better ) players than they were bringing in , not least at Manchester United ( Ronaldo , Tevez out ) , Arsenal ( Abdebayor , Toure out ) and Liverpool ( Alonso out ) .
At those three clubs there was net transfer income , not spending , while at Chelsea investment was at a much more reasonable level than in the middle of the decade when money was flowing freely .
We knew this at the start of the season , hence my hunch that English clubs would be likely to find opponents relatively tougher in Europe this season .
We can demonstrate how the Premier League ’s net spending in transfer windows in the current season is at its lowest for a decade .
I have taken the summaries of seasonal numbers in the table below from the transfermarkt .de website .
Also note that in the 2009 - 10 transfer market , the Premier League ’s ranking fell , for the first time in 10 years , from first place in terms of net spending in Europe , to third place , below the top division in Spain ’s La Liga and Germany ’s elite in the Bundesliga .
It may not be fully incidental that Arsenal and Manchester United fell in the Champions League to teams from precisely those two leagues .
The issue of exchanges rates and their effect on football has been sporadically raised in the British media , as in this Gabriele Marcotti piece in The Times last year , in this by Martin Caparrotta in The Sport Review , and on the BBC website last summer .
Interestingly , the same phenomenon as has happened in football has happened in rubgy union , with the weak pound provoking an exodus of top players towards France and Ireland , as these linked articles in The Telegraph and Daily Mail explore .
As a result , this season ’s European Cup results mirror those of the Champions League with , for the first time – if you exclude the period of the boycott of the competition by English teams – only one English team in the quarter - finals of the Heineken Cup .
For the three previous seasons , there were three English sides in the last eight , plus one finalist in 2008 - 09 and both finalists in 2006 - 07 .
As with football , exchange rates are not the only reason for this change ( there is no salary cap in French rugby ) , but the similarity between both situations goes beyond sheer coincidence and has it roots in common factors .
So it would be somewhat unfair to criticize English Premier League football teams and management for any decline in quality in the terms of Champions League performances .
The fall of the pound has an automatic negative effect on the purchasing power of the league .
If you add the staggering debts of top clubs , the will of the Uefa to cap spending on players as a function of clubs ’ turnover , and the Ofcom ruling on Sky ’s selling prices , it is a fair to bet to say that the following years wo n’t look like the 2003 - 2009 era .

U.S. Special Operations commandoes in February mistakenly killed five Afghans , including two pregnant women , and then tried to cover up their mistake .
An investigation by NATO ’s International Security Assistance Force ( ISAF ) determined that American and Afghan special forces arrived at the village of Khataba in Paktia province on February 12 , entered a residential compound , and opened fire on two men — a police officer and a local prosecutor — because “ they showed what appeared to be hostile intent by being armed , ” according to the investigation .
The two pregnant women , along with an 18 - year - old girl , were also killed by the gunfire .
Dozens of people had gathered at the home to celebrate the naming of newborn baby .
When they saw armed men on their property , they assumed the intruders were Taliban .
After the bungled raid , the Americans removed bullets from the dead bodies and cleaned the wounds with alcohol as part of their cover up .
The Special Forces then lied to their superiors , claiming they found the women already dead when they entered Khataba .
Mohammed Tahir , the father of the 18 - year - old girl , told the Times of London , “ The foreigners are always talking about human rights .
But they do n’t care about human rights ,
They teach us human rights , then they kill a load of civilians .
They did n’t come here to end terrorism .
They are terrorists . ”
“ We deeply regret the outcome of this operation , accept responsibility for our actions that night , and know that this loss will be felt forever by the families , ” said Brigadier General Eric Tremblay , an ISAF spokesperson , in a prepared statement .
“ The force went to the compound based on reliable information in search of a Taliban insurgent and believed that the two men posed a threat to their personal safety .
We now understand that the men killed were only trying to protect their families . ”

[ pictured : children murdered by the U.S. government during the Waco Massacre ]

19 Apr 2010 | LRC
Seventeen years ago , on April 19 , 1993 , the F.B.I. finished off its siege of the Branch Davidians ’ home just outside Waco , Texas , by pumping poisonous and flammable C.S. gas into a room filled with women and children , driving a tank through the wall , throwing incendiary devices at the survivors and , most likely , spraying them with machine gun fire .
The conflagration that engulfed the lives of seventy - six people of diverse international and ethnic backgrounds and of all ages , who had been brought together under the fringe but peaceful religious separatism of David Koresh , came at the end of a 51 - day standoff that began when the A.T.F. bungled a public - relations stunt in the form of an aggressive raid of the Davidian home , which had been practiced on life - size model buildings and whose planning began in the lame - duck years of the first Bush administration .
Koresh could have easily been arrested without all this fanfare and violence — he was an integrated member of the town , and law enforcement had visited the Davidian home and even fired weapons with him at their shooting range — but the A.T.F. had made sure the press would be there to witness their chivalrous swooping in and capture of this menace of Mt. Carmel .
Meth lab !
Weapons stockpiles !
Child molesters !
The excuses for this federal militarism in the heart of Texas were numerous and shifting .
But when it was all done , a peaceful American community had been utterly destroyed by the U.S. government .
It was an event that crystallized and radicalized populist rightwing anger at the Clinton administration .
The left , for the most part , stood by the federal government , swallowed its propaganda about how the Davidians killed themselves , had been a threat to the community , were stockpiling illegal weapons and harboring child abuse .
At the White House press conference , journalists applauded the regime .
Liberals mocked the religious nuts and began stoking fears that such extremists were not the last .
They were thankful to be “ protected ” by the F.B.I .
Only the most anti-establishment leftists joined the populist right and radical libertarians in their denunciation of this act of governmental mass murder .
As bad as mainstream attitudes toward Waco were in the immediate aftermath , the popular meaning of the massacre was fully inverted through the Oklahoma City incident exactly two years later , on April 19 , 1995 .
This act of mass murder was blamed on rightwing and anti-government extremism , and even on the more moderate anti-Clintonianism of Rush Limbaugh , who himself declared publicly his solidarity with Clinton in bringing the Oklahoma killers to justice .
( Just recently , Slick Willy raised concerns that the Tea Parties would breed more Timothy McVeighs . )
As for the facts that McVeigh was trained by the government , served the U.S. in the Gulf War , and described the Oklahoma attack as revenge for Waco — this was twisted into a retroactive vindication of the government ’s behavior at Waco .
As with the blowback explanation of 9/11 , the blowback explanation of Oklahoma City with the corollary that U.S. government violence leads to violence at home never got a serious hearing .
On the contrary , post - Oklahoma , sympathy for the Branch Davidians became increasingly perceived as sympathy for McVeigh ’s cause .
What emerged in the mid- and late - nineties was a narrative of hysteria and paranoia that the populist right , the patriot movement , anti-New World Order types , so - called “ hate groups , ” and the nation ’s diffuse array of militia were all part of a rightwing conspiracy to bring down the U.S. government , and only federal police agencies , the rigorous liberal domestic interventionism of the Democratic Party , and a new era of political correctness engineered by our socially balanced rulers stood between order and chaos .
This narrative worked in dampening the right ’s dissent .
While the Contract with America was a Republican scam whose failure could be pinned on the G.O.P. , the anti-Clinton radicalism behind the 1993 resistance to Hillarycare and anger about Waco were most completely neutralized by the militia hysteria that conflated David Koresh with Timothy McVeigh and conservative dissent with anti-American terrorism .
This narrative was suspended during the Bush II era , when the main terrorist threat was seen as coming from abroad , and the Republican administration was busy erecting a 21st century national security state and launching two aggressive wars of occupation purportedly to keep Americans safe from a boogeyman even worse than McVeigh — a boogeyman with an alien culture , plans to conquer America in the name of Islam or kill thousands or more in the attempt to do so , and turn back the clock a millennium .
For a few years the left dissented , at times heroically , viewing the conservative wing of America as a danger insofar as it wielded power , not insofar as it protested government .
This meant the left ’s critiques were far more trenchant and correct than in the 1990 ’s , but at the same time Bushian violence was mostly opposed in the context of respectable public policy disagreements .
Most left - liberals saw Bush ’s Iraq war as a disaster , but would not dare put U.S. wars on the same moral plane as the acts of 9/11 or Oklahoma City .
There were exceptions .
On the fringes of the left , there were grand denunciations of Bush as a fascist , a Nazi , a war criminal .
Images at antiwar protests depicted the president with a Hitler mustache .
Those on the far left compared Bush to the most despised of all totalitarians , and the center left brushed off this radical rhetoric as harmless and in the spirit of dissent , the highest form of patriotism .
But these radicals were exceptions .
In any event , most of the left failed to be permanently radicalized in the Bush years .
Waco had been mostly forgotten , and progressives could not be bothered to rethink what they thought they knew about their beloved federal government .
They knew they hated Bush , but most Democratic voters would never come to revise their understanding of Clinton ’s wars and domestic depredations , or see the Bush term as just a particularly egregious installment in a long series of murderous and authoritarian presidencies — a line of would - be dictators that included most of the left ’s favorite modern statesmen from Harry Truman to Lyndon Johnson .
In September 2005 , the Bush administration ’s response to Katrina taught the leftwing dissidents all the wrong lessons .
Instead of reacting in horror to the martial law , the gun confiscations , the use of FEMA and military personnel back from Iraq to tame the people of New Orleans , seeing these as dangerous precedents for the creation of a police state , the respectable left adopted the universal critique that Bush was not doing enough .
The government was too laissez - faire .
As always , the problem with Republican rule was that it was insufficiently activist — even at the height of an administration that amassed so much power in Washington , unleashed terror upon two Muslim societies , murdered hundreds of thousands of people , and penetrated one traditional constraint upon government after another , we were all supposed to hate Bush mostly because he was too anti-government .
The failure of the left to learn the obvious lessons from the Bush experience — the Actonian axiom that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely — has contributed to the peculiar political dynamic and maddening hypocrisy we see now that the Brown Scare is coming back , perhaps worse than it was in Clinton ’s time or even in F.D.R.’s , when the president had a long list of political enemies compiled for purposes of imprisoning them if the right circumstances arose .
It is increasingly often that one mainstream news outlet or another builds on the narrative that the fabric of America is being threatened by out - of - power rightwing extremists .
This narrative thrives through the conflation of varying strains of anti-establishment thought and activity , all bundled together to paint a picture of American Brown Shirts conspiring not to erect the modern activist central state , as the Nazis had done , but do tear it down .
This hysteria is partisan , and so it is directed against relatively mainstream Republicans , the odd loose - cannon killer motivated by extremism or racism , normal Americans who fear for their country ’s economic health under a conspicuously active presidency , and everyone in between who is not ecstatic about Obama ’s policies .
How is the conflation of anti-government sentiment and actual violence , including against the innocent , achieved ?
A contribution from Salon.com to the new Brown Scare , entitled “ A history of anti-government rage and violence ” and providing an eerie slideshow of anti-government extremism , is fairly typical .
Opposition to Obama ’s health care plan is shown to be part of a menacing historical pattern of resistance to the U.S. government — the slideshow includes the Whiskey Rebellion ; the New York Draft Riots ; opposition to Reconstruction , Integration and Social Security ; anti-JFK animosity and the Davidians ’ resistance Waco .
Some of these events involved violence , others simply peaceful political opposition , but all of it is missing its crucial context — a government at least as belligerent as those standing in dissent .
Not that all of it is benign : the Draft Riots , for example , involved violence against the innocent — but so did the draft itself and the way Lincoln militarily pacified the rioters .
This part of the story is dropped .
In portraying the government in these conflicts as the embodiment of social order , progress , racial harmony , economic fairness and national unity , critics of a government takeover of medicine are practically called out as enemies of all that is good in modern society .
Quite tellingly , the Vietnam war protesters are also included in this picturesque story of nefarious anti-government agitation .
Even the progressive left ’s greatest anti-government cause of the last several generations , the 1960 ’s antiwar movement , is in the crosshairs of the liberal media ’s pro-government depiction of American history as a struggle between the mainstream state and the peripheral Americans who oppose it .
It is again gauche to suggest that the U.S. government is a serious threat to our liberty .
While the left at times appropriately condemned Bush ’s warmaking , warrantless wiretapping , violations of habeas corpus and flouting of due process , the left has now become resigned to the precise policies being carried out by their hero Barack Obama .
Just as important , they have forgotten what it meant to be more afraid of their government than of their fellow Americans upset about that government .
All this Bush - era despotism continues unabated , but now it is seen as unseemly , unpatriotic , hateful , and even criminal to suggest that the U.S. government has authoritarian practices and totalitarian designs .
When Sarah Palin was taken to the woodshed for suggesting that the government might create “ death panels ” to ration health care to the elderly , the implication was that the mere concern about such a possibility was motivated by hatred or dishonesty .
But we all knew that in the quasi - private health care sector , decisions of life and death are already decided by medical boards at hospital boards and insurance companies .
If the government becomes even more involved in determining the allocation of resources , of course something like government death panels will be a likely result .
But more strikingly , the very same institution that massacred the Branch Davidians under Clinton , slaughtered innocent Iraqis and Afghans under Bush , and now , under Obama , claims the prerogative to execute American citizens by fiat , is somehow seen on the left as such an unambiguous guardian of health and American well - being so that to insinuate its propensity to let Americans die is an act of sedition .
Sarah Palin ’s sins go beyond her concern about Obamacare — and for the most part , they are not her unmitigated neocon warmongering , corporatist economic prescriptions or disregard for the Bill of Rights .
What she is most attacked for is not being sufficiently in love with leviathan .
During the presidential election , she was lambasted for her foreign policy ignorance but she was feared more for her husband ’s connection to secessionists .
Had her partisan opponents ever genuinely wanted to rein in the American empire , surely secessionist sentiment would be welcomed , or at least tolerated , as an acceptable disposition .
And in the hatred of secessionism , of the ideas of nullification and political decentralism , we see the ugly nationalism of the politically correct left .
Even constitutional talk of the Tenth Amendment makes one a “ Tenther ” — on par with a 9/11 Truther or Birther — as though the notion that the Tenth Amendment has some teeth and might , by some reasonable interpretation , preclude at least some of the left - liberal program , is not worth seriously refuting — as though there is something cultish and insidious about believing that the federalism of the Framers is not the national supremacism of today .
The federal government is an eternal institution , apparently , and Sarah Palin has associated with too many folks who question its legitimacy .
Glenn Beck , too , is primarily hated for his questioning the authority of the federal government — not his many past calls for foreign war and nationalism , but for his current failure to accept government ’s slow war on the American people .
For most of the left , the palatable Republican personality is someone like Lindsey Graham , who despite being a neocon on war is also pro–Cap and Trade and in favor of moderate domestic socialism .
Graham has not been accused of hatemongering or threatening the tranquility of our great land , even as he pushes for new executive powers to detain American citizens indefinitely .
Hating welfare , global warming alarmism , gun control and ACORN are the worst transgressions against respectability .
You can crazily favor war with Iran — as increasing numbers of progressives seem to — and still be in the community of official opinion , but if you harbor too much fear and distrust toward FEMA , you might as well be locked up in an asylum .
The Tea Parties have been dragged through the mud because some of their members dress up like colonial - era Americans , protest the census and go so far as to compare Obama to Hitler .
But I was at several antiwar marches in 2003 , and the radicalism on the left was just as ostentatious and , from my point of view , appreciated .
Leftist radicals would perform street theater , covering themselves with fake blood , holding up images of Bush in precisely the unflattering light in which discontented populists now portray Obama , and in some heroic cases even pleading their fellow Americans to protest war taxes .
But now it is considered insane , if not dangerous , to question the census , the Department of Homeland Security or other worshiped secular institutions .
On “ The Daily Show with Jon Stewart , ” a number of census opponents were brought on a panel and ridiculed .
One of them was an Arab - American concerned with the privacy rights of his people , and his concerns were brushed off in a rude joke — despite the collusion between the Census Bureau and Homeland Security post - 9/11 to share data on Arab - Americans .
The conservatives were mocked for talking like middle - Americans .
The fact that the census was used to round up Japanese - Americans was brought up and met with laughter by the audience .
I bet at least a few were thinking , “ Obama would never round people up like the U.S. did to the Japanese — he ’s a good progressive Democrat , like Franklin Roosevelt ! ”
Sarah Palin , Glenn Beck , Republican talk radio , the Tea Party movement and other relatively mainstream voices of Obama opposition do not comprise all the targets in the establishment ’s new Brown Scare .
They , especially the Tea Parties , are meant to be chilled into silence and complacency or marginalized — but the ammunition used by the new war on right - wing dissent comes from the weaving together of a narrative that depicts the right - wing as most perilous when it is out of power .
Since the release of the MIAC report last year and a number of unrelated incidents , the liberal media have been thrilled to create an image of disenfranchised rightwing anti-government hatred on the brink of boiling over and doing great harm to our country .
When abortionist George Tiller was murdered and then James von Brunn murdered a guard at the Holocaust museum , a hysterical Rachel Maddow went on the air and tried to create a connection where there was none .
Like Saddam Hussein , Osama bin Laden and the Pakistani who runs the nearby convenience store , all menacing figures are brought together in an imagined conspiracy against the established order .
The Hutaree militia set - up , wherein a group of people too small for two poker tables was accused of planning violence against police and using “ weapons of mass destruction ” to bring down the U.S. government , was met not with suspicion or even laughter , but serious concern on N.P.R. , on Rachel Maddow , in the center - left imagination of a future in which police and social workers protect us from the chaotic violence of nine people in Michigan .
Such journalists scrambled to show a connection with racist groups , only to determine there was none .
But the idea of anti-government racists killing police is at the center of their worries now — not the police tasing and arresting innocent Americans every day and occasionally killing people , much less foreign policy .
Just as rap songs about killing cops scared conservatives out of their wits in the 1990 ’s , the ravings of some marginal Americans in the woods who had been infiltrated by the F.B.I. are the new social epidemic worrying the left , worthy of censorship and a stern government response .
The government is now the most persecuted victim group – worthy of far more advocates in journalism than the Muslim children being liquidated by U.S. remote - control robots every day .
A new report from the Southern Poverty Law Center ( S.P.L.C. ) , which under Democratic regimes becomes a virtual arm of the state , targets the new “ patriots ” and enablers of the “ anti- government ” extremist movement .
Much of the list is predictably absurd .
Michelle Bachmann is attacked for opposing the census , telling the truth about how it was used in World War II , and having skepticism toward AmeriCorp .
“ Somewhere , Joseph McCarthy must be smiling , ” the document says , and I agree .
His spirit is smiling at the efforts to malign all in political life who subscribe to something even more subversive than Communism — any notion that U.S. political power ought to be limited .
Glenn
Beck is also targeted , and the criticisms are not even coherent — for example , “ he delivered the keynote address to 10,000 right - wing activists who attended the Conservative Political Action Conference . ”
Oh no !
Joseph Farah is smeared because he questioned the official story behind Vince Foster ’s death .
The president of the John Birch Society is attacked because , like all good Birchers , he hates socialism and fears it is in America ’s future .
Libertarian and other anti-government activists are targeted in the new S.P.L.C. blacklist , including a man who legally carried a rifle to some political protest ( and who unsettlingly points out that Obama has killed more people than he has ) , and Sheriff Mack , who dares to say law enforcers should not enforce unjust , illegal laws and that the I.R.S. should be abolished .
But most absurd of all is the S.P.L.C. ’s attacks on Judge Andrew Napolitano and Ron Paul .
The judge , a principled libertarian who opposed all of Bush ’s lawless power - grabs and acts of foreign empire - building and who consistently applies the same critiques to Obama , is targeted for believing the federal government should be at least 2/3 smaller than it is now and supporting the rights of states to secede .
The most substantive criticism of Ron Paul , the most principled , least partisan and most dedicated to non-violence and tolerance of all the members of Congress , is that he believes that taxation is immoral , the U.S. should withdraw from the U.N. and the Fed is crooked .
The only thing most , although not all , of the people branded as enablers of or participants in rightwing extremism agree on is that they oppose the current U.S. government and believe tyranny is possible and perhaps impending in America .
For this they are smeared and all attempts are made to chill their dissent .
Some would call the fear of crackdowns on dissent itself a form of rightwing paranoia , but when establishment liberals happily talk about prosecuting people for “ seditious conspiracy ” and creating speech codes , there is plenty to be legitimately concerned about .
Further , many of the concerns of the extremist rightwing , the patriots , the anti-government populist movement , the Tea Parties and even inconsistent statists like Glenn Beck are not off - base .
And the most disenfranchised and least respectable of the voices are often the ones who stumble upon something resembling the truth .
Seventeen years ago in 1993 , the federal government did in fact murder dozens of Americans who were no threat to anyone .
The same government has in fact violated the rights of American citizens , rounded people into concentration camps , silenced and infiltrated politically peaceful groups , conspired against the people in numerous ways , drugged , poisoned and withheld medicine from Americans without their knowing , lied repeatedly about war and serious law enforcement matters , jailed people without due process , imposed martial law on segments of the domestic population , seized guns from law - abiding gunowners , broken down American doors and held scared children at gunpoint , planned the creation of extralegal judicial institutions to process American citizens , targeted political enemies with the I.R.S. and other police agencies , forced Americans to labor and even kill and die under threat of imprisonment , overseen the largest prison system in the world , shoveled trillions of borrowed dollars to corrupt financial institutions and killed millions of civilians abroad — all in the lifetime of many who are still alive .
The U.S. police state has in fact been growing since 9/11 and even before — and Obama has done nothing to stem its growth .
On the contrary , he has continued the mix of economic fascism , imperialism , surveillance and lawless detention policy that characterized the Bush years .
Indeed , the most dangerous rightwing extremist in my lifetime was George W. Bush .
Obama is following in his footsteps .
That so many Americans are more frightened of rightwingers out of power than in power — more bothered by conservatives who hate Washington than those who control or want to control it — and more offended by anti-government rhetoric than the Democratic president continuing the policies they claimed to hate under Republican rule — shows how little they have learned from Waco and all that has happened since .

Apple 's move to ban Adobe 's Flash - to - iPhone compiler elicited shrugs from Adobe and complaints from Adobe loyalists .
Digging deeper into the OS reveals another , albeit less dramatic slight : Apple scrubbed Google 's name from the new OS 's Safari search button .

The iPad has the generic " search " button as well , and the Safari settings allow users to choose between Google or Yahoo ! as their default search engines .
The text in the search box at the top of the screen changes to read either " Google " or " Yahoo ! , " depending on which is selected , but the soft keyboard 's search button does not bear any site 's name .

Of course , stripping Google 's name from the search does n't come as much of a surprise to anyone who 's been following the increasingly heated rivalry between the two companies , and disassociating iDevices with Google search could be step towards adopting Bing as the default iPhone search engine down the line .

While it makes sense for Apple to have a generic button as they move to a system with multiple search options , it also makes sense that they'd want to remove the most prominent instance of their rival 's brand name from their OS .
Sources have reported Google paying Apple as much as $ 100 m a year in their search agreement , and though the terms of such an agreement are unknown , it seems likely that at some point they involved the iPhone keyboard bearing Google 's name .
It 's anyone 's guess as to whether Google did n't want to pony up what Apple was requesting for search exclusivity or if Apple pushed them out of an exclusivity agreement going forward .

This is n't the only way the rivalry has manifested itself this week .
iAd , Apple 's new mobile advertising platform , is Apple 's attempt to beat Google to the lucrative mobile advertising space , and many people have read Steve Jobs ' repeated call for " emotional " mobile ads as a remark on Google 's decidedly unemotional search ads .

So while Google will still likely be performing your iPhone 's searches ( for now ) , Apple is n't going to go out of its way to remind you of the fact .
For all of the changes in iPhone OS 4 , Apple 's slights of Adobe and Google make it clear that they want people to understand one thing very clearly : iPhone OS is theirs and theirs alone .

Carbon dioxide is " essentially harmless " to human beings and good for plants .
So now will you stop worrying about global warming ?
Utah 's House of Representatives apparently has at least .
Officially the most Republican state in America , its political masters have adopted a resolution condemning " climate alarmists " , and disputing any scientific basis for global warming .
The measure , which passed by 56 - 17 , has no legal force , though it was predictably claimed by climate change sceptics as a great victory in the wake of the controversy caused by a mistake over Himalayan glaciers in the UN 's landmark report on global warming .
But it does offer a view of state politicians ' concerns in Utah which is a major oil and coal producing state .
The original version of the bill dismissed climate science as a " well organised and ongoing effort to manipulate and incorporate " tricks " related to global temperature data in order to produce a global warming outcome " .
It accused those seeking action on climate change of riding a " gravy train " and their efforts would " ultimately lock billions of human beings into long - term poverty " .
In the heat of the debate , the representative Mike Noel said environmentalists were part of a vast conspiracy to destroy the American way of life and control world population through forced sterilisation and abortion .
By the time the final version of the bill came to a vote , cooler heads apparently prevailed .
The bill dropped the word " conspiracy " , and described climate science as " questionable " rather than " flawed " .
However , it insisted – against all evidence – that the hockey stick graph of changing temperatures was discredited .
It also called on the federal government 's Environmental Protection Agency to order an immediate halt in its moves to regulate greenhouse gas emissions " until a full and independent investigation of climate data and global warming science can be substantiated " .
As Noel explained : " Sometimes ... we need to have the courage to do nothing . "
" I think it is unavoidable for any party whatever the outcome .
You can not now duck the fact that we have an electoral system which is completely out of step with the aspirations and hopes of millions of British people , " he said .
The Future of Renewables ?
Germany 's First Offshore Wind Farm Goes Online
Germany 's energy supply is on the verge of an important turning point .
Over the coming months and years , German utility giants plan to build massive offshore wind farms that are expected to produce huge amounts of green energy .
The first such wind farm went online this week .
Campaigners say conditions in Blikkiesdorp or ' Tin Can Town ' are worse than in the townships created during apartheid
Children squint as wind whips the grey sand into their faces .
A teenager braves the flies and stench of a leaking outdoor toilet to draw water from a standpipe .
He stares vacantly along regimented rows of corrugated iron shacks encircled by a tall , concrete fence .
No grass or trees grow here .
This is Tin Can Town , or Blikkiesdorp , described by the mayor of Cape Town as a " temporary relocation area " ( TRA ) , but by its residents as a concentration camp .
Many say they were forcibly evicted from their former homes and moved here against their will .
And for this they blame one thing : the football World Cup .
" It 's a dumping place , " said Jane Roberts , who lives in the sparsely furnished structure known as M49 .
" They took people from the streets because they do n't want them in the city for the World Cup .
Now we are living in a concentration camp . "
Roberts , 54 , added : " It 's like the devil runs this place .
We have no freedom .
The police come at night and beat adults and children .
South Africa is n't showing the world what it 's doing to its people .
It only shows the World Cup . "
President Jacob Zuma 's government insists that sport 's biggest showpiece is already benefiting the whole nation , creating jobs , improving infrastructure and transforming its image abroad .
It has lavished some R13bn ( £ 1.15 bn ) on world - class venues , with none more breathtaking than the Cape Town Stadium that will host England in June .
Yet a short drive from the city 's expensively upgraded airport , a drive few tourists are likely to make , boys kick up dust and stones in Blikkiesdorp because the spending spree failed to provide them with a park .
Campaigners argue that this bleak place in Delft township shows that Africa 's first World Cup has become a tool to impress wealthy foreigners at the expense of its own impoverished people .
Residents say it is worse than the townships created by the white minority government before the end of racial apartheid in 1994 .
In view of cloud - capped mountains , Blikkiesdorp was built in 2008 for an estimated R32 m ( £ 2.9 m ) to provide " emergency housing " for about 650 people who had been illegally occupying buildings .
To visitors , the column after column of one - room shacks , each spraypainted with a designated code number , are disturbingly reminiscent of District 9 , last year 's hit science fiction film about space aliens forced to live in an informal Johannesburg settlement .
Residents said this week there were about 15,000 people struggling to live in about 3,000 of the wood and iron structures , with more arriving all the time .
City officials claimed these figures were inaccurate but said the site was designed to cater for 1,667 families in total .
In some cases families of six or seven people are crammed into living spaces of three by six metres .
They complain that the corrugated walls swelter in summer temperatures of 40C and offer little protection from the cold in winter .
Tuberculosis and HIV are rife .
Babies have been born at Blikkiesdorp and , still unknown to the state , officially do not exist .
Brutality
The shacks are laid out in strict lines with little room for individual homemaking , though some residents have tried to build extensions , gardens and informal convenience stores , often protected by barbed wire .
Above them loom poles with lighting and power cables that give the residents electricity .
But between the shacks there is no paving , only roaming dogs , scraps of rubbish and grey sand that swirls in the wind .
There are no shower facilities and the standpipe taps lack bowls , so water tends to leak into the ground and under people 's homes .
Toilets are found inside grim concrete cubicles so small the locked door presses against the user 's knees .
Many have leaking roofs and are broken despite repeated promises to fix them .
Sandy Rossouw says she was among 366 people evicted from the Spes Bona Hostel in the district of Athlone three months ago because a stadium there is to be used for training by some of football 's biggest stars .
She is now one of five family members who squeeze into one bed in her shack at Blikkiesdorp .
" We were forced out of our hostel because of the World Cup , " Rossouw said .
" The hostel is on the main road to the stadium , only about 200 yards away .
We did n't want to move because we 're used to it and it 's close to everything .
But they said if we did n't get out , they would move us out with law enforcement .
" Here the whole place is under starvation .
We can't even afford to make a pot of soup for our children .
We send them to school without bread .
People sell everything to get food and walk three hours to Athlone just to get a loaf of bread .
When you do eat , there is sand in your food – you can feel it on your teeth .
" We were promised in January the toilets would be repaired but they 're not .
You 've got eight families to a toilet and it's unhygienic . "
Rossouw , 42 , is among several residents who accuse the police of brutality .
" It 's like a jail , like a concentration camp , " she continued .
" If you 're not inside at night , the police beat you .
A few weeks ago they pointed an R5 rifle as if they were going to shoot people .
They swore at us : ' This is n't fucking Athlone .
You should go back to your place . ' "
She argues that the fanfare around a month - long football tournament is hypocritical when people are going hungry .
" I think they must cancel the World Cup because people are starving .
They are renovating buildings in Cape Town for half a billion rand ; why can't they spend that money here ?
It breaks my heart .
" When rich people come to the World Cup they must come to Blikkiesdorp first to see for themselves how people are living .
It 's worse than apartheid . "
Among those suffering is Fatima Booysen , 40 , who has lived in shack J22 with her husband , Abraham , and two daughters for more than a year .
She said : " I can't shop , the rain is coming in , the child is sick .
A lot of people have got TB now .
" It 's very cold in winter .
When you stand up in the morning you feel frozen , you can't feel your hands or feet .
" The children do n't want to go to school .
I 've got a one - year - old grandchild who 's sick today and has gone to hospital . "
Residents say that unemployment is high and a lack of postal deliveries or official addresses makes it hard to find work .
They also criticise their remote location , which requires them to pay for minibus taxis to the city , and say that children have been killed in accidents on Blikkiesdorp 's thoroughfares and when crossing a nearby motorway .
Crime is said to be high , with drug gangs moving into unused shacks , but the police offer little relief .
Court action
Badronessa Morris , 47 , complained : " The police treat us like animals .
They swear at us , pepper spray us , search us in public , even children .
At 10 o'clock you must be inside : the police come and tell you to go into your place and turn down the music .
In my old home we used to sit outside all night with the fire . "
Morris was among families evicted from an informal settlement on the Symphony Way road .
" We were one happy family on Symphony Way .
Now we 've moved to Blikkiesdorp it 's like we 're in chains , fighting each other , putting each other in jail .
" I know we were moved because of the World Cup .
They do n't want people to see shacks on the road in South Africa .
They want everything perfect for the World Cup . "
Other people have gone to court to resist a possible move to Blikkiesdorp .
Last December five families living near the Athlone stadium were told their homes would be demolished to make way for a car park .
Llewellyn Wilters , 52 , who has lived in his house for seven years , said : " I took a drive to Blikkiesdorp to check it out and do n't think it 's going to work .
How are we going to take the kids to school and get to work ? "
He added : " We were born in this area , we went to school here , we know the area and know all the people here .
Why must we move out ? "
Shack dwellers have mobilised against evictions in well - organised protests that make powerful use of new media .
Pamela Beukes , 29 , secretary of the Western Cape Anti-Eviction Campaign , condemned the rise of Blikkiesdorp : " They 're creating a tin city .
They 're doing worse things than the apartheid regime did to the people .
Under apartheid they gave us a brick house .
" The World Cup was supposed to bring a higher standard of living .
But it 's making it lower .
People are saying , ' I do n't want to watch soccer because it 's the reason I was evicted . '
It 's as if we 're lesser beings . "
The city of Cape Town denies the accusation that it is dumping people in Blikkiesdorp because of the World Cup .
Kylie Hatton , a spokeswoman , said in an email : " It is not true that the City of Cape Town is moving or displacing residents in informal areas in the runup to the 2010 Fifa World Cup .
" It is important to note that the TRA has been constructed for emergency accommodation needs and is provided by the city , and exceeds national housing requirements . "
She added : " We have significant challenges regarding vandalism in the area , and in some cases our contractors have had to return to the site over four times to repair broken toilets , taps and electricity cables .
This often then has an impact on services in the settlement . "
But Blikkiesdorp is only one manifestation of a deeper disquiet in South Africa about the benefits , or otherwise , of hosting football 's biggest festival .
In Durban there are further demonstrations over evictions and reports that street children are forcibly being removed from the city centre to " safe areas " far away .
Tens of thousands of informal traders complain that they will lose income because of Fifa - imposed " exclusion zones " around stadiums which permit only approved businesses .
Regina Twala , who has been selling cooked meals and snacks for 35 years , told South Africa 's Sunday Independent that she and fellow workers had been ordered to vacate their premises outside Ellis Park stadium .
Unemployment
The Western Cape Anti-Eviction Campaign said : " The lives of small businesses and informal traders in South Africa have been destroyed by this World Cup .
If we are not allowed to trade near stadiums , fan parks and other tourist areas , how can we benefit from tourism ? "
The new stadiums heralded a construction boom , but many of the workers who built them have already been laid off and are without work .
Caroline Elliot , international programmes officer for the anti-poverty group War on Want , said : " Behind the spectacle , the World Cup is exacerbating the struggle of poor South Africans who are facing evictions , lack of public services and unemployment .
The South African government needs to tackle these problems as an urgent priority . "
Andile Mngxitama , a political commentator and columnist , is about to publish a pamphlet entitled " Fuck the World Cup " .
He said : " We never needed the World Cup .
It is a jamboree by the politicians to focus attention away from the 16 years of democracy that have not delivered for the majority of black people in this country .
We 'll be trapped with white elephant stadiums . "
He added : " The World Cup is not about football or so - called tourism .
It 's about politicians hoping it keeps us busy for a month and making enormous amounts of money for themselves and their friends . "
White men who want to play with themselves in public are getting their wish
Is there no end to this crap ?
This coming June the inaugural season of an all - white professional basketball league is scheduled to launch in 12 south - eastern cities .
The All - American Basketball Alliance would also ban players born outside the United States .
The league ’s commissioner , Don “ Moose ” Lewis , claims that he does n’t “ hate anyone of color .
But people of white , American - born citizens are in the minority now . ”
Thus , he says , the All - American Basketball Alliance would be “ a league for white players to play fundamental basketball , which they like . ”
Augusta , Georgia is a hot tip to be the first city to be awarded the lucrative franchise .
Fired up by the chance to see professional basketball in Augusta , local fans are submitting their ideas for uniforms and names for their new , yet to be announced favorite team .
One fan said he would like the team to be called The Augusta Red Necks and he would like to them play in the Confederate uniform .
Another avid supporter of the plan , said he would call them The Augusta Possums , after his favorite snack , and he wanted to see them play in long white robes , but no hoods .
April 29 , 2010 --
Do you really want to know all of the information encoded in your genes ?
A thought - provoking new study shows why you might -- and why you might not .
It 's not science fiction .
It now costs less than $ 10,000 to learn your own personal genome .
Soon it will cost no more than $ 1,000 .
What might you learn ?
Ask Stephen Quake , PhD , a Stanford University bioengineer .
Recently , Quake and colleagues showed that a whole human genome -- his own -- could be unraveled by a single technician using a single machine .
When a 19 - year - old relative died suddenly in his sleep , Quake began to wonder whether the information he collected could tell him whether he risked the same fate .
He took his genome to cardiologist Euan Ashley , MD , who runs Stanford 's hypertrophic cardiomyopathy center .
" This made me start thinking about what doctors are supposed to do when a patient walks into your office , shows you his whole genome , and asks , ' What is in my crystal ball ? ' "
Ashley tells WebMD .
" It 's a challenge .
Lots of people have looked at human genomes , but nobody had ever looked at a single patient before . "
Ashley and Quake assembled a large group of Stanford 's top researchers .
The group pored over all available information on genetic risk and then evaluated millions of the variations in Quake 's genetic code .
In the end , it turns out that Quake carries three gene variants linked to sudden cardiac death .
Genetic analysis shows he's at increased risk for heart attack , clogged arteries , type 2 diabetes , and some cancers .
Does this mean Quake is particularly unlucky ?
No .
Because of the frequency of risk genes in the population , every single person who looks into their genome will find that they carry risk genes for more than one serious or deadly disease .
" It is all bad news , " Quake tells WebMD .
" After all , there is no genetic basis for happiness or athleticism .
It 's all about things that make you uncomfortable and ill .
You have to have a strong stomach . "
While it is n't what you 'd call really good news , Quake did learn a number of helpful things .
He 's genetically more likely to respond to low doses of cholesterol - lowering drugs with a lower risk of side effects ( in fact , he 's begun taking the drugs even though he 's only 40 ) .
And should he ever need the drugs , Quake learned that he 's less likely to respond to the blood - thinning drug Plavix than to alternative drugs , and he would need a lower starting dose of warfarin .

Winners of the fourth annual North American Computational Linguistics Olympiad just announced .
More than a thousand high school students from across the USA and Canada recently competed in the fourth annual North American Computational Linguistics Olympiad .
The top students are eligible to represent their country at the Eighth International Linguistics Olympiad to be held in Sweden in late July .
The competition included two rounds -- the Open round on February 4th and the Invitational round on March 10th .
1118 students participated in the Open competition at more than 100 sites , including universities such as Carnegie Mellon , Princeton , Stanford , and University of Michigan , as well as many high schools .
The students with the top 100 scores in the open round advanced to the Invitational round , which featured significantly harder questions .
Top winners include :
Ben Sklaroff , Palo Alto , CA , Palo Alto High School
Brian Kong , Milton , MA , Milton Academy
Allen Yuan , Farmington Hills , MI , Detroit Country Day School
Daniel Li , Fairfax , VA , Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology
Alan Chang , San Jose , CA , Piedmont Hills High School
Alexander Iriza , Astoria , NY , The Dalton School
In - Sung Na , Old Tappan , NJ , Northern Valley Regional HIgh School at Old Tappan
Tian - Yi Damien Jiang , Raleigh , NC , North Carolina School of Science & Mathematics ( Durham )
Students compete in the Computational Linguistics Olympiad by solving challenging problems using data from a variety of languages and formal systems .
There is no pre-requisite knowledge .
Students discover facts about languages and formal systems in the course of solving the puzzles .
According to first place winner Ben Sklaroff , " Translating a language you 've never heard of before just by using logic is extremely gratifying .
It 's like breaking a code , except languages generally make sense so all the rules are less arbitrary .
Trying to figure out how another person would express common concepts in their own language , with just a few examples to work with is a fun challenge . "
This year students solved sixteen problems , including deciphering the rules for a Pig - Latin - like play language in Minangkabau , the writing systems of Plains Cree , and the Vietnamese classic Tale of Kieu written in Chinese characters .
Computational problems dealt with text compression and automatic expansion of abbreviated words .
Alan Chang ( 5th place ) says , " I really did n't know what I was getting myself into until the open round actually started .
Those three hours did n't feel like a test at all .
They were three hours of very creative and challenging puzzles .
As much as I like math and physics competitions , I found this linguistics competition to be the most fun .
I was very surprised at how many problems I could solve without any prior experience or knowledge of the subject , and this made me feel more accomplished every time I solved a problem . "
Dragomir Radev of the University of Michigan is the chair of the program committee .
Among his many responsibilities , Radev gathers ideas from industry and academic researchers around the world .
Radev aims to create challenging and stimulating problems that address cutting edge issues in the field of computational linguistics .
Though not yet widely known to the general public , computational linguistics is a rapidly emerging field with applications in such areas as search engine technologies , machine translation , and artificial intelligence .
While the linguistics competition is fun , it also requires dedication and hard work by many people , all of whom are volunteers .
Dragomir Radev and Lori Levin ( Carnegie Mellon University ) co-chair the organizing committee , which also includes School Liaison Amy Troyani ( Pittsburgh Allderdice High School ) , Administrative Chair Mary Jo Bensasi ( Carnegie Mellon University ) and Sponsorship Chair James Pustejovsky ( Brandeis University ) , as well as problem authors and jury members Eugene Fink ( Carnegie Mellon University ) , David Mortensen ( University of Pittsburgh ) , Patrick Littell ( University of British Columbia ) , and 2007 international gold medalist Adam Hesterberg , now studying at Princeton University .
Many other college professors , high school teachers , and college students also volunteer their time .
NACLO is sponsored by the National Science Foundation and the North American Chapter of the Association for Computation Linguistics ( NAACL ) , Carnegie Mellon University Language Technologies Institute and Gelfand Center for Community Outreach , University of Michigan , and Brandeis University , as well as donations from academic departments and individual donors .
Programs similar to NACLO have taken place for over forty years in Eastern Europe , and the International Linguistics Olympiad is in its eighth year .
More information as well as the problem sets and solutions can be found on the NACLO website www.naclo.cs.cmu.edu.
" Usually , college students do n't even hear about computational linguistics until they are well along in their undergraduate studies , " says Lori Levin of Carnegie Mellon University , co-chair of the North American program .
" Our hope is that competitions such as the Computational Linguistics Olympiad will identify students who have an affinity for linguistics and computational linguistics before they graduate high school and encourage them to pursue further studies at the university level . "
The organization also hopes to see the scientific study of language incorporated into high school curricula .
Charles Forster , a computer science teacher , has created a new computational linguistics course at the Dalton School in NY .
" We are making an effort to cater to the students who are in the department but are less interested in following our singular " algorithms " track , as well as to students who are afraid to take computer science because it has the word " science " in it but are interested in taking language .
Ling is a great crossover field in HS .
For kids who are less inclined to science , they learn to see a subject that they are interested in through a science lens .
Inversely , it is a great entre for sci geeks to english and language . "
Universities and corporations view the program as a way of helping high school students discover their talents and interests in the areas of language , linguistics and natural language processing .
" High school students are always enthusiastic about logic puzzles , and the Linguistics Olympiad provides lots of them , " says Adam Hesterberg , vice - chair of the jury and winner of the 2007 International Linguistics Olympiad .
" It 's like a math contest without the requirement of knowing any math , although without the rigor of a math contest .
Indeed , mathematicians normally do quite well in the contests . "
Chang adds , " Despite all being based on linguistics , the problems in NACLO are very diverse .
Every time I began a new problem , I had to think carefully about what I could use to solve it .
The techniques I ended up using ranged from applying basic English grammar to searching for patterns to solving systems of equations . "
Dragomir Radev certainly feels that his hard work pays off .
" Many of the participants are extremely bright and have broad interests .
In addition to linguistics , they also excel in physics , mathematics , computing , and many other subjects .
A number of linguistics clubs have been created at high schools thanks to NACLO . "
And , as Eugene Fink puts it , " most importantly , it is fun for all participants , both students and organizers . "
Allen Yuan ( third place ) concurs , " NACLO has been one of the most enlightening experiences in my life , combining my love for solving puzzles with a newly sparked interest in languages .
The contest was very well organized this year and I hope that this event can continue to expand in the future .
It brings a great opportunity to change the way all the students think . "

There 's only so many ways you can blame your Xbox Live profile saying nasty or verboten things on someone else .
The truly creative are able to depict it as something beneficial to society .
Like breast cancer awareness .

Kotaku reader LOL
It 's Bert got bored , apparently , and began sifting through the Xbox Live forums , finding several hilarious appeals of bannings , all within the past week .
These , along with last week 's parents who discovered their son plays UNO in the nude , paint a vivid picture of the crap folks like The Pro have to deal with every day .
And yes , in fact , it is a slow news day - so feel free to say that in this post and in this post only without ending up like any of these suckas .

Let 's start with women 's health advocate COMMANDER TOBIN :
MY GAMER TAG IS COMMANDER TOBIN
suspenion reason ( HURRY FOR BOOBIES ) in my motto
I am a 28 yr. old male who is an advocate for breast cancer awarness and research why I am being suspended for that .
It makes no sense to me .
G/O Media may get a commission Subscribe and Get Your First Bag Free Promo Code AtlasCoffeeDay20
The reply :
Maybe " Support Cancer Research " would be a better option .
Now , hold on a second .
I suppose " Hurry for Boobies " could refer to the Race for the Cure .
But hey , it 's only a day suspension .
It 's not like he wrote SHOW ME YOURE BOBIES .

Next up , BANNED NOW MAD wants to debate the Webster 's definition of the B - word .
Now I know my first ban was for having an innapropriate word in my profile and it was the word ' f ** k ' and spelt exactly like that with the asteriks .
This time it was for the phrase '' I made you rage quit and now you 're crying like a b*tch '' ( referring to Fifa 10 players of course ) and I am wondering why the word ' b * tch ' is considered offensive ?
It is in the dictionary and is technically a female dog .

Hey , he 's right !
And " pussy " also refers to a cat !
" Gay " also means " happily excited . "
It 's not his fault you guys have such filthy minds .
Some excuses are variants on the timeless .
Tango Actual blames it on the dog .
Or , well , the dog sitter .
I have been out of country for a few weeks and had a friend of mine house sit / watch my pets while I was away .
I got home about 2 days ago and apparently while i was out he had used my Xbox and changed my bio to somthing offensive .
Unfortunatly it didnt come to my mind to check my profile and see if changes were since it 's somthing i do n't often do .
So all in all would it be out of the question to request that account Tango Actual is unbanned on account it was not through my own fault ?
Thank you .

Damn .
Seriously , do you know how hard it is to find a good pet sitter ?
iMOD x TRIIX explores the difference between the letter of the law and its spirit .
I got suspended without any warning for my bio which was n't directly explicit it read :
I picked your mum up in the RUNDOWN ESTATE district of AFGHAN and then took her up to my HIGHRISE FAVELA .
We used MARATHON to get there faster then she took off her BLING & we got COMMANDO .
Her CARE PACKAGE looked like a WASTELAND with a few SKIDROWs close I had no past experiences with suspensions and did not no I could be banned for this Please Review

I would have banned him for being incoherent .
Moving along , what 's PWNxOGRAPHY 's problem ?
It 's not like they banned him on his birthday .
For God 's sake !
I was suspended on Apr 23 for one day .
I do n't really even talk online and play games where you can't hear the other team so I DO NOT talk trash .
It was my B - day on the 22nd for gods sake .

GHETTOGHOUL 51's
Mom does n't appreciate your tone of voice , Mister Xbox Man :
My son was scammed by [ Mod Removed ] .
[ Mod Removed ] told my son that for 3 months of xbox live codes he would invite him to a lobby and get him 10 prestige and unlock everything there is to unlock on COD2 so my so sent him 3 one month codes as follows [ Mod Removed ]
Which [ Mod Removed ] took and never contacted my son for the upgrades .
I just found this out because my son used my ebay acct .
to get the three xbox live codes .
I do have a reciept for the three codes and I am sure you can find out who used them .
Thank You

Mod KLRSKIR replies :
I will tell you that what your son was engaging in is also against the Live Terms of Use .
Never ever give out anything with the expectation of getting something in return , even to cheat .
This is a simple lesson of life , and with the proper instruction , your son may benefit from this experience .

Oh , that did it .
Do n't worry about the lesson or intruction my son learned becuase he wo n't be able to sit for a week .
save your speaches for Obama .

Man , paddled and banned .
Talk about pwned .
Senate Democrats ramped up pressure on the GOP over financial reform , demanding top GOP senators elaborate on meetings they had with Wall Street executives .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's ( D - Nev. ) office accused Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R - Ky. ) and National Republican Senatorial Committee ( NRSC ) Chairman John Cornyn of conducting " backroom negotiations " with business leaders when they met with executives from banks and other business groups in New York earlier this month .
" Senators McConnell and Cornyn should immediately reveal what they discussed earlier this month during secret , closed - door meeting with Wall Street executives in New York City , " Reid spokesman Jim Manley said Monday .
McConnell and Cornyn have acknowledged meeting with the business leaders , but have not elaborated on the conversations that took place during the meeting .
" Well , look , we were talking about financial regulation , as everybody in the country is talking about it , " McConnell explained Sunday during an appearance on CNN .
" It does n't mean that we can't discuss issues with people that we meet around the country who are deeply involved and concerned about what we are doing , " McConnell later added of his and Cornyn 's meeting .
Democrats pounced on McConnell 's answer , saying that the top Senate Republican should be more forthcoming .
" Since Republicans appear to be conducting backroom negotiations with these same people who took our economy to the brink of collapse , the public deserves to know what secret deals and carve - outs Republicans are offering Wall Street executives in exchange for their support , " Manley shot back .
A spokesman for McConnell did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment .
I think it ’s safe to say that , at least in terms of popularity , Neon Indian is going to be this 2010 ’s version of Passion Pit .
Case in point is the Texas - turned - Brooklyn outfit ’s newly announced summer tour , which includes two dates in support of Massive Attack as well as its very own headlining performance .
The trek commences starting in mid-May and will keep the band on the road through mid-July .
We ’re guessing a yet - to - be- announced appearance at the Pitchfork Music Festival will also be included .
Of course , all this will be in support of last year ’s debut LP Psychic Chasms , which recently got the remix treatment courtsey of a fellow up - and - coming Brooklyn outfit , BRAHMS .

Imagine a format that lies somewhere between photos and video , and a device that takes that format automatically , without you having to click a button .
Microsoft 's SenseCam is a prototype that hangs around your neck , lifecasting everything you see .
Advertisement
Around three years ago , lifecasting was all the rage .
We idolized iJustine , Justin.tv and the countless other people brave enough to film every action , every day .
The trouble with their form of lifecasting is that it 's done via a camcorder strapped to a hat , filming all your actions plus everyone else 's .
You could almost say the SenseCam is the lifecasting device for shy people who are merely interested in jogging their memory at a later date ; people who want to tell a story without having to hear themselves .
Advertisement
So , What The Heck Is It ?
Measuring the size of a square pack of cards , it hangs from a lanyard around the neck and films everything within your eyesight in 640 x 480 resolution photos , compressing them as JPEGs on the device 's internal 1GB SD card .
It can store over 30,000 images — which works out to around 100 hours ' worth of lifecasting , based on approximately 300 photos taken each hour ( which is the average number automatically shot ) , plus the time each photo was shot at .
G/O Media may get a commission Subscribe and Get Your First Bag Free Promo Code AtlasCoffeeDay20
Its 0.3MP VGA image sensor may not be as good as your cameraphone or even laptop webcam ( though it does shoot in a wide - angle fish - eye style effect which I loved ) , but those devices require you to click a button every time you want a photo taken .
The SenseCam takes photos passively , based on changes to the light , temperature or movement — or you can set it to take photos on a timer instead .
It contains several different sensors — light - intensity and light - color sensors , a passive infrared detector for measuring changes in body heat , a temperature sensor and an accelerometer for detecting movement .
It 's certainly interesting moving between rooms with different lighting conditions , and seeing how many more photos the SenseCam takes .
Advertisement
Every Step You Take , It'll Be Watching You
When connected to a computer it pops up as an external hard drive , with individual folders dedicated to each batch of 100 photos , or roughly 20 minutes ' worth of memories .
I used the SenseCam over two days , and by the end I had thousands of photos to sort through .
Opening all the folders and previewing them on my Mac , I just ran through them quickly , so they turned into something akin to a flipbook .
It was shocking seeing how often I open my Twitter tab when working , and how many times each hour I chew on my nails .
Advertisement
Cooking dinner provided the best results .
The SenseCam detected the change in temperature and likely the light as well , so took as many as eight shots a minute .
Chopping sundried tomatoes turned the shots into a movie when I ran through them quickly on the laptop later — and stirring pasta with a wooden spoon saw my hand move very slightly in each shot .
Advertisement
Sadly — and this is more of a reflection on my life than the SenseCam — none of the photos are really worth showing anyone .
In fact , what you see below in the gallery are the only photos I deemed interesting enough .
No-one , especially not me , wants to see hours ' worth of photos of my laptop screen as I work , flipping tabs and checking email .
An alarming amount of photos showed my BlackBerry in front of the camera , as I replied to emails when I was away from my laptop .
A good number featured my cat in them .

Here Comes The Fun
But the potential here is huge .
Whereas strapping a camcorder to a hat is deemed as intrusive , having a small box the size of a deck of cards strung from my neck on a lanyard is far from it .
Filming makes both you , and the people around you , very aware of every action .
Affectations are created that way ; egos are born .
Having a camera that you do n't have to control means it 's forgotten , so a truer representation of your life can be broadcast — should you choose to put the photos on Twitter , Facebook or Flickr .
Advertisement
As there 's no plans for Microsoft to send the SenseCam down the production line ( excluding the fact that they 've licensed the technology to Vicon , who 'll sell it to the medical industry ) , it 's not too important hypothesizing on why you could ever want or need one .
I do wish however that I was wearing it several nights ago when my friend won tickets to the London premiere of Remember Me , and we were stood 5 m away from Robert Pattinson ( he of Twilight fame ) .
The one shaky photo I managed on my BlackBerry , which while it has a better image sensor than the SenseCam's , was ruined thanks to my nerves and emotions running wild .
The SenseCam , while triggered by changes in bodyheat or temperature , does n't have stage fright when confronted with celebrities - you - really - should n't - fancy - but - actually - do .
Advertisement
There 's a future here with the SenseCam , if Microsoft can find the right partner to license the technology to for personal use .
They could even launch it successfully themselves .
I would n't use it everyday , and certainly have no need for reviewing 100 hours of my life through the form of 30,000 photos , but it'd be great fun to wear while at a party — especially for those of us who often suffer from memory loss the next morning .
Adding a 3G chip and GPS , so each photo could be sent to an online profile and tagged with your whereabouts would be future features I 'd like to see ... but then , who would be interested enough in viewing someone else 's life from their perspective ?

This is the face on environmentalism today – publicly issued threats from Greenpeace
I find this sort of thing slightly troubling , but mostly I see it as just behind the scenes business as usual , only written down instead of part of the usual meeting rhetoric .
We need to hit them where it hurts most , by any means necessary : through the power of our votes , our taxes , our wallets , and more . …
The proper channels have failed .
It ’s time for mass civil disobedience to cut off the financial oxygen from denial and skepticism .
If you ’re one of those who believe that this is not just necessary but also possible , speak to us .
Let ’s talk about what that mass civil disobedience is going to look like .
If you ’re one of those who have spent their lives undermining progressive climate legislation , bankrolling junk science , fueling spurious debates around false solutions , and cattle - prodding democratically - elected governments into submission , then hear this :

Rape has been used as a weapon of war in Dr Congo -- DR Congo gang rape crisis ' spreading ' , new study says , BBC , 15 April 2010 . [ 2 ]
Researchersfrom Harvard Universityin the US examined more than 4,000 cases of sexual assault from 2004 to 2008 and discovered that the number of rapes carried out by civilians had increased 17 - fold .
Joseph Kabila , the DRCongo president , has asked the UN to withdraw a

Ok ... I have n't watched morning Joe in months mainly because it just gives me high blood pressure .
But today over at TPM Grade A Smackdown they had an awesome clip of how Democrats should have been talking about and framing the healthcare reform issue all year long .
Of course Joe was doing his usual of setting up the Republican talking points for the day , trying to cut - off any real Democratic points , Peggy Noonan was co-signing in her most above the fray voice , and Mika looking like she just took a Xanax ( she is such a poor excuse for intelligent women everywhere ) .
Weiner was n't having any of it .
He was calm , patient , and MAGNIFICENT !!
He ( and Rep. Alan Grayson ) just need to start scheduling appointments right NOW on teaching Democrats how to not only push back HARD but frame the issues whatever they are .
This was a thing of beauty .
The fireworks started around the 8 minute mark .
So , settle in , get your popcorn , and send Rep .
Weiner a donation if you can .
He 's one of the good guys .
Taxed Enough Already ?
Or not taxed at all ?
One of the striking ironies of Fox News running with the statistic that 47 % of Americans might not owe federal income taxes is that Fox News also moonlights as the unofficial station of the Tea Party movement , which clamors for lower taxes .
You might ask : half of the country pays no income tax , how much lower do you want ?
Here 's a more troubling point : if the Tea Party movement has a similar share of Americans making under $ 50,000 as the broader population ( as a recent Gallup poll suggests ) , then why is this movement rallying under the banner " Taxed Enough Already ! " when half of them are n't taxed at all ?
Forty - five percent of self - identified " Tea Partiers " make less than $ 50,000 per year , according to a USA Today / Gallup poll .
Similarly , 50 % of the total population makes less than $ 50,000 in the same poll .
Despite this author 's lack of direct access to the tax returns of the Tea Party movement , it seems safe to assume that if about half the country avoids federal income taxes , a similar percentage of the Tea Party movement gets away with the same even as they march and scream about their tax burden .
This is a gotcha point .
But it 's a gotcha point worth making , if only to shine light on the sad intellectual bankruptcy of the Tea Party , a political movement that has taken over the news cycle like a particularly aggressive strain of ragweed .
Tea Partiers want lower income taxes .
But many of them probably do n't pay income taxes .
If we listen to them and bring even more Americans into the zero - income tax pool , we would only concentrate more of the tax burden on wealthy earners ... which conservatives are against .
Tea Party apologists on TV will explain that what they 're really asking for is lower rates and a broader tax base to diffuse America 's tax responsibility .
But if half the Tea Party does n't pay income taxes today , a broader tax base -- even with minuscule rates -- would raise many of their taxes !
The party 's labyrinthine position on tax policy is n't worth untangling any further .
It 's a Gordian Knot that deserves a guillotine .
When liberals and conservatives in Congress and think tanks and conference rooms debate tax policy in the coming months , they should consider a wide buffet of reform options -- but hold the tea .
Might is right on Mumbai roads
Apr 20 , 2010 , 07:28 PM IST
1/7 Motorists across the globe spend six months of their lives in traffic jams - most are phantom jams - a study in the UK has revealed .
Mumbai motorists , however , end up spending much more than that .
DNA visits some of the major traffic bottlenecks in the city to find out reasons for the never - ending snarls .
The obvious culprits are narrow roads , heavy traffic volume , ongoing road works , and above all unruly driving and pedestrian indiscipline .
Haji Ali junction , 5.00 pm
This junction witnesses a daily traffic flow of close of 1.5 lakh vehicles .
Traffic moving to and from Pedder Road hits a roadblock here and even though most arms of the junction - it has four arms - are sufficiently wide , the sheer volume of traffic is too much to handle .
Vehicles that get off the Bandra - Worli Sea Link at the Worli end have also added to the traffic woes at the junction .
To facilitate smooth traffic flow , the traffic cops have now been forced to impose certain restrictions for vehicular movement on some portions of the junction .
" Most drivers do n’t have any driving culture .
Lane discipline is never observed ; if one driver cuts a lane , others follow blindly .
Also , there is an urgent need to upgrade road infrastructure . ”
- Anish Gandhi , motorist
2/7 Cadbury junction , Pedder Road , 5.15 pm
This junction , a nightmare for motorists , sees the highest peak hour traffic during morning and evening .
Traffic cops blame heavy traffic flow and the narrow road width for the chaotic situation .
Undisciplined lane changing by drivers is more often than not the reason for traffic snarls at the junction .
Unless the proposed Pedder Road flyover , which has been embroiled in controversy for some time now , is built on priority or additional lanes are created , the problem at the junction will only worsen once the Worli - Haji Ali stretch of the sea link comes up .
" It is not possible to penalise each and every person found flouting lane discipline as this would hold up traffic .
Unless the road infrastructure is upgraded here , the bottleneck will continue to exist . ”
- Traffic cop
3/7 Mahim Church junction , 2.00 pm
A junction notorious for traffic snarls has recently seen a plastic divider being put up by the police on Mahim Causeway for northward - bound traffic .
The divider instructs motorists travelling to different roads from the junction to keep their vehicles on a particular side of the road .
Transport expert Ashok Datar felt the dividers improved traffic flow considerably .
Another experiment was tried , which succeeded , but was discontinued later .
At the exit of the Western Express Highway on Mahim Causeway , where six lanes merge into three , the police blocked three lanes to the right to redirect traffic flow .
" Bad driving skills and dug up roads cause most traffic jams .
Motorists and bikers exploit the minutest of free space available , thus causing jams . ”
- Sukanya Kulkarni , actress
4/7 Famous studio- Mahalaxmi station , 4.30 pm
Post - noon the stretch from King George Memorial Hospital on Dr E Moses Road to the Mahalaxmi station , which is less than a kilometre , takes about 10 minutes to cover due to traffic snarls .
During peak hours , the situation worsens drastically as there is bumper - to - bumper traffic on the stretch .
The morning peak hours between 10 am and 11 am are a difficult time for southward - bound traffic , and the evening peak hours between 5.30 pm and 6.30 pm are a major distress for northward - bound vehicles .
Also , haphazardly parked cars and taxis block traffic movement on both sides of the road throughout the day , which adds to the traffic woes .
" There ’s no traffic sense .
Driving licences are given without proper tests .
We need driving schools that teach good driving culture . ” - Ravinder Kaur , motorist
5/7 SV Road , Borivli Station , 9.30 am
It 's a task to travel from the Dahisar - end of Borivli station to the other end on SV Road , especially during peak hours .
The distance , which is less than 500 metres , takes about 10 - 12 minutes to travel .
Haphazard parking by autorickshaw drivers is the biggest nuisance and causes most traffic jams here .
Also , the ongoing skywalk work adds to the woes of the motorists .
Since the road is parallel to the station , pedestrians going in and coming out of the station also hinder traffic movement and add to the chaos .
Even the presence of a traffic cop at the junction does not deter autorickshaw drivers from taking illegal turns and blocking traffic .
" The road is narrow and pedestrians do n’t respect traffic flow .
The share - rickshaw drivers park in the wrong direction and take illegal turns . ” - S Waghela , autorickshaw driver
6/7 Mohd Ali Road , 6.00 pm
This is one junction where traffic snarls were a common phenomenon for years , but had come down after the JJ flyover became operational .
But now with the traffic department 's decision to ban two - wheelers on the flyover , the traffic situation has gone back to square one .
Two - wheelers , which would zoom past on the flyover , now crowd the junction , which is already congested due to its proximity to Crawford Market .
Various other markets , commercial and public , are also located near the junction and thus unregulated movement of hand carts and trucks adds to the traffic snarls .
The traffic jams are extremely chaotic during peak hour traffic .
" Two - wheeler ban on JJ flyover is unnecessary .
It now takes twice the time it used to for covering the stretch from CST to Byculla due to the traffic snarls . ”
- Aslam Khan , advocate
Based on the MSNBC article " New Hampshire loses strongest wind gust title "
In the year 1996 , a lot of mundane shit went overlooked that years later would seem like a really big deal .
It was officially designated the International Year for the Eradication of Poverty .
A foolish boast really , since there was nothing in place to give everyone on the planet a bunch of money , and last time I checked there are still a lot of poor people .
It was the year Bin Laden wrote The Declaration of Jihad on the Americans Occupying the Country of the Two Sacred Places , something that in hindsight maybe should have raised a few more eyebrows , but given the wind bag author and rather lengthy title , understandably was n't a bestseller .
It was the year the " fastest wind gust ever recorded on Earth " occurred in Australia , clocking in at 253 miles per hour .
It was the year Alanis Morissette became the youngest person to win the Album of the Year award , with Jagged Little Pill , a record she still holds today .
In fact I hear Alanis cuddles with that album nightly before falling asleep .
It was also the year that Monica Lewinsky officially " worked " at the White House during Bill Clinton 's term .
I guess what I 'm trying to say is , 1996 was filled with a lot of things not only blowing hard , but really hard to swallow .
I do n't think this will ever get old .
But I do n't want to bore you to death with topics like the economy , terrorism , Grammy winners , or political scandals .
Especially not with boring events that occurred almost 15 years ago .
So let 's talk about that gust of wind , eh ?
Wind is fucking crazy exciting is n't it ?!
You know what 's even more exciting than wind ?
Wind that happened a decade and a half back , that 's what !
Now that 's big news , which even though it totally blows , is still absolutely worth obsessing over … maybe even crying about …or um …NOT .
You see , it seems that New England 's little political red-headed step- child , New Hampshire , is all abuzz with sadness over a gust of wind that happened way back in 1996 .
This particular tragic gust of wind happened on Australia 's Barrow Island during Cyclone Olivia and was measured at an amazing 253 miles per hour !
So why is this such a big deal and worth getting upset over ?
Well , it is n't worth getting upset over , because it 's just fucking wind !
The better question is , " Why is this such a big deal to New Hampshire ? "
You see , apparently , until that gust of wind was measured , New Hampshire held the world record for the fastest wind gust ever recorded on Earth , and for some reason , New Hampshire gave a shit about that .
I guess if you live in New Hampshire there is n't that much to do or get really excited over , so things like wind being to seem like a big deal .
New England 's political red - headed step - child .
New Hampshire 's famous gust of wind , the one they pride themselves on , occurred at an observatory atop Mount Washington back in 1934 .
That 's right , New Hampshire is still excited about a single gust of wind from 1934 and yet people today are still surprised when they make idiotic , archaic , political decisions .
Actual quotes from Scot Henley , the observatory 's executive director : " It 's obviously a big disappointment .
Having the world record for over six decades was such a part of the soul of this organization and for fans of Mount Washington around the country . "
Apparently fame is so easily achieved these days that even mountains now have fans !
" No one noticed the new record gust at the time , " Henley said .
" Somehow it fell through the cracks and the Australians did n't think it was a big deal .
We hear that , and it kinds of blows our minds , but of course , we 're weather fans and we 're tuned into that sort of thing . "
The Australians did n't think it was a big deal , Scot , because like I said , it 's just fucking wind !
The only thing to ponder about Australia 's wind is whether their resident giant windbag , Gavin Pitt , has anything to do with it , because according to Alex Boonstra , he apparently does put a lot of effort into blowing .
Both Gavin and Mount Washington are apparently really big blowhards .
Scot went on to say that the official title at issue is " highest wind gust ever recorded on the surface of the Earth by means of an anemometer . "
But to most people in New Hampshire , it was simply " The Big Wind . "
By the way Scot , just out of curiosity , did The Big Wind of New Hampshire blow the other " t " off your name ?
Last time I checked , Scott had two " t "s and to spell it with just one is equally as sad as your ridiculous wind obsession .
Scott ( fuck him and his missing " t , " I 'm writing it correctly from now on ) then went on to say , " So the work continues up there , and we 'll be ready for the next one . "
Wait , just so we 're clear , this work you 're referring to is sitting around waiting for a future gust of wind ?!
I know homeless people who work harder than that !
According to the observers , " they are paid little and work 12 - hour shifts , seven days a week .
They get free food , long vacations , and every other week off . "
Wait , maybe these guys actually ARE homeless people .
They are also reported to be minor media stars , because of their daily radio forecasts which are broadcast in New Hampshire and Maine and given in their quirky , monotone delivery .
Aww , they even had a sign and everything .
Yes , you read that right , people , they are minor media stars because they report about boring things in a boring voice .
First mountains get fans and now boring , monotone , weather reporters get them too .
It 's like they 're now handing out fans like Nobel Prizes or something .
Although I guess it 's understandable , because I also have a tendency to get very entertained by homeless people muttering to themselves about inane crap .
What really makes this all so sad and tragic , to New Hampshire , is that they significantly prided themselves on this " Big Wind " and now it has been discovered that their precious little record was actually broken almost 15 years ago .
However , what makes this all so sad and tragic to the rest of the world is that New Hampshire significantly prided themselves on a 76 - year - old gust of fucking wind !
Seriously , New Hampshire ?!
Is that all you 've got ?!
That 's just pathetic .
My heart truly goes out to you for your public loss of dignity , however , I 'm going to go out on a limb here and say that your dignity was in significant danger the moment you started placing your dignity on whichever way the wind blows .
New Hampshire , where backwards thinking is just called voting .
It occurs to me that New Hampshire is actually a lot like that awkward home - schooled person you can't quite figure out .
At first you cut them a little slack , because after your first encounter , you naturally assume they 're retarded .
Then , after several other strange and unusual encounters , you begin to realize that they are n't really mentally impaired , just a little socially backwards .
That pretty much describes New Hampshire , a state constantly clinging to things they think other people care about , but in reality could n't give a shit about .
I 'm here to tell you , New Hampshire , that the rest of us are just humoring you , because the entire country feels a little sorry for you and your backward confusion about things .
New Hampshire , like old hampshire , but newer .
While I have your attention and all eyes are on New Hampshire , do you know what else is kind of sad ?
Their obsession with The Old Man of the Mountain .
I 'm sure everyone has thought it at one time or another , but no one really wants to say it for fear of hurting New Hampshire 's fragile ego .
But if you wanted sensitivity and tact you probably would n't be reading PIC , so I 'm just going to tell New Hampshire , once and for all , what the rest of us are thinking :
The Old Man of the Mountain obsession is a fucking joke to the rest of the country too !
You 've made damn sure that we 've all seen it , because it's on the New Hampshire license plate , the New Hampshire state emblem , the New Hampshire quarter , and New Hampshire t- shirts .
Here 's the thing though , it 's time to let it go , New Hampshire , because ironically , the only place you guys DON'T have the Old Man of the Mountain now , is ON THE FUCKING MOUNTAIN !!
For the record , our mountains blow WAY harder than yours !
That 's right , that famous rock outcropping that New Hampshire shoves down everyone 's throat actually crumbled into oblivion back in 2003 !
People were so distraught over it 's collapse that they left flowers at the base of the cliffs in tribute .
Some state legislators sought to change the New Hampshire state flag to include the profile , and many people even suggested replacing the Old Man with a scale plastic replica .
On the first anniversary of the collapse , the state unveiled coin-operated viewfinders near the base of the the cliff that shows how the Old Man USED to appear .
In addition , New Hampshire is now planning on building an Old Man of the Mountain memorial which will consist of five huge stones that , when viewed from a raised platform , merge into a form that recreates the original profile .
We 're talking about rocks to memorialize other rocks , people !
Am I the only one who thinks this is weird ?!
I mean , when Mount St. Helens erupted in my home state of Washington , we did n't memorialize the mountain the way it used to be , but focused on the future by letting the environment respond naturally to the disturbance .
How freaking weird would it have been if we drew up plans to have the mountain rebuilt , out of plastic , to the way it was BEFORE the eruption ?!
New Hampshire , just face simple facts :
You are a small , sad little state clinging to things the way they used to be and I think the reason you cause so much political upheaval is for nothing more than attention .
These attention - gathering tactics put you at about the intellect level of a 3 - year - old , and frankly , the rest of the country thinks you should stop acting like a whiny little cry baby .
Get over all these childish temper tantrums and come on board with the rest of New England .
I promise if you stop acting like such a little spaz , they wo n't tease you …that much .

I was 12 years old when the abortion law in Poland was severely restricted .
At that time I was not aware that the politicians were deciding about the lives of thousands of women , including mine .
Later I read that thousands of people protested in the streets of Warszawa and millions signed a petition supporting a referendum .
In the pre-internet society , this was a great achievement and proof that Polish society was against those changes .
Unfortunately , the first Polish democratic government ignored women ’s voices , showing the deepest disregard for democratic processes .
Since then , political elites have time and time again proved they are more concerned about keeping the Catholic church on their side than they are about the welfare and safety of women .
In 1990 there were 60,000 legal abortions , 4 years later over 1000 , and in 2005 , only 138 .
Obviously , women did not suddenly stop undergoing pregnancy termination after 1993 .
Women ’s organisations estimate that the number of abortions stayed on a similar level – 60,000 - 100,000 a year .
Most of the procedures are now performed in the thriving abortion underground often by the same doctor that did it legally in the 80s but now with a high fee .
Women living in small towns and those with limited financial resources have especially been penalised by the restrictive abortion law .
The ones that are well off can afford to pay for a back - street abortion or go abroad to the Czech Republic or the increasingly popular UK .
For some , the only thing that changed when they want to access abortion is having to pay for it – sometimes as much as an average monthly salary .
Women take desperate actions when faced with unwanted pregnancy .
Many order the “ abortion pills ” online and take it with no supervision or access to medical professionals , often in secret from friends and family .
Reports on Polish women in the UK seeking illegal abortion are widespread .
They are often not aware that abortion is legal in the UK , have little knowledge how the NHS operates or poor language skills .
I also think that due to years of living in the country where women who undergo abortion are stigmatised and called murderers , it might be difficult to imagine going to your local GP and saying out in the open that you do not want to continue the pregnancy .
On the 21st of March , children in Poland celebrate the coming of spring by burning or drowning an effigy of the winter .
This year a right wing youth organisation prepared a dummy of Alicja Tysiąc .
Although pregnancy termination is admissible when there is a danger to woman ’s health under the current legislation , Tysiąc , who had been told that continuing the pregnancy would result in her going blind , could not find a hospital that would carry out the procedure and was forced to continue with her pregnancy .
Tysiąc , ( who is now unable to work because of her disability ) won a case against the Polish government at the European Court of Human Rights .
The defeat did not result in a serious political debate or revisiting of the legislation .
What happened instead was a torrent of abuse towards Tysiąc and pro-choice feminists .
Currently , with the right - wing government in majority there is a very little chance the law will be changed in the foreseeable future .
The abortion law itself is referred to by the politicians as “ a compromise ” .
This refers to the deal struck between the church and the government when attempts to liberalise the law by the left wing government were halted in exchange for church officials support for the EU accession referendum .
Each year the polls show that public support for liberalising the law is diminishing .
With the public discourse dominated by the anti-abortion right wing , it is not surprising .
For many years I witnessed how the debate on abortion in Poland has shifted and how important it is to work with young people whose opinions are easily influenced by authority figures .
Since I started working at EFC , I often wonder if it would ever be possible to implement parts of our Talk About Choice education programme in the Polish school context .
I certainly regret that young people there cannot participate in sex education classes where abortion is discussed in terms of rights not as it happens now during religion classes led by a priest and preceded by the screening of Silent Scream .

LONDON–Protests are growing against Pope Benedict XVI 's planned trip this fall to Britain , where the legal world is debating whether the Vatican 's implicit statehood could shield the Pope from potential prosecution related to sex crimes by pedophile priests .
More than 10,000 people have signed an online petition to Prime Minister Gordon Brown opposing the Pope 's four - day visit to England and Scotland in September .
The campaign has gained momentum as more Catholic sex - abuse scandals shake Europe .
Although Benedict has not been accused of any crime , senior British lawyers are now examining whether the Pope should have immunity as a head of state and whether he could be prosecuted under the principle of universal jurisdiction for an alleged systematic cover - up of sexual abuses by priests .
Universal jurisdiction – a concept in international law – allows judges to issue warrants for nearly any visitor accused of grievous crimes , no matter where they live .
British judges have been more open to the concept than those elsewhere .
Lawyers are divided over the immunity issue .
Some argue the Vatican is n't a true state , while others note it has national relations with about 170 countries , including Britain .
David Crane , former chief prosecutor at the Sierra Leone war crimes tribunal , said it would be difficult to implicate the Pope in anything criminal .
" It 's a fascinating kind of academic , theoretical discussion , " said Crane , who prosecuted Liberia 's Charles Taylor when he was still a sitting head of state .
" At this point , there 's no liability at all . "
But Geoffrey Robertson , who as a UN appeals judge delivered key decisions on the illegality of conscripting child soldiers and the invalidity of amnesties for war crimes , believes it could be time to challenge the immunity of the Pope – and Britain could be the place .
" Unlike in the United States , where the judges commonly uphold what the executive says , the British courts do n't accept these things at face value , " Robertson said on Saturday .
Lawyers question whether an alleged systematic cover - up could be considered a crime against humanity – a charge usually reserved for the International Criminal Court – and whether it could be pursued under universal jurisdiction .
" My guess is the weight of opinion would allow the Pope to enjoy immunity , " said Hurst Hannum , of Tufts University .
" It 's not automatically clear that the Holy See is a state , although it 's treated as one for almost every purpose . "
Spain and Britain jointly pioneered the universal jurisdiction concept when , in 1998 , Britain executed a Spanish arrest warrant for former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet on torture claims .
He was under house arrest in London until ruled unfit to stand trial in 2000 .
Pennsylvania 's chief information security officer , Robert Maley , has been fired , apparently for talking publicly at the RSA security conference last week about a recent incident involving the Commonwealth 's online driving exam scheduling system .
A source close to the matter said Maley was terminated for not getting the required approvals from the Commonwealth 's authorities to talk publicly about the incident .
Commonwealth rules explicitly require all employees to get approval from the appropriate authorities before they publicly disclose official matters , the source said .
A spokesman for the state 's governor , Edward Rendell , today confirmed that Maley is no longer working for the Commonwealth .
But he refused to say if Maley had been terminated , citing privacy rules .
Maley , who was Pennsylvania 's CISO for more than four years , was part of a RSA conference panel discussing state cybersecurity issues last Thursday .
During the discussion , Maley talked about a recent incident involving a Philadelphia - area driving school that was trying to get early driving tests for its students .
The source said someone at the school exploited a configuration " anomaly " in the Department of Transportation 's online driver 's test scheduling system .
The vulnerability allowed the school to essentially cut the line and schedule " a whole bunch of driver 's license exams " for its students , the source said .
The incident was reported to the state police , and the matter is currently under investigation , the source said .
Danielle Klinger , a spokeswoman for Pennsylvania 's Department of Transportation , confirmed today that a problem had been uncovered in the driver test scheduling system , and that the matter has been turned over to state police .
However , she contested several media reports that have described the incident as a hacking attack , and said that as far as the the department was aware , there had been no hack or breach of the system .
Maley 's dismissal comes amid ongoing budget and staff cuts at Pennsylvania 's IT security organization , the source said .
Over the past 18 months to two years , the administration has cut information security budgets by close to 38 % , and staff by 40 % .
They also put a " lockdown " on talking about cybersecurity , the source claimed .

The picture on the front of Labour 's manifesto of a young family confronted by the rising sun and the words : " A future fair for all " has been preoccupying me all week .
The sickly blend of Stalinist iconography and The Wizard of Oz is weird , but as important is the contrast between the image and what I know Britain to be , which is less free , less equal , less private and less just .
Here is a clutch of stories from last week that remind us of the reality .
A Freedom of Information request revealed that in the last six years 15,000 people have been wrongly identified as criminals by the Criminal Records Bureau .
Stop and search was up by 182 % in 2009 , while the use of the Section 44 terror law by officers to stop people without suspicion rose by 66 % .
In Essex , bouncers , now dignified by the term door supervisors , are being given powers to hand out fixed penalty notices for drunkenness .
In Stroud , a man was sentenced to four months in jail for breaching an Asbo that prevents him swearing at his television set .
And in Manchester police used a 50,000 - volt Taser on a man suffering an epileptic fit .
The sunny uplands of a Labour future do not beckon , at least for me : reading the manifesto closely , I realised there 's an ingenious mechanism of self - fulfilment at work which , for example , allows Labour to stoke fear of crime and create thousands of new criminal offences , then employ 17,000 new police officers and 16,000 new community support officers and swell the prison population by 24,000 .
During the first Labour term , the party relaxed drinking laws and planning requirements for licensed premises .
Now , it deplores drunken antisocial behaviour .
It sold hundreds of playing fields for development ; now , it demands that we find more for teenagers to do .
In this barely plausible document , which makes the astonishing boast : " We are proud of our record on civil liberties " , there is nothing to remind us of the intrusions of state databases , the mass surveillance planned for our email , phone calls and internet usage , the new measures to allow secret interception of mail by the taxman , the attack on jury trial , the half - million people who came under some sort official surveillance last year , Britain 's alleged involvement in torture and rendition …
On and on the list goes , but I wo n't try your patience ; I will just tell you that I finally flung " A future fair for all " across the room when I came to the section called " Democratic Reform " and the sentence : " A new politics also means strengthening the power of Parliament to hold the executive to account . "
This piety was too much to endure from a government that cut short debate in Parliament by unprecedented use of the guillotine , drafted legislation so that toxic measures at the end of bills were n't examined and used record levels of unscrutinised secondary legislation .
The only reason Labour agreed to reforms that will give backbenchers more say and the chairs of select committees more independence was because Harriet Harman was ambushed by the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats , as well as her own backbenchers .
A few weeks later , her party makes a virtue of something they were forced to accept and which they had resisted for 13 years .
When people use extreme language about politicians I mistrust them , so I will simply confine myself here to saying that Labour is not fit to be in charge of a free society .
The impact of the last 13 years can be seen in the policies of both main opposition parties but particularly the Conservatives who have been bamboozled by sentiments such as this in Labour 's manifesto : " The Tories talk tough but vote soft on issues from gun crime to DNA . "
With the help of Rupert Murdoch , Labour has permanently changed the co-ordinates of the middle ground .
On crime , the Conservatives cannot risk the big girl 's blouse taunt and while the menace of an intrusive , bossy government may fit the party 's criticism of the big state , the manifesto confines itself to just one - and - a - half pages about restoring civil liberties .
Yes , it is encouraging that the Tories accept " Labour has subjected Britain 's historic freedoms to unprecedented attack " , and are committed to scrapping the ID card , yet there 's no mention of a great repeal bill to redress Labour 's attack on liberty , which was being pushed by Dominic Grieve , and no undertaking to hold a judicial inquiry on accusations of British involvement in torture ..
Writing in the Observer , David Cameron commits the party to openness in government and to some disclosure of personal data , which is welcome , but he does not go the whole way to make all personal information held by the state available to the individual , who should also know who is using his or her information and what for .
That would represent a real transfer of power from state to individuals and society .
As you would expect , the Liberal Democrats are much better on civil liberties .
Their manifesto guarantees a freedom bill , trial by jury , the reform of the regulation of investigatory powers laws and protections for free speech and protest .
They promise to scrap ID cards , the children 's database and fingerprinting in schools , put a stop to the creation of new offences and remove innocent people from the DNA database .
It 's good that both opposition parties recognise the problem , if only fleetingly in the case of the Tories .
I am beginning to wonder if any politician appreciates quite how much Labour 's laws and its corrosively pessimistic view of society have permeated national life or , for that matter , the way that a culture of fear , encouraged by government and the popular press , leads to ludicrous overreaction on the ground .
There is something freakish about a man being stopped from taking photographs of his own toddler in a shopping mall or police using terror laws to search an artist doing a watercolour in London .
Since reading the following sentence a few years ago in John Skorupski's study of John Stuart Mill I have been haunted by it .
I quote it again because it seems so absolutely right for the moment .
" It could be , " he writes , " that modern democracy chronically risks falling into a cycle of periods of cultural stagnation interrupted by brief phases of undiscriminating assault on its vital traditions and institutions : dominated in both phases by the intellectually second - rate but socially and politically effective . "
There seems no doubt that we have passed through just such a period of assault and that last phrase certainly describes New Labour but there is a real obligation on us to guard against stagnation and the lazy addiction to fear .

Today we 're shipping some significant changes to the item drop system .
Previously , we rolled randomly at intervals to see if you got an item drop .
Now we roll to determine when your next item drop will occur .
So you 're guaranteed to find items at fairly regular intervals .
The bulk of drop complaints we 've received in the past have been from players having unlucky streaks , where they did n't find any items for weeks .
That wo n't be possible now .
We 've significantly increased the rate at which item drops occur , compared to the previous average interval .
There 's now a maximum amount of playtime per week in which you get item drops .
Playing beyond that amount wo n't find any more items .
The amount varies , but if you play an hour or so a day you 're good .
Some of your unused time will rollover to the following week , so if you 're an intermittent player you 'll also be fine .
What are the net effects of these changes ?
Here 's the quick summary :
If you 're an idler , you 're going to find fewer items than you were prior to this change .
Sorry .
On the bright side , there 's less reason to idle , because it wo n't earn more than players who are playing regularly .
Everyone else will find items more frequently , and with greater regularity .
We 're still thinking about how to allow you to influence your drops .
When we see discussions on the forums , people often ask why we do n't tie it to some in - game performance ( like your scoreboard position , or number of kills , etc ) .
Many players understand that if we did this , idle servers would simply change into servers running plugins that generate those in - game events frequently ( as we saw in the Soldier & Demoman WAR ! ) .
There 's another side of it that we care about just as much , which is the message it would send to all the players who do n't want to idle .
Any in - game performance metric we chose would result in there being specific maps , classes , tactics , and so on that resulted in more drops .
We really do n't want that to happen .
When it 's simply playtime , you 're free to play the game however you like .
If you love Payload , you can play Payload maps without worrying about whether you 're earning less drops than the guys playing Arena maps .
Community mapmakers do n't have to worry about whether their maps earn item drops fast enough .
Similarly , server operators can configure their servers however they like , without worrying about reducing the rate at which their players are earning drops .
In short , while it 's far from perfect , not tying to in - game performance is a lot less poisonous to your minute - to - minute game experience .

One 's luminous OLED screen may be state of the art when it comes to display technology in smartphones but an iPhone 's LCD screen ranks better , according to tests by DisplayMate , a firm that calibrates and optimizes displays .
" The high - resolution , high - pixel - density OLED display on the Nexus One is beautiful , even stunning on first view , but there are lots of issues , problems and artifacts lurking just below the surface , " said Raymond Soneira , president of DisplayMate , on the company 's blog .
Since OLED displays are still so new , they are yet to be perfected for use in consumer products , which can result in a less - than - optimal experience , he says .
Organic LED displays , or OLEDs , are gaining favor among gadget makers because they can offer a brighter display at lower power than traditional LCDs .
The Nexus One has a 3.7 - inch screen and a resolution of 800 x 480 pixels .
The iPhone 3G has a 3.5 inch display with a resolution of 480 x 320 pixels .
To test the Nexus One 's screen , DisplayMate used 24 - bit native resolution 800 x 480 test patterns and 24 - bit HD resolution test photos .
Their conclusions ?
The " peak white brightness " of the Nexus One is low for a display that used often in outdoor settings .
In terms of picture quality , the Nexus One photos had " way too much contrast and color saturation , to the point of appearing gaudy , " says DisplayMate .
The Nexus One 's Gallery app also uses 16 - bit color instead of 24 - bit color , which results in poor images , says the firm .
Another reason for the Nexus One display 's performance could be the " PenTile pixel arrangement " that it uses , says Soneira .
Instead of the three sub-pixels of red , green and blue for every pixel , the Nexus One 's display just divides each pixel into two .
Every PenTile pixel includes a green sub-pixel , but the red and blue sub-pixels appear in alternating pixels , he says .
" In principle , that is only a minor issue because if red or blue is n’t available in a particular pixel , then the display driver can just use one from an adjacent pixel .
But in practice , it makes things a lot harder for the software and makes it very likely that artifacts will creep into the on - screen images , " says Soneira .
DisplayMate suggests , among other things , Google improve the factory display calibration to correct color saturation and contrast .
Check out their complete two - part series discussing the tests conducted and the results for this Nexus One vs. iPhone 3G shootout .
Not surprisingly , the OLED Association is n't happy with the results .
The tests are flawed and just because the OLED screen does not react the same way as an LCD screen does not mean the former is inferior , Barry Young , managing director of the OLED Association told OLED - Display.net .

LOS ANGELES , April 26 ( Reuters ) - Playboy magazine founder Hugh Hefner on Monday donated the last $ 900,000 sought by a conservation group for a land purchase needed to save the famed vista of the Hollywood sign from being spoiled by development .
Hefner ’s key role in reaching the group ’s fund - raising goal was announced by Los Angeles city officials , Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and the San Francisco - based Trust for Public Land at a news conference in the Hollywood Hills .
The land trust needed to collect a total of $ 12.5 million by this Friday under a deal with a group of Chicago investors who bought the 1,820 - foot ( 555 - meter ) ridge , called Cahuenga Peak , from the estate of billionaire Howard Hughes in 2002 .
The trust will now purchase the 138 - acre ( 56 - hectare ) adjacent parcel and turn it over to the city to be incorporated into the surrounding Griffith Park , preventing any construction that would mar the postcard - perfect view of the Hollywood sign nearby .
“ My childhood dreams and fantasies came from the movies , and the images created in Hollywood had a major influence on my life and Playboy , ” Hefner said in a statement .
“ As I ’ve said before , the Hollywood sign is Hollywood ’s Eiffel Tower and I ’m pleased to help preserve such an important cultural landmark . ”
Other private donors to the Hollywood sign preservation effort included actor Tom Hanks and director Steven Spielberg , the land trust said .

Likewise , I ’d bet that it is the government ’s sense of insecurity  not strength  that has the leadership fulminating about Google .
When the Chinese government jostled with Google , young Chinese did n’t leave flowers at Zhongnanhai to show support .
Rather , they left flowers and supportive notes at Google ’s headquarters in Beijing .
“ Patriotic education ” and carefully nurtured nationalism mean that in many disputes between China and the West , the Chinese people and the Chinese government stand together .
We in the West see human rights in Tibet as a moral imperative and a rising renminbi as an economic imperative ; Chinese citizens and leaders alike see these issues as part of a 200 - year - long string of Western imperialist efforts to bully or dismember a fragile China .
But the Internet is different .
The Politburo does n’t want a free Internet , and the people do .
Mostly , I think we exaggerate the disaffection of Chinese toward their government .
Most Chinese citizens are n’t very political and are n’t deeply upset by the lack of a ballot  as long as living standards continue to improve .
And many Chinese prefer a local search engine , Baidu , to Google .
Still , ordinary Chinese are profoundly irritated by corruption , nepotism , lies , official arrogance  and hassles when they try to use the Internet .
The United States government has been reluctant to support financing for the proxy servers that enable Chinese or Iranians to leap firewalls .
That ’s because the most effective software to evade censorship was devised by Falun Gong , a religious group that is despised by the Chinese government .
The fear is that China would be outraged .
But we should n’t let that dissuade us , for we have a powerful interest in chipping away at firewalls that protect dictatorships .
The mood among young Chinese reminds me of Taiwan or South Korea or Indonesia in the 1980s , when an increasingly educated middle class  beneficiaries of enlightened economic policies of oppressive governments  grew to feel stifled and patronized by their governments .
Eventually , in each case they upended one - party rule and achieved a democracy .
Chinese leaders surely fear that parallel , and that is likely to be one of the reasons they are cracking down frantically on dissent .
But again , all this may be a sign of weakness , not strength .
The Communist Party ’s greatest success is the extraordinary economic changes it has ushered in over the last three decades with visionary policies and impressive governance .
Its greatest failing is its refusal to adjust politically to accommodate the middle class that it created .
And its greatest vulnerability is the way it increasingly neither inspires people nor terrifies them , but rather simply annoys them .

Taking advantage of the new Apps Marketplace
Posted by Nick Johnson | Filed under openid , app- engine , python , coding , tech , apps - marketplace , aeoid
The recently unveiled Apps Marketplace has been getting a lot of attention lately , and a lot of people are wanting to know how they can integrate their App Engine app with it , making use of its integrated single - signon support .
Today we 'll go over what 's required to get this working .
Apps Marketplace uses OpenID for SSO .
Fortunately , we can use the openid library , which provides a Users - API - Lookalike interface , to support this in App Engine .
There are two additional requirements for getting SSO to work in an Apps Marketplace app :
The realm defined in the application manifest must match the realm specified in the OpenID request .
The OpenID library must support the host - meta discovery method .
Handling the first of these is easy :
The aeoid library sets the realm of an OpenID request , by default , to the domain that the request was made over , so all we need to do is use that same domain name as the realm in our app 's manifest file .
The second is a little trickier .
The ' janrain ' python - openid library which aeoid and other Python - based solutions are based on does not support host - meta as a discovery mechanism for OpenID URLs .
Let 's analyze what this discovery method does , and see if we can find a way around it .
There are two tasks that this discovery method assists with .
The first is determining the OpenID URL for a user , given only their domain ( which is passed to us as a GET parameter by Google Apps ) .
The second is fetching more information about a user , once their OpenID URL is known .
Since we know that anyone coming from Google Apps will be using the Google OpenID endpoints , we can actually bypass the first part of this discovery process altogether .
Given the domain name passed in with the initial GET request , the OpenID URL to use is simply " https://www.google.com/accounts/o8/site-xrds?hd={{domain}} " .
By using this , we can completely skip the first part of the discovery process .
You can see this in action in aeoid 's demo app by visiting http://localhost:8080/apps_login?domain=yourdomain.com .
The second part of the discovery process is a bit tougher .
When the python - openid library completes the initial authentication process , and finds it needs additional information about the user , it engages in another discovery process to determine where it should go for that information .
This is where , ideally , it should start off by trying the host - meta discovery method , which permits discovery of this information even if the Apps user in question is not hosting their own discovery documents .
Since all of this occurs deep inside the openid library , there 's little we can do about it short of patching the library , either .
There remains one way around this , however : Have the Apps user host a standard openid discovery document on their domain .
The openid library can then use its standard discovery methods for this second phase of discovery , and everything proceeds as planned .
All that 's required is that they place a file called ' openid ' in the root of their domain - instructions are here .
With that present , the openid library will complete authentication as normal , and Apps users will seamlessly be logged into your app , without any prompting required .
The solution presented here is n't ideal , unfortunately - some Apps users will have to host a discovery document that they previously did n't have to care about .
Doing so is a fairly simple process , however , and until the python - openid library ( and other similar libraries ) add support for configurable discovery or the host - meta discovery method , this is likely the best option available .

CAPE CANAVERAL , Florida ( Reuters ) - NASA fleshed out plans on Thursday for a revamped U.S. space program that will focus initially on developing technology needed to send people to Mars .
The new program also aims to promote the development of commercial space taxi services and to ring the planet with satellites to monitor climate change .
The plans come as NASA prepares to end its space shuttle program later this year , which is expected to cost thousands of contracting jobs tied to the space program .
NASA officials said work on the new program would be spread out across the agency ’s 10 field centers , with the Johnson Space Center in Houston taking responsibility for a $ 6 billion , five - year program to oversee technology demonstrations .
The Kennedy Space Center in Florida will be in charge of a $ 5.8 billion , five - year effort to help private companies develop orbital transportation services .
Centers in Maryland , California and Ohio will manage an expanded Earth - observation campaign to keep tabs on climate change and its impact .
“ This is step one , to identify programs that are going to be funded by this budget , ” NASA Administrator Charlie Bolden said during a conference call with reporters .
President Barack Obama has proposed adding $ 2 billion to NASA ’s $ 18 billion annual budget for the year beginning October 1 , an increase Bolden said should result in more jobs .
“ We ’re expanding the amount of programs that we have so that we can try to put people to work who are interested in being part of the space program , ” Bolden said .
“ Are we going to be able to employ everybody that used to work in shuttle ?
No , we ’re not , but that was never a vision , ” he said .
“ A very serious and real concern for everyone is the jobs , but this is what we call progress .
Unfortunately , if you look at every area of technology in this country , as you advance , there are fewer and fewer manual - type jobs . ”
END OF SHUTTLE PROGRAM
NASA is retiring its three space shuttles in the fall due to cost and safety concerns after three more missions to finish outfitting the International Space Station , a $ 100 billion project of 16 nations that has been under construction since 1998 .
The new U.S. program extends the life of the space station until at least 2020 .
But thousands of contract employees in Florida alone are expected to lose their jobs due to the end of the shuttle program .
Obama ’s budget also cancels the Bush - era space exploration initiative known as Constellation , which aimed to return astronauts to the moon by 2020 .
An independent review determined the $ 108 billion program was severely underfunded , with no hope of reaching its goals .
Elements of the Constellation will likely be incorporated into the new programs , including development of heavy - lift rockets to send people , robots and cargo to asteroids , Mars and other destinations in the solar system , Bolden said .
Obama plans to discuss his proposal during an invitation - only conference at or near the Kennedy Space Center next Thursday .

Windows 7 reached the 10 % usage milestone almost a year faster than its berated predecessor , Vista , did , according to Web analytics company Net Applications .
But the growth of Windows 7 has yet to have an impact on Microsoft Corp .'s overall share of the operating system market , which returned to its usual downward trend last month after a one - month advance .
Windows dropped to a 91.6 % share , down half a percentage point from February .
The new operating system again grabbed share from both Windows XP and Vista , with the former losing twice as much , on a percentage basis , as the latter .
Windows XP slid to 64.5 % , down a full point , while Vista lost one - half of a percentage point to end at 16 % .
Vista appears to be on a fast slide to nowhere : March was the fifth consecutive month in which the beleaguered version of Windows lost share , and it was the sixth month of the last seven in which it did so .
If Vista maintains its trajectory from the last three months , it will drop under 10 % before the end of this year .
Windows 7's and Vista 's paths should cross in June , when Windows 7 is projected to become Microsoft 's second - most - used operating system .
Windows XP still accounts for the majority of the editions of Windows in use .
More than 70 % of the computers using Windows in March were running XP , which has three years of life left before Microsoft pulls the support plug in mid-April 2014 .
Windows 7 's gains show some signs of slowing , according to Aliso Viejo , Calif . - based Net Applications .
March 's 1.5 - point increase was slightly off the new operating system 's monthly average gain of 1.7 percentage points during the period from November 2009 to February 2010 .
Even so , Windows 7 beat Vista to the 10 % mark by nearly a year .
While Windows 7 reached the milestone just five months after its public release , Vista did n't hit that mark until May 2008 , 16 months after its retail debut .
Meanwhile , Mac OS
X's share of the operating system market rebounded by three - tenths of a percentage point last month , with Apple Inc. 's operating system ending the month with a 5.3 % share .
The increase countered a recent downward trend in which Mac OS X lost share in three out of the four previous months .
March 's increase was the largest for Mac OS X since December 2008 .
But for Vince Vizzaccaro , executive vice president of marketing at Net Applications , the news last month was n't the 10 % for Windows 7 but the continued increase in the use of mobile devices to go online .
By Net Applications ' numbers , mobile operating systems powered 1.7 % of the hardware used to access the Web ; that 's an increase of 0.15 of a percentage point , and double the mobile share of August 2009 .
" Mobile growth is now more a curve than a straight line , " observed Vizzaccaro .
Net Applications measures operating system use by analyzing the pool of about 160 million unique visitors each month to its clients ' sites .
March 's operating system data is available on the NetApplications.com

The other day we received an email support question asking if IDA Pro / Windbg debugger plugin works with VirtualKd , a tool that allows speeding up ( up to 45 x ) Windows kernel module debugging using VMWare and VirtualBox virtual machines .
After we installed and experimented with VirtualKd , our answer was “ yes , certainly ” .
This blog entry aims at illustrating how to configure VirtualKd to be used with IDA Pro / Windbg plugin and VMWare .
Installing VirtualKd
First download the VirtualKd package , unzip its contents and copy the contents of the ‘ target ’ folder to the VMWare guest OS and run ‘ vminstall.exe ’ .
After this step , reboot the guest and run the ‘ vmmon.exe ’ ( or ‘ vmmon64.exe ’ ) inside the host .
If everything is successful , you should see something like this :
Please take note of the ‘ Pipe name ’ value as shown in the screenshot .
We will use this value when configuring the Windbg plugin .
Configuring IDA Pro / Windbg plugin
First , run IDA
Pro without an input database and select Debugger / Attach / Windbg plugin :
Next , we get this screen :
Here we enter a connection string ( designating that the com port is a pipe ) .
The pipe name is the same value we read from the ‘ vmmon ’ tool from the above steps .
Before pressing OK , we need to make sure that the Windbg plugin is properly configured .
Let us verify that by pressing on the ‘ Debug options ’ button :
This dialog is used to configure the debugger in general , it is common to all debugger modules .
Since we do n’t need to change any of those settings now , let us instead select ‘ Set specific options ’ :
Make sure that these two options are properly configured :
Kernel debugging is selected Debugging tools path is correctly entered .
Please note that even if you ’re debugging an x64 kernel you still need to point to the x86 version of the debugging tools .
After we configured everything , simply press OK all the way until the attach dialog shows up :
Pressing OK one last time will start the debugging session :
After debugging for a while , we were really amazed at the speed improvement achieved with the help of VirtualKd ( nice work VirtualKd team ) .
Kernel debugging speed using the Windbg plugin is almost comparable to the local win32 debugger plugin .

When Massachusetts elected Republican Scott Brown to fill the Senate seat of the late Edward Kennedy , health care reform seemed doomed .
In truth , it was an opportunity , say the Democratic leaders who led the successful effort to pass the bill Sunday .
Before that moment , the entire process had focused on “ getting to 60 ” – crafting a bill that could get 60 votes in the Senate .
After a snowy January Tuesday in Massachusetts , however , a new strategy was born :
Pass the Senate bill in the House , then fix it .
If passing the fixes meant using the contentious and time - consuming process of reconciliation – which requires only a simple majority – so be it .
IN PICTURES : Health care reform passed : who Nancy Pelosi won and lost
“ Scott Brown ’s election was a turning point , ” says House majority whip James Clyburn ( D ) of South Carolina .
“ Losing 60 votes [ in the Senate ] got us to a more realistic place : that the number for health care had to be 50 plus one , not 60 . ”
“ I never thought the things we had to do to get to 60 could produce a good plan that the House would agree to , ” he added , citing the now - notorious deals included in the Senate bill to win over holdouts needed to get to 60 votes .
But that first step – getting 216 House Democrats to pass what many thought was an odious Senate health care bill – was a formidable one .
Thirty - seven sitting Democrats had voted against the House version of health care reform in November 2009 , and many found the Senate version even more objectionable .
With no GOP support , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had almost no room for error .
Here ’s a glimpse at how Speaker Pelosi and President Obama worked a diverse caucus to get to Sunday ’s 219 - to - 212 vote victory :
Congressman Kucinich opposed the House bill because its public option was not strong enough .
The Senate version is weaker still .
But hours of discussion with Mr. Obama – including a trip to Cleveland on Air Force One on March 15 – helped change his mind and shift momentum toward Democrats .
“ When I realized I could n’t get everything I wanted , the choice was :
Do you accept the bill as it is or just kill the bill – and with it , any chance of a serious discussion – because people wo n’t want to go there again , ” he said .
Kucinich says that what moved him was n’t any special deal for Cleveland , but concern for the impact of a defeat of health care to the Obama presidency .
“ I saw how he was really putting his presidency on the line , ” he added .
On Sunday night , he voted for the bill .
Congressman Stupak said he would oppose the Senate health care bill unless House leaders allowed a stand - alone vote to strengthen language in the Senate bill banning public funding of abortion services .

But after talks with Speaker Pelosi and the White House , Stupak accepted the compromise of a new executive order reaffirming the principle that taxpayer dollars not fund abortion services in the new system .
“ Although this legislation is not perfect and does not do everything I believe is necessary to reform our health insurance industry , it is a tremendous step forward for northern Michigan residents and for our nation , ” he said in a statement after the vote .
Stupak backed the bill Sunday .
A former consumer activist in Chicago who organized one 1989 protest that featured seniors chasing then - Rep. Dan Rostenkowski ( D ) of Illinois down the street , Congresswoman Schakowsky was a strong yes for health care reform .
But she was outraged by Stupak ’s proposal and told Pelosi that she and some 50 others would vote down the bill if Stupak were given the option of a stand - alone vote to strengthen anti-abortion language .
“ We have said from Day 1 that we are not going to allow this bill to set back women ’s access to abortion , ” she said .
Pelosi told the group that she was suspending talks with Stupak .
Pelosi ’s response “ made many of us feel much more reassured , ” Schakowsky said .
Schakowsky voted to pass the bill Sunday .
A lifelong liberal , Kaptur also strongly opposes public funding of abortions and lined up with Stupak .
“ I ’m trying to be constructive in this , ” she said .
“ We have to find a way to reaffirm the House language before the vote on the bill . ”
But at the same time , the plight of the uninsured has troubled her ever since her father had to give up his own grocery to take a job in a factory that ensured his family health coverage .
“ It was gut wrenching , ” she said .
“ I ’ll never forget what I felt for him to give up his life ’s dream . ”
She praised round - the - clock efforts by both House leadership and the White House to resolve this issue .
On Sunday , she voted yes .
A second revolt broke out in Democratic ranks after the Senate parliamentarian – who is seen as the authority on what provisions can be passed by reconciliation – said last week that geographic disparities that disadvantaged Wisconsin and 16 others could not be “ fixed ” under Senate rules for reconciliation .
“ Wisconsin has some of the highest quality outcome areas in the country , but among the lowest reimbursement rates , because we are not practicing volume medicine , ” he says .
Asked on Friday whether the group would actually vote down health care reform over this dispute , he said : “ Many of us are of the belief that this is the time .
This is it ....
A lot of votes are hinging on it . ”
Congressman Kind says that savings expected to come from wellness programs or improved quality of care are under - scored by the CBO .
“ The US is spending $ 80 billion a year on tests and procedures that do n’t work . ”

In response to these concerns , the White House agreed to step up efforts to educate the public on quality medicine as an alternative to fee - for - service .
The president also pledged to hold a summit on the issue in Washington .
Kind voted yes on healthcare Sunday .
Rep. Paul Hodes ( D ) of New Hampshire
Currently in a tough race for US Senate , Congressman Hodes told his constituents that he would carefully read the health care bill before committing to vote for it .
Like Kind , he is concerned about regional disparities in Medicare payments that disadvantage his state .
But the Live Free or Die state is also famously independent and distrustful of anything that smacks of big government .
“ I studied the bill carefully in its final form – all 2,407 pages of the bill and 154 pages of the reconciliation bill , ” he says .
In the end , he voted for the Senate bill and fixes , but analysts say he could pay a price for it at the polls .
According to a recent Rasmussen poll , 61 percent of New Hampshire voters think it would be better for the country if most incumbents were defeated in November .
Only 44 percent of New Hampshire voters favor national health reform .
“ I am confident that when people I represent and the American people fully understand the benefits of this bill whatever public sentiment there may be against it will change , ” he says .
“ This bill is a jobs bill . ”
Congressman Marshall is one of 13 members of the Democratic caucus who voted against leadership on the 2009 House health care reform bill , the climate change bill , and the Senate health care bill and fixes .
He is also one of the group Pelosi refers to as “ majority makers , ” whose views must be taken into account .
He is deeply concerned about the growth of federal deficits and says that the health care reform bill does far too little to rein in costs .
“ It ’s all very well intended , and millions will be helped by this , but how does this bill deal with increasing health care costs ?
It raises revenues , ” he says .
“ Sixty to 80 percent of our long - term debt problem is involved with health care .
We have missed quite an opportunity . ”
He voted no on health care reform , again .
A former ironworker with strong union ties , Congressman Lynch stunned Democrats when he announced opposition to the Senate bill : “ We ’re adding 33 million people to a system that ’s still as broken as it was before . ”
Lynch opposes a funding mechanism in the Senate bill that taxes high - end insurance plans , including many negotiated in union contracts .
He preferred the House measure , which taxed rich families .
He also objected to the absence of a public option in the House bill .
In recent days , he has withstood a personal meeting with Obama , an appeal from Vicki Kennedy ( Ted ’s widow ) , and a full court press just off the floor of the House from AFL - CIO leader Richard Trumka .
“ There ’s a difference between a compromise and a complete surrender , ” he said .
On Sunday night , he voted against the bill .

NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) --
It might be a telltale sign that , just as the U.S. economy starts adding jobs again and the Dow Jones Industrial Average nears 11,000 , retail investors have been making a quiet comeback into the market .
Steady retail trading activity since the start of the year from online brokers TD Ameritrade AMTD , +1.05 % , Schwab SCHW , +1.25 % , or E - Trade ETFC , +2.28 % , and positive flows into equity mutual funds over the past several weeks do point to rising participation , be it from day traders or the broad investing public .
It 's perhaps more telling , however , that the numbers remain subdued , along with the cheerleading of stocks so common at every level before the financial crisis .
On Monday , as the Dow industrials DJIA , +1.19 % toyed with the magic 11,000 level , the headlines on CNBC were fairly infrequent , and the pitch of commentators ' voices semi-contained -- all relatively speaking -- just as stocks meandered around in a muted celebration of the March U.S. jobs report and a jump in an index of the service sector of the economy .
Only one research note in this reporter 's mailbox promised Dow 12,000 was now in sight .
These muted signs are as good as any that " irrational exhuberance " is still some distance away for stocks .
They 're also a good sign that various commentators -- be they brokers , analysts or economists at investment banks -- are n't catering to the broad investing public as much as they did before the financial crisis .
There are obvious good reasons for this .
Trillions of dollars of investor money vanished into thin air during the crisis , and the financial hardships and trauma of the public cannot be simply wished away .
And while stocks , as measured by the broad S&P 500 index SPX , +0.82 % , have rallied 75 % since hitting 12 - year lows in March 2009 , the move has taken place with shell - shocked retail investors largely absent .
They should n't be expected to return massively any time soon , either .
Over the past two decades , a stock rally of this magnitude without the participation of retail investors would have been inconceivable , says Vincent Deluard , global equity strategist at TrimTabs , a research firm that tracks investment flows .
" This is very , very unusual , " he says .
" Normally , retail investors buy when markets are rising .
It 's a big selling point .
But this time , people expecting that a big wall of money is going to come and sweep the markets are mistaken . "
According to the Investment Research Institute , a research group representing the investment fund industry , equity funds saw estimated inflows of $ 294 million for the week ended March 24 , representing the fifth straight week of inflows .
For the whole month of March , equity mutual funds saw net inflows of $ 11.7 billion , according to TrimTabs .
That compares with inflows of $ 110 million in February .
But putting things in perspective , it 's still a far cry from the average $ 40 billion monthly inflows experienced during the go - go days of the 1990s , which saw an explosion in 401 ( k ) s and mutual - fund investing , says TrimTabs ' Deluard .
Even as stocks began to recover from the Internet stock bubble , inflows never came back to such heights .
If they rise again now after the latest crisis -- should the economic recovery and jobs growth continue -- " we eventually might reach an average of $ 10 billion a month , but it'd be surprised if we do more than that , " the TrimTabs analyst says .
Volatility , as measured by the VIX VIX , - 2.16 % , the CBOE Market Volatility Index otherwise known as the market 's fear gauge , has sunk back to pre-crisis levels , another reason why day traders seeking risk are n't rushing to make bets via online brokers .
Change in equity culture ?
Beyond the fresh trauma of the crisis and recession , the primary reason why more retail investors wo n't embrace stocks as before is due to demographics , according to Deluard .
In the 1990s , baby boomers reached their maximum earnings potential , but they now need less equities and more fixed - income .
For the younger generations , still shouldering student and other household debt , " it 's going to be an uphill battle " to invest in equities , Deluard says .
This is especially true given that post - boomer generations have now seen " stocks drop more than 50 % twice in the past 10 years , which is not inspiring , " he says .
For the time being , professionals at investment banks , funds , and other investing institutions , have been and remain firmly in control of this low - volume market .
Unlike day traders , portfolio managers tend to buy in large chunks and rather infrequently and most professional investors tend to look to future expectations .
Long - term retail investors , by contrast , tend to look in the rearview mirror .
This partly explains the oft - mentioned dissonance of the 2009 low - volume rally taking place while the economy was mired in recession .
Meanwhile , bond and hybrid mutual funds , which have performed so well during the crisis , remain much more appealing in the retail rearview mirror .

That 'll be the Adept Quattro , a machine claiming the title of being the world 's fastest industrial pick and place robot .
On the evidence of today 's video , we 're not going to argue .
Being demonstrated as part of the first National Robotics Week , the Quattro took on a WiiMote - controlled moving platform and still effortlessly conducted its job at a pace that would make even Usain Bolt feel inadequate .
The person controlling the platform tries his best to confuse the machine with rapid changes of direction , but whatever he does , the chips are placed and removed from their repositories with unerring precision .
Go past the break to see the Quattro in action .
BEIJING —
In a photograph on his lawyer ’s Web site , Ma Yaohai stares straight at the camera , cheekbones prominent above sunken cheeks , his expression intense , almost haunted .
The 53 - year - old computer scientist , dressed soberly in a dark jacket and polo - neck pullover , holds a sign saying : “ Swinging is no crime . ”
Unfortunately for Mr. Ma , it is .
Article 301 of China ’s criminal law bans “ crowd promiscuity , ” with offenders liable to five years in jail .
On April 7 , Mr. Ma and 21 other members of his swingers ’ circle were tried in the central city of Nanjing on group sex charges , in a case that is roiling society and provoking heated debates in academic circles , among friends and in the blogosphere .
Prosecutors accuse the twice - divorced Mr. Ma , who has since been fired from his job as a professor at Nanjing University of Technology , of organizing and taking part in at least 18 group sex parties between 2007 and 2009 .
Fourteen were in his own home , four in hotels and the rest in unspecified locations , according to his lawyer , Xue Huogen .
No verdict has yet emerged from the two - day trial , during which Mr. Ma was the only defendant to plead not guilty .

The number of narwhal in Baffin Bay is estimated at more than twice the previous figure after a recent survey using new techniques , say scientists with the Department of Fisheries and Oceans .
Previously estimated at between 20,000 and 30,000 , the Baffin Bay population is now said to be more than 60,000 .
One of the new surveying techniques involves a formula to estimate the number of narwhal below the surface at any given time , says Pierre Richard , a research scientist with the Department of Fisheries and Ocean .
Past surveys counted only whales on the ocean surface , not those beneath it , he said .
For the most recent count , researchers attached trackers to more than a dozen whales .
" We found that narwhal on average spent one - third of their time at the surface .
So for every animal that you would see at the surface , there are another two below the surface , " said Richard .
" In other words , you have to multiply the numbers you estimate at the surface by three to get the total population - that 's approximate . "
The chair of the Hunters and Trappers Organization in Pond Inlet , Jayko Alooloo , says the new numbers are not a surprise .
Still , he says there are fewer whales in certain places , such as Eclipse Sound .
Alooloo says hunters worry that increased marine traffic , snowmobiles , and the placing of trackers on whales is causing narwhal to bypass former hunting zones .
In fact , hunters are harvesting fewer whales than before .
Alooloo says they took only 72 last summer even though they have a quota for 130 narwhal .
Meanwhile , Richard says while the new data is more accurate , it 's still important to remember the numbers represent averages , and that any changes in quota should consider the most conservative estimates .
The manual contains frank assessments of the strengths and weaknesses of the U.S. Army including its training and equipment .

As Congress nears its historic showdown on health reform , a new state - by - state survey highlights how middle - class Americans were hit by the insurance crisis even before the worst of the recession took hold .
Here are some of the key findings of " Barely Hanging On : Middle - Class and Uninsured , " which the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation released today .
The analysis , based on U.S. Census data from 2000 to 2008 , defines middle class as families earning roughly $ 45,000 to $ 85,000 .
• Between 2000 and 2008 , more than 2 million middle - class people became uninsured .
Their ranks rose to 12.9 million of the estimated 46.3 million Americans without health insurance . •
At a time when median household income fell 2.5 % , a worker paid an average 81 % more for a family policy as employers shifted the cost of premium increases .
•
In 2008 , 12 % of middle - class workers had job at companies that did not offer insurance , while 22 % of workers at firms that offered health insurance were ineligible for coverage .
The San Francisco Chronicle looks at the situation in California , which differs significantly from the rest of the country on several measures .
( Posted by Michael Winter )
First , the positives .
The Capitals have the most wins in the league ( 51 ) , the fewest regulation losses ( 15 ) , and the most goals scored ( 301 ) .
The team with the second most goals is the Vancouver Canucks and they have scored over 40 fewer goals than the Capitals .
Their power - play is also dynamic , clicking at a 25.4 % rate , which is good enough for first in the league .
They also get a lot of opportunities on the power - play ( fifth most of all playoff teams ) , which is likely a product of being a team that is relentless in their attack .
The Capitals have also been on fire since the Olympic break .
They only have two regulation losses over the past 16 games .
Teams tend to carry the momentum from the regular season into the playoffs and the Capitals record of late bodes well for future success .
At first I thought maybe their win total was inflated by playing in the brutal South East Division , where the Capitals are 18 - 3 - 2 , but the Caps play just as well against the rest of the Eastern Conference .
They are 10 - 4 - 4 against the North East Division and 13 - 3 - 3 against the Atlantic Division .
Against the Western Conference they are 10 - 5 - 3. Oh , and they also have Alex Ovechkin , who is the most talented player in the NHL today .
He has 46 goals and 102 points in a mere 68 games .
They also have Mike Green , who is the NHL ’s bestdefenceman .
Green has 74 points in 73 games , which is almost unheard of for a defenceman in today ’s game .
Now , the negatives .
They do take the fourth most shots in the league ( 32.7 ) , but they give up 30.9 , which is the 18th most in the league .
This just shows that they like to play a run and gun style of game , which I ’m not convinced works exceptionally well in the playoffs .
They also let in a lot of goals .
They have given up 222 goals , tied for 17th best in the league with the Pittsburgh Penguins .
However , this is only tied for sixth best of all Eastern Conference playoff teams and tied for second worst of all playoff teams .
Those stats do n’t exactly prove Umberger wrong .
Another stat that does not favour the Capitals is their penalty kill percentage .
They only kill off 78.6 % of penalties , which is the 6th worst in the league .
The only playoff team with a worse rate is the Nashville Predators , who only kill off 2.6 % more penalties than the Maple Leafs .
This low penalty kill percent is somewhat mitigated by the lack of penalties they actually take .
The Capitals have only taken 361 penalties all year , which is the ninth best in the league .
These stats suggest that the Capitals are not a very good defensive team .
They seem to me like a bunch of puck sharks .
Not really fully committed to defence , instead perpetually awaiting breakaway passes and one - timers .
Their defence is also led by Mike Green , undoubtedly offensively prolific , but not really a defenceman in my eyes .
He ’s playing some hybrid position in between forward and defence ( which I have been calling the Puck Hawk – no real concern for positioning , just always hunting the puck – not the most defensive way to play ) .
But it is hard to argue against their 51 wins this season .
Their style of play has worked tremendously during the regular season .
However , for the past two seasons they have been in the top - 10 in goals forward , while allowing as many goals as they have this season .
Both those seasons the Capitals were eliminated prematurely .
In 2008 they were beat in seven games by the Flyers in the first round and last year they were beat in seven games by the Penguins in the second round .
This is not entirely surprising considering they were ( and still are ) a very young team making their first few trips to the post - season .
The Penguins were defeated in five games in 2007 during their first trip to the post - season and they did not realize exactly the type of effort required to win until they lost in the Stanley Cup Final the next year to the Detroit Red Wings .
Last year ’s second round defeat to the Pittsburgh Penguins could act as a similar motivating factor for the Capitals .
They saw what it takes to win ( from their bitter rivals , no less ) and made depth moves in the off - season to supplement their talented core .
One of the better moves was acquiring Mike Knuble , who has played in 41 career playoff games and plays the hard , physical style required for playoff success .
If players like Ovechkin , Green , Semin , and Backstrom did n’t realize the sacrifice and commitment needed to win then hopefully adding a player like Knuble will show them .
When asked about Umberger ’s comments Mike Green said , " We play an aggressive game , but that 's why we 're so successful during the season .
It 's obviously a different style , but now having played two , three years in the playoffs , we really understand what it takes . ” via ( The Washington Post That should be an indication that the Capitals are willing to change their run and gun style and commit to defence for the playoffs , although their coach did n’t suggest as much .
Bruce Boudreau said , “ I like the fact that as a coach , I 've got a few championships under my belt playing this way , so we 'll leave it at that . " via ( The Washington Post This is troubling because he must be referencing his 1999 ECHL Championship or his 2006 AHL championship .
Umm , I do n’t think run and gun success in those leagues necessarily translates to the NHL , Bruce .
A three - year - old in Wilson County , Tennessee died Sunday evening after accidentally shooting herself in the abdomen with a weapon she may have mistaken for a plastic Wii facsimile .

At least that 's how the news is being reported today in The Tennessean .
Three - year - old Cheyenne Alexis McKeehan had been playing a Nintendo Wii game in her living room using a gun-shaped controller which , according to the story , " looked very similar to the real handgun " her stepfather used to scare away dogs that were hanging about the family 's home .
The child had been playing a Nintendo Wii video game , Ashe said .
The game 's controller was shaped like a gun that looked very similar to the real handgun , which her stepfather had put on a table in the living room .
Ashe said the girl pulled the gun off the table and it went off .

My question is this : why is the Wii even mentioned in this article ?
Someone left a loaded handgun in reach of a three - year - old girl .
That 's the story here .
The fact that the child was playing with a Wii controller that looked like a real gun is a non-issue .
This is a three - year - old we are talking about .
Three - year - olds touch everything , regardless of whether or not it looks like something they were allowed to touch previously .

Not to mention the fact that most Wii gun controllers are either white and blue or Nerf - colored , none of which is a color commonly found on handguns .
This story is horrible , unfortunate , and tragic , but the way that things are worded here make me wonder if there are n't pair of parents out there thinking that had they not let their child play that Wii game , she would still be alive today .

I do n't think the majority of our readership needs clarification on this , but just in case , no - if her stepfather had not left a loaded weapon within reach of a curious three - year - old 's hands , she would still be alive today .
Accidental shooting kills Wilson County child [ The Tennessean ]
Ever since tiny bits of genetic material known as microRNA were first characterized in the early 1990s , scientists have been discovering just how important they are to regulating the activity of genes within cells .
A new study now shows that microRNAs do n't just control the activity of genes within a given cell , they also can move from one cell to another to send signals that influence gene expression on a broader scale .
Researchers at the Duke Institute for Genome Sciences & Policy ( IGSP ) , in collaboration with groups at the Universities of Helsinki and Uppsala and the Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research at Cornell University , made the discovery while working out the intricate details of plant root development in Arabidopsis , a highly - studied mustard plant .
Although they still do n't know exactly how the microRNAs travel , it appears that this mobility allows them to play an important developmental role in sharpening the boundaries that define one plant tissue from another .
" To our knowledge , this is the first solid evidence that microRNAs can move from one cell to another , " said Philip Benfey , director of the Duke IGSP Center for Systems Biology .
The findings , which appear in an advanced online publication of the journal Nature on April 21 , add microRNA to the list of mobile molecules , including hormones , proteins and other forms of small RNA , that allow for essential communication between cells in the process of organ development .
They also add a new element to the already complex interplay in Arabidopsis roots between two proteins , known as Scarecrow and Short - root , that Benfey 's team had described in earlier work .
Those proteins interact and restrain one another to allow the assembly of a waterproofing layer of cells that ultimately enables plants to control precisely how much water and nutrients they take in .
The researchers now show that Short - root moves from cells in the plant 's inner vasculature out into the waterproofing endodermis that surrounds it to activate Scarecrow .
Together , those two transcription factors ( genes that control other genes ) activate microRNAs , known as MIR165a and 166b .
Those microRNAs then head back toward the vascular cells , meeting and degrading another transcription factor ( called Phabulosa ) as well as other regulatory factors along the way .
" Dr. Benfey and his colleagues have shown how two modes of gene regulation work together across cellular borders to ensure the proper patterning of plant root tissues , " said Susan Haynes of the NIH 's National Institute of General Medical Sciences , which partially funded the study .
" This study provides important insight into how cells communicate positional information to orchestrate the complex process of tissue and organ development . "
" Now we know that microRNAs can and do move to form gradients in the context of plant development , " Benfey added .
" It adds a new dimension to gene regulation . "
According to Benfey , history suggests this kind of two - way communication involving microRNAs in the developing root is likely to be a more general phenomenon .
" Just about everything in biology that once seemed particular sooner or later proves to be more general , " he said .
He said there 's also reason to think that the specific regulatory interactions they 've uncovered were key in the evolutionary transition from single - celled algae to land plants .
" Formation of vascular tissue with a surrounding endodermal layer that acts as waterproofing was a key milestone in the evolution of land plants , " Benfey said .
" Without a tube to conduct water , you can't grow a tree or a sunflower . "

More than 80 schoolgirls in Kunduz were taken ill
Scores of schoolgirls in the Afghan province of Kunduz have fallen ill over the past week , in what authorities allege is mass poisoning by insurgents .
On Sunday , 13 girls were taken ill .
This follows two separate incidents earlier in the week when about 70 girls complained of dizziness and nausea .
An inquiry has already begun , health officials told the BBC .
The Taliban - which oppposes female education - denies carrying out an attack , the Reuters news agency says .
The girls said they noticed a strange smell in class before the onset of their symptoms , but health officials said the gas remains unidentified .
None of the symptoms experienced by the girls are reported to to be serious .
The incidents all involved different schools .
In May 2009 , Afghan authorities launched an investigation after about 90 schoolgirls fell ill in Kapisa province .
Although officials suspected deliberate poisoning , the results of the inquiry were inconclusive .
In recent years there has been an increase in attacks on schoolgirls in Afghanistan , mainly in the south and east of the country where several acid attacks on schoolgirls have been reported .
Girls were banned from attending school during the rule of the Taliban , who were overthrown in the American - led invasion of 2001 .
The only way to get to the good ideas was to trudge through all the obvious and bad ones first .
( CNN ) --
A vaccine treatment for prostate cancer has become the first therapy of its kind to win approval for use in U.S. patients .
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Provenge , a novel technique for fighting prostate cancer , on Thursday .
The treatment involves taking a patient 's own white blood cells and using a drug that trains them to more actively attack cancer cells .
" It 's a landmark in the sense that it would be the first approved cell - based immune therapy , " said Dr. Nina Bhardwaj , director of the tumor vaccine program at New York University Langone Medical Center , who is not involved with Provenge or its maker , Dendreon Corp .
The treatment is intended only for men with so - called " metastatic castration - resistant " prostate cancer , for whom hormone suppressant therapy has not worked .
Studies have shown that Provenge prolongs survival by about four to 4.5 months .
But the real breakthrough is the approval of this new way of treating disease , which could be used for other cancers and conditions , such as HIV , Bhardwaj said .
" It 's a major conceptual advance ; it 's a modest therapeutic advance , " said Dr. Christopher Logothetis , prostate cancer researcher at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center .
Logothetis testified to an FDA panel in 2007 about the drug , but has no financial ties to Dendreon .
It is unclear whether insurance companies will cover the cost of Provenge and it may be prohibitively expensive for some , Bhardwaj said .
Dendreon says it will be priced similarly to other new biologics that prolong survival .
Investment firm J.P. Morgan estimates a full course of Provenge will cost $ 65,000 ; estimates by other investors put it between $ 50,000 and $ 100,000 , according to J.P. Morgan .
Cancer drugs Avastin and Erbitux , also based on new concepts in treating different kinds of cancer , cost up to $ 100,000 per year .
" In this whole scheme of things , [ Provenge is ] costly , but not unheard of , " Bhardwaj said .
Provenge is the first cancer treatment vaccine that the FDA has approved .
Although Provenge is considered a vaccine , it is a treatment for patients who already have prostate cancer , rather than a preventive measure , said Dr. David Penson , assistant professor of urologic surgery at Vanderbilt University , who was an investigator in a Provenge clinical study and has presented the research , but has no financial ties to the company .
The Provenge process involves taking out some of the patient 's white blood cells and sending them to a facility where they are activated with Provenge .
The infusion is sent back , and a physician delivers it to the patient intravenously .
A complete course of therapy takes three cycles in one month .
A phase 3 clinical trial called IMPACT , involving 512 men with castration - resistant prostate cancer , found that Provenge reduced the risk of death by 22.5 percent compared with a placebo .
The IMPACT study also found that the treatment extended the lives of patients by an average of 4.1 months ; a separate trial with 225 men found an average life extension of 4.5 months .
Clinical trials also found that 33 percent of patients with advanced disease remained alive three years after treatment with Provenge .
" This is a significant improvement in survival , and is more significant in that it is a new way of treating prostate cancer , " said Dr. Otis Brawley , chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society , in an e-mail .
Brawley and Logothetis said they will prescribe the therapy for patients who fit the criteria .
Because the treatment makes use of the patient 's own cells , it does not cause the severe side effects seen in chemotherapy , Penson said .
The main side effects seen for Provenge were flu - like symptoms , such as chills and fever , lasting one to two days .
Docetaxel , a chemotherapy drug that is the only available alternative for these patients , is toxic to the body , and can lead to infection , muscle and bone pain , and hair loss , he said .
Potentially , Provenge could one day be used in combination with chemotherapy , Penson said .
Right now it is prostate - cancer specific , but the principle behind it may be applicable to other cancers , he said .
The treatment has had an long journey on the way to approval .
An FDA advisory panel reviewed Provenge in 2007 and voted in favor of it , but the agency declined to approve it , requesting more data .
Logothetis also recommended additional research at that time .
Concerns surrounded the drug because although the initial studies showed a survival benefit , they did not demonstrate a delayed progression of cancer , Logothetis said .
Usually , both of these benefits are seen in proven cancer therapies .
" Since the traditional measures of efficacy are not seen in these studies , it has created initial skepticism , " Logothetis said .
But given the survival benefit found in the later results , there is now little doubt that the treatment works , he said .
The question is why it works without delaying tumor progression .
The results could mean that the drug resists negative effects of cancer rather than cancer growth , he said .
Alternatively , the slowing of the tumor 's growth may be too small to measure with available tools .
It is also possible that the mechanism is entirely different , changing the tumor in some way that scientists do not yet understand .
Other promising research may have been stifled for similar reasons , Logothetis said .
" You can assume that many trials that would have been beneficial were stopped early because there was no effect on progression on the tumor , " Logothetis said .
One concern now is capacity , because Dendreon 's facilities initially wo n't be able to handle the demand , Logothetis said .
The company intends to make Provenge available through about 50 centers , all of which were approved clinical trial sites , and plans to expand its existing manufacturing facility in New Jersey , said Dendreon spokeswoman Katherine Stueland .
The expansion should be done by early 2011 , and the company is also building facilities in Los Angeles , California , and Atlanta , Georgia , which should be complete in mid-2011 , she said .

The U.S. media proclaimed Iraq ’s March 7 election a vindication of the U.S. occupation before the voting even ended .
But the reality is different .
Michael Schwartz , the author of War Without End : The Iraq War in Context spoke with SocialistWorker.org ’s Eric Ruder about what the media failed to grasp — and put recent events into a broader regional context .
U.S. OFFICIALS are trumpeting Iraq ’s elections on March 7 , 2010 , as a triumph for democracy in the Middle East .
But the Iraqi government of Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki showed its weakness , both before the election , and during the results .
OF COURSE it 's a completely shaded election .
In the run-up to the election , there was an interesting kind of ambivalence , let 's call it , on the part of the Maliki administration about this election .
On the one hand , they spent the last year or so trying to woo local groups that they thought would allow the government , which exists only in the Green Zone , to appeal to the many Sunni and Shia constituencies that were angry at the central government and at the U.S .
At the same time , they began arresting many of the leaders of the Sunni Awakening movement , in an effort to create a double - bind situation in which the local leadership that developed in the Sunni areas would have a choice between going to jail or supporting him .
Toward the end of the election campaign , Maliki tried another strategy — to disqualify key election candidates , especially Sunni leaders .
This was aborted by various protests — including , apparently , from the U.S. , which found the response too dangerous .
Despite the disqualification of a major Sunni leader , the alliance that included the most prominent excluded opposition leader emerged from the election with a tremendous proportion of the vote .

One important question to ask , and I do n't know the answer to it , comes out of the wholesale stealing of the election that took place in Afghanistan .
Maliki would certainly have liked to have that kind of a victory , even if it had to be stolen , but there does appear to be the incapacity to actually commit that kind of crime , given that there certainly was enough motivation to do so .
Since the U.S. was probably not the deterrent , his failure to attempt wholesale fraud must reflect the strength of the opposition .
There are various forms of opposition that exist in Iraq at this point -- the mostly dormant Sunni insurgency ; the somewhat more visible institutional resistance in some Sunni and many Shia areas often embedded in local government ; and what might be called the parliamentary resistance , consisting of parliamentarians who are representative of the local interests that elected them , and therefore are willing to stand up to both the Americans and Maliki — though their power to accomplish much more than verbal opposition is limited .
Less visible is the institutional resistance residing in various parts of the national government — notably the national oil companies , and the weakened but not eliminated agencies in charge of such matters at electricity and internal security ; the labor movement , which has rejuvenated and is increasingly active ; and various tribal and religious groupings that are either outside or partially involved in formal politics .
I think we have to say that this kind of multifaceted resistance floating through Iraqi society is exercising quite a bit of impact on the behavior of the government and the occupation .
Virtually all these elements oppose the current policies of the Maliki administration , both with regard to oil — the big news in Iraq — and its posture toward the U.S. presence .
The U.S. government did not support Maliki 's more militant efforts at fixing the election , but it did n’t oppose them either .
And American officials have at least rhetorically accepted the preliminary results of an election that appears to be headed toward replacing Maliki with a new administration less friendly to U.S. influence .
The presumptive winners want absolutely no alteration of the withdrawal process .
They want radically changed government policies .
And they have — at least rhetorically — registered their resistance to the oil deals because of their accommodation with international oil companies .
Of course , the U.S. complains that these arrangements are not sufficiently accommodating .
So it does look like the outcome of the election is going to create yet another set of problems for the U.S. ambition that Iraq become the headquarters of U.S. hegemony in the Middle East .
But these difficulties may not even approach what the U.S. military says it fears : a “ breakdown ” of order .
Keep in mind that this government has almost no presence outside the Green Zone .
Whatever debates occur will largely be about Green Zone policies that have only tangential impact in the rest of the country , with the exception of the policies involving oil , which could — if they produce new revenues — result in resources that could have a profound impact on daily life .
So it 's very hard to know what the effect of the election will be .
There will certainly be a fight over what kind of government to form .
And it may , in fact , emerge that Maliki will be the technical leader of the government , even though the parliamentary majority will favor ousting him .
The final outcome will be the result of a lot of political horse - trading in parliament .
I think that the reality for Iraq in the next five years will be more determined by what happens on the ground than what happens in parliament , or what is decided in the Green Zone where Maliki and the American diplomatic leadership reside .
INITIALLY , THE mainstream media reported the election as a major victory for the followers of Moktada al Sadr .
The New York Times ran a piece full of alarm about Sadr ’s “ unpredictability , ” but of course their real concern was not his unpredictability , but as the story also said , his “ steadfast … opposition to any ties with the United States . ”
Some two weeks later , a new story line has emerged : the growing struggle between Maliki and Allawi , the U.S. puppet who lived in exile for nearly 30 years before returning to become prime minister of the interim government set up by the U.S. A Los Angeles Times article even quoted an unnamed U.S. official who said it ca n’t be ruled out that Maliki might declare martial law .
MALIKI ’S THREATS to declare martial law appear to be empty to me .
In effect , he has already imposed martial law , insofar as he has been willing to send troops to various places to crush dissent .
If he were able to effectively silence dissent , he would have tried to do so before the election , since he has known for months that a fair election would net his fragile alliance less than the majority he needs to guarantee continued rule .
So why would he now decide to use martial law and more extensive military intervention than he has been using ?
So I think that might be posturing .
On the other hand , his rhetoric may reflect behind - the - scenes maneuvering by the U.S.
This could be the first — or really a continuing — effort to justify continued U.S. military intervention , beyond the December 2011 deadline , when all the U.S. troops are supposed to be out .
We know that the leadership in the Obama regime is not interested in removing all the U.S. troops .
They want to have about 50,000 troops there , which was the original goal from before the war .
They want to have five enduring bases , which are already built and functioning with no sign of decline .
They want to have 2,000 diplomats inside Iraq , housed in the billion - dollar embassy located in the Green Zone , running the headquarters of the American Empire in the Middle East .
And so maybe this is going to be the occasion when the promise to fully withdraw is officially reversed .
All along , when the question was put to American military commanders about whether U.S. troops in Iraq were more needed in Afghanistan , the answer was , “ No , they ca n’t leave yet .
We have to wait until we see that the election aftermath does n’t create a new crisis . ”
To me , the subtext to that was that the election might produce a result that was going to be unacceptable to the U.S. , and they might need the military to reverse the result .
So it may be that when we hear Maliki say , " I 'm going to have to declare martial law " and " Allawi is so unruly " and “ He ca n't control his people " and “ The Sunnis are going to start fighting again , " it may be the expression of Obama administration anxiety about the negative result they had always feared .
Declaring martial law would be , nevertheless , an unprecedented step .
The Bush administration ’s approach was always more cautious than that .
Declaring martial law and using the military to reverse the election result would be a departure in a much more militant direction .
There were several times when it was very clear that the Maliki administration was not behaving the way the Bush administration wanted it to behave .
And , among U.S. military planners , there was all this talk about a coup d'état to replace him .
But they restrained themselves because the threat of rebellion made it too dangerous to try .
There were also various moments when Maliki wanted to use heavy military troops in order to consolidate his power , and the U.S. restrained him more often than they allowed him to do so .
So this would be a departure from the traditional American policy there .
Given the kind of desperation — and possible failure — of such a move , I do not think that they will try it .
But neither would I exclude it , because in some ways this is the most desperate situation the U.S. has faced during its almost continuous crisis in Iraq .
The whole goal of Iraq as the U.S. imperial headquarters could be slip - sliding away .
At some point , they may have to decide whether they want to re-escalate the war in order to try to re-pacify Iraq , or allow it to slip away .
So it 's not impossible that that could occur .
MY THINKING was that if a U.S. official is saying Maliki might declare martial law , that 's essentially a declaration that the U.S. did n't get the result it wanted .
And if the anti-U.S. currents headed by Allawi and Sadr are the chief contenders to displace Maliki , then perhaps the easiest thing to do would be to have Maliki bring down the hammer .
This in turn gives the U.S. a perfect pretext for ripping up the status of forces agreement ( SOFA ) that mandates the exit of U.S. troops by the end of 2011 .
YES , I agree that this logic has to be at least part of their thinking .
But they may have a less dramatic way of ripping up the SOFA .
They have said many times in the past that Maliki may feel that he needs to have an American presence , even if there 's no disruption , for deterrence of internal rebellion or external attack .
If Maliki can be returned to power or even act before he leaves office , they can make it look like the U.S. troops are there by invitation .
Such a course of action , however , might also trigger vigorous , even violent , resistance .
The bottom line is that the equation of forces that 's emerging after this election are very negative from the point of view of the U.S. — and that the Obama administration may decide it will need some kind of military action to reorient the forces into a more acceptable profile .
That , I think , is quite plausible .
In this context , it is important to note that the Sadrists have made very clear their non-negotiable stance that the U.S. should get all the way out .
In addition , the Sadrists have been very militant all along about opposing the presence of foreign companies in Iraq ’s oil fields .
They want a nationalized oil industry .
So that 's a double - whammy , as far as the U.S. is concerned .
The U.S. has given them any number of opportunities in the last six months to modify their stance vis-à - vis the U.S. presence .
And while the Sadrists have given ground in a lot of places , they have n't given ground on these two points .
Insofar as they will have major influence on the newly formed government , it seems likely that they will successfully demand hostility toward a continuing U.S. military presence .
Five years ago , Iyad Allawi was an honest - to - goodness American puppet , but he ’s remade himself as a fierce nationalist .
As leader of what has emerged as the largest single voting block in the new parliament , his distinctly anti-American stance is highly significant .
And like the Sadrists , he is also very critical of the oil deals .
If Allawi and Sadr are able to make a deal and take control of the government — it looks like they will together be just short of a majority , but well short of the two - thirds needed to form a government — the newly formed government would almost certainly seek to gain full control over what could be dramatically increased oil revenues .
This is in contrast to Maliki , who might be willing to allow international oil corporations to control the oil .
This could produce a newly powerful Iraqi government capable of working with Iran to establish a regional power bloc — the worst nightmare for the U.S.
Just the possibility of this development would be reason enough for the Obama administration to be really worried .
It 's an interesting question .
Another element to take into consideration is the question of what forces are governing in the various sections of Baghdad outside the Green Zone and in the various regions and rural areas throughout Iraq .
In some places , there is none .
And in other places , you can say that government is provided by local formations that have arisen in this period .
So in Basra , for example , there is almost a city government , but not quite .
It 's a bunch of neighborhoods that are governed by the various local groups that developed roots over the past few years .
The Sadrists rule in some neighborhoods , but they 've been dislodged in some places .
The Fadhila Party [ a Shia party that came out of , but is now a rival to , the Sadrists ] rules in many neighborhoods .
The Supreme Council has almost nothing on the ground .
In other smaller cities , there are coherent leadership groups .
Many of these quasi governments are headed by local leadership without any national presence or affiliation .
This is particularly true where tribes have gained leadership ; they can be locally powerful and well organized , especially when they have strong ties to the mosques and especially in the Sunni areas .
So local areas can have coherent government , but remain structurally and politically independent from the national government isolated in the Green Zone .
These local formations constantly make demands on the national government , calling for their share of oil revenues and for oil resources to be put under their authority .
So far they have had little success in claiming oil revenues , but much more success in harvesting local resources .
In Basra , for example , the local government has captured the electrical production facilities and withheld electricity from the national grid in order to serve local needs .
In Anbar , the local communities have siphoned off oil from pipelines and trucks and used black market revenues to finance everything from local projects to the insurgency to criminal gangs .
It ’s entirely possible that the quasi-alliance that the Sadrists are a part of , or a potential future quasi-alliance between the Sadrists and Allawi 's group , would really just be an expression of the local groups working together on a rather uncertain basis to assert a national policy .
And that national policy could then serve as a vehicle by which a real national government could be built .
From the U.S. point of view , such a “ bottom - up ” government could be extremely dangerous , because the one thing that such a government surely would be is highly nationalist .
That is exactly what the U.S. invaded Iraq to get rid of .
So there could be a renewal of American aggression , a re-invasion of those local areas that form the power base for these various formations , targeting especially the Sadrists , but also the local Sunni base of Allawi in order to eliminate their institutional foundation .
This is , in effect , what the original war was all about , and the new war could look quite similar , including patrols , home invasions and wholesale destruction of buildings “ harboring ” insurgents .
This seems like a remote possibility , but the shape of the situation may lead U.S. planners to consider this as a last ditch strategy to avoid being asked to fully withdraw .
MALIKI ’S RESPONSE to the strong showing for Allawi is to assert that Allawi , though he is a Shia , had strong ties to Saddam Hussein ’s Ba’ath Party and that Allawi is intent on restoring Ba’athist rule , that is , Sunni rule over the Shia .
So Maliki , who previously portrayed himself as more secular , is now playing the sectarian card .
Related to this is the affinity between Sadr and the rest of the Shia parties in Iraq and the Shia regime in Iran .
What role do you think this kind of sectarian logic is playing in Iraqi politics today ?
SUNNIS IN Iraq do not have nationally visible leadership groups who aspire to represent their sectarian interest .
Starting in 2003 , the U.S. military has systematically targeted any group with such aspirations , except the handful of quislings who supported the U.S. attacks against the Sunni insurgency .
These quislings , who pretended to represent Sunni interests in the previous parliament , have been hated since before the 2005 election , and they received few votes and perhaps not even a single seat in this election .
The Sahwa movement — called the Awakening by the Western press — has not coalesced into an integrated formation , even at the provincial level , and therefore has become powerful in various localities without generating a Sunni national formation .
As a consequence , the Sunnis did n't really have any other option but this Allawi group .
The Allawi group has filled this vacuum by recruiting a number of important local leaders and quasi - governments into its electoral coalition .
Despite Maliki ’s effort to disqualify certain of the candidates , these local groupings delivered their constituencies to Allawi ’s electoral list , with particular success in Anbar , where they had an overwhelming victory , and in Kirkuk , where they soundly defeated the Kurds and therefore served notice that this key province will not pass quietly into the Kurdish regional sphere of influence .
Allawi ’s success , therefore , does not represent or even symbolize the survival of the Ba'ath Party , and I do n’t think that anybody in Iraq really buys the idea that Maliki is floating about Allawi re-establishing Ba’athist rule .
Most significantly , Allawi is n’t tied to the remnants of the Ba'athist establishment in any real way .
The local groups that he is dealing with , some of them are ex-Baathists , but they ’re not people who used to be leaders of the Ba’ath Party ; they ’re people who grew up during this period since the fall of the Ba’ath regime as local leaders .
I think that from the point of view of the people who are actually immersed in Iraqi politics — including even the most sectarian Shia in the south of the country — this accusation is not credible .
Maybe Maliki thinks the accusation will mobilize people in the Shia areas , but it does n’t look like that ’s going to work very well .
Maybe it ’s just an expression of desperation .
OR PERHAPS Maliki is aiming the message at the U.S. as a plea , or a threat , for the U.S. to get firmly behind him .
YES , IT could be for international consumption .
In fact , it could be that this is another effort to justify continued U.S. military presence beyond 2011 .
This initial salvo could later amplify into a call for U.S. military intervention , to bring into line these “ obstreperous communities ” that form the basis of Allawi ’s electoral success .
In fact , he may even be speaking for the U.S.
This appeal is almost too consonant with Obama administration interests — to discredit Allawi ’s nationalist and anti-American coalition — and it may well be a simple expression of the U.S. Embassy ’s public stance , which has regularly characterized Sunni nationalism as Ba'athist restoration .
But this is just speculation ; there is so far no direct evidence that Maliki is a cat ’s paw for the U.S. on this matter .
The difficulty is that the investigative reporters are n’t over there finding this stuff out anymore , and this information is much slower to develop .
On Iran , I think the Iranian leadership has decided that it ca n’t be heavy handed in this situation , and I think they ’ve backed away from the more interventionist efforts they tried in the past .
Where they are putting the bulk of their energies , I think , is on economic relationships with the Maliki administration that would endure a change of regime .
They are supplying electricity to a couple of the provinces of Iraq — in fact , provinces with large Sunni populations — which are not hooked into the Iranian electrical grid .
Many localities are now getting electricity from Iran after years of deprivation under the U.S. occupation .
Imagine the impact on public opinion in these localities , where the U.S. was already detested .
Or , consider the Shia pilgrimage city of Karbala , where the Iranians are financing and constructing a modern airport , so pilgrims from Iran as well as the rest of the Shia world can fly into Karbala .
Here again , imagine the impact on local public opinion as this new airport brings to the city hundreds of thousands of tourists willing to spend heavily on their religious pilgrimages .
The Iranians have even begun refining Iraqi oil , because the refining capacity in Iraq is well below Iraq ’s own needs .
So the Iranians are creating a kind of economic inter-penetration of the two countries that I think they see as a more durable way of creating an alliance than the more heavy - handed efforts to affect the military or insurgent situation that they were engaging before .
That makes them a far more formidable adversary to the U.S .
And the Iranians are not alone in their efforts to build enduring economic relationships with Iraq .
Of all the oil contracts given out in the last year , the biggest single actor is the CNPC , the national oil company of China .
These oil contracts have augmented other economic contracts that presage long - term interchanges between the countries .
In particular , Iran , China and other countries are offering to develop Iraq ’s infrastructure , because if the oil is going to get out , there has to be an infrastructure capable of managing it over the long term .
Various potential and actual trading partners are proposing to provide the roads and the pipelines to Iraq in exchange for a share of the oil production and revenue .
And the Maliki government is very happy to discuss such arrangements when the U.S. is n’t telling him he can’t .
And keep in mind that while all this is percolating within Iraq , the Shanghai Cooperation Organization ( SCO ) — the mutual security pact among Russia , China , Kazakhstan , Kyrgyzstan , Tajikistan and Uzbekistan — is now inviting Iran to be a full member .
The SCO is an extension of the Chinese sphere of influence , and the Chinese are hoping to bring Iran — and then by extension , Iraq — under their umbrella .
Such a development would create a bond between Iraq and Iran that ’s more durable than any other kind of political machinations that Iran was working on before .
This is a dire threat to the Obama administration ’s designs on Iraq as the capital of their Middle East empire .
And it demonstrates that the outcome of the election is by no means the most important current development .
Regardless of who becomes prime minister and who wins various cabinet positions , these kinds of economic relationships with China and Iran are going to be incredibly enticing .
In fact , this would tempt any regime that ’s not a complete creature of American policy .
WHAT ’S THE difference between the vote for Allawi and the Sadrists ?
It seems they were both trying to appeal to an anti-U.S. vote .
THE SADRISTS had a combined slate with several other parties , but the way the election was organized this time individuals could walk into the booth and vote for the slate if they wanted , but they could also choose the individual candidate they wanted to vote for within the slate of their choice .
In the 2005 elections , the various slates would be given — based on their total vote — a certain number of parliamentary seats , and the leaders of the slates would then designate which of their candidates would become members of parliament .
Now , while the number of parliamentary seats won by the list is still determined in the same way , the actual candidates selected for election is being determined by their individual vote total .
So it turns out that many voters walked into the polling booth and chose to vote specifically for the Sadrist candidates from the national slate in which the Sadrists participated .
This was true in Baghdad especially , and it was also true in several of the other southern cities .
In the province of Maysan , they were apparently particularly successful .
But in other places , even where their slate did n’t do as well as they might have wished , the Sadrists did much better than the rest of the slate .
Now what that means is that ordinary people on the ground are seeking out the Sadrists , so it remains true that the Sadrists still have the base on the ground and that people are looking at them as a real representative of their interests .
There is no doubt in my mind that the social welfare function that the Sadrists have always attempted to perform in the working - class neighborhoods of Iraq , many times with some real degree of success , is still functioning in a very important way .
They have a real base , they can mobilize that base , and that base supports them because of what they offer the base in the context of this non-governed country rife with local proto - governments .
At the same time , the Sadrists ’ fundamentalist point of view has moderated in many realms , not in the realm of personal behavior , but in the realms of political activism and the toleration of other viewpoints .
For some time , it looked as though the Sadrists had crested as the pre-eminent power in the Shia areas , but they ’ve proved that they still have organization on the ground with a lot of credibility , because people see them as the ones that deliver some kind of economic answer to their problems .
I think that ’s of high significance .
On the Allawi side , I do n’t think it ’s that different , except for the fact that Allawi is mainly a figurehead .
Allawi ’s group is made up of a compendium of groups that have a local base , and it ’s the local base that ’s delivering these votes .
When the analysis comes out , I think we ’re going to find that it is the people who represent that local base who will have won the election in the various cities of Anbar province and the other provinces around it where Allawi has made a good showing , especially in Kirkuk , which is a fascinating instance of this trend .
The other difference is that the Sadrists are a national movement , or a quasi-nationalist movement with a presence throughout the Shia areas , whereas the Allawi group is a series of local groups that have just allied themselves together .
As a result , they do n’t have a coherent political position — there are Sahwa people , there are some old - time parties , there are people who have some real Ba'athist loyalties but were low - level Ba’athists .
So there are some organic leaders in the Sunni areas , but there is n’t a national leadership and only a rudimentary basis for a coherent program .
It ’s a jumbled group of formations that will line up on some issues and not on others .
They may be able to agree that they want Allawi as prime minister , but there ’s going to be a lot of disagreement over actual policies .
There ’s going to be a lot of demands for just local answers .
Each locality where the Allawi coalition prevailed will ask , “ Where ’s our stuff ? ” whereas the Sadrists might articulate a coherent policy posture supported by all their members of parliament — and , perhaps far more important — all of their local leaders .
TO SUMMARIZE what you ’re arguing , the U.S. expected the elections to provide a stable government , but instead they resulted in a weak , fractured government .
As a consequence , Iran is now the most powerful state in the region , and seven years on , the U.S. has little to show for the immense expenditure of blood and treasure in Iraq .
I THINK that ’s a pretty good summary .
But if you were looking for a way for the Obama administration to feel at least a little good about the situation , you could point to the oil contracts that could get implemented and eventually would strengthen the central government .
Or you could point to the fact that Iraq now has a military force that claims 600,000 soldiers , which the U.S. thinks can actually be a fighting force — even though if you send it into a lot of localities , you ca n’t really rely on it to “ pacify ” much of anything .
So they ’ve got the prospect of the oil flow , and they ’ve got a start on a military force — two ingredients that could produce a coherent central government — though neither one is demonstrably operative .
But even if these do become foundations for a viable government , the Obama administration cannot be assured that the government will be the reliable ally that has been the foundational goal since the beginning of the invasion .
So there are a couple of hopeful signs here for them , but each of those hopeful signs is itself more than a little problematic .
I think they ’ve got to be very worried .
If they ’re not worried , it ’s simply because of arrogance of power that they still have not realized that the cards they are holding are not working the way they ’re supposed to work .
So I think that Iraq , in a way , is at a crossroads .
But I do n’t think the election is central to the crossroads , but rather is symptomatic of that crossroads .
There ’s one last thing I ’d like to add .
There ’s an unsettled struggle on the ground in Iraq over the newly negotiated oil contracts .
Most of the big players are state - owned oil companies rather than the old seven sisters , the Shells and Exxons and so forth , which are playing a less central role .
These oil contracts are supposed to jack up Iraq ’s oil production , triple it very soon , and the various foreign oil companies are supposed to go in and implement the steps necessary to make this happen .
However , there ’s a lot of resistance , because the oil companies want to bring in foreign workers and treat the production as just another export platform .
In other words , they ’re in there just to get the oil out .
But at every level , the Iraqi national oil companies , the oil workers and the local leaders all want this oil development to be something that really enriches them .
They want to keep the money and the power and the technical expertise inside Iraq .
Of course , Iraq ’s state - owned oil companies are no friends of the people , but they are friends to themselves , and they do n’t want foreign oil companies to control this new apparatus — they want to control it .
And if they win this struggle , it will mean that Iraqis will be employed from the bottom to the top , that localities will be able to claim a share of the revenues , and the profits might well be reinvested in Iraq .
All this will be far less likely if the companies owned by foreign governments , notably China , emerge with operational control — but not impossible .
And it will be almost certainly impossible if the international oil companies , like Shell and Exxon , obtain operational control .
But it ’s not clear who ’s going to end up in control .
The way the contracts have been written , it ’s very ambiguous .
There are elements to them that limit the international oil companies , and there are a lot of elements that offer them a real opportunity .
The oil workers are very sensitive to this , and they ’re fighting it .
There ’s already sabotage in the first of the contracts implemented because local leaders and unions do n’t feel that local suppliers and local workers have gotten a fair share .
So that contract is stalled because the local resistance is stopping it .
This same dynamic is going to multiply across all these contracts .
And now , the new parliament was elected on a platform that these contracts have to be abrogated and re-written to give full guarantees for Iraqi control of the oil .
So I think that is where the struggle is , because the economy of Iraq depends on what happens to the economy of oil .

The just released 6th Annual Demographia International Housing Affordability Survey shows some improvement in housing affordability , especially in the United States and Ireland but a continuing loss of housing affordability , especially in Australia .
The Survey , co-authored by Hugh Pavletich of Performance Urban Planning , covers 272 metropolitan markets in 6 nations ( the United States , the United Kingdom , Canada , Australia , Ireland and New Zealand ) .
The Survey estimates housing affordability using the “ Median Multiple , ” which is the median house price divided by the median household income .
As recently as the late 1980s , the Median Multiple virtually everywhere was 3.0 or below .
Over the past 10 to 20 years , however , the Median Multiple has risen worryingly in all major markets of the United Kingdom , Australia , New Zealand and Ireland and in some markets in the United States and Canada .
Housing affordability is rated on a four category scale , from “ affordable ” to “ severely unaffordable ” ( Table 1 ) .

Affordable Markets : The Survey found affordable markets in both the United States and Canada .
This included fast - growing markets , such as Atlanta , Dallas - Fort Worth and Houston , which have had the highest underlying demand of any metropolitan areas with more than 5,000,000 population in the high - income world .
It also includes the “ Rust Belt ” metropolitan areas , such as Detroit , which has experienced severe declines in demand in the Great Recession .
There were also a number of additional metropolitan areas that are neither fast growing nor in dire economic straits , such as Indianapolis , Kansas City and Cincinnati ( Table 2 ) .

Severely Unaffordable Markets :
There were also 18 severely unaffordable markets , in five nations .
The least unaffordable market was Vancouver ( Canada ) , with a Median Multiple of 9.3 .
Sydney ( Australia ) was the second least affordable market ( 9.1 ) , followed by Melbourne ( 8.0 ) and Adelaide ( 7.4 ) .
The most unaffordable markets also London ( GLA or inside the greenbelt ) , with a Median Multiple of 7.1 , San Francisco ( 7.0 ) , New York ( 7.0 ) , Perth , Australia ( 6.9 ) , Brisbane , Australia ( 6.7 ) , Auckland , New Zealand ( 6.7 ) and the London Exurbs ( outside the greenbelt ) , at 6.7 .
Los Angeles - Orange County , which was the most unaffordable metropolitan area in the first four Surveys , remained severely unaffordable , at 5.7 ( Table 3 ) .

Severely Unaffordable Markets :
There were also 18 severely unaffordable markets , in five nations .
The least unaffordable market was Vancouver ( Canada ) , with a Median Multiple of 9.3 .
Sydney ( Australia ) was the second least affordable market ( 9.1 ) , followed by Melbourne ( 8.0 ) and Adelaide ( 7.4 ) .
The most unaffordable markets also London ( GLA or inside the greenbelt ) , with a Median Multiple of 7.1 , San Francisco ( 7.0 ) , New York ( 7.0 ) , Perth , Australia ( 6.9 ) , Brisbane , Australia ( 6.7 ) , Auckland , New Zealand ( 6.7 ) and the London Exurbs ( outside the greenbelt ) , at 6.7 .
Los Angeles - Orange County , which was the most unaffordable metropolitan area in the first four Surveys , remained severely unaffordable , at 5.7 ( Table 3 ) .
Summary by Nation :
As in the five previous Surveys , there is a close relationship between housing unaffordability and categories of land use regulation .
Virtually all severely unaffordable markets are characterized by “ more prescriptive ” land use regulation policies ( also called “ compact city , ” “ urban consolidation , ” “ growth management , ” or “ smart growth ” ) .
At the same time , the affordable markets overwhelmingly have “ more responsive ” land use regulation , in which new residential development is demand driven .
Australia :
The most extreme housing unaffordability has evolved in Australia .
Australia ’s overall Median Multiple was 6.8 , with a housing affordability rating of severely unaffordable .
A recent Bank West report also noted the deteriorating housing affordability and indicated housing affordability was a thing of the past for “ key workers . ”
This is a dramatic turnaround ; housing had been affordable widely in Australia in the late 1980s , with a Median Multiple of under 3.0 and remained under 3.5 until the late 1990s .
All but one of Australia ’s 23 markets were severely unaffordable , with one being seriously unaffordable .
All of Australia ’s major markets ( over 1,000,000 population ) have strong “ urban consolidation ” policies that have resulted in unaffordable land on the urban fringe and a substantial decline in house construction , despite the highest national population growth rate among the surveyed nations .
Canada : Canada has an overall Median Multiple of 3.7 and is thus rated moderately unaffordable .
Housing had been affordable in Canada in the late 1990s , with a Median Multiple of 3.0 .
Canada has 5 affordable markets and 4 severely unaffordable markets .
Thirteen markets were rated moderately unaffordable , while 6 were rated seriously unaffordable .
Like the United States , land use regulation is under the control of sub-national governments and thus ranges from demand driven to plan driven regimes .
Ireland : Ireland has experienced a substantial improvement in its housing affordability .
Ireland has a Median Multiple of 3.7 , and is rated moderately unaffordable .
Housing had been affordable as late as the middle 1990s , with a Median Multiple below 3.0 .
New Zealand : New Zealand ’s overall Median Multiple was 5.7 , for a severely unaffordable rating .
Housing had been affordable in the early 1990s , with a Median Multiple of under 3.0 .
Five of the 8 markets were rated severely unaffordable , while 3 markets were seriously unaffordable .
As in Australia , more prescriptive land use regulation is pervasive .
United Kingdom :
The overall Median Multiple in the United Kingdom was 5.1 , for a severely unaffordable rating .
Housing had been affordable in the late 1990s , with a Median Multiple of under 3.0 .
Despite the recent house price declines , 19 of the 33 surveyed markets were rated severely unaffordable and 14 were rated seriously unaffordable .
The connection between the UK ’s housing unaffordability and its plan - driven regulation has been documented in Labour government commissioned report by Kate Barker , a member of the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England .
United States :
The United States is the first nation in Survey history to have achieved an overall affordable rating , with a Median Multiple of 2.9 .
The recent house price declines have restored national housing affordability to the below 3.0 historic norm ( last achieved in the early 2000s ) , as the price bubble burst in many markets .
There were 98 affordable markets , most of which experienced an increase in demand .
There were also 58 moderately affordable markets .
Even with the price decreases , however , house prices remain far above historic norms in some markets .
Eight of the markets were seriously unaffordable , while 11 were severely unaffordable .
Plan - driven land use regulation is in place in all of the major markets with severely unaffordable housing affordability .
Comparing Sydney , Melbourne , Dallas - Fort Worth and Atlanta
Australia : A Nation in Mortgage Stress : The Survey includes a comparison of four similar markets , Sydney and Melbourne in Australia to Dallas - Fort Worth and Atlanta in the United States .
In the early 1980s , Sydney had a higher population than Dallas - Fort Worth and Melbourne had a higher population than Atlanta .
Since that time , the two US metropolitan areas have passed the Australian metropolitan areas in population , having added more people than Australia ’s five largest metropolitan areas combined ( Sydney , Melbourne , Brisbane , Perth and Adelaide ) .
At the same time , despite their far higher demand , housing affordability has improved in Dallas - Fort Worth and Atlanta , while it has deteriorated markedly in Sydney and Melbourne ( Figure 1 ) .
During this period , “ plan driven ” or more prescriptive land use policies were strongly enforced in Sydney and Melbourne in contrast to the “ demand driven ” land use policies in place in both Atlanta and Dallas - Fort Worth .
Australian government agencies consider any household paying more than 30 % of its gross income for housing to be in “ housing stress . ”
At this point , a median income household in Sydney or Melbourne would pay more 50 % or more of its gross income annually for a new mortgage on a median priced house .
In Brisbane , Perth and Adelaide , the figure is above 40 % . ( Figure 2 ) .
By comparison , in Dallas - Fort Worth and Atlanta , however , the median income household would pay less than 20 % of its income for the mortgage .
Not surprising then is the huge loss in housing affordability in Australia , and a decline in home ownership rates from 72 % to 68 % between 1995 and 2008 .
Unaffordable Housing as Public Policy :
It is clear that much of the cause for the differences in affordability lies with contrasting public policy approaches .
The strong intervention in land markets under plan - driven regulation raises the price of land inordinately .
Governments appear to have , however unwittingly , established unaffordable housing as an objective of public policy .
Yet despite this , there is pressure – including from the US Obama administration , to adopt plan - driven regulation throughout the United States , despite the substantial economic disruption that such policies produced in the US bubble markets .
Besides making houses unaffordable for many households , this could set the stage for even more housing bubbles in the future .
If this trend continues , future generations will pay far more for their housing than did their parents .
This seems likely to stunt economic growth and job creation , while facilitating higher levels of poverty and class stratification throughout the English speaking world .
Non è vero che in Italia non c'è più la legge .
Anzi : da oggi in Italia c'è una legge chiara , semplice , onnivalente e priva di ogni ipocrisia .
E ' la legge del più forte .
Quello che è successo nella settimana che si va chiudendo , l'ho detto fino alla noia , trascende di molto le poltrone dei governatori .
Perché quello che è successo è stata una puntata importante di un confronto che dura da decine di secoli , in tutte le civiltà .
Dove l'aspirazione etica e filosofica a fare norme « uguali per tutti » - a prescindere dai rapporti di forza nella società - si è sempre scontrata con gli interessi e le arroganze dei più forti , dei più ricchi , dei più potenti .
A questo serve - servirebbe - la legge : a garantire i diritti dei più deboli .
A contenere la tracimazione della volontà di comando assoluto dei più forti .
A riequilibrare una società quel tanto che basta a garantire la convivenza civile .
Quello che è successo ieri dimostra che in Italia non è più così .
Che il nostro salto indietro non è di decenni , ma di secoli : basta essere i più forti , avere il potere , e le leggi non contano più niente .
Sono un orpello , anzi una formalità .
Quello che conta è la sostanza .
E la sostanza è che comanda il più forte .
Altro che Polverini , altro che Formigoni : questa è la fine di un patto civile e sociale .
E ' un insegnamento violento e diretto , è una lezione di diseducazione civica che autorizza chiunque alla violazione delle regole - quelle formalità - purché si abbia la forza ( un patrimonio ? un mitra ? uno zio ministro ? ) per poter imporre se stessi .
Todd Stern , the chief American climate change negotiator , said Thursday that the flawed and incomplete agreement reached last month in Copenhagen could provide significant benefits if countries followed through on its provisions .
The three - page Copenhagen Accord is not legally binding , and the 192 nations that took part in the December talks did not formally accept it .
But a sizable group of those countries said they would accept its terms and provide plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by Jan. 31 .
Wealthy countries also said they would follow through on promises to come up with $ 30 billion over the next three years to help developing countries adapt to global climate changes .
“ It is incredibly important that those things happen , ” Mr. Stern told investors gathered for a conference at the United Nations in New York , in his first public comments since the Copenhagen talks ended on Dec. 19 .
“ The accord is lumbering down the runway , and now it needs to get speed so it can take off . ”
What is silence ?
I am profoundly deaf in my left ear ( I have a cochlear implant ) .
The ear is useless for hearing , though it makes a pleasant decorative ornament and serves as a place to display earrings and anchor glasses ; no sound can penetrate it .
You would think that profound deafness is as silent as it gets .
And yet it is not quiet in there .
I hear deep space sounds , a hollow hum that washes in and fades away , changes in pitch and volume .
George Prochnik seems to have found a place that is even quieter than my deaf ear .
The underground chapel at the Trappist New Melleray Abbey south of Dubuque , Iowa , is so quiet that visitors sometimes find themselves physically unable to remain there .
Mr. Prochnik embraced it , wanting “ to remain and sink deeper into it . ”
The silence allowed him to acknowledge “ the limitations of our grasp on what lies within and without us , the knowledge that there ’s something beyond the self . ”
It ’s an elegant and eloquent observation .
But can you experience total silence in the presence of another person ?
Mr. Prochnik , who was with a guide , does n’t address that .
He traveled far and near in his pursuit of silence : to Copenhagen to learn about “ noise mapping ” in urban areas , to a Zen garden in Portland , Ore. , to a neurobiology lab in upper Manhattan , to one of New York ’s vest pocket parks right around the corner from his office .

When buying a horse , there are things you need to consider .
You have to be terribly sure of what kind of horse to buy and you need to have a prepared home for it .
Remember that owning and taking care of a horse involves a long term commitment , you should know everything about it .
Before you purchase a horse , you may want to understand about the following guidelines .
1. Sellers have a tendency to present lots of horses , but if you know the right horse for you , you will not be confused .
Never allow your seller to pressure you to purchase a horse that 's not best for you .
Stick to what you need and do n't be influenced or tempted by your seller .
If you are n't actually sure about the horse , then do n't purchase it .
Wait until you find the right one .
Buying a wrong pony mean buying yourself a headache .
The most effective way of getting the right horse is to lease it first .
2 . Keep the option for negotiation open .
Do n't let the seller know of your financial position .
Never show that you like the horse so much .
This could make your seller think he / she can sell the horse even at an immoderately high price .
3 . If you are buying a horse for your youngster , talk to him first .
Explain how important it is n't not to demonstrate the seller his or her excitement .
4 . To scale back the level of pressure exerted to you , tell your seller that you are going to ask your instructor first about the horse and you value your instructor 's opinion .
5 . To help with your call , ask your instructor to check the horse before you purchase it .
The only person who knows what you want and what suits you when it comes to horses is your instructor .
Your instructor might ask you to pay for his or her professional recommendation and educated opinion .
6 . Before you make an offer , guess first the sales price your seller will be offering .
Base your price estimate on the current market conditions , the time the horse has been for sale and the seller 's personal financial circumstances .
If you can not guess the price , ask your instructor what he thinks is a fair offer .
7 . If you are unable to bargain , ask your seller for concessions like free tack .
Or you can ask your seller at no cost delivery of the pony .
These are examples of industry standard practices , so you will not insult your seller .
8. Sales commissions are terribly characteristic in this kind of transaction , so be prepared .
Ask up front if there 's someone asking for a sales commission and for how much .
Sales commissions run from 10 - 20 % of the acquisition price .
9 . One significant thing that most buyers overlook is that they do not subject the horse for check up before buying .
You should know if the horse you are buying is healthy .
Have an independent 3rd party vet check the horse first .
Then ask for the result and include it in your decision .
10 .
When buying a horse , have the exchange drafted in a form of a contract which will obviously state all the terms and the warranties of your purchase .

This may be surprising to a lot of people , but cycling and horology have a lot in common .
Yes , enthusiasts from both communities spend a lot of time admiring gears and machinery — the crankset or full - carbon frame for the cyclists , and the manual movement for the watch fans .
Apart from that , both camps put a lot of value in tracking time as accurate as possible .
With that said , it is inevitable that these two worlds merge and create a useful tool — cycling watches .
When it comes to professional cycling , timing is important .
In fact , a lot of people say that timing is everything in events like Tour de France .
As we all know , the cyclists who participate in these competitions are highly competitive that even a split - second difference counts .
That is why it is necessary to be equipped with the most reliable cycling watch .
The same goes for beginners who want to take cycling seriously .
It is recommended for them to use these sports watches to aid them during practice as they have a lot of features aimed at making your cycling session more efficient .
Let ’s take a look at a few reasons why a reliable sports watch is important in cycling .
The Importance of a Reliable Watch in Cycling
Whether you ’re a beginner or a long - time rider , a cycling watch is something that you must consider adding to your biking checklist .
Here are a few reasons why it ’s worth investing in one .
1 . It tracks your progress .
When you want to improve your game or if you want to get into professional cycling , training is important .
In fact , you ’ll have to keep track of your speed , time , and distance so you know which aspects of your training you have to improve on .
Fortunately , a lot of cycling watches offer a built - in fitness tracker .
Apart from being aware of the weaknesses that you have to work on , your fitness tracker can also serve as a motivation .
In fact , depending on the software used , some display motivational quotes or even let you share your progress to your friends online .
2 . A cycling watch is more convenient to use than a smartphone .
Some people might argue that smartphones can now do whatever cycling watches can do .
However , tracking your time with your wrist is easier than getting your phone out of your pocket and unlocking it .
And if you have to check your timer while on - the - go , you risk keeping your eyes off the road .
With that , simply taking a peek at your wrist will help you save both time and energy .
Famous Cyclists and their Favourite Luxury Sports Watches
When you say cycling watches , however , it does n’t mean you only opt for beater or affordable watches .
Some luxury sports watches prove to be the best cycling buddy .
Let ’s take a look at these famous cyclists and their favourite luxury cycling watches .
1. Fabian Cancellara and his IWC Aquatimer Chronograph Edition ‘ Galapagos Islands ’
If you ’re a fan of Fabian Cancellara , you might have noticed his fondness for luxury watches , particularly IWC models .
In fact , he has been spotted numerous times wearing those watches in events like the Tour de France .
One of those models is the IWC Aquatimer Chronograph Edition ‘ Galapagos Islands ’ .
Apart from that chronograph , Fabian Cancellara also enjoys sporting a few other timepieces .
A few of those are the Big Pilot Perpetual Calendar and the Ingenieur Double Chronograph .
As its name suggests , the Chronograph Edition ‘ Galapagos Islands ’ from the IWC Aquatimer collection has a chronograph function that features minutes and seconds trackers .
Apart from that , it has a SafeDive system which gives it enough water resistance rating in case it ends up raining during a cycling tour .
The watch is also durable , as evident in the materials used .
For the case , IWC used stainless steel with vulcanised rubber coating .
Apart from that , it has a screw - down crown and a sapphire glass for added durability .
Lastly , it comes with a black rubber strap to keep Fabian Cancellara comfortable during his cycling tours .
2. Richie Porte and his TAG Heuer Connected Modular 45
Richie Porte , a famous Australian road bike racer , is also known for strapping on luxury watches on his wrist .
And his partner in crime is the TAG Heuer Connected Modular 45 .
This watch is a combination of TAG Heuer ’s signature design and the benefits of a high - tech smartwatch .
The famous cyclist has been seen numerous times wearing the watch with different straps .
For instance , he was spotted wearing an orange strap during the Tour Down Under .
Another example is when he sported a yellow one for the Criterium du Dauphine .
Indeed , the watch ’s Strava app helps professional cyclists track their training .
Apart from that , the touch screen is a breeze to use especially if you want to toggle the chronograph and stopwatch functions .
When it comes to comfort , the TAG Heuer Connected Modular comes with a titanium finish and a fully - perforated rubber strap .
This is easily adjustable and breathable so Richie stays comfortable even during a hot ride .
3. Julian Alaphilippe and his Richard Mille RM 67-02
Going on a tour using expensive bikes is not uncommon .
In fact , it is normal to see professional cyclists who use all - carbon bike frames that cost at least $ 2000 .
But Cyclist Julian Alaphilippe took flexing to the next level as he was spotted spinning with a $ 120,500 luxury watch at the Critérium du Dauphiné in France .
The watch spotted on his wrist was a Richard Mille RM 67 - 02 .
According to the brand ’s website , that particular model is “ thin , lightweight , coloured , elegant and athletic ” .
While it does n’t have the bells and whistles of a smartwatch like a heart rate monitor and fitness tracker , it is durable and light .
In fact , it only weighs 32 grams and is made with carbon composite and titanium components .
Apart from that , the model was designed so that it can be adapted to various sporting disciplines .
That is why the brand made various RM 67 - 02 units in the colours of various athletes ’ countries .
A few examples are Alexis Pinturault for skiing and Mutaz Essa Barshim for high jumping .
Requirements of a Good Cycling Watch
Cycling is a physically demanding activity .
With that said , you will need more than just a regular watch .
You will most likely need a few features that are n’t found in a time - only watch .
Here are some of the few important things that you should consider when out shopping for sports watches .
1 . It should be durable .
Perhaps durability is the most important thing to look for when shopping for cycling watches .
Indeed , bike watches should be synonymous with tough watches .
Whether you ’re just going out for a sprint in the city or a long ride in the mountains , it is inevitable that you come across rough roads .
Also , add the possibility that you might drop the watch or rub it against a rough surface .
With that , we recommend looking for bike watches made with durable material .
A few things you should consider for your case are stainless steel and titanium .
Apart from the case , you should also mind the crystal used for the dial .
Sapphire crystals , for instance , are shatter - proof and can resist scratches .
Moving on to the inside of the watch , some brands offer shock - resistant calibres .
With that said , it is important to watch out for words like “ Parashock ” when looking at the watch ’s spec sheet .
This will help it keep time more accurately even after being subjected to shocks .
2 . It should be lightweight .
There ’s a good reason why people opt for lightweight materials when it comes to bike parts .
Enthusiasts wo n’t second guess spending all the extra money for carbon materials , etc .
And it is for aerodynamics .
The same thing can go for your equipment .
With that said , it is important to prioritise lightweight watches when looking for your next sports watch .
A timepiece ’s weight might seem unimportant , and people might overlook it .
However , it is important to note that having a lightweight watch on your wrist can minimize fatigue .
3 . It should be GPS - enabled .
One of the most useful things that bike watches offer is the GPS functionality .
With this feature , it would be easier for cyclists to check their speed and distance travelled .
This is extremely important if you ’re setting cycling goals or tracking your progress and looking to break your record .
Apart from that , it can also provide navigation when you ’re going through an unfamiliar trail .
And depending on the device you ’re using , some maps show the condition of the route .
This allows you to avoid damaging your tires in case you are riding a road bike instead of a mountain bike .
4 . It should be waterproof .
As mentioned above , you will be wearing your cycling watch while doing intense physical activities .
That means that apart from having durable materials , it must have the correct water resistance rating as well .
But why would you need a watch with a good water - resistance rating if you ’re not going to swim with it ?
Remember that when you ’re out doing exercises , your sweat can drench your timepiece especially when you ’re cycling intensely .
Apart from that , there is also a chance that you get caught in a rain .
We recommend looking at sports watches that have at least 50 m water resistance rating .
What this means is that your timepiece can be used to swim with .
Additionally , having a watch with a high water resistance rating can be extremely useful if you ’re a triathlete who needs to alternate between swimming and cycling .
5 . It should come with a rubber strap .
Last but not least , you should be comfortable wearing your bike watch for hours .
Believe us when we say that the ergonomics of your watch strap can play a big role when it comes to performance .
You would n’t want to compromise a workout by getting distracted with an uncomfortable bike watch .
One of the most recommended straps to get for sports watches are rubber straps .
In fact , this is the most common material used for dive watches and other sports watches .
Unlike leather or metal bracelets , rubber can handle sweat and dirt better .
Additionally , it is easier to clean in case you drive through a muddy trail .
Apart from the material of the strap , you should also look at how it ’s built .
For instance , some straps offer better breathability .
You should also look for straps that have a secure lock system so you do n’t have to worry about it falling while riding .

Professor Emeritus of Animal Science Peter Cheeke wrote the following in one of his college textbooks on animal agriculture :
" One of the best things modern animal agriculture has going for it is that most people ... have n't a clue how animals are raised and " processed . "
If most urban meat - eaters were to visit an industrial broiler [ chicken ] house , to see how the birds are raised , and could see the birds being ' harvested ' and then being ' processed ' in a poultry processing plant , some , perhaps many of them , would swear off eating chicken and perhaps all meat .
For modern animal agriculture , the less the consumer knows about what 's happening before the meat hits the plate , the better . "
When people do find out , they are outraged .
In the last election cycle , Californians passed a ballot measure phasing out some of the worst factory farm abuses by a landslide .
This November the citizens of Ohio may have the same opportunity , but they need your help .
Today a white paper was released that I had the privilege to contribute to detailing some of the horrors of factory farming affecting millions of animals in the state .
Horrors like strangling pigs to death , as was documented in the HBO documentary Death on a Factory Farm .
The proposed ballot measure in Ohio would ban the strangulation of cows and pigs , the transport to slaughter of cows and calves who can't even walk , and the confinement of animals in cages and crates barely larger than their bodies ,
What does it say about how animals are now raised for food that the meat , dairy , and egg industries have spent millions of dollars trying to stop these kinds of modest reforms ?

ECHL Stories from April 5 , 2010
The opinions expressed in this release are those of the organization issuing it , and do not necessarily reflect the thoughts or opinions of OurSports Central or its staff .
Blogging , as you might have heard , is changing the face of the media .
It may also be changing the face of mathematical research .
For the first time ever , a substantial mathematical problem has been solved via an accumulation of blog comments , all building on each other .
Could this be the future of mathematical research ?
Before I explain the problem , let ’s talk a little about tic - tac - toe .
As you probably figured out long ago , intelligent players of ordinary tic - tac - toe ( on a 3 by 3 board ) will invariably battle to a draw .
But , as you probably also figured out , not every game ends in a draw , because not every player is intelligent .
On the other hand , if we blacken out the three squares on the main diagonal and do n’t allow anyone to play there ( so the game ends when the remaining six squares are filled , then every game is sure to end in a draw .
There ’s simply no way to get three in a row when you ’re not allowed to play on the diagonal :
Okay .
Now let ’s play tic - tac - toe in three dimensions , with three ordinary boards stacked on top of each other ( giving you a total of 27 places to place your X. )
How many of those 27 squares would I have to blacken to insure that winning is flat - out impossible ?
The answer , it turns out , is 9 — as long as you choose the right 9 .
And if we go to 4 dimensions ?
Now there are 81 squares , and if you want to prevent any possibility of winning , you ’re going to have to blacken at least 29 of them .
In 5 dimensions , you ’ve got to blacken at least 93 .
( See yesterday ’s post if you ’re puzzled about how to play tic - tac - toe in four dimensions ) .
The density Hales Jewett Theorem says that as you go to higher and higher dimensions , the number of squares you must black out to prevent a win gets arbitrarily close to 100 % of the squares available .
In some high enough dimension , you ’ll have to black out at least 90 % of the squares ; in some higher dimension , you ’ll have to black out 95 % , and then 99 % and 99.9999 % .
If you ’re not sure why anybody would care about such a thing , take my word for it — there are many applications to other areas of mathematics .
( My statement of the theorem glosses over some minor technicalities ; the actual theorem is slightly stronger than what I ’ve quoted here . )
Now until a few months ago , the only known proof of the density Hales Jewett theorem was extremely difficult .
But Tim Gowers , a Fields - Medal winning Cambridge mathematician , thought there ought to be an easier proof .
So he did what everyone with an opinion about anything does nowadays ; he posted his opinion on his blog .
He also did what no mathematician had ever done before , and invited the entire world to collaborate with him in proving his opinion correct .
Following an initial post asking “ Is Massively Collaborative Mathematics Possible ? ” , he posted a description of the problem and invited his readers to have at it in comments .
Commenters leapt in .
In response to a couple of dozen blog posts by Gowers and others , roughly spanning the calendar year 2009 , commenters continued to build on each others ’ ideas until they produced the ( relatively ) simple proof Gowers had been hoping for .
Along the way , they accomplished a lot more — for example , we now know that in 5 and 6 dimensions , you ’ve got to black out exactly 93 and 279 squares ( again , glossing over some minor technicalities ) ; these numbers were not known before the blogging project .
For any single mathematician — or team of mathematicians — this would have been a singular accomplishment .
It ’s not clear it would ever have happened in a world without blogs .
Gowers believes this could be the beginning of a whole new way of doing mathematics , allowing hundreds or thousands of mathematicians to contribute to the solution of a single problem .
Of course this raises all sorts of questions about rewards and incentives , many of which are addressed ( but not , or course , settled ) in Gowers ’s “ Massive Collaboration ” post .
Still , I have an inkling that this is a big freaking deal .
PARIS , France —
French teachers are protesting , but not for the usual reasons :
They say violent attacks have become all too commonplace in schools , an unintended result of budget cutbacks .
A string of incidents since the beginning of the year have turned some schools into venues for settling instead of earning scores .
In January , an 18 - year - old student named Hakim died after being stabbed by a fellow student at a suburban high school over an exchange of words between the alleged attacker and the victim ’s sister .
In another incident , hooded attackers entered a school ’s gymnasium and sprayed students with teargas before chasing and slashing their target .
One of last week ’s victims was an assistant principal attacked as he tried to stop two individuals from forcibly accessing his school in the tough Seine - Saint - Denis suburb on the northeastern outskirts of Paris , Le Parisien newspaper reported .
Another incident left a teacher hospitalized with bruises after a 16 - year - old student facing a seven - day suspension arrived at a southeastern suburban school with a curtain rod and a pair of scissors and pummeled him , according to reports .
Teachers say they are ill - equipped to confront the banal violence that has gradually seeped into their classrooms and that there are too few security guards patrolling school corridors .
Proposals to add metal detectors , video cameras and reinforced doorways will not address the roots of the problem , they say .
To aggravate matters , the government plans to eliminate in the coming academic year up to 16,000 jobs from schools already straining under personnel shortages .
In response , thousands of teachers again put down their lesson plans on March 23 , picked up their placards and joined the mass of civil servants throughout the country protesting governmental reforms .
“ We ’re eliminating a lot of jobs and not replacing those of the teachers who retire , ” said David , a 34 - year - old physical education teacher from the northern city of Lille , who requested his last name not be used so he could speak more candidly .
“ Conditions in the classrooms are deteriorating and teachers have had enough . ”
As a result of the attack on the principal last week , the school was shuttered the next day .
After the gym stabbing , teachers stayed away from their classes for more than two weeks while they negotiated solutions with education authorities .
Parents too have had their say .
They threatened to seek redress in court over the “ fundamental right to lessons ” if the government did not find a solution to address teacher absences , whether due to strikes or to teachers not being replaced when they fall ill , go on maternity leave or take vacation .
Part of the frustration for teachers caught in this vicious circle with students at the center is the “ crippling ” feeling they have no recourse against unruly and disrespectful pupils and that the students know this , said David , who is verbally assaulted on a daily basis by his charges , who range in age from 12 to 16 , and of course cannot respond in kind .
“ We do n’t have the means to react . ”
Although there are some small variations , students are generally disciplined through a series of warnings and suspensions , followed by expulsion .
Until age 16 , other schools are obliged to take on the expelled students .
In Hakim 's murder , the alleged attacker had just been transferred from another school .
Expelling a disruptive student from one school and placing him in another is not an adequate solution , according to teachers .
“ It ’s a game of musical chairs , ” David said .
“ We pass them from one person to another . ”
On average about 10 serious violent incidents occur for every 1,000 students , with almost 39 percent of those involving physical violence , according to information provided by the education ministry .
An international colloquium on school violence and security is planned for April 7 and 8 at the Sorbonne and will bring together experts from disciplines like sociology , criminology and child psychology to discuss the causes and propose solutions , announced Luc Chatel , the education minister and government spokesman .
School violence is not a new phenomenon but the occurrences in quick succession that have attracted both the public ’s and the government ’s attention is what struck Benoit Larousse , who teaches in a southeastern suburb just outside of Paris .
What happened at the other schools easily could happen at his school , he said .
Larousse , 38 , has n’t participated in any of the numerous teacher strikes over the last month , since he is “ not necessarily convinced of their utility , ” but he said the powers that be should explore alternatives that go beyond simply fortifying schools and transferring violent students .
“ Some students are too aggressive , ” Larousse said .
They need specialized centers with counselors who can deal with their issues and help “ put them on the right track . ”
Larousse , who teaches physical education , said he has seen “ the habit of solving their problems with violence ” on display too much and often the reaction is out of proportion with the offense .
He said he was embarrassed by the “ hyper- aggression ” of students who recently came close to physically attacking a referee over a volleyball tournament he had organized .
His idea of specialized schools may not be too far off the mark .
Following a trip to Quebec , a school administrator in a southern suburb of Paris has started exploring the possibility of implementing a program next year that would devote extra resources to students with disciplinary problems , which includes counseling in addition to regular academic work .
It is unclear who would pay for such a program when jobs are being slashed to save money .
Teachers are already taking on too much of the burden that should also fall on parents , said David , but in many cases , such as those of his students , many of whom come from socially disadvantaged backgrounds and neighborhoods , parents are involved very little , if at all .
“ Schools have to manage all of society ’s problems , ” David said .
“ At some point , we have to get tougher . ”
Every month or so I try to learn a new Emacs feature or extension – something beyond the usual buffer juggling and programming - language modes .
Of course when you ’re trying new things so frequently some of them are going to work better than others .
Things I ’ve tried that stuck :
Keyboard Macros – probably the first “ advanced ” Emacs feature I learned and I use it all the time .
I do n’t save and name my macros as often as I should though .
Tramp – tramp - mode allows me to run a fast local Emacs and edit files remotely with no setup required .
Just open / server.example.com : and go .
Underneath it uses SSH to access the files , and you can set it to use alternate methods ( scp , sftp , rsync , etc ) .
I do wish it was a little faster though , or multi - threaded so it did n’t block Emacs when saving over a slow link .

Bookmarks – I bind M-b to bookmark - jump and I use it all the time .
I have bookmarks for each project I ’m working on and I use them with tramp - mode to get me onto the appropriate server .
to and I use it all the time .
I have bookmarks for each project I ’m working on and I use them with tramp - mode to get me onto the appropriate server .
Yasnippet – a recent add , this is a module which provides a template system for Emacs .
It comes with some useful boilerplate templates for various programming languages and you can easily add more .
I use the class and def ones for Python periodically as well as ones I ’ve added to set up a warn ( ) call .
browse - kill - ring – super useful to be able to pull up the full kill - ring and search for what you need .
I have my kill - ring set to hold 100,000 entries , so if I ’ve killed it in the current session I can be pretty sure I can get it back !
auto - complete – mode - aware auto-completion .
I ’m still not sure this one is going to last , but it does help a lot sometimes , particularly when I ’m coding deep in a Python file and I need to accurately type the name of an imported identifier from the top of the file .
And I ’m getting more used to hitting C - g when I need to keep what I ’ve typed and not accept a completion .
I think it ’s most likely a keeper .
Of course , not every experiment is a success .
Here ’s a few notable recent ones that I ’ve since abandoned :
ido - mode – I wanted to like this one .
Sometimes it ’s a big time - saver , quickly navigating to files I ’m trying to open in just a few keypresses .
But just as often I ’d find myself fighting with it , particularly when trying to create new files or navigate up a few levels .
Ultimately I decided that the benefits of having a file path that ’s editable the same way as normal text is just too much to give up .
registers – this still seems like something I should be using .
Surely the ability to remember locations and little bits of text and then replay them should come in handy .
Alas , not often enough to actually remember the keystrokes on the rare occasions when I think to use them .
rectangular selections – again , potentially very useful but I do n’t need it often enough to remember the bindings .
It does n’t help that the default binds are so verbose , possibly I could learn to love this feature if I rebound it .
Tags – I ’ve setup TAG file generation for several projects now , and each time I use it for a while and then fall back to grep and ack .
I think the way TAG searches work just does n’t match the way I want to search for things – I want to quickly browse through a list of hits , not jump from file to file .
Still , being able to jump from the use of a function directly to its definition seems like it should be very useful !
I ’m always curious about how other people use Emacs – what features do you use most and what have you tried that did n’t work out ?
The world will be watching when Real Madrid faces Barcelona in Saturday night 's El Clásico match .
You 're advised to savor the action .
As it stands , there will be no soccer matches in Spain next weekend after the Spanish players ' union , the AFE , Friday called a strike over unpaid wages that will halt games in the country 's top four leagues between April 16 and April 19 .
The pay disputes apply mainly to soccer players playing in the lower tiers of Spain 's professional soccer league , the LFP , but the strike was supported by a majority of players , according to the AFE .
In a statement Friday , the AFE confirmed that it had presented the Labor Ministry in Madrid with the official documents to call a general strike after negotiations with representatives from the LFP , Spain 's sports council and the Spanish Football Federation failed to establish a " Grand Pact for Spanish Football " that would satisfy players ' demands
" This strike will consist of the non-participation of players involved in official competition matches that could be played between clubs belonging to the Primera , Segunda A , Segunda B and Tercera divisions , " the union said .
The general strike wo n't affect " training sessions and technical activities , " it added .

NRK har gått gjennom de største problemene i årets første kvartal .
Det er dyster lesning , og kalenderen står bare på 1 . april .
For det går mot et nytt annum horibilis for norsk jernbane .
Året har knapt rukket å dreie et kvartal , og listen over hendelser begynner allerede å bli faretruende lang .
For i år har det gått fort og galt for norsk jernbane .
Begynner dårlig
En tunnelbrann i Asker like før nyttår gjør at året begynner med forsinkelser og innstilte tog fra vest mot hovedstaden .
Det fører til forsinkelser og innstilte tog allerede fra årets første dag .
Passasjerene blir stående på de togløse og iskalde perrongene i timevis uten verken oppfølging eller informasjon om når eller om toget i det hele tatt kommer .
Og det skal bli verre .
Den 7 . januar har situasjonen blitt så prekær at samferdselsminister Magnhild Meltveit Kleppa ( Sp ) innkaller direktør Elisabeth Enger i Jernbaneverket og konsernsjef Einar Enger i NSB til et hastemøte .
Der får Enger og Enger beskjed om at situasjonen for de reisende var over det Kleppa finner akseptabelt .
Sjefen i Jernbaneverket Elisabeth Enger og samferdselsminister Manghild Meltveit Kleppa hadde hastemøte .

Ikke uten grunn .
Ifølge VG er bare nær halvparten av lokaltogene i Oslo - område i rute i uke 1 .
På Vestfoldbanen er punktligheten så lav som 36 prosent , og på Dovrebanen er den nede i 35 prosent .
Natt til 7 . januar står Bergensbanen i timevis på grunn av feil , og feilene sprer seg utover dagen .
Vestfoldbanen står også i timevis , og det er en rekke andre forsinkelser i Oslo- området .
På perrongene står passasjerene hutrende i sprengkulden .
Elisabeth Enger forteller samferdselsministeren at Jernbaneverket og NSB har hatt en helt ekstraordinær situasjon å håndtere i desember og de første dagene i januar etter det Enger karrakteriserer som et år ( 2009 , red. anm ) med svært mange feil .
Frustrerte passasjerer på Oslo S har blitt et syn som er mer vanlig enn Jernbaneverket setter pris på .

Frustrerte passasjerer på Oslo S har blitt et syn som er mer vanlig enn Jernbaneverket setter pris på .
– Vi har hatt en uakseptabelt høy feilfrekvens , men vi har ikke funnet noe mønster .
Feilene i infrastrukturen har vært av forkjellige typer , sier Enger til Dagsavisen .
Hun sier videre at planene for å hindre en gjentakelse i 2010 er klare .
Nå skal 470 millioner kroner brukes til å forbedre avviklingen i Oslo-området .
Men problemene bare fortsetter .
Blir verre
Søndag 10 . januar er det på an igjen .
Da melder NSB at to tog har revet ned hver sin kjøreledning på Oslo S og Nordstrand .
Resultatet er at det ble strømløst i begge spor mellom Oslo S og Kolbotn .
Alle avganger i denne retningen blir innstilt .
Til alt hell for prøvede passasjerer viser kalenderen søndag kveld .
To dager senere er det Bergensbanen som er i hardt vær .
Ifølge Bergens Tidende opplever banen to skinnebrudd .
Ett vest for Vaksdal og ett vest for Stanghelle .
Dermed må passasjerene over på alternativ transport .
Etter bare to år i jobben velger sjefen i NSB Persontog Stein Nilsen å kaste inn håndkledet 11 . februar .

NSB - sjef spår togkaos i 30 år
– Jeg er den første til å innse at dette ikke er godt nok , sa han til NTB den gangen .
Han mener problemene i jernbanen skyldes en systematisk underbevilgning til Jernbaneverket gjennom flere år .
20 . februar går det troll i ord .
Da har et nattlig snøfall gitt problemer med både sporveksler og togavvikling i hovedstadsområdet .
Og problemene stopper ikke der heller .
Fire dager senere , den 24 .
februar , blir et tog fullt med passasjerer stående fast i timevis i Oslotunnelen mellom Nasjonalteateret og Oslo S. Stansen skyldes at en kjøreledning har falt ned slik at strømmen forsvinner .
NSB vurderer buss fremfor skinner
Dagen etter har når Posten Norge et metningspunkt .
De sier til NTB at de kommer til å flytte store deler av godstrafikken sin fra bane til vei etter lengre tids up ålitelighet langt skinnegangen .
NSB er heller ikke fjernt fra samme tanke .
Samme dag sier NSB til Dagsavisen at de kan tenke seg å redusere antall avganger med tog , og heller satse på å transportere sine passasjerer med buss .
– Det å innstille noen avganger og heller sette inn buss på enkelte strekninger , vil føre til større forutsigbarhet , sier informasjonsrådgiver Mai-Bente Paulsen til avisen .
Passasjerene på Bergensbanen har fått unngjelde flere ganger .

Som for å understreke alvoret må Bergen stasjon stenges etter at kjøreledningen faller ned samme dag .
Den siste uken i februar rapporterer Aftenposten at NSB nærmer seg ny bunnrekord i punktlighet .
Bergensbanen er nede i 38 prosents punktlighet , Vestfoldbanen er nede i 44 prosents punktlighet , og på Dovrebanen er punktligheten på 38 prosent .
På lokaltogene rundt Oslo blir det meldt om 68 prosents punktlighet .
Målet er mer enn 90 prosent .
Når statistikken for innstilte tog for årets to første måneder blir gjort opp , viser den 250 innstilte avganger .
Det er mer enn fire innstilte tog hver eneste dag i Norge .
Nye runder
Dagen før kvinnedagen , den 7 . mars , bærer det løs igjen .
Denne gangen er det passasjerene på Sørlandsbanen som får unngjelde .
Flere hundre meter kjøreledning har falt ned ved Vennesla , og fortvilte passasjerer blir holdt inne på toget i tre timer .
– Det tok veldig lang tid før noe begynte å skje .
Vi fikk ikke noe informasjon , toalettene hadde rent over og det var folk med klaustrofobi som hadde lyst til å gå ut .
Det var ikke noe kult , sier passasjer Kent Olaf Steinhaug til avisen Fedrelandsvennen .
Passasjerene på Sørlandsbanen har heller ikke fått unnslippe togkaoset .

11 . mars blir Nordlandsbanen stengt på ubestemt tid mellom Grong og Agle i Nord - Trøndelag etter at et ras har blokkert sporet .
Togføreren på et persontog fra Trondheim til Bodø oppdager raset og får varslet .
Dagen etter skriver Adresseavisen at rekordnedbør , snøsmelting , flom og ras stenger flere jernbanestrekninger i Trøndelag .
Foruten Nordlandsbanen , er også Meråkerbanen stengt på grunn av forholdene .
Bare dager senere , 19 . mars , melder samme avis at Meråkerbanen er stengt på ny .
Denne gangen fordi Jernbaneverket ikke har satt ut nok skilt om nedsatt hastighet på grunn av tele .
I Aftenposten kan man lese at Raumabanen er stengt mellom Åndalsnes og Dombås på grunn av rasfare .
Det samme er Bergensbanen , og NTB kan opplyse at Vestfoldbanen måtte stenge fordi et ras hadde blokkert skinnegangen mellom Larvik og Oklungen .
Dødsulykken som ikke kunne skje
25 . mars løper 16 godsvogner løpsk på Alnabru .
Godsvognene dundrer inn på Sjursøya i mer enn 100 kilometer i timen .
Når vognene stopper har tre mennesker mistet livet .
Ulykken som ikke kunne skje var et faktum .
Senere viste det seg at bare tilfeldigheter hindret en nær identisk ulykke fra samme sted i 2006 .
Her er godsvognenes ville ferd .

A MICHIGAN teenager could face trespassing charges after he was found living in the bedding section of a Bed Bath & Beyond store for four days , The Detroit News reports .
The boy 's mother reported him missing to police Sunday in the town of Rosewell , in east Michigan .
On Thursday morning , workers at the household retail store called police after they discovered the boy living at the store .
" Employees found him near the bedding section of the store , " Roseville Deputy Police Chief Anthony Cona said .
" He had some snacks with him .
We do n't know if he got them from inside the store or brought them from somewhere else . "
The boy would hide in the store before it closed and would leave in the morning at its opening , police said .
The teen , who has not been identified because he is a minor , has previously run away from his home a couple of times but it was not known how long he was gone , police said .
" There could be trespassing or larceny charges at some point , " said Officer Cona .
" But our main concern right now is the problems he has had with running away and getting him taken care of . "
WASHINGTON --
The bubbly enthusiasm that many analysts express about the Chinese economy reminds me of the old - time variety show host Lawrence Welk , who banished worries each week with soothing sounds from his " Champagne Music Makers . "
China watchers should turn off the music and listen to Premier Wen Jiabao , who has been surprisingly frank in warning that overinvestment and lack of domestic demand are producing an economic bubble in his country .
" The biggest problem with China 's economy is that the growth is unstable , unbalanced , uncoordinated and unsustainable , " Wen cautioned at a March 2007 news conference during the National People 's Congress .
That comment had about as much effect as former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan 's 1996 concern about the stock market 's " irrational exuberance . "
Wen again voiced concern last week to the National People 's Congress .
" We still face a very complex situation , " he said , given the twin dangers of overheating at home and the global recession abroad .
He pointed to a " precipitous rise " in housing prices in some Chinese cities and said that because of the danger of overinvestment , " the launching of new projects must be strictly controlled . "
The rise of China is one of the blessed miracles of modern economic history .
But Chinese leaders know they cannot repeal the economic laws of gravity .
As the economist Herbert Stein observed decades ago , " if something is ' unsustainable , ' that means it wo n't be sustained . "
That is surely true with the unbalanced , export - led growth that has powered China 's ascent .
" China 's dependence on export - led growth ... is unsustainable over time , " argues Robert Zoellick , president of the World Bank , in a forthcoming article in the journal The International Economy .
He cites a recent IMF analysis saying that for China to maintain its trend of 8 percent growth annually with the current pattern of trade , it would have to double its share of world exports by 2020 .
That is n't going to happen .
So the question is n't whether the Chinese economy will change , but how .
The optimistic view is that Chinese leaders will slow their investment and credit boom , and at the same time make a transition to a consumer - led economy that does n't depend so much on exports .
The scale of China 's growth is so overwhelming it can make analysts giddy : A compilation of " 15 facts about China that will blow your mind " by the Web site Business Insider enthuses : " By 2025 , China will build TEN New York - sized cities . "
It 's a vision of a perpetual cash machine .
The problem with these straight - line extrapolations is that they are notoriously unreliable in predicting the future .
Recall the forecasts about the Soviet Union in the 1960s , or Japan in 1990 .
My favorite analyst of bubble economies is David M. Smick , who predicted the U.S. financial mess in " The World Is Curved . "
He notes some worrying statistics :
Until the global financial crisis , Chinese exports represented 43 percent of its GDP .
To make up for collapsing foreign demand once the recession hit in 2009 , China launched a $ 1.8 trillion stimulus and lending program -- amounting to about 38 percent of its GDP .
This money was supposed to reach consumers , but Smick estimates that 85 percent of the subsidized loans went to state - run companies and banks -- pumping the investment bubble even larger .
Not to worry , say China enthusiasts :
A country with more than $ 2 trillion in foreign reserves does n't have to worry about debt problems .
But those reserves ( mostly in dollars ) are n't quite the safety net some imagine , since China could n't liquidate them without hurting itself badly , as economist Michael Pettis argues in his blog , China Financial Markets .
China has a larger problem of questionable loans on its domestic balance sheet .
Smick notes that $ 1.2 trillion of the Chinese stimulus package last year came in soft , subsidized loans .
And Victor Shih , a professor at Northwestern University , has been gathering information about murky , off - books borrowing by local investment companies that he reckons could amount currently to as much as $ 1.7 trillion , or about 34 percent of China 's GDP .
The most reassuring fact about China is that the country 's leaders see the problem and are trying to put on the brakes , ever so gently .
For a reminder of the dimensions of the overcapacity problem they 're facing , consider that China today has enough steel - making capacity to meet the demands of the U.S. , Russia , Japan and Europe combined .
For a country addicted to export - led growth , making the transition to a sustainable economy wo n't be easy .
People who assume that an ever - expanding China will inexorably replace America as the world economic superpower should take a close look at the numbers .
Author ’s note :
This is a response to Claudia Rosett ’s “ Turkey Tilts toward Iran , ” published on 26 March 2010 by Forbes.com .
Forbes columnist Claudia Rosett — who just so happens to be “ a journalist - in - residence ” with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies , a neo- conservative think tank — feigns her regret for having to report a “ disturbing talk ” that she claims went with an otherwise pleasant tea with Turkish President Abdullah Gül .
Rosett finds it regrettable that Turkey is seeking “ zero problems ” with one “ of the world ’s roughest neighbors . . . Iran . ”
However , what is really regrettable and truly disturbing for us is that this so - called interview is apparently fictional and yet Forbes nevertheless decided to publish it , complete with lies about the Turkish president ’s opinion on Iran and its nuclear program ( shamelessly and repeatedly labeled a “ bomb program ” by Rosett ) .
According to President Gül ’s press release ( published on the Presidency of the Republic of Turkey website on 27 March 2010 ) :
Following today ’s reports by some press organizations [ claiming ] that Mr. President gave an interview to the Forbes Magazine , the announcement below was deemed necessary : “ Neither today nor in the past has Mr. President ever given any interview to the Forbes Magazine .
We respectfully inform the public . ”
To date , Forbes has not published a correction or even a clarification on the matter , let alone an apology , nor has it taken the article offline , despite the Turkish president ’s public rebuttal that “ [ n] either today nor in the past ” has any such “ tea and interview ” affair with the Forbes columnist ever taken place .
The question is why Forbes — the self - proclaimed “ home page for the world ’s business leaders and No. 1 business news source in the world ” — pursues such an unprofessional behavior .
The answer may lie in the broader American policy for framing Iran and its leadership — or “ regime ” as the Western media prefer to call it — as irrational and dangerous .
That policy is now getting more momentum than ever before , including the Bush era , driven by the Euro - American efforts to subject Iran to “ crippling ” sanctions which the Western leaders hope will bite the “ regime ” ( meaning the country ) to its core .
As part of its “ crippling sanctions policy , ” the West seeks to exhaust every opportunity to normalize a discourse that refers to Iran as a bomb - building revolutionary ( read irrational ) “ regime ” threatening the peace - building , democracy - promoting , security - concerned West .
The help of its leading corporate media is crucial for that endeavor .
Rosett ’s disturbing article is emblematic of the tireless Western efforts to abuse any context at hand , or even just fabricate one , to portray a picture of an aggressive Iran designed to justify the Western governments ’ own aggressive policies against the legitimate and peaceful Iranian nuclear program along with Iran ’s wider role in the Persian Gulf and Middle East region .
Now that Turkey is one of the non-permanent members of the United Nations Security Council , its leaders ’ words carry a heavier weight .
Rosett ’s dubious article has President Gül make comments such as follows :
Gul says he has no doubts that Iran wants the nuclear bomb : “ This is an Iranian aspiration dating back to the previous regime , the days of the Shah . ”
For Iran ’s current regime , says Gul , “ I do believe it is their final aspiration to have a nuclear weapon in the end , ” as a matter of “ ‘ national pride . ' ”
That alone is testament to Rosett ’s penchant for misrepresentation and fabrication of facts , for Iran ’s nuclear program , either during the Pahlavi regime or under the Islamic Republic , has never been a “ bomb program . ”
For another vivid example of irresponsible journalism , look how Rosett sneaks in her favorite phrase , “ Iran ’s bomb program ” in the following mishmash of supposed quotes and out - of - quote statements , smoothly putting her own words in President Gül ’s mouth :
Gul reaches the sweeping conclusion that the real solution to Iran ’s bomb program is “ to eliminate nuclear weapons throughout the Middle East . ”
This , he suggests , is the way to “ guarantee the security of Israel . ”
But neither he nor any of the other Turkish government officials we spoke with in Ankara were able to provide a plan for ensuring that Iran — undeterred by years of European , American , U.N. and Turkish diplomatic talks — would genuinely abandon its bomb program .
Such is Forbes ‘ degenerate realpolitik today .
The real business for Forbes seems to be not to provide its corporate audience with reports and analyses that they need to succeed at work , but , ironically , to frighten them away from their opportunities to do business with one of the most potentially profitable business partners that they may ever have , namely Iran .
All this is not surprising given the history of corporate media ’s taste and talent for fear mongering , but it is , to use Rosett ’s words , “ a perilous guide , ” as is demonstrated by the media ’s role in paving the way for the bloodbath that we have seen , and are still seeing , in Iraq for example .
Following such a guide is not to anyone ’s long - term benefit , even that of the world ’s senior business executives .
What may become of the “ Free World , ” where the freedom of baseless allegation — or “ gossip ” in Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan ’s words — is practiced on a daily basis in the name of freedom of expression , all for the purpose of manufacturing consent to doing to Iran what has been done to Iraq ?
President Gül ’s rebuttal of the so - called “ interview ” is welcome , as it may enlighten Forbes ‘ current readers and future interviewees about the magazine ’s modus operandi .
However , to save the “ Free World ” from itself as well as save Iran from the “ Free World , ” the Turkish leadership would have to exert itself more energetically .

Part 2 of 2 . ( Read part 1 … )
It ’s Time to Separate Church and State , Once and for All
If you recall , anti-Catholic prejudice was once a problem for Catholic politicians in the US .
John F. Kennedy went so far as to address the issue head - on in his 1960 campaign – probably because he did n’t feel he had much choice .
Here ’s what he told the Greater Houston Ministerial Association on September 12 of that year :
I am not the Catholic candidate for President .
I am the Democratic Party ’s candidate for President who also happens to be a Catholic .
I do not speak for my Church on public matters — and the Church does not speak for me .
He went on to assert his respect for the separation of church and state and vowed that Catholic officials would not dictate policy to him .
As noted in part 1 , the times , they have a -changed .
In 1960 it was “ anti-Catholic prejudice . ”
In 2010 it ’s “ empirical evidence of improper behavior by the Roman Catholic Church . ”
And it ’s time it stopped .
Cold .
If I were a Congressman , I ’d introduce a bill yesterday stripping all US operations of the Roman Catholic Church of their tax - exempt status .
At the press conference announcing the move I ’d also say something along these lines : “ I wo n’t be running for re-election – what could possibly be the point ?
However , between now and the day I leave office , I ’m going to raise hell 24/7 / 4ever over this issue .
I know that I ’ll probably never get my bill into a committee hearing , let alone get it out of committee , but if Richard Dawkins , Sam Harris and Christopher Hitchens can draw as much attention as they have , I feel certain that I , as a sitting member of the United States Congress , can get booked on every talk show in America .
Rest assured , my fellow citizens , this is going to make for some epic television . ”
Of course , I ’m not Congressional material .
If you want to know what Congressional material is , recognize that representatives of a foreign theocracy are inside Congress shaping policy … and not a damned one of the spineless sacred whores on Capitol Hill has uttered a fucking syllable in protest .
Did I miss something ?
“ America is a Christian nation . ”
It certainly is .
Sort of .
It ’s a Christian nation in the same way that it ’s a white nation , a heterosexual nation , a right - handed nation and a nation with brown hair .
That is , “ Christian ” is the majority position .
Boy howdy , is it the majority position , with a majority of the population saying it believes angels and demons are active in the world and 80 % saying they believe in miracles .
Hell , even our atheists and agnostics sound a little religious .
A snapshot of American religious affiliation that I offered up back in 2007 is instructive :
Polls show the percentage of Americans identifying themselves as Christian ranging as high as 85 % or beyond .
The president is a Christian …
… as is the VP .
The Speaker of the House is Catholic …
… and the Senate Majority Leader is Mormon .
Well over 90 % of our Congressional representatives are Christian , with a majority of the remainder being Jewish .
The Supreme Court features seven Christians and two Jews .
All of our major presidential candidates in both major parties .
Almost all of our past presidents ; depending on how you count Unitarians , you have to go all the way back to Lincoln ( ironically enough , the founder of the GOP ) to even find one to debate over ;
Hell , even sports franchises are starting to build their operations around the evangelical litmus test .
It seems unlikely that a similar review of the legislatures and courthouses in the 50 states would reveal too much variation from this overpowering Judeo - Christian norm .
There ’s no denying that we ’re a Christian culture – in many ways , that ’s a simple math question and it ’s about as controversial as noting that whites of European descent are the racial majority .
But Christian culture and Christian government are n’t the same thing , and the United States is most emphatically not a Christian state .
Not yet , anyway .
Reflecting back on my “ if I were a Congressman ” fantasy from above , I suppose I ’d spend the remainder of my time in office asking the audiences of those TV shows to think about a proposition : to wit , while most Americans are Christian , “ Christian ” describes a lot of different things and not one unitary thing .
Dr. Sid’s “ modest proposal ” from a couple of months back was more about provoking than persuading , but at its core there ’s an important question .
If you ’re a Christian , you may want to see a more Christian government .
But if you ’re a Baptist , do you want to see a more Catholic government ?
If you ’re Catholic , how are you going to react when the Texas School Board is co-opted by Mormons and all of a sudden the nation ’s textbooks are filled with lessons that transform the hallucinations visions of The Prophets into stone cold fact ?
If you ’re a member of the Foursquare Bible Congregation in Smallpond , Alabama , you probably agree with the Stupakers on abortion , but how do you feel about the idea that your duly elected representatives are keeping counsel with that German eunuch in the pointy hat ?
Think about it , Christian supermajority .
Think hard .
Crawling Toward a More Rational Future
Evidence suggests that there may be hope in the long run .
From USA Today :
The percentage of people who call themselves in some way Christian has dropped more than 11 % in a generation .
The faithful have scattered out of their traditional bases : The Bible Belt is less Baptist .
The Rust Belt is less Catholic .
And everywhere , more people are exploring spiritual frontiers — or falling off the faith map completely .
These dramatic shifts in just 18 years are detailed in the new American Religious Identification Survey ( ARIS ) , to be released today .
It finds that , despite growth and immigration that has added nearly 50 million adults to the U.S. population , almost all religious denominations have lost ground since the first ARIS survey in 1990 .
“ More than ever before , people are just making up their own stories of who they are .
They say , ‘ I ’m everything .
I ’m nothing .
I believe in myself , ’ ” says Barry Kosmin , survey co-author .
From FutureMajority :
The American Religious Identification Survey ( ARIS ) also found that a movement towards claiming no religious affiliation is “ a general trend among younger white American . ”
The Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life reported “ people not affiliated with any particular religion stand out for their relative youth compared with other religious traditions . ”
…
The National Journal profiles a growing faction of non-religious youth – the Secular Student Alliance ( SSA ) .
Their motto is “ Mobilizing Students for a New Enlightenment . ”
The SSA ’s chapters have grown from 42 in 2003 to 129 this year and they currently have a network of over 14,000 students .
Their mission is “ to organize , unite , educate , and serve students and student communities that promote the ideals of scientific and critical inquiry , democracy , secularism , and human based ethics . ”
From AlterNet :
We are on the verge — within 10 years — of a major collapse of evangelical Christianity .
This breakdown will follow the deterioration of the mainline Protestant world and it will fundamentally alter the religious and cultural environment in the West .
Within two generations , evangelicalism will be a house deserted of half its occupants .
( Between 25 and 35 percent of Americans today are Evangelicals . )
In the “ Protestant ” 20th century , Evangelicals flourished .
But they will soon be living in a very secular and religiously antagonistic 21st century .
This collapse will herald the arrival of an anti-Christian chapter of the post - Christian West .
Intolerance of Christianity will rise to levels many of us have not believed possible in our lifetimes , and public policy will become hostile toward evangelical Christianity , seeing it as the opponent of the common good .
Millions of Evangelicals will quit .
Thousands of ministries will end .
Christian media will be reduced , if not eliminated .
Many Christian schools will go into rapid decline .
I ’m convinced the grace and mission of God will reach to the ends of the earth .
But the end of evangelicalism as we know it is close .
So perhaps in the 2020s and beyond the Bible - thumping Jesus Jihadi yahoo will be a thing of the past – or at least , his inexplicable influence on the course of government will be .
But that ’s of little comfort today .
Just because the good guys win the war eventually does n’t mean they do n’t lose battles along the way , and lost battles mean casualties , measured in lasting damage to real human lives .
Even if it ’s just ten years until we ’re free of these crusaders , understand that a lot of mischief can be done in a decade .
If I might put it in more meaningful terms , remember how long George Bush was in office ?
Add two years to that .
Not that it will do any good , but your Senators and representatives need to hear from you that it is not acceptable for the Catholic Bishops to be meddling in the people ’s business .
Separation of church and state .
Today .
When Jesus attacks , the proper course of action is to smack him in the nose with a crowbar .
It says so , right there in the Constitution .

U.S. Military Still Lying About Special Forces Night Raid in Afghanistan
Regardless of whether U.S. Special Forces removed bullets from the bodies of the Afghan women they just killed , as charged by the victims ’ relatives – and if they did , what their motivation was for doing so – spreading the story that the women ’s bodies had been found " tied up " and " gagged , " as NATO did in a Feb. 12 press release still posted on its web site , if that was not true , would meet any disinterested observer ’s definition of the word " coverup .

Highlights of the Afghanistan Debate
https://www.justforeignpolicy.org/video/housedebate
Summary :
U.S. / Top News
1 ) U.S. Special Forces are the focus of a high - profile investigation that could shed unprecedented light on their methods and tactics , the Los Angeles Times reports .
US and Afghan officials are probing a possible attempted coverup in the deaths of five Afghan civilians in February in a raid carried out by U.S. Special Forces .
Special Forces account for a disproportionate share of civilian casualties caused by Western troops , military officials and human rights groups say , though there are no precise figures because so many of their missions are deemed secret .
2 ) Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu canceled his plans to attend the Nuclear Security summit meeting in Washington next week , the New York Times reports .
Israeli news media reported that the prime minister feared that Muslim states were planning on using the occasion to raise the question of Israel ’s nuclear arsenal .
Israel is widely believed to be the only nuclear armed power in the Middle East , but it refuses to discuss the issue and has declined to join the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty .
3 ) Arab diplomats said they suspected Netanyahu had canceled mainly to avoid further confrontation with President Obama over Jewish settlements , and denied having any plans to press Israel on atomic policy , Reuters reports .
Two senior Arab officials accused Netanyahu of trying to evade questions on the Palestinian issue .
" We believe that Netanyahu withdrew from the summit because he did not want to face President Obama and is using Egypt and Turkey as an excuse , " a senior Egyptian diplomat said .
Another senior Arab diplomat said Arab states had no plan to " politicize " the venue and raise the Israeli issue there .
" We are surprised that the Israeli prime minister would use this as a pretext for not attending , " the second diplomat told Reuters .
But Turkey ’s Foreign Ministry said Prime Minister Erdogan would demand at the summit that Israel disarm as part of a nuclear - free Middle East .
Le Monde quoted Erdogan as saying this week that " Israel has nuclear weapons but does n’t belong to the NPT .
Does that mean that those who do n’t sign the NPT are in a privileged position ? "
4 ) Opposition leaders in Kyrgyzstan said they had no immediate plans to close the U.S. air base at Manas International Airport , the Washington Post reports .
But they indicated that , at a minimum , Washington would be forced to negotiate fresh terms to maintain the military installation , less than a year after the Bakiyev government tripled the rent and extracted $ 150 million in other concessions .
Roza Otunbayeva , leader of the interim government , suggested the new government would honor the U.S. lease for the base , which expires in July .
But she made no promises beyond that .
5 ) The international community could help Haiti " become more self - sufficient " by purchasing the entire Haitian rice crop over the next two years for just 2.35 percent of total current committed aid funds , says the Center for Economic and Policy Research in an issue brief .
CEPR finds that buying up all of Haiti ’s rice should be close to the amount of food aid for rice that the international community is likely to provide this year , and would provide a tremendous boost to Haitian farmers , who currently are unable to compete with low - cost rice imports from the U.S .
Turkey
6 ) Turkey ’s top prosecutor criticized planned constitutional changes but stopped short of launching a repeat of an attempt he made in 2008 to shut down the ruling AK party , Reuters reports .

1 ) Inquiry Puts Spotlight On U.S. Special Forces In Afghanistan
A joint U.S. - Afghan investigation into a raid in February may shed light on the secretive role of Special Forces , who are said to account for a disproportionate number of civilian deaths .
Laura King , Los Angeles Times , April 9 , 2010

Kabul –
In nearly nine years of warfare in Afghanistan , U.S. Special Forces have done their fighting in the shadows , governed by rules largely of their own making .
Now , these elite and secretive troops , their actions long shielded from public scrutiny , are the focus of a high - profile investigation that could shed unprecedented light on their methods and tactics .
American and Afghan officials are probing a possible attempted coverup in the deaths of five Afghan civilians in February in a raid carried out by U.S. Special Forces accompanied by Afghan troops .
Three of those killed were women and among the charges is that the bodies were tampered with by coalition forces to conceal the cause of death .
The U.S. military this week accepted responsibility for the Feb. 12 slayings , initially blamed on insurgents , and on Thursday , senior officials met with family members of the slain civilians to offer an apology .
But U.S. officials say allegations that bullets were dug out of the bodies as part of a coverup are baseless .
A new investigation has been opened , military officials in Afghanistan said Thursday , to further look into the differences between findings by Afghanistan ’s Interior Ministry and an initial American inquiry , which remains classified .
Special Forces are inextricably linked to one of the most contentious issues between the Afghan government and Western forces : civilian deaths and injuries .
Special Forces account for a disproportionate share of civilian casualties caused by Western troops , military officials and human rights groups say , though there are no precise figures because so many of their missions are deemed secret .
U.S. Army Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal , who took command of Western forces in Afghanistan last summer , has said such casualties are highly damaging to the Western effort , because they galvanize opposition to the foreign troop presence and fuel support for the insurgency .
McChrystal last year instituted strict new rules of engagement meant to limit civilian casualties .
But even under the new rules , Special Forces members , who have the task of hunting down key Taliban figures , continue to have more operational leeway than other troops .
In mountain villages and desert hamlets , the Special Forces inspire dread among Afghans , who tend to speak of them in whispers .
Their strikes are usually swift and violent , most often taking place in the dead of night .
At Western military bases , Special Forces troops are readily identifiable by shaggy beards , vaguely Afghan - looking dress , preternaturally fit physiques and a forbidding manner .
Usually housed in separate compounds , they rarely mix with other troops and tend to react explosively if anyone snaps a photo that might show their faces .
Initial military accounts of the February raid in the Gardez district of Paktia province made it sound as if it were a successful instance of Western raiders swooping down on wanted militants .
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization at the time described the slain men as armed insurgents who fired on coalition troops and said the women were already dead when the Special Forces arrived .
But in the ensuing two months , the narrative changed dramatically .
The slain men turned out to be an Afghan police official and a district prosecutor , according to local leaders .
They identified the others as a teenage girl and two pregnant women whose deaths left motherless a total of 16 children .
" We deeply regret the outcome of this operation , accept responsibility for our actions that night , and know that this loss will be felt forever by the families , " said Canadian Brig .
Gen. Eric Tremblay , a spokesman for the NATO - led International Security Assistance Force .
Both U.S. and Afghan officials say questions remain about whether the scene of the raid – a family compound in the village of Khatabeh – was tampered with afterward in an effort to conceal the circumstances of the deaths .
" By the time we got there , there was a foreign guy guarding the bodies , and they would n’t let us come near , " said Gen. Azizdin Wardak , chief of police in Paktia .
Both the Interior Ministry and the U.S. military , under NATO ’s auspices , are investigating reports that coalition forces washed down the compound , dug bullets from the walls and collected casings from the ground .
Though such actions could be consistent with a coverup , they could also have represented a legitimate effort to reconstruct and record the night ’s events , military officials say .
A British newspaper , the Times of London , cited an Afghan investigator as saying raiding forces may have tried to extract bullets from the bodies in an apparent attempt to conceal how they were killed .
The report said the unidentified investigator interviewed a relative who described a coalition soldier standing over one of the bodies with a knife .
U.S. Rear Adm. Gregory Smith , McChrystal ’s spokesman , said no forensic evidence or eyewitness testimony had been presented to support that account .
Zemari Bashary , a spokesman for Afghanistan ’s Interior Ministry , declined to detail the Afghan investigators ’ findings , which he said would be released in coming days .
Smith said NATO would issue a report on the raid ’s aftermath , though he said some details might remain classified .
Even in the absence of any proven coverup , the incident was a highly damaging one – especially since the military had initially suggested that the women had been killed execution - style by insurgents or in a so - called honor killing by their own relatives , not in the course of the raid itself .
" Joint Force Operating in Gardez Makes Gruesome Discovery , " read the headline of NATO ’s first news release about the incident .
The Special Forces raiders also apparently mistook a large celebration taking place in the compound for a gathering of insurgents .
Shortly after the raid , McChrystal , a former high - ranking special ops commander , moved to assert control over Special Forces units operating here .
Previously , many had separate chains of command .
He also moved this year to limit night raids , a prime weapon in the Special Forces arsenal , because of the heightened risk of confusion and mistaken identity .
In rural Afghanistan , most family compounds contain weaponry of some kind , increasing the likelihood that any accidental confrontation will take a lethal turn .
Upon hearing gunshots outside at night , men will almost invariably grab a gun and try to defend themselves , drawing the raiders ’ retaliatory fire .
Moreover , in this complex tribal society , Afghans sometimes try to settle clan feuds and other rivalries by fingering the other side as insurgents , as a means of bringing deadly raids down on the heads of their enemies .
A notorious Special Forces - ordered nighttime airstrike in Azizabad in August 2008 , which killed up to 90 people , was reported to have been prompted by a deliberately false tip about insurgent activity that reached the ears of the Western coalition .
Most of the dead were civilians , according to the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross .
Special Forces are regarded with mistrust not only by many Afghans , but also by some in the conventional ranks of the Western military .
Coalition field commanders responsible for operations in a given area often are not even aware of that a Special Forces strike is planned or taking place in their territory , but are left to deal with the consequences .
In the southern province of Oruzgan , an airstrike in late February that was reportedly called in by Special Forces killed at least 27 people when their vehicles were mistaken for an insurgent convoy .
Dutch troops operating in the area , who are acknowledged to be among the coalition ’s best at developing good relations with Afghan villagers , said they were not consulted , and said the raid was a serious setback to their efforts to win residents ’ trust .
In Khatabeh , residents ’ anger remained palpable despite the high - level apologies , local leaders said .
" People are still very , very upset , " said Jannat Khan , a provincial council member from Gardez .
" The Special Forces do these operations without telling anyone .
And they do n’t know who is the enemy and who is n’t . "
2 ) Netanyahu Cancels Trip to U.S. Nuclear Summit
Ethan Bronner and Isabel Kershner , New York Times , April 8 , 2010
http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/09/world/middleeast/09mideast.html
Jerusalem – Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has canceled his plans to attend the Nuclear Security summit meeting in Washington next week and will send a minister in his place , Israeli and American government officials said Thursday .
The official declined to explain the last - minute cancellation .
But Israeli news media reported that the prime minister feared that Muslim states were planning on using the occasion to raise the question of Israel ’s nuclear arsenal .
Israel is widely believed to be the only nuclear armed power in the Middle East , but it refuses to discuss the issue and has declined to join the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty .
The official said that Dan Meridor , the minister for intelligence affairs , would attend the meeting , which starts Monday .
In Washington , an administration official confirmed that Mr. Netanyahu had canceled his plans to attend .
The official said the United States believed that the cancellation was linked to Israeli concerns that the meeting would be used by some countries to focus on Israel ’s nuclear program and its refusal to sign the nonproliferation treaty .
Leaders of nearly four dozen countries are scheduled to attend the meeting , where President Obama is hoping to reach an agreement on securing vulnerable nuclear stockpiles in an attempt to keep them safe from terrorists .
But that issue could be further complicated if attending leaders insist on broadening the conversation to include Israel ’s reported arsenal .
Many Muslim countries , while acknowledging their concern over Iran ’s nuclear program , have insisted that the entire region must be made nuclear free .
[ …]
The Israeli prime minister ’s cancellation also comes against the background of recent tensions between the Obama administration and the Netanyahu government over the terms for restarting peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians .
The United States has asked Israel to take certain steps , and Mr. Netanyahu has yet to respond .
The main disagreement is over Israel ’s building in contested East Jerusalem .
3 ) Netanyahu ducks U.S. nuclear summit , fearing censure
Dan Williams , Reuters , Friday , April 9 , 2010 ; 1:31 PM
http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/09/AR2010040900935.html
Jerusalem – Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has withdrawn from a nuclear security summit in Washington next week , fearing Muslim delegates will demand Israel give up its assumed atomic arsenal .
Netanyahu , who plans to send a deputy and two senior advisers to the April 12 - 13 conference instead , canceled " after learning that some countries including Egypt and Turkey plan to say Israel must sign the NPT , " an Israeli official said .
Arab diplomats countered that they suspected Netanyahu had canceled mainly to avoid further confrontation with U.S. President Barack Obama over Jewish settlements , and denied having any plans to press Israel on atomic policy .
Netanyahu ’s attendance at the 47 - country summit would have been unprecedented .
Israeli premiers long shunned such forums , hoping to dampen foreign scrutiny on their nuclear secrets .
By staying outside the 1970 Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) , Israel has not had to forswear nuclear arms nor admit international inspectors to its Dimona reactor , which experts believe has produced plutonium for between 80 and 200 warheads .
Aides said Netanyahu had agreed to attend the summit after being assured it would focus on efforts to secure fissile materials and shun language challenging Israel ’s nuclear " ambiguity " policy .
Such coordination between the allies has been clouded by rifts over stalled Israeli - Palestinian peace talks .
But two senior Arab officials accused Netanyahu of trying to evade questions on the Palestinian issue that has lately clouded Israel ’s ties with its largest U.S. ally .
" We believe that Netanyahu withdrew from the summit because he did not want to face President Obama and is using Egypt and Turkey as an excuse , " a senior Egyptian diplomat said .
Another senior Arab diplomat intimately involved in the negotiations said Arab states had no plan to " politicize " the venue and raise the Israeli issue there .
" We are surprised that the Israeli prime minister would use this as a pretext for not attending , " the second diplomat told Reuters , speaking on condition of anonymity .
But Turkey ’s Foreign Ministry said Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan would demand at the summit that Israel disarm as part of a nuclear - free Middle East .
The French newspaper Le Monde quoted Erdogan as saying in Paris this week that " Israel is the principal threat to peace in the region today . "
" Israel has nuclear weapons but does n’t belong to the NPT .
Does that mean that those who do n’t sign the NPT are in a privileged position ? "
[ …] Israel says its nuclear secrecy helps ward off enemies while avoiding the kind of provocations that can trigger arms races .
The official reticence , and the tacit U.S. acceptance of Israel ’s nuclear monopoly , aggrieves Arab and Muslim powers .
India and Pakistan – both scheduled to attend the nuclear security summit – are outside the NPT , like Israel .
Unlike them , Israel has not openly tested or deployed atomic weapons .
4 ) Future Of U.S. Air Base In Turbulent Kyrgyzstan Uncertain
Philip P. Pan and Craig Whitlock , Washington Post , Friday , April 9 , 2010 ; A08
http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/08/AR2010040800787.html
Bishkek , Kyrgyzstan – Rival political groups were vying for control of this Central Asian republic Thursday , a day after protesters toppled the president for the second time in five years , raising fresh doubts about the future of a U.S. air base here that is critical to the NATO troop surge in Afghanistan .
President Kurmanbek Bakiyev refused to step down , but he remained in hiding as opposition leaders declared they would form an interim government and were in control of the capital , Bishkek , and most of the provinces .
Dawn arrived in Bishkek on Friday to reveal a city scarred from a second night of violence , though residents said civilian militias had restored order to much of the downtown area .
Garbage and broken glass littered streets lined with looted stores , while the charred remains of a few police and military vehicles sat outside the seat of government , the White House , which had been ransacked and burned , along with the chief prosecutor ’s building .
Across the boulevard was an abandoned armored personnel carrier , its tires slashed and an empty beer bottle sitting on the hood .
At least 75 people were killed and hundreds injured when security forces fired on protesters , who fought back and stormed key installations Wednesday .
Opposition leaders said they had no immediate plans to close the U.S. air base at Manas International Airport , a major transit hub for personnel and equipment en route to Afghanistan .
But they indicated that , at a minimum , Washington would be forced to negotiate fresh terms to maintain the military installation , less than a year after the Bakiyev government tripled the rent and extracted $ 150 million in other concessions .
The instability in Kyrgyzstan could complicate President Obama ’s plan to send 30,000 more U.S. troops to Afghanistan as part of an even larger NATO buildup there .
In March , 50,000 U.S. and allied forces heading to and from Afghanistan transited through the Manas air base , more than three times the monthly average last year .
U.S. officials said they were forced to curtail flights at Manas on Thursday and confine all troops to the base .
Roza Otunbayeva , a former foreign minister and ambassador to the United States , was named the leader of the interim government .
She suggested that the new government would honor the U.S. lease for the base at Manas , which expires in July .
But she made no promises beyond that , saying at a news conference , " We still have some questions on it . "
Several opposition leaders had criticized Bakiyev for agreeing to host the base and the Obama administration for overlooking his government ’s human rights abuses and suppression of democratic freedoms .
One leader of the interim coalition said the lease on the base might not last , citing Russia ’s support for Bakiyev ’s removal .
Last year , Moscow thought it had persuaded Bakiyev to expel the U.S. military , but he changed his mind after Washington agreed to pay more .
" You ’ve seen the level of Russia ’s joy when they saw Bakiyev ’s ouster , " Omurbek Tekebayev , a former opposition leader now in charge of constitutional matters , told the Reuters news agency .
" So now there is a high probability that the duration of the U.S. air base ’s presence in Kyrgyzstan will be shortened . "
Russia has operated an air base in the city of Kant – about 40 miles from Manas – since 2003 .
The U.S. military began operations at the Manas base in December 2001 , soon after it invaded Afghanistan .
In addition to serving as a hub for troops flying back and forth from the war zone , the base is a refueling center for U.S. planes flying missions over Afghanistan and is home to a KC - 135 tanker squadron .
Excluding Afghanistan , Manas has been the only U.S. military air base in Central Asia since 2005 , when Uzbekistan evicted the United States from the Karshi - Khanabad air base there .
The U.S. military separately relies on several overland routes – mostly via Pakistan and Tajikistan – to deliver supplies and equipment to Afghanistan .
Alexander Cooley , a Columbia University professor who studies U.S. military relations in Central Asia , said the interim government in Kyrgyzstan was unlikely to order the Americans to leave because the country needs U.S. financial assistance and because the American presence serves as a useful counterbalance to Russia ’s influence in the region .
But he said the U.S. government had been so intent on securing the base that it had turned a blind eye to corrupt dealings by Bakiyev and his allies .
As a result , Cooley said , many Kyrgyz citizens saw Manas as the poisonous fruit of relations with Washington .
" It ’s symbolized the U.S. disregard for democracy and human rights , " he said .
" The base took over the entire U.S. foreign policy in dealing with Kyrgyzstan . "

5 ) International Community Can Boost Haiti’s Self - Sufficiency by ‘ Buying Local ’ Rice
Center for Economic and Policy Research , April 7 , 2010
http://www.cepr.net/index.php/press-releases/press-releases/international-community-can-boost-haitis-self-sufficiency/
http://www.cepr.net/index.php/publications/reports/using-food-aid-to-support-haiti/
Washington , D.C. –
The international community could , in the words of former President Bill Clinton , help Haiti " become more self - sufficient " by purchasing the entire Haitian rice crop over the next two years for just 2.35 percent of total current committed aid funds .
A new issue brief from the Center for Economic and Policy Research ( CEPR ) finds that buying up all of Haiti ’s rice should be close to the amount of food aid for rice that the international community is likely to provide this year , and would provide a tremendous boost to Haitian farmers , who currently are unable to compete with low - cost rice imports from the U.S .
" The international donors have said that they do not want to repeat the mistakes of the past , which have destroyed much of Haiti ’s agriculture , " said Mark Weisbrot , economist and CEPR Co-Director , and lead author of the paper .
" It would be very easy and inexpensive for them to keep this promise .
Now we will see if they mean it . "
There has been a growing recognition that past food aid to Haiti has had a significant negative impact on local food production and contributed to the sharp decline of Haiti ’s rice sector .
Last month , Bill Clinton told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that exporting cheap rice to Haiti " was a mistake … I had to live everyday with the consequences of the loss of capacity to produce a rice crop in Haiti to feed those people because of what I did . "
The paper notes that while there is much that can and should be done to support Haitian agriculture and the rebuilding of the economy , it is most important to immediately reduce the harm caused by imported , subsidized rice .
The authors propose that this can be done by having the international community immediately commit to buying Haitian rice for the next two years .
Since food aid was 13 percent of the total rice supply last year , and Haitian rice production is about 15 percent of total supply , buying up all of Haiti ’s rice would be close to the amount of food aid for rice that the international community would be expected to provide this year .
The paper also suggests the aid donors buy the rice at a price that is high enough to encourage local production .
Even though this would have to be somewhat higher than an average of past years ’ market prices , the cost would only be between $ 62.1 million and $ 82.8 million per year .
Since international donors have committed $ 5.3 billion in aid for the next 18 months , or $ 3.53 billion annually , the cost of buying Haiti ’s rice crop would be only 1.76 to 2.35 percent of committed international aid funds .
Since there are funds allocated to bringing in a similar amount of rice in any case , the additional cost of buying the Haitian rice crop would actually be considerably less than the high estimate of $ 82.8 million , or 2.35 percent of committed funds .
On March 25 , former President Clinton and UN special envoy to Haiti told representatives of aid groups : " Every time we spend a dollar in Haiti from now on we have to ask ourselves , ‘ Does this have a long - term return ?
Are we helping them become more self - sufficient ? …
Are we serious about working ourselves out of a job ? "

6 ) Turkish prosecutor says reforms bad , lets AK off hook
Reuters , Friday , April 9 , 2010 ; 1:26 PM
http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/09/AR2010040901859.html
Ankara – Turkey ’s top prosecutor criticized planned constitutional changes on Friday as undemocratic but stopped short of launching a repeat of an attempt he made in 2008 to shut down the ruling AK party .
The Turkish media had speculated for months that prosecutor Abdurrahman Yalcinkaya could again try to use laws banning anti-secular activity to close the governing party , and thereby prevent constitutional changes which the senior judiciary deeply opposes .
Markets fell by almost one percent during Valcinkaya ’s press conference but rose by 1.5 percent when he failed to mention " a closure case against AK Party , " Halil Recber , a strategist at Anadolu Invest , said .
Turkish stocks closed at a fresh all - time high , as investors bought into Turkey ’s expected strong growth this year .

7 ) Court calls on Uribe to sign ‘ Law of Forced Disappearance ’
Brett Borkan , Colombia Reports , Thursday , 08 April 2010 08:37
http://colombiareports.com/colombia-news/news/9042-court-calls-on-uribe-to-sign-law-of-forced-disappearance.html
Colombia ’s Constitutional Court on Wednesday called on President Alvaro Uribe to pass the " Law of Forced Disappearance , " which sets out new provisions on registering and searching for people who have been secretly kidnapped or murdered .
The court stated that Uribe ’s objection to the " Law of Forced Disappearance " are unfounded , and that he should sign the bill , reports Caracol Radio .
The bill , which has already been passed by Congress and is awaiting Uribe ’s approval prior to becoming a law , seeks to establish an official policy on finding , registering , and caring for the victims of forced disappearance .
The court argued that the bill should be converted into law because the Congress has already approved it , and that the government has the resources to fund it .
One of Uribe ’s objections to signing the bill is that it it exceeds the resources the government has allocated for such programs .
The bill , if enacted into law , will lead to the creation of a genetic database of forcefully disappeared individuals , and the construction of monuments to honor the victims .
The official figures of forced disappearances differ , in 2009 the United Nations said there were 17,000 cases , NGOs reported 24,000 , while Colombia ’s prosecutor general said there were 50,000 .
In 2008 , the UN said that Colombia was the only country where forced disappearances continue to be a problem .
8 ) Ecuador to re-file charges against Santos
Brett Borkan , Colombia Reports , Thursday , 08 April 2010 11:14
http://colombiareports.com/colombia-news/news/9047-ecuador-to-re-file-charges-against-santos.html
An Ecuadorean judge announced on Thursday that charges will be re-filed against Colombia ’s front - runner presidential candidate , Juan Manuel Santos , for his role in the 2008 cross - border attack on a FARC camp , reports Eco Diario .
The judge , Francisco Revelo , explained that the initial charges , which were launched in 2009 but put on hold in February of this year , were permanently dropped on Wednesday because they did n’t follow formal procedures .
According to Revelo , the accused " were not notified by the prosecution , " which violates their right to defense .
As a result , Revelo explained , new charges against Santos , who was Colombia ’s defense minister at the time of the cross - border bombing , will be filed .
Santos was not the only Colombian named in the charges .
Armed forces commander Freddy Padilla and former army chief Mario Montoya were also named by the Ecuadorian court .
The charges against the three Colombians stem from their alleged personal and criminal responsibility for the March 2008 cross - border attack on a FARC camp that killed the rebels ’ number two , Raul Reyes , and 25 others , including one Ecuadorian citizen .
The incident led to a break - down in diplomatic relations between the two nations , with Ecuador requesting the extradition of the high ranking Colombian military leaders .

Thinking about going digging for gold in the dumpsters around your town ?
Start with the FAQ at Dumpsterworld , the online community for skip - spelunkers :
There 's many reasons that perfectly good things go in the garbage .
One of the biggest reasons is business practice .
Remember that businesses are there to make profit .
Goods that are overproduced , do n't sell , need repair , or take too much space and maintainence , are unprofitable to keep .
It can also be unprofitable to sell them below cost or give them away free , so they go to waste .
Wasting goods helps retailers profit if people might otherwise pay for new ones , and producers profit when more get made .
Waste is a regular result of doing business .
Consider how the government props up agriculture and stops it from having a depression , in years when the grain market is saturated .
It buys excess grain from farmers , takes it off the market , and lets it rot in warehouses .
Farmers still get paid for it , and then they can sell their regular supply without the price dropping below cost .
In our system , competing suppliers are always producing more stuff than they can sell , and the excess goes to waste .
Business policies enforce waste .
Department stores toss products for cosmetic damage or an open package .
Offices toss equipment when they upgrade .
A college might toss last year 's furniture for new , because it has to spend money so next year 's budget does n't drop .
Groceries toss sealed containers of food when it expires .
Expiration dates are planned for selling , keeping in mind that a consumer will have days or weeks more for use of the goods .
Relative worth is another reason why good things go in the trash .
Wants , needs , and usability change between people .
John Moneybags dumps his sofa because it does n't match the wallpaper , Jane Englishmajor trashes a pile of books because they 're too bulky to carry home for the summer , and Joe Bluecollar throws out his TV because he does n't have time to fix a bad wire .
Good news , smartphone fans .
It turns out there may not be a looming spectrum crisis after all .
That 's according to Verizon CEO Ivan Seidenberg , who suggested to the Council on Foreign Relations on Tuesday that it 's time to relax about this matter .
" If video takes off , could we have a spectrum shortage in five or seven years ? "
Seidenberg asked out loud .
" Could be , but I think that technology will tend to solve these issues .
And I think , as I said , I happen to think that we 'll advance fast enough that some of the broadcasters will probably think , let me cash out and let me go do something different .
" So I think the market will settle it .
So I do n't think we 'll have a spectrum shortage the way this document suggests we will . "
The " document " in question is the FCC's National Broadband Plan , and if you 're experiencing Seidenberg 's comments as somewhat Orwellian , you 're not the only one .
" The recent statements by Verizon 's CEO are rather baffling , " declared Federal Communications Commission Chief of Staff Edward Lazarus on his blog .
" The fact is , Verizon played a major role in building an overwhelming record in support of more mobile broadband spectrum , consistently expressing its official view that the country faces a looming spectrum crisis that could undermine the country 's global competitiveness . "
For instance , there was this statement Verizon endorsed , signed by almost 100 companies and sent to the FCC on December 2 :
Our nation 's ability to lead the world in innovation and technology is threatened by the lack of sufficient spectrum for wireless broadband applications and services .
As the chairman has said , there is a looming spectrum crisis .
We applaud your candid acknowledgement of this fact and appreciate your efforts to close the spectrum gap .
Without more spectrum , America 's global leadership in innovation and technology is threatened .
The undersigned urge you to allocate more spectrum for wireless broadband as soon as possible .
Please let us know how we can help .
At this point , Verizon could probably " help " by not suddenly acting like it did n't say any of this stuff .
If " video takes off " ?
We 're also wondering how the TV broadcasters will " cash out " and let the wireless companies buy their spectrum if there is n't an orderly plan to make sure that can happen smoothly .
CTIA - The Wireless Association , of which Verizon is a member , has proposed one , and it suggests that the matter is a little more complicated than just letting the market settle things .
So did Verizon back in July of 2009 : " The Commission has identified only 50MHz of additional spectrum for next generation wireless growth , " the company wrote .
" This total lags behind both the United States ' competitor nations as well as the ever - increasing demand for mobile broadband services .
Verizon Wireless therefore urges the Commission to undertake a targeted examination of spectrum to identify additional bands . "
That , of course , was then .
This , apparently , is now .
An opinion poll for the Sun has found more people thought none the worse of Gordon Brown for describing a Labour voter as a " bigoted woman " , than believed he was a hypocrite – but the newspaper decided not to publish the figures .
The results provide some comfort for Labour after the incident continued to dominate the news agenda for much of the day , overshadowing the build - up to the final leaders ' debate .
They also indicate that the embarrassing episode for the prime minister has had a minimal effect on voter intentions .
Voters were asked about their perception of the Labour leader in the aftermath of the insulting private comments he made about 65 - year - old Gillian Duffy , caught on an open
Sky microphone yesterday , after she had challenged him on issues including the national debt and immigration .
The prime minister later apologised to Duffy in person for his comments , saying he was a " penitent sinner " .
Asked if they agreed with the statement " It 's a storm in a teacup .
Mr Brown was simply trying to let off steam in private .
We should not think the worse of him " , 50 % of those polled by YouGov agreed .
By way of comparison , 46 % agreed with the statement : " Mr Brown is a hypocrite – saying one thing in public and the opposite in private . "
The remaining 4 % of respondents were undecided .
The survey , carried out yesterday , also showed that just 9 % of the 527 people polled said the episode was less likely to make them vote Labour , while 3 % said it was more likely to make them vote Labour .
The overwhelming majority – 83 % – said it would not affect their voting intentions .
The Sun 's failure to run the results is likely to be seized upon by critics of the paper who have accused it of not publishing the details of polls that are unfavourable to the Conservatives .
The Sun announced it was backing the Tories , after 12 years of support for Labour , in September last year .
Last week the Lib Dems accused the paper of suppressing the results of a YouGov poll that showed that if people thought Nick Clegg 's party had a significant chance of winning the election , it would win 49 % of the votes , with the Tories winning 25 % and Labour just 19 % .
The Sun also decided not to publish the details of another poll taken yesterday that was favourable to the Lib Dems .
It showed that 29 % of people thought the Lib Dems were being the most honest about spending cuts , compared to 26 % who named the Conservatives and 21 % who plumped for Labour .
The Sun 's decision not to run the " bigot - gate " poll was highlighted by Mark Pack , co-editor of the Liberal Democrat Voice website .
He noted the results had appeared on the YouGov website – in compliance with the rules of the British Polling Council .
There is no question YouGov had done anything wrong .
Pack added : " The Sun do commission more opinion polls than you would expect them to publish ... but it 's very striking when you have the Sun running a story and they have put forward a polling question that gives a very different slant [ in its results ] . "
The Sun had not responded to the Guardian 's request for a comment by the time of publication .
The remains of a little finger discovered in a cave in the mountains of southern Siberia belong to a previously unknown human ancestor , scientists said today .
The finding suggests an undocumented human species lived alongside Neanderthals and early modern humans in parts of Asia as recently as 30,000 years ago .
If confirmed , it would be the first time a new human ancestor has been identified since the discovery of Homo floresiensis , the diminutive " hobbits " that lived on the Indonesian island of Flores until 13,000 years ago .
Fragments of the finger bone were recovered from Denisova cave in the Altai mountain range that straddles Russia , Mongolia , China and Kazakhstan .
The cave was occupied by humans for 125,000 years and a variety of stone tools and bones have been recovered .
The size of the bone has led scientists to believe it came from a child , aged between five and seven , though they are unable to say whether it was male or female .
Scientists at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig , Germany , ran genetic tests on the bone fragments and were stunned to find it did not match the DNA profile of Neanderthals or early modern humans .
Johannes Krause sequenced DNA from mitochondria , the sub - cellular bodies that carry genetic material passed down only the maternal line .
Because the DNA came from the mother , they called the creature " X - woman " .
" It really looked like something I had never seen before .
It was a sequence which is similar in some ways to humans , but still quite distinct , " Krause said .
It is the first time a new type of human has been identified from DNA alone .
By comparing the DNA with sequences from Neanderthals and modern humans , Krause 's team concluded that modern humans shared a common ancestor with the creature a million years ago .
Humans and Neanderthals diverged from an ancestor that lived 500,000 years ago .
When Krause saw the results of the genetic test , he called project leader Svante Pääbo .
" It was absolutely amazing , I did n't believe him .
I thought he was pulling my leg , " Pääbo said .
The bone fragments were recovered from a layer of rock in the cave dated to between 48,000 and 30,000 years ago .
The first humans to move from Africa to Eurasia were Homo erectus 1.9 m years ago , but scientists believed they died out around 100,000 years ago .
The new species probably migrated from Africa more recently , around 1 m years ago , and survived in Eurasia until at least 40,000 years ago .
Krause 's team is now analysing DNA from the nuclei of cells in the finger fragments in the hope of locating the species in the human family tree .
The tests should also indicate whether there was any interbreeding between the new species , Neanderthals and modern humans .
" There were at least three different forms of humans in the area between 30,000 and 40,000 years ago , and there were also the hobbits in Indonesia , so the picture of what was around in human form in the late Pleistocene gets a lot more complex and a lot more interesting , " Pääbo said .
Chris Stringer , head of human origins at the Natural History Museum in London , said : " This new DNA work provides an entirely new way of looking at the still poorly understood evolution of humans in central and eastern Asia . "
Ah , gotta love second - hand mix-ups .
In fact , I think this one even beats the time a kid got a bag of rocks instead of a Nintendo DS .
But apparently , a four year - old boy got a bag of marijuana with his new XBOX 360 game .
Granted , the game in question was Fight Night Round 4 , which no four year - old should ever be playing .
His dad , who was 30 , really should ’ve known this , but y’know , that ’s not what we ’re here to talk about .
Maybe this was a really precocious 4 year - old who could obviously handle a T - rated game .
Yeah , let ’s assume that .
Anyway , Andy Brown in West Sussex , England bought the aforementioned game secondhand at a Blockbuster for his little boy Riley .
“ He ’d only been playing the game ten minutes when he came down with the bag in his hand and asked , ‘ Daddy , what ’s this ? ’ ”
Andy says .
Naturally , Daddy took the weed away before his little boy could smoke up .
Needless to say , a horrible crisis was averted .
“ … What if he ’d thought it was sweets , and started munching away ? ”
Andy continued .
“ It does n’t bear thinking about . ”
Obviously , the moral of this story is threefold .
First , do n’t buy games for your four year - old and let him take them out on his own .
Second , four year - olds should n’t be playing games designed for teenagers .
Third , British parents are stupid .

House Concerts 101
** NOTE : This is an awesome blog post , but it is out of date !
Instead , see this page for updated 2013 show booking notes !
The writing below is wonderful but also it is a historical document from early 2010 .
There ’s an updated version that is very much the same .
New info : https://mariancall.wordpress.com/booking-a-house-concert/**
My 2010 tour will consist primarily of house concerts .
Yet most of my listeners have never attended a house concert .
Even fewer have hosted .
So what ’s the deal ?
Here ’s the deal .
Let ’s go back in time , back to the millenia before television brought Mick Jagger at halftime into your living room through a glowy blue box .
If you wanted live music , you had to make it happen in your own house , yard , church , pub , temple , piazza , or outhouse .
The best modern equivalent is a house concert .
I ’m not saying those old days were better , but I am saying it ’s probably been too long since you ’ve listened to fantastic music up close and live in a quiet environment — that ’s a transformative experience .
It ’s way different than going out , way different than listening to MP3’s , way different than anything the glowy blue box can bring you .
And you still make it happen .
I ’ve played dozens and dozens of house concerts now , and 90 % of them were with hosts who had never organized a house concert before .
So do n’t say you ca n’t do it — you can !
It ’s entirely simple , cheap for everyone , friendly , fun , environmentally smart , economically smart — and the food and alcohol are way better and cheaper than what you get going out .
How does it work ?
You contact an artist , set a date , get them your address , invite your friends by e-mail and take RSVP ’s , plan for food or drinks ( if you want to ) , and then I show up , set up my gear , and play for you !
Things prospective house concert hosts ALWAYS say to me :
“ I ’d love to , but my house is too small . ” EVERY host says this at first .
No , it ’s not .
I ’ve done house concerts for 5 people in a tiny cabin in Alaska and for 25 in an even smaller crowded standing - room - only flat in Hollywood , with everyone shoulder - to - shoulder .
I ’ve even played a dorm room .
Your house can fit way more people than you think .

“ I ’ve never done anything like that before . ”
You probably have .
Take any kind of house party you can think of — a drunken BYOB bash , a child - friendly family potluck , a birthday party with presents , a backyard BBQ , a fancy wine and cheese event — and just imagine that the theme of the afternoon / evening is music .
The artist ( me ) will provide absolutely everything related to the music part of the show ; all you do is put on a very normal party , invite people , set out drinks , and wait for all of us to show up .

“ I do n’t know if I want strangers in my house . ”
No need to have any ( besides me ) .
You can have a private event , just for your friends and family .
Or you can host it at a local community center , school , place of worship , park , swimming pool — anywhere !
People get all sorts of creative , using these concerts for fundraisers , community events , conventions , kids ’ time , etc .
The host sets the parameters .

“ It will take so much time ! ” Well , it can , but it does n’t have to .
I ’ve played some elaborate , carefully coordinated house concerts , and some that the hosts just let happen .
Potlucks and BBQ’s , especially , are low - to - no maintenance and take only a few e-mails to coordinate .

“ My place is a mess . ”
Everyone says this , and everyone is lying .
By the time I arrive you ’ve usually scrambled for thirty minutes and made it look lovely .
( If you need an excuse to clean up , this would be it … )

“ You ca n’t come to my town , I ’m out of the way . ”
People who contact me and ask nicely usually get me to come sooner or later .
If you ’re out of the way , just guarantee me a certain number of people in attendance , or a certain amount of money ( surprisingly little ) and I ’ll make it happen .
As long as I do n’t lose money coming to your town , I will probably be game !

“ Wow , that was amazing and special and unforgettable .
And it was so much easier than I thought ! ” I hear this Every .
Single .
Time .
Most hosts and guests are thrilled by their first house concert .
Get out to one in your area if you want an idea of how they go !
There are lots of normal folks like you beginning to host monthly or quarterly concerts because they ’ve found it ’s so easy , fun , and memorable .
Artists love to be asked to do house concerts — after the bars - and - cafes grind , they ’re a pleasure .
Your favorite local artist would probably be thrilled to play one for you .
Why not ask ?
Ask me anytime : visit this blog entry to actually request a concert , or e-mail mcminion42@gmail.com to ask questions .*
Answers to FAQ ’s are below if you ’re thinking of hosting .
If you ’ve hosted or attended a house concert before , do leave your thoughts in the comments !
– What do I need to provide ?
Just some comfortable space where people can stand or sit and mingle , and later listen attentively to music .
Consider what your sort of crowd would be comfortable with .
You also need to provide at least some of the people — most house concerts are populated by the host ’s friend and social circle , though occasionally one will be promoted as a public event and I will invite other fans to RSVP .
– What ’s the food and drink situation ?
This is completely up to you .
I ’ve played at fully catered gourmet dinners , potlucks , barbecues , desserts , wine tastings , and even afternoon or late evening events which had no real food — only beverages and cookies .
Anything goes , as long as your guests are prepared for what to bring and what will be available .
– How does the event flow ?
Usually the event starts with about forty - five minutes to an hour of mingling and food and drink .
When the moment feels right ( or right on the clock , however you like it ) you invite people to claim their space for the show , and I begin performing .
I usually do two forty - five minute sets with a break ( so as not to wear down guests ’ attention span .
I am very generous with my tunes ; if folks are engaged I ’ll go as long as the audience likes and do any and every request I can ) .
During the show at some point , I invite people to give money , usually $ 10 - 15 , and / or buy CD ’s , and I leave it at that .
The host can keep their hands clean of the money business for the most part ; I ’m used to doing it myself .
After the show people mingle some more , in varying stages of sobriety , sometimes staying all night and sometimes going home right away .
When everyone ’s gone usually you and I crack one last beer or heat one last cup of tea and sigh and chat about how fun the evening was .
Then I drive away ( or sleep on your couch , depending ) and provided your guests are the good kind , you ’re left with minimal mess .
– How do I promote the event ?
Do I have to post my personal information on the internet ?
You can make your event private — only for people you know — or public .
If it ’s public , I will advertise it , but I will not post your name or address on the web unless you ask me to .
Usually prospective guests can get the address in exchange for a firm RSVP by e-mail .
( And my fans are awesome people that you ’d want to meet anyway . )
To get the word out , e-mail invites and a Facebook event usually do the trick ; some folks use a service like evite , but I ’ve almost never seen that go very well .
The very best promotion in the world is word of mouth .
If you ’re excited , your friends will be too .
I ’m happy to help with a free MP3 for invitees , plus all the links and photos and posters you could want — or a spiffy e-mail / web invite like the one below .
Plus I ’m happy to give you CD ’s and bonus things .
House Concert hosts get Marian Call perks of all kinds — just ask !
UPDATED : for help writing an invitation or get official images , posters , etc. , just click on the tab at the top of this page called “ Publicity Tools . ”
Everything you need is there ( scroll down to the bottom ) .
Things it ’s important to clarify when you invite people : 1 ) this will be a house concert , not a house party , and the music is the feature event ; 2 ) bring your own ( chair , food , beer , kids , whatever they should bring , as people want to know ) ; 3 ) whether kids are welcome , and if they are , whether childcare will be provided .
– What about the * gulp * money ?
Awkward … I understand completely .
Asking guests for $ $ is awful .
If you mention it up front , in the e-mail invitation , it ’s actually less awkward — and if you leave a basket at the door , instead of passing the hat , again , less awkward .
People do n’t like letting other people watch them pay .
A good way to phrase the invitation is to say there ’s a “ $ 10 - 15 per person recommended donation for the artist , pay - as - you - can . ”
I ’ll reinforce that with a friendly announcement that I ’m used to making .
I never begrudge folks coming and not paying , or paying less than $ 10 .
But I do have to make ends meet .
So the idea is to prepare guests for what to expect before you ’re speaking to them in person .
I do n’t require a minimum guarantee , unless I ’m flying far afield , but if you think you might have less than 12 - 15 people , it ’s good to tell me that directly , since that may affect what other shows I look for in the area or what date I book with you .
– Can I really do this ?
Absolutely !
And to paraphrase most of my house concert hosts from around the country , it ’s a fantastic and memorable and [ insert many glowing adjectives here ] experience .
You ’ll be so glad you did .
So will I . I ’m proud of you !

CHICAGO — A University of Chicago freakonomics professor told General Electric investors Monday to keep a close eye on recent fluctuations in the heights of competitive powerlifters from Mexico .
" Usually we can count on a stable average of 5 feet 8 inches , but last month 's quarter - inch drop in height among Mexican dead - lift competitors in the middle - heavyweight division could spell disaster for GE 's aviation and software subsidiaries , " freakonomist James Duncan said .
" But , like anything else , a shrewd investor must always ask himself one thing :
How many hot dogs did I eat last year ? "
Duncan previously gained recognition for tracking first - time home ownership and teenage mothers ' gum purchases against the Times Tom Jones Is Played Per Day Index .

DETROIT -- Phoenix Coyotes captain Shane Doan will not play tonight in Game 4 against the Detroit Red Wings , coach Dave Tippett said .
Doan did not skate this morning .
Tippett said the forward 's upper - body injury ( believed to be his right shoulder ) is not long - term and believes there is a chance he can play in Game 5 on Friday in Phoenix .
" With two days before our next game , it 's best for him to wait a couple of days , '' Tippett said .
" Early on , he was upset .
His demeanor yesterday was good .
He knows he 's not going to be out long - term .
Rest tonight and , hopefully , he can jump in on Friday . ''
Doan was injured two minutes into the second period in Game 3 when he stumbled over goaltender Jimmy Howard and crashed his right shoulder into the boards .
Center Vernon Fiddler will return from his upper - body injury to replace Doan in the lineup .
The average salary in the American videogame industry dropped by more than 4 % to $ 75,573 in 2009 , Game Developer Research said Tuesday .
Average paychecks for the people who make games reached a record high of $ 79,000 in 2008 .
Last year is the first year on record to see a major downturn in game developer pay .
Code - monkeys and suits pulled down the most money in 2009 , with businesspeople taking home nearly $ 100,000 and programmers earning a little less than that .
Testers , many with fewer than three years ’ experience , made the least .
The winner of Sony ’s reality show The Tester can expect to make around $ 38,000 a year in quality assurance if he decides to make a career of it .
The good news is that testers who keep at it for at least six years see their average salary more than double .
The full results of the 110 - page study , titled Game Developer Salary Report 2005 - 2010 , can be purchased for $ 1500 .

A team of Nepali mountaineers will leave Kathmandu tomorrow heading for Mount Everest , the world 's highest peak , where they hope to climb to more than 8,000 metres ( 26 , 246ft ) to clear the mountain's " death zone " of tonnes of rubbish and remove the bodies of dead climbers .
Though many foreign and Nepali expeditions have set out to clear parts of the mountain in the past , Namgyal Sherpa , leader of the Extreme Everest Expedition 2010 , said no one had tried to clear at that height .
" This is the first time we are cleaning the death zone .
It is very difficult and dangerous , " said Namgyal , who has climbed Everest seven times .
The zone earned its name because it is almost impossible to survive the harsh temperatures and the thin air of such altitudes , where there is a third as much oxygen as at sea level for more than a couple of days .
Anyone who remains within the zone for longer will almost certainly perish .
The climbers will use special bags to collect the bodies – which lie between the South Col and the 8,850 m ( 29,035 ft ) summit – before lowering them down the snow and icefields of the mountain and then carrying them across the glaciers to base camp .
The expedition hopes to retrieve five bodies , including that of a climber killed two years ago .
Scores of corpses preserved by the freezing temperatures remain on the mountain , some for decades .
" I have seen three corpses lying there for years , " Namgyal said .
" We 'll bring down the body of a Swiss climber who died in the mountain in 2008 and cremate it below the base camp , for which we have got the family 's consent . "
In 1999 a research expedition found the remains of George Mallory , a British explorer and mountaineer , who disappeared with ropemate Andrew Irvine in 1924 .
Experts have long debated whether it was possible that the pair had actually reached the summit before perishing .
The find did not provide conclusive evidence .
A service was performed for Mallory and his body left where it was .
More than 4,000 climbers have scaled Everest , which is known as Chomolungma in local Tibetan language .
Climbing has become a key source of income for Nepal , a state reduced to poverty by lengthy civil strife and misgovernment .
Not only do expeditions provide employment for thousands but climbers pay high fees to the Nepali authorities for permission to venture on to the mountain , providing much - needed hard currency .
Litter on the mountain was a major environmental problem until the Nepalese government imposed strict rules requiring visitors to keep the peak clean or risk losing a substantial deposit .
The South Col , from which the attempts to reach the summit are often launched , had become known as the world 's highest rubbish tip , with the snow littered with empty oxygen bottles , old ropes , food and the remnants of tents .
" The garbage was buried under snow in the past .
But now it has come out on the surface because of the melting of snow due to global warming , " Namgyal said , adding that some of the rubbish had been on the mountain since 1953 when Edmund Hillary , who died in 2008 , made the first successful ascent of the mountain with Sherpa Tenzing Norgay .
Frozen fates
One of the most notorious disasters on Everest occurred in 1996 when eight people died within 36 hours near the summit .
Three of the casualties were with an Indian paramilitary police expedition on the north side of the mountain .
The rest were guides and clients on commercial American expeditions climbing the traditional South Col route .
The deaths of the five westerners was the subject of a best - selling book , Into Thin Air , and a film that depicted chaotic scenes in the " death zone " as dozens of mountaineers attempted to climb or descend the narrow summit ridge with bad weather threatening .
Blizzards finally turned the upper reaches of the peak into a nightmare of driven hail and snow , trapping those who had not headed down early enough .
One of the guides , New Zealander Rob Hall , was able to talk to his wife on a satellite phone from high on the mountain .
Despite being frostbitten and knowing that he was probably incapable of traversing the ropes that led to safety , he said he was reasonably comfortable and told her not to " worry too much " .
His body was found nearly two weeks later .
The tragedy sparked fierce arguments over the commercialisation of mountaineering on the world 's highest peak .

Judge Strikes Down Congressional Ban on Funding ACORN
March 10 , 2010 , New York , NY – Today , federal judge , for the second time , granted an injunction against Congress ’ unconstitutional de-funding of the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now ( ACORN ) to apply to federal budget provisions signed into law by President Obama in December 2009 and ordered the United State of America and several named agencies to rescind orders cutting off funding to ACORN and its affiliates and allies .
A preliminary injunction was won in December 2009 in the Center for Constitutional Rights ’ ( CCR ) case charging Congress with violating the U.S. Constitution ’s protections against Bill of Attainders and the First and Fifth Amendments in several recurring resolutions .
Today ’s opinion extends that protection by ordering a permanent injunction and directing agency heads to disregard the provisions denying funding and to rescind the memos that implemented the Congressional action .
Those lying or cowardly members of Congress who voted for this should be deeply ashamed of themselves .
Let 's hope ACORN can recover after being the target of an orchestrated smear campaign - one aided and abetted by Congress - after this important court decision .
UPDATED : Thanks everyone for putting this story on the Rec list .
I believe that the story itself belongs there .
Here are some statements from Acorn 's attorneys
CCR Legal Director Bill Quigley ,
We are pleased with the ruling made by Judge Nina Gershon today .
That Congress passed a budget , signed by President Obama , days after federal judge ruled bills of attainder unconstitutional shows just how intent these lawmakers are to target this one organization while violating their right to due process and freedom of association by targeting affiliated and allied organizations , as well .
This is a rebuke of the smear tactics of the far right .
and Jules Lobel , CCR cooperating attorney who argued the case :
This is why the Constitution contains a prohibition against Congress enacting a bill of attainder – to prevent Congress from acting as judge jury and executioner .

A team from the BBC1 science programme Bang Goes the Theory has unveiled a car that runs on coffee .
Christened as Car- puccino , the car is actually a modified version of a £ 400 , 1988 Volkswagen Scirocco .
Well , the visible area of concern , for millions like me , is the running cost of the vehicle that has been estimated at between 25 and 50 times the cost of running a car on petrol .
It will be displayed at the Big Bang science fair in Manchester before it sets out for 210 miles run between Manchester and London ; on coffee - power , of course !
The car will keep on asking for coffee granules every 30 to 45 miles since the early calculations shows it doing three miles per kilo or about 56 espressos per mile .
70 kilos of ground coffee required for the journey translates into £ 910 and £ 1,820 .
Did you say ‘ extravagance ’?
Yes , it is , but ‘ anything ’ for environment .
Nick Watson , producer of Bang Goes The Theory , says …
Coffee , like wood or coal , has some carbon content so you can use it as a fuel .
The coffee needs to be very dry and in pellets to allow the air to move through the pile of coffee as it burns .
The brand does n’t matter .
The car can effectively reach a top speed of 60 mph .
Still , the car will have to stop for routine clean out of coffee filters that would involve removal of the soot and tar .
Consequently , the entire journey will take ten hours or so .

The labor market is still in recession , but for younger workers it feels more like a depression .
In the last year , the unemployment rate among workers age 20 to 24 has risen to almost 16 % , and among teenagers to 26 % .
You might therefore expect a federal effort to encourage employers to give unskilled youngsters a chance .
You would be wrong .
The feds have instead decided to launch a campaign to crack down on unpaid internships that regulators claim violate minimum - wage laws .

Let ’s reserve judgment on the Goldman case about guilt or innocence — but make no mistake , it will inflame the nation .
It will give power and strength on the floor of the Senate to the forces for reform .
It will make opponents of reform realize they could lose their seats if they fail to join the battle .
It will win condemnation for any Tea Party leaders who support Wall Street bonuses and win applause for those who join liberal activists in calling for the bonus surtax .
The summer scandal this year , going into election season , will be a steady stream of fraud and Wall Street corruption cases that could be the game - changer helping Democrats in November .
But let ’s be clear :
The Democrats must fight much harder than they have before .
Phony , timid and halfway reforms by Democrats will only fuel public anger against both parties .
The summer scandal has begun .
The fight now begins for real .
The game - changer for the election has come .
Now let ’s begin with a 50 percent tax for Wall Street bonuses of companies that caused the crisis for the unjust profits made during the five years that took the American economy down .
Seoul , South Korea ( CNN ) --
A North Korean torpedo attack was the most likely cause for the sinking of a South Korean warship last month , according to a US military official .
The US believes the ship was sunk by the blast of an underwater explosion , but that the explosive device itself did not come in contact with the hull of the South Korean ship , the official said .
This is the same conclusion expressed by South Korean military officials .
TeaPartarians ?
By Arnold Kling
The Bush Administration , particularly in its final year , discredited the Republican Party as a proponent of free markets .
What should come next ?
One idea , promoted at Cato by Brink Lindsey and Will Wilkinson , is liberaltarianism .
The idea is to approach liberals and say , “ we ’re with you on social issues and we ’re also dovish on foreign policy .
Let us persuade you that markets are good for the economy . ”
The problem is that liberals tend to affiliate themselves with Harvard types , and Harvard types believe that they are smarter than markets .
And , at this moment in history , the Harvard narrative is that the financial crisis was caused because of blind faith in markets regulating themselves .
According to this narrative , the election was a mandate to Harvard to deal with huge market failures in finance , health care , aggregate demand ( hence the stimulus ) , and climate / energy .
Based on this narrative , Harvard is absolutely committed to expert control over the economy , liberaltarians be damned .
Another reaction to the Republican cratering has been the Tea Party .
The Tea Party is , if nothing else , strongly resistant to the Harvard narrative .
Is that where libertarians should be making our overtures ?
Should we be trying to be TeaPartarians ?
The Tea Party poses a problem for libertarians in that the Tea Party is going to stay pretty far to the right on issues like immigration and gay marriage .
But the bigger problem is one of social and educational class .
The Tea Party does not have a liaison office with the Ph.D crowd .
Unfortunately , it seems to me as if libertarian intellectuals would rather deal with Democrats than with the Tea Party because those intellectuals are socially more comfortable with Matt Yglesias than with Glenn Beck .
I think it might be good to have some TeaPartarians , meaning intellectual supporters of free markets who are comfortable working with the Tea Party folks .
I worry that an electorally successful Tea Party movement might not have the focus and ideas to take on entitlements and other major contributors to fiscal problems .
If the Tea Partiers are electorally successful and all they give us are a few symbolic budget cuts , the long - term trend toward concentrated government power will continue .
My worry is that the Tea Party movement will be satisfied with taking some Democratic scalps and restoring some of the sense of group status that the Tea Party demographic feels that it lost in 2008 .
Instead , I wish that the Tea Partiers would read the last chapter of Unchecked and Unbalanced and get some ideas from that book .
I would like them to be less satisfied with achieving ballot - box validation along with status revenge and instead more interested in reforms that would make government more competitive .
[ UPDATE : Will Wilkinson responds . ]
It 's people like this who I most fear , because they are completely irrational , own guns , and embrace violence .
It 's also why I loathe Michele Bachmann and her ilk .
They actually encourage this type of behavior .
Watch this exchange .
This man starts out angry , but controlled .
He 's got a problem with our new " socialist - communist " health care bill , and he 'll tell anyone within 50 feet about it .
When pressed on specifics , he just rolls out of control , first shouting for death to the communists , then death to the videographer .
" Get out of here before I run you up with this flag and throw you to the river , " he cries .
" I fought for this country , you sonofabitch .
What did you do ? "
With all due respect for his service to our country , he seems to have a disconnect when it comes to Constitutional rights .
Evidently free speech , which he is exercising liberally in this clip , is only acceptable when it 's right wing free speech .
Part of me really dislikes giving any attention to these people .
At the same time , ignoring them also ignores the fact that when mentally unstable people are stirred up and their anger ignited , it will not end well .
This is the worst team in the history of the Edmonton Oilers .
Obviously .
It 's a statement that requires no defense and will attract no argument .
But , position by position , the strange thing is that we 're not that bad .
Sure , goaltending 's an obstacle , but the 1998 - 99 Edmonton Oilers featured Bob Essensa , Mikhail Shtalenkov , and Tommy Salo , all of who were ( if you can believe it ) worse than Jeff Deslauriers , never mind Nikolai Khabibulin .
The forwards are bad but at least we 're not relying heavily on David Oliver , Shayne Corson , and Mike Stapleton like the 1995 - 96 Oilers were .
And for all the foibles of our depth defensemen the 2005 - 06 Oilers had Igor Ulanov , Cory Cross , Dick Tarnstrom , and Marc - Andre Bergeron and they made the Stanley Cup finals !
It is a sad day when we 're finishing last and yet not even the best at being the worst .
We all hate people who use injuries as an excuse , but looking at the roster injuries are an excuse : granted , in a " this is a 22nd - place team that is stuck in 30th place " sort of way , but all the same .
There is , however , one glorious exception .
It lurks like a foul beast at the bottom of the Oilers roster , mocking us with its terribleness .
It 's played a combined 110 games for us this season , or as many as Ales Hemsky , Mike Comrie , and Denis Grebeshkov combined , even though one half of this terrible tandem started as the worst defenseman on the Springfield Falcons .
They 're two very different players : a 6 ' 3 " load of bricks on the wrong end of his thirty - fourth birthday , and a 5 ' 11 " finesse defenseman who turned twenty - three in April .
Even the potential nicknames are terrible : " Chorwick " sounds like an English village , and " Strudney " does n't sound like anything .
They are Jason Strudwick and Taylor Chorney , and they are the worst defensive pairing in Edmonton Oilers history .
A statement like that takes a little justification , I realize .
Justification perhaps more well - reasoned than shouting " just look at them ! " and shaking you like an Etch - a - Sketch .
There are problems there : it 's hard to find information as simple as time - on - ice for Oiler seasons in the distant past and advanced statistics are just impossible .
So when I say the worst pairing ever , I have to qualify that : the Oilers well have asked Dave Lumley to do a shift on the blueline with Jim Playfair back in 1984 and they could have gotten scorched for nineteen goals against and I would n't know .
But as far as regular pairings that history can record ?
Chorney and Strudwick are the worst .
It 's not just the shifts the length of a Norse saga , but the unique combination of utter worthlessness on both the offensive and defensive sides of the puck .
In seventy games , Jason Strudwick has no goals and six assists ; the second - worst points per game among Oiler skaters who have played at least twenty games .
The worst belongs to Chorney , with no goals and three assists in forty games from a man who is allegedly an offensive defenseman .
By comparison , in his ill - fated post - lockout season Igor Ulanov had three goals and six assists in thirty - seven games and even Cory Cross mustered two goals and three assists before we traded his sorry ass .
The worst - scoring defenseman on the previous worst team to wear the oil drop , the ' 93 - '94 Oilers , was a young Luke Richardson with two goals and six assists .
Richardson was also the plus / minus chump on that team 's blueline , with a - 13 .
That 's pretty bad .
Richardson saw a revolving door of fellows on his pairing but got a good taste of the long - forgotten Adam Bennett , who ran up a - 8 in only 48 games .
That , also , was pretty bad .
But , son , you ai n't seen nothing yet .
Jason Strudwick is - 14 and Taylor Chorney is - 16 . - 16 !
In his number of games that 's truly remarkable and holds up well against the all - time nadir : the pairing of Matt Greene and Ladislav Smid , two young men who combined for a - 38 on the Ryan Smyth Death March 2006 - 07 Edmonton Oilers .
Depressingly , Greene and Smid are the closest thing we have to equal Strudwick and Chorney .
Smid and Greene spent far too much of 2006 - 07 together , picking up ten points each and sodomizing us with those truly dreadful plus / minus numbers .
Of course , there are extenuating circumstances .
Greene was in his first full NHL campaign and Smid was in his first NHL season full stop .
Neither of them were , say , allegedly " steady " and " reliable " defensemen in their mid-thirties .
They were superior offensively to Strudwick and Chorney by just a staggering margin , and considering what cinder blocks Smid and Greene are in the attacking zone that 's a hell of a statement .
Greene was a team - worst - 22 on a blueline that featured regulars Smid ( - 16 ) , Marc - Andre Bergeron ( - 9 in fifty - five games before going to the New York Islanders in the Denis Grebeshkov deal ) , Daniel Tjarnqvist ( +3 in only thirty - seven games thanks to injuries that let him miss the Death March ) , Jason Smith ( - 13 ) , Steve Staios ( - 5 ) , Jan Hejda ( - 6 ) as well as cameo appearances from Tom Gilbert ( 12GP , - 1 ) , Mathieu Roy ( 16GP , - 7 ) , Danny Syvret ( 16GP , - 10 ) , Bryan Young ( 15GP , - 8 ) , and of course the legendary Sebastien Bisaillon ( 2GP , - 1 ) .
There are a lot of minuses on that list .
Compared to the likes of Smith and Bergeron , Smid and Greene are bad but not slam - your - head - in - the - desk - drawer awful .
It 's almost too obvious to say , but that team was really bad for more reasons than Ladislav Smid and Matt Greene .
Context actually makes Strudwick and Chorney look a lot better .
The worst plus / minus on the current Edmonton blueline is actually Sheldon Souray ( - 19 ) in a frankly unbelievable 37 games .
Steve Staios was also - 19 before we shipped his sorry ass out of town .
Tom Gilbert , also known as " the good one " , is - 10 .
And , to give us all hope for Taylor Chorney 's future , Death March whipping boy Ladislav Smid was + 5 before he got hurt , which I think may make him Jesus .
So how can I rank Chorney and Strudwick above ( or , rather , below ) Greene and Smid ?
Let me resort to the crudest trick of the bad author and go point - by - point :
With Smid and Greene , we were suffering in the present to try and improve the future .
Smid , awful though he was as a 20 - year - old four years ago , is currently a legitimate shutdown defenseman in the Barret Jackman mold .
Matt Greene was Taylor Chorney 's age in 2005 - 06 and came on a little more slowly but is a positive part of a very good young blue line in Los Angeles .
While the optimist might suggest that Chorney will turn it around , Strudwick is a veteran .
At his age , each season should be worse than the previous .
Which is pretty damned depressing .
Smid and Greene did n't play together anything like consistently .
Craig MacTavish 's famed blender was set to purée throughout the Ryan Smyth Death March .
Smid famously ate suicide passes from Steve Staios for much of the winter and Greene played with whoever Charlie Huddy would deign to put with him .
Chorney and Strudwick , meanwhile , have been pretty much locked in as a unit since Chorney got called up .
Smid and Greene are both better all - rounders than Strudwick and Chorney .
As we 've established , their offense was far superior .
Moreover , both Smid and Greene were better at the little things : they made a lot of mistakes but they could at least clear the zone or ( Smid in particular ) find an outlet pass .
Jason Strudwick , by contrast , is the Patron Saint of the HUA , and for a 5 ' 11 " guy who made his bones in college getting points Taylor Chorney could not be a worse offensive player .
Greene 's 2005 - 06 +/- per 60 ? - 1.25 .
Wow , that 's bad !
Smid's ?
- 0.83 .
Not good either !
Jason Strudwick this year ?
- 0.93 , and Taylor Chorney ? - 1.57 .
Unbelievably - and it takes some doing - in spite of the difference between their +/- numbers Chorwick actually give it up worse than Greemid ... er , Smeene ... Smid and Greene did .
It 's going to be a long summer , Oiler fans .
The trades we 're all hoping for , deep down inside , we know are n't going to happen .
There 's nearly a fifty percent chance that we 're going to pick second rather than first and be stuck with whichever one of Seguin and Hall the other guys did n't want .
There 's an even bigger chance we 'll do something stupid and draft Cam Fowler or something .
And even if everything breaks right , we 're still going to enter 2010 - 11 with a lousy team packed to the gills with unready youth and Nikolai Khabibulin .
But let 's look on the bright side .
We 've seen the worst defensive pairing in Oilers history .
May there never be another .
NEW YORK -- I ’ll start with a question , which you can respond to below :
When was the last time you felt this good about the Mets ?
I ’m somewhat amazed that I ’m asking that question .
But it ’s an appropriate one , considering the recent turn of events .
Only a week and a half ago , the Mets returned home with a 4 - 8 record .
The talk was n’t so much about how they would turn things around but about who would replace Jerry Manuel as manager when they did n’t , and how soon that might happen .
Now , over the course of one home stand , the Mets have completely altered the conversation .
They ’ve dramatically changed the sense of what they are capable of -- probably in most fans ’ minds and certainly in their own .
Jason Bay said it best Tuesday night .
“ You do n’t feel like you ’re lucky to get wins , ” Bay said .
“ You feel like you should get wins .
I think early on it might have been like , ‘ Hey , we ’re not playing that great .
We snuck one in there .
Great .’
Now , we expect to win them all . ”
The Mets ( 12 - 9 ) wake up this morning in first place in the NL East for the first time since May 29 , 2009 .
They ’ve won eight of nine games on this 10 - game home stand and have a chance to make it nine Wednesday , when they ’ll look to sweep the Dodgers .
It is the first time the Mets have won eight games in a single home stand since Aug. 18 - 28 , 2006 .
What ’s been going right for them ?
A lot .
Here are 10 reasons they ’ve suddenly gotten to this point :
1. Starting pitching .
Mike Pelfrey and Jon Niese have given the Mets an effective 2 - 3 tandem behind Johan Santana .
And while John Maine and Oliver Perez are still huge question marks , the Mets have found ways to win in spite of them on this home stand .
Overall , in their last 13 games , Mets starting pitchers have a 1.48 ERA .
2 . The bullpen : Four weeks into the season , the Mets still do n't have a clear setup man .
Yet somehow they 've been getting by with the group they have , even with Ryota Igarashi now on the disabled list .
The bullpen had the third lowest ERA in the NL entering Tuesday ( 2.66 ) .
3 . A little luck :
The rain helped secure a 1 - 0 win over Atlanta Sunday night .
And let 's face it , the Mets have run into three teams ( Cubs , Braves , Dodgers ) playing some very mediocre baseball right now -- or at least while they were at Citi Field .
They 've benefited from several botched plays by opponents .
You know , the kind the Mets used to make , which bring us to ...
4. Defense .
The Mets have n't been perfect in the field , but they 've made some impressive plays at crucial moments and , just as importantly , avoided the kind of game - altering , head - scratching gaffes that plagued them last season .
5. Ike Davis .
The home stand started with his debut , and already it seems Davis is cementing his status as the Mets ' starting first baseman .
Davis is hitting .333 after his first nine major - league games .
6. Jason Bay .
After a dismal start to the season , Bay is finally heating up at the plate .
He hit his first home run Tuesday and is 7 for 17 ( .412 ) with two triples , one double , four RBI three runs scored in his last five games .
7 . The catchers .
Rod Barajas and Henry Blanco have played a role in the Mets ' pitching success , giving the Mets the veteran presence behind the plate they lacked for much of last year .
8. Citi Field .
The ballpark has suited the Mets well so far this year , helping them win with pitching , defense and manufacturing runs .
The Mets have hit nine triples here , more than any team in the majors at home this season .
9. Hisanori Takahashi .
He 's easy to overlook , but he 's played a vital role in the bullpen so far , as evidenced by his relief appearance Tuesday night .
Takahashi leads all major - league relievers with 21 strikeouts .
10 . The NL East .
The Phillies have lost seven of 10 .
The Braves have lost seven in a row .
Between those teams struggling a bit and the Mets playing better of late , the gap between the Mets and the top teams in the division does n't look as huge as it did 10 days ago .

BEDFORD , N.H. —
When it comes to health care , Mitt Romney is hoping to have it both ways , even as he accuses the White House of doing the same .
In the weeks since President Obama and the Democratic Congress enacted their health care overhaul , Mr. Romney , the once and presumably future candidate for the Republican presidential nomination , has confronted an issue that is alternately viewed as a strength and a vulnerability .
As he promotes himself as a problem - solving pragmatist , Mr. Romney can justifiably point to the landmark universal coverage law in Massachusetts that he , as governor , proposed in 2006 .
But as he appeals to conservative activists and Republican primary voters , he is trying to draw nuanced distinctions between his Massachusetts law and the federal legislation that shares many of its fundamental elements , including a requirement that people have insurance .
The core of his argument is a federalist assertion that the new law usurps powers that properly reside with the states .
The Open Graph protocol enables any web page to become a rich object in a social graph .
For instance , this is used on Facebook to allow any web page to have the same functionality as any other object on Facebook .
While many different technologies and schemas exist and could be combined together , there is n't a single technology which provides enough information to richly represent any web page within the social graph .
The Open Graph protocol builds on these existing technologies and gives developers one thing to implement .
Developer simplicity is a key goal of the Open Graph protocol which has informed many of the technical design decisions .
To turn your web pages into graph objects , you need to add basic metadata to your page .
We 've based the initial version of the protocol on RDFa which means that you 'll place additional < meta > tags in the < head > of your web page .
The four required properties for every page are :
og : title -
The title of your object as it should appear within the graph , e.g. , " The Rock " .
- The title of your object as it should appear within the graph , e.g. , " The Rock " .
og : type -
The type of your object , e.g. , " video.movie " .
Depending on the type you specify , other properties may also be required .
- The type of your object , e.g. , " video.movie " .
Depending on the type you specify , other properties may also be required .
og : image -
An image URL which should represent your object within the graph .
- An image URL which should represent your object within the graph .
og : url -
The canonical URL of your object that will be used as its permanent ID in the graph , e.g. , " https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117500/ " .
As an example , the following is the Open Graph protocol markup for The Rock on IMDB :
< html prefix= " og : https://ogp.me/ns# " > < head > < title > The Rock ( 1996 ) </ title > < meta property = " og : title " content = " The Rock " /> < meta property =" og : type " content=" video.movie " /> < meta property = " og:url " content = " https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117500/ " /> < meta property =" og : image " content = " https://ia.media-imdb.com/images/rock.jpg " /> ... </ head > ... </html >
The following properties are optional for any object and are generally recommended :
og : audio - A URL to an audio file to accompany this object .
- A URL to an audio file to accompany this object .
og : description - A one to two sentence description of your object .
- A one to two sentence description of your object .
og : determiner -
The word that appears before this object 's title in a sentence .
An enum of ( a , an , the , " " , auto ) .
If auto is chosen , the consumer of your data should chose between " a " or " an " .
Default is " " ( blank ) .
- The word that appears before this object 's title in a sentence .
An enum of ( a , an , the , " " , auto ) .
If is chosen , the consumer of your data should chose between " a " or " an " .
Default is " " ( blank ) .
og : locale -
The locale these tags are marked up in .
Of the format language_TERRITORY .
Default is en_US .
- The locale these tags are marked up in .
Of the format .
Default is .
og : locale : alternate -
An array of other locales this page is available in .
- An array of other locales this page is available in .
og : site_name -
If your object is part of a larger web site , the name which should be displayed for the overall site .
e.g. , " IMDb " .
- If your object is part of a larger web site , the name which should be displayed for the overall site .
e.g. , " IMDb " .
og : video - A URL to a video file that complements this object .
For example ( line - break solely for display purposes ) :
< meta property = " og : audio " content = " https://example.com/bond/theme.mp3 " /> < meta property =" og : description " content =
" Sean Connery found fame and fortune as the suave , sophisticated British agent , James Bond . " /> < meta property =" og : determiner " content = " the " /> < meta property = " og : locale " content=" en_GB " /> < meta property=" og:locale:alternate " content = " fr_FR " /> < meta property=" og:locale:alternate " content = " es_ES " /> < meta property =" og : site_name " content = " IMDb " /> < meta property = " og : video " content = " https://example.com/bond/trailer.swf " />
The RDF schema ( in Turtle ) can be found at ogp.me /ns .
Some properties can have extra metadata attached to them .
These are specified in the same way as other metadata with property and content , but the property will have extra : .
The og : image property has some optional structured properties :
og : image : url - Identical to og : image .
- Identical to .
og : image : secure_url -
An alternate url to use if the webpage requires HTTPS .
- An alternate url to use if the webpage requires HTTPS .
og : image : type - A MIME type for this image .
- A MIME type for this image .
og : image : width -
The number of pixels wide .
- The number of pixels wide .
og : image : height -
The number of pixels high .
- The number of pixels high .
og : image : alt -
A description of what is in the image ( not a caption ) .
If the page specifies an og : image it should specify og : image : alt .
A full image example :
< meta property = " og : image " content = " https://example.com/ogp.jpg " /> < meta property =" og: image:secure_url " content = " https://secure.example.com/ogp.jpg " /> < meta property = " og : image : type " content = " image / jpeg " /> < meta property =" og : image : width " content = " 400 " /> < meta property =" og : image : height " content = " 300 " /> < meta property = " og : image : alt " content =
" A shiny red apple with a bite taken out " />
The og : video tag has the identical tags as og : image .
Here is an example :
< meta property = " og : video " content = " https://example.com/movie.swf " /> < meta property=" og: video:secure_url " content = " https://secure.example.com/movie.swf " /> < meta property=" og: video:type " content= " application /x-shockwave - flash " /> < meta property =" og : video : width " content = " 400 " /> < meta property =" og : video: height " content = " 300 " />
The og : audio tag only has the first 3 properties available ( since size does n't make sense for sound ) :
< meta property = " og : audio " content = " https://example.com/sound.mp3 " /> < meta property=" og: audio: secure_url " content = " https://secure.example.com/sound.mp3 " /> < meta property =" og : audio: type " content = " audio/mpeg " />
If a tag can have multiple values , just put multiple versions of the same < meta > tag on your page .
The first tag ( from top to bottom ) is given preference during conflicts .
< meta property = " og : image " content = " https://example.com/rock.jpg " /> < meta property =" og : image " content = " https://example.com/rock2.jpg " />
Put structured properties after you declare their root tag .
Whenever another root element is parsed , that structured property is considered to be done and another one is started .
For example :

means there are 3 images on this page , the first image is 300x300 , the middle one has unspecified dimensions , and the last one is 1000 px tall .
In order for your object to be represented within the graph , you need to specify its type .
This is done using the og : type property :
< meta property = " og : type " content = " website " />
When the community agrees on the schema for a type , it is added to the list of global types .
All other objects in the type system are CURIEs of the form
< head prefix= " my_namespace : https://example.com/ns# " > < meta property =" og : type " content= " my_namespace:my_type " />
The global types are grouped into verticals .
Each vertical has its own namespace .
The og : type values for a namespace are always prefixed with the namespace and then a period .
This is to reduce confusion with user - defined namespaced types which always have colons in them .

Never one to mince his words , Sir Bob Geldof has launched his latest expletive - ridden broadside at the documentary Starsuckers , due to be broadcast tomorrow night on More 4 .
In the film , Geldof is accused of undermining the Make Poverty History campaign 's attempts to hold G8 leaders to account for the scandal of global poverty .
By contrast , Saint Bob now claims that he alone should be credited with putting issues of world poverty on the political agenda , and not the millions of ordinary people who take action on such issues year on year .
I am one of the two senior executives from the Make Poverty History coalition interviewed in Starsuckers , and I understand that I am also named by Geldof in the letter of complaint he has sent to the film 's director , Chris Atkins .
Let me say from the outset that I stand by what I said in the film .
Like many others , I believe that Geldof 's involvement in the mobilisations around the G8 undid much of the good work that had been built up over a period of months by people up and down Britain , not to mention the years of campaigning undertaken on these issues by civil society groups across the world .
The Make Poverty History coalition of more than 100 campaign organisations , faith groups and trade unions was formed in recognition of the special opportunity offered by the UK hosting both the EU presidency and the G8 summit of world leaders in 2005 .
The coalition put together a manifesto that called for a new approach to global poverty based on justice , not charity .
We spent months building nationwide support for political action to tackle issues of trade justice , corporate accountability and debt relief , in an attempt to move the debate on from focusing solely on overseas aid .
Over the year , many millions of people joined in the campaign .
Although a number of celebrities gave their backing to Make Poverty History , Geldof was not involved with the campaign .
News that he was planning a follow - up event to his 1985 Live Aid concerts was kept secret , and we only discovered late in the day that he had chosen to hold the event on the same date as the main Make Poverty History demonstration in Edinburgh had already been planned , just prior to the start of the G8 summit itself .
A quarter of a million people took to the streets of Edinburgh on Saturday 2 July , and tens of thousands stayed for the other events that took place in the lead - up to the G8 summit in Gleneagles the following Wednesday .
As predicted , the celebrity - charged Live 8 concerts took away the great majority of the media coverage we had hoped to achieve for the Edinburgh demonstration and its political aims .
While others criticised Geldof for failing to feature any African musicians at the main concert in Hyde Park , our main concern was that the challenge to the G8 was completely subsumed in the glitz and glamour of a pop event .
Worse was to come at the final press conference that concluded the G8 summit in Gleneagles .
The South African activist Kumi Naidoo acted as spokesperson for Make Poverty History at the press conference , giving the coalition 's verdict that : " The world has roared , but the G8 has responded with a whisper . "
Geldof turned on Naidoo in front of the assembled media , attacking his statement as " a disgrace " and defending Tony Blair , George Bush and the other G8 leaders for saving millions of African lives .
African civil society representatives who had travelled to Gleneagles for the summit went on television afterwards to make public statements dissociating themselves from Geldof 's remarks .
The Make Poverty History campaign was not perfect , and many of us have been candid about its shortcomings .
Yet Geldof 's arrogance is simply in a different league .
To suggest that he alone was responsible for creating a mass movement on global poverty is a direct insult to the millions of people around the world who have worked steadfastly for debt cancellation , trade justice , women 's rights , workers ' rights and environmental sustainability over decades .
Swimming
" Orang - utans are famous for their fear of water , " says Russon .
" They have high body densities and can't help but sink . "
They 're such lousy swimmers that some zoos have stopped surrounding enclosures with moats – too many orang - utans have drowned .
" One day we saw an adolescent orang - utan called Sif wade into deep water , hunker down and then lunge forward making simple paddling movements with her arms and legs , " says Russon .
" It was kind of like a bad dog paddle . "
Sif did n't get all that far – about a metre .

Bridge - building
Others in the group have found drier means of crossing water : they 've learned how to build bridges .
" They deliberately bend slender trees over and use them as bridges to travel over broad stretches of water , " says Russon .
" The trees remain partially bent after the first use , and after several uses they stay permanently bent into these positions . "
And although each bridge is engineered by a single orang - utan , the structure is used by all the orang - utans on Kaja .
" Nothing like this has been seen anywhere else , " says Russon .

Fishing
" Orang - utans are n't supposed to eat fish , let alone hunt them , " says Russon .
" They 're primarily fruit eaters , and they rarely hunt . "
So it came as a surprise when the Kaja orang - utans were seen grabbing live fish from streams and eating them .
" In 2005 , we saw them scavenging for dead fish that had washed up on the shore during the dry season , " says Russon .
That probably gave the orang - utans the idea of developing more complex tactics to actively hunt down fish .
" The orang - utans probably tasted the dead fish , thought , ' Hey , this is n't too bad , ' and tried to figure out how to get some more , " says Russon .

More fishing
" There can't be more than half - a - dozen observations of orang - utans hunting in the wild , and in all those cases they were targeting grey tree rats , slow lorises , gibbons or young birds – never fish , " says Russon .
She is sceptical of claims made in 2008 that orang - utans hunt fish using wooden harpoons .
" The orang - utan that was photographed sticking a ' spear ' into the water was not observed catching or eating any fish , " she says .
" They use sticks to test the depth of water before wading into it , so that 's a more likely explanation . "

Fishing for sunken fruit
It 's the wet season and Markisa , a 7 - year - old dominant female , is groping for sunken fruit in the mud beneath a Rengas tree .
Kaja Island has seasonal floods that submerge some of the Rengas trees on the island .
Although dry fruit are available , some orang - utans prefer to trawl underwater , despite the risk of crocodiles and water snakes .
" The best explanation I could come up with was that the water may soften the typically hard , nut - like Rengas fruit , so that they 're easier to eat , " says Russon .
For some orang - utans such as Leonora , an adolescent , subordinate female , sunken fruit is a critical source of food .
" Markisa and other orang - utans often steal Leonora 's food on dry land , " says Russon .
" But out there in deep water , her dinner is safe . "

The row surrounds e-mails hacked from the University of East Anglia
There was no scientific malpractice at the University of East Anglia 's Climatic Research Unit , which was at the centre of the " Climategate " affair .
This is according to an independent panel chaired by Lord Oxburgh , which was convened to examine the research published by the unit .
It began its review after e-mails from CRU scientists were published online .
The panel said it would be helpful for researchers to work more closely with professional statisticians in future .
This would ensure the best methods were used when analysing the complex and often " messy " data on climate , the report said .
" We can not help remarking that it is very surprising that research in an area that depends so heavily on statistical methods has not been carried out in close collaboration with professional statisticians , " the panel remarked in its conclusions .
The e-mails issue came to light in November last year , when hundreds of messages between CRU scientists and their peers around the world were posted on the internet , along with other documents .
Critics said that the e-mail exchanges revealed an attempt by the researchers involved to manipulate data .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
But a recent House of Commons Science and Technology Committee report into the e-mails concluded that the scientists involved had no intention to deceive .
And Lord Oxburgh said that he hoped these " resounding affirmations " of the unit 's scientific practice would put those suspicions to bed .
He stated : " We found absolutely no evidence of any impropriety whatsoever .
That does n't mean that we agreed with all of their conclusions , but these people were doing their jobs honestly . "
Climate interest
The chair has been challenged over his other interests .
Lord Oxburgh is currently president of the Carbon Capture and Storage Association and chairman of wind energy firm Falck Renewables .
Critics say clean energy companies would benefit from policies to tackle climate change .
But Lord Oxburgh insists the panel did not have a pre-conceived view .
The panel included Professor David Hand , president of the Royal Statistical Society , who had been examining the way CRU used statistical methodology to develop an average annual global temperature .
Climate sceptics have argued that CRU 's statistical methods were inadequate .
Professor Hand said that the CRU scientists did not use " the best statistical tools for their studies " but that this had made not significant difference to their conclusions .
Dealing with uncertainty Professor Hand pointed out that the translation of " messy data " into clear facts had caused problems .
But he said that the CRU were " to be commended for how they dealt with the data , " adding that , in their research papers , they were very open about the uncertainty in the numbers .
It is straightforward to get a measurement precise in space and time from an individual weather station - albeit with uncertainties attached .
But some countries have many weather stations , while others have very few , and there are sizeable areas of the Earth with no surface measurements at all .
" Unfortunately , " Professor Hand said , " when this research is [ republished and ] popularised , those caveats tend to be forgotten . "
The panel noted that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) was one of the organisations that had " oversimplified " the CRU data it used in its publications .
They said the IPCC and others had neglected to highlight the discrepancy between direct and " proxy " measurements , such as the tree ring data often used to reconstruct past temperature changes .
Professor Hand added that CRU had been " a little naïve " in not working more closely with statisticians .
The report stated : " There would be mutual benefit if there were closer collaboration and interaction between CRU and a much wider scientific group outside the relatively small international circle of temperature specialists . "
UEA 's vice chancellor Edward Acton said he welcomed the report .
" It is especially important that , despite a deluge of allegations and smears against the CRU , this independent group of utterly reputable scientists have concluded that there was no evidence of any scientific malpractice , " he said .
Dr Benny Peiser , director of the Global Warming Policy Foundation , criticised the panel for producing a report that was " not even - handed " and appeared to be the product of a " rushed job " .
He said : " This has produced a very superficial report .
The panel should have taken more time to come to more balanced and trustworthy conclusions .
" They should have heard evidence from critical researchers who have been working in the same field for many years . "
But Lord Oxburgh said that the seriousness of the allegations being investigated made it crucial that the panel publish their findings " as quickly as possible " .
He explained : " We read 11 key [ CRU ] publications spreading back over 20 years and a large number of others .
We then spent 15 person days interviewing the scientists at UEA .
" I do n't know what more we could have done and we came to a unanimous conclusion . "

The only good news from Israel is that President Obama , at least for the time being , has decided to not let Israeli premier Benjamin Netanyahu continue to push him around .
During last week ’s meeting in Washington Obama deliberately gave the Israeli premier a low key welcome — no big state dinner , no side - by - side photo ops .
Netanyahu earned this rebuke by insisting that Israel go ahead and build 1600 — which has been raised to 50,000 — new housing units for Jews in East Jerusalem , a traditional Palestinian neighborhood which Palestinians had hoped — still hope — would serve as the capitol of their new state .
In a podium - thumping speech to AIPEC , the militantly conservative American Jewish lobby , Netanyahu repeated the claim that Jerusalem always has been and always will be Jewish turf and nothing less .
It was n't so long ago that all three faiths — Jews , Christians , and Muslims , all of whom trace their origins to Abraham — saw Jerusalem as in some sense a home .
I just finished reading two books about the Crusades in which over several hundred years Christians and Muslims slaughtered one another for the right to control the sacred city .
Today , for several reasons , including pressure from the Jewish majority , the Christian presence in the Holy Land is a shrinking remnant , to about 2 percent .
The West Bank Palestinians and Israeli Jews are separated by a wall ; and the Palestinian West Bank , in violation of international law , is dotted with Jewish settlements linked by new highways where only Jewish vehicles may drive .
Just about every serious article I read about the Middle East and Israel in particular concludes that the huge irritating sore preventing peace in the region is Israel 's continued occupation of the West Bank and its determination to keep building settlements on land to which they have no right .
Jewish fundamentalists claim the Old Testament God gave Abraham and his descendants all the land as far as the eye could see .
But the claim is undermined by both archeology and secular history .
Genesis and Exodus , are not history or legal documents , but religious myths .
To use them in this way , as instruments of oppression , borders on sacrilege .
Meanwhile a few Muslim madmen corrupt the minds of their disciples ; and , in violation of the Koran , stoke the frustrations of young Arabs who come forward as suicide bombers , with accounts of the American - backed Israeli abuse of its power .
They will not forget the Gaza War in which 1400 Palestinians , of whom only 250 were combatants , were killed in only 22 days .
Netanyahu likes to present himself as defending Israel against its enemies , particularly Iran .
But in effect he is primarily defending his own job .
He is willing to compromise Israel 's relationship with the United States , which over the years had fed Israel well over $ 3 billion a year , one - third of our entire foreign aid budget , when Israel is already one of the wealthiest countries in the world , rather than form a coalition with a more centrist party , Kadima .
This new alliance would enable him to halt the East Jerusalem construction and dismantle unauthorized settlement outposts in the West Bank .
Now word has spread that the United States military , under General David Petraeus , have made the case that the Israeli - Palestinian failure to achieve peace , particularly because of America 's complicity with Israeli refusal to stop building , is making America look weak in the Middle East .
Furthermore , it weakens the moderate Arab regimes and strengthens Iran ’s influence in the Arab world .
As John Heilemann writes in New York magazine ( March 29 ) , Petraeus 's presentation on Capitol Hill was both a blow to the Israel - is - always - right crowd , and a critique of Obama 's so - far feeble efforts to get both sides to the bargaining table .
Finally , what 's so terrible about Jews and Arabs sharing Jerusalem as the capitol of each one 's state ?
There are Jewish scholars today who argue that they should be one secular state , not two separate entities divided by race and religion , where Jews and Arabs and whoever else wanted to join , no matter where they came from , would all live and work side by side .
Seems like a radical idea , but it was tried a little over 200 years ago and seems to have worked pretty well here .
If that 's not possible for Israel , why call it a democracy ?

And then there was a plant .
Taddaaa !
I had him in my mind , even before Ben was there .
But somehow I first needed Ben and now finally I was able to slide the plant in the story .
It 's funny how every time I wanted to introduce him , I thought of 1 - 2 jokes I needed to do before ... because otherwise I could n't let the fish be annoying or eat the fish .
The fish - storyline needed to be finished before I could get rid of them .
So sorry for the delay , but the plant has arrived 😀
I really love Mojo in the second frame .

The KHL just released the following statement :
The Kontinental Hockey League ( KHL ) and Czech club Lion , located in the city of Hradec Kralove , have signed a letter of intent for the club to participate in the KHL 's 2010 - 2011 season .
The letter of intent outlines the regulations and stipulations the club must meet to join the KHL , as well as the club 's responsibilities in collaborating with the Czech Republic Ice Hockey Federation to gain approval for joining the KHL .
As a next step , the KHL and Lion have agreed on a deadline of April 1 , 2010 , for the club to provide all financial guarantees to the KHL for the club to join the league next season .
In December 2009 , the feasibility of Lion joining the KHL was ratified by the Hradec Kralove city assembly .
The ice arena that will host Lion 's home matches has a seating capacity 7,700 .
This makes for an interesting followup to their announcement in November that the league would add a Swedish team in Stockholm as well .
I am by no means an expert on Russian hockey developments , but based on their disappointing results in Vancouver , I have to think that there will be direction from the very highest levels of the country 's leadership to ensure that they fare much , much better in the Sochi Games of 2014 .
Towards that end , I would expect the KHL to ramp up its efforts to attract more NHL talent to come and play in the KHL to elevate the level of competition in their home league .
By adding teams in Sweden and the Czech Republic , they can extend those efforts beyond Russian nationals , to draw in more European players in general .
Hradec Kralove is situated about 70 miles east of Prague , the Czech Republic 's capital city .
Might that provide an attractive situation for young Czech players who might prefer to ply their trade closer to home ?
The Volkswagen camper van that Dr. Jack Kevorkian used during his assisted - suicide campaign is no longer for sale on eBay after the online auctioneer cited a policy against “ murderabilia . ”
The owner , Jack Finn , put the van up for auction last week .
The top bid was $ 3,400 at 12:30 p.m.
Monday , with three days left in the auction .
The company sent an e-mail message about the policy to Mr. Finn to explain why it pulled the listing .
He said he would sell the van through another auction company .
A 4,000 - year - old hairball found frozen in Greenland has been used to create the first ancient - human genome , says a new study that paints a picture of a dark - eyed man with dry ear wax who was prone to balding .
Well preserved in Arctic permafrost , the hair belonged to " Inuk , " a relatively young member of the now extinct Saqqaq culture , the earliest known inhabitants of Greenland .
The Saqqaq have long presented a puzzle to scientists , according to study co-author Eske Willerslev , an evolutionary biologist at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark .
" Various theories have suggested that they were direct ancestors to the Inuit , or that they were actually Native Americans who penetrated into the High Arctic , " Willerslev said .
But little has been known about the Saqqaq 's genetic history , since archaeological sites have yielded only a few small bits of preserved bone and hair .
The new DNA evidence , presented online today by the journal Nature , shows that Inuk 's closest relatives are not the ancestors of today 's Native Americans and Inuits , but three Arctic peoples of the Siberian Far East : the Nganasans , Koryaks , and Chukchis .
" This evidence suggests a [ unique ] migration happening around 5,500 years ago , " Willerslev said , adding that this estimate nicely matches the earliest archaeological evidence of New World Arctic habitation .
In addition , analysis of Inuk 's genome — which is comparable in quality to a modern human genome — allowed the scientists to create a DNA - based profile of the Saqqaq male .
Inuk Prone to Balding , Built for Cold
The hair sample used in the study was recovered from northern Greenland in the 1980s and had been kept since then at the National Museum of Denmark .
( Related : " Museum Secrets Unmasked by ' Museomics ' Technologies . " )
Unlike the DNA found in ancient skin or bone , genes housed in hair can be recovered relatively free of contamination from the genes of fungi or bacteria .
This advantage has helped , for example , in making breakthroughs sequencing ancient mammoth DNA .
And , as with Inuk , the ever improving techniques being used on ancient DNA are also helping scientists decipher not only where ancient peoples came from , but what they looked like .
( See a photo of the first model of a Neanderthal based in part on ancient DNA evidence . )
" In many ways this is the really exciting bit of the paper , " said David Lambert , an evolutionary biologist at Australia 's Griffith University , who co-authored a commentary on the study for Nature .
" People have done [ DNA ] studies in the past able to pinpoint the geographic origin of samples to greater or lesser degrees .
I think the more unusual thing they 've done is this work with single nucleotide polymorphisms , " or SNPs .
A person 's genes are made up of bundles of molecules called nucleotides — the " letters " with which DNA is written .
Some genome sequences can differ by a single nucleotide , and these variations are called SNPs .
Work on the modern human genome has produced a large database of known SNP variations , and many have been identified with specific physical characteristics , such as eye color , that their carriers are 99 percent likely to display .
Inuk 's genome reveals he most likely had brown eyes , dark skin and hair , and even dry ear wax .
Although the ancient Greenlander had genes susceptible to baldness , he seems to have retained plenty of hair , leading scientists to suspect he died young .
Inuk had the shovel - graded front teeth common in both Asian and Native American populations , and his A blood type is relatively frequent in northeastern Siberia .
His metabolism also appears to have been genetically fine - tuned for life in unforgiving cold climates .
Inuk Proof of Third New World Migration ?
In addition to establishing this genetic portrait , the newly sequenced Saqqaq genome offers the first hard proof for a theorized third human migration from Siberia to the New World , said geneticist and National Geographic explorer - in- residence Spencer Wells .
Wells , who heads the Genographic Project , was not involved in the research .
( The National Geographic Society owns National Geographic News and funds the Genographic Project . )
The first such migration is generally thought to be the journey of America 's original paleo - Indian settlers , who crossed the Bering Strait via the Beringia land bridge some 15,000 years ago .
These people likely became the ancestors of most South Americans and many North Americans .
" Then there was a later migration — probably by boat along the coast — some 6,000 to 8,000 years ago by the ancestors of western North Americans speaking the Na- Dene languages , " Wells said .
Today Na-Dene languages , including Navajo and Apache , are spoken only in western North America .
Linguistic evidence had suggested to some scholars that there must have been a third migration , although that theory is far from universal .
Still , Inuk 's DNA trail links the Saqqaq more closely to Siberian cultures than Native American , leading Willerslev and colleagues to suggest his people must have made a separate , later migration .
The Bering Strait land bridge had disappeared by 5,500 years ago , so Inuk 's ancestors must have crossed by kayaks , like those used by more recent Arctic peoples , or by walking the winter pack ice .
Making the Impossible Possible
Overall , the new study highlights the advances being made in genetic sequencing , the study authors and other experts say .
" It 's an amazing technical achievement to get a whole genome out of a hair sample , " Wells said .
And as sequencing technologies continue to improve even as expenses drop , similar projects could give new insights into past peoples such as the mummies of South America , study co-author Willerslev said .
Griffith University 's Lambert agrees , although he cautions that similar results may be difficult to duplicate , because it was extraordinary to find so much ancient hair in such fine condition .
DNA degradation is related to temperature , so samples from outside the permafrost regions may be especially difficult to find and sequence , he noted , although he holds out hope that scientific advances and a bit of luck might yield unexpected finds .

Defense Minister Ehud Barak said there is no reason for a war to break out this summer , but Israel must recognize that the world will not put up with decades more of Israeli rule over the Palestinian people .
In a Memorial Day interview with Israel Radio on Monday morning , Barak said " there is no other way , whether you like it or not , than to let ( the Palestinians ) rule themselves .
" Barak said Israel has enough power and security to allow for a two - state solution , and if such a solution should fail , the world will know that it was not Israel 's fault .
In addition , Barak told Israel Radio that the recent alienation from America is harmful to Israel , and must be stopped .
Growing gaps with the United States , Barak explained , can be narrowed by embarking on a peace initiative that tackles all the big issues that divide Israelis and Palestinians .
Barak addressed the issue of kidnapped soldier St.- Sgt.
Gilad Schalit , saying that Israel must do whatever it can to bring him home as quickly as possible .
He admitted that the government has not brought results on this front .
Barak also discussed Iran , saying that nuclear weapons in Teheran are a danger to the region and the world , and warned against an arms race in the Middle East .
He also said Israel should work towards imposing sanctions on Iran .

The pension plans at General Motors and Chrysler are underfunded by a total of $ 17 billion and could fail if the automakers do not return to profitability , according to a government report released Tuesday .
Both companies need to make large payments into the plans within the next five years — $ 12.3 billion by G.M. and $ 2.6 billion by Chrysler — to reach minimum funding levels , according to the report , prepared by the Government Accountability Office .
Whether the companies will be able to make the payments is uncertain , the report concluded , though Treasury officials expect the automakers will become profitable enough to do so .
If either company ’s plan must be terminated , the government would become liable for paying benefits to hundreds of thousands of retirees .
The effect on the government ’s pension insurer , the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation , would be “ unprecedented , ” the report said .
The agency manages plans with assets totaling $ 68.7 billion , less than the $ 84.5 billion in G.M. ’s plan alone .
The carmakers ’ pension plans were jolted by the downturn , increased liabilities and other factors .
G.M. ’s plan was overfunded by $ 18.8 billion in 2008 , and was then underfunded by $ 13.6 billion last year , the report said .
Chrysler ’s plan was overfunded by $ 2.9 billion in 2008 but underfunded by $ 3.4 billion last year .
I ’ve been writing technical documents for a living for the past four years , and I can tell you : there is no easy way to go about it .
For example , you can use :
a Word Processor like MS Word , for example — anyone can do that , right ?
Sure , but no , thanks :
I strongly believe that Word Processors should not be used for writing technical documents as I firmly do n’t believe GUIs are suitable for doing this at a professional level .

Lightweight markups
I love Textile and Markdown .
When people are n’t looking , I even use them at work to generate HTML code , because it ’s just so much faster .
Textile in particular can be used as a drop - in replacement for HTML ( and a bit of LaTeX , too ) , as it can produce most inline HTML tags effortlessly and some block - level tags , too .
For things like < div > tags and < tables > though , Textile is not the best thing in the world , so you normally end up falling back to HTML .
Another “ problem ” is that Textile or other similar lightweight markups cannot be extended easily , simply because they were not meant to be extended in the first place .
Moreover , if you are producing a book , Textile ca n’t help you if you want to generate things like a Table of Contents automatically or validate links : those things are simply not part of Textile ’s job .
How Glyph can help
There are a few projects on the Internet that tackle structured document generation .
One of them is Kitabu , which looks promising and is able to produce pretty documents using Textile and Prince for PDF rendering … but again , it ’s not extensible because it relies too much on Textile and Markdown .
Glyph is different .
For one , it is much younger than any other , therefore it is most likely full of bugs .
Jokes aside , Glyph follows a much more radical approach , which consists in using a macro language on top of Textile or Markdown .
The good thing about it is that this macro language is very simple to learn and — most importantly — very easy to extend .
Here ’s an example :
section [ header [ Something about Glyph ]
You can use Glyph macros in conjunction with _ Textile_ or _Markdown_ to produce HTML files effortlessly .
section [ header [ What about PDFs ? |pdf ]
Once you have a single , well - formatted HTML file , converting it to PDF is extremely easy with a 3rd - party renderer like =>[ http://www.princexml.com|Prince]. ] ]
Which translates to :
< div class=" section " > < h2 id =" h_1 " > Something about Glyph </ h2 > < p >
You can use Glyph macros in conjunction with < em > Textile < / em > or < em > Markdown </em > to produce HTML files effortlessly .
</p> < div class=" section " > < h3 id =" pdf " > What about PDFs ?</h3 > < p
>
Once you have a single , well - formatted HTML file , converting it to PDF is extremely easy with a 3rd - party renderer like < a href = " http://www.princexml.com " >
Prince</a>.</p> </div> </div >
Glyph macros can be used to :
Generate block - level HTML tags not commonly managed by lightweight markups , like head , body , div and table .
tags not commonly managed by lightweight markups , like , , and .
Create and validate internal and external links .
Include and validate images and figures .
Automatically determine header levels based on the document structure .
Automatically generate a Table of Contents based on the document structure .
Store common snippets of text in a single YAML file and use them anywhere in your document , as many times as you need .
file and use them anywhere in your document , as many times as you need .
Store configuration settings in a YAML file and use them anywhere in your document , as many times as you need .
file and use them anywhere in your document , as many times as you need .
Evaluate Ruby code within your document .
Call macros from other macros ( including snippets ) , carefully avoiding mutual calls .
Include text files in other text files .
Include the contents of configuration settings ( author , title ) in the document .
Filter input explicitly or implicitly , based on file extensions when including files .
Manage comments and todo items .

A series of transit ads criticizing MTA service cuts has New Yorkers snickering , but the agency , for one , is not about to LOL .
WTF ?
OMFG ?
Those are some of the acronyms printed on posters that bear a striking resemblance to planned service announcements posted by the MTA .
They ’re part of an ad campaign created by the Working Families Party to blast City Hall and Mayor Michael Bloomberg , whom the party claims has been MIA amid the budget crisis that left straphangers vulnerable to extensive cuts in subway and bus service .
The agency has refused to put up the signs , which bear the headline " Service Nightmare , " in its buses and subways , however .
The MTA says the acronyms , which are formed using the agency 's circular subway - line logos , suggest inappropriate words that could offend riders .
Also , the posters themselves could be mistaken for actual transit agency announcements and the MTA does n't want to imply that it condones their message by displaying them , an agency spokesman told the Daily News .
Working Families is considering taking the matter to court , claiming the MTA 's rejection of its ad campaign is a violation of the party 's right to free speech .
The group had been willing to shell out up to $ 50,000 for a four - week campaign on city buses and subways .
" We were really hoping to put some pressure on the mayor , " party spokesman Bryan Collinsworth told the News .
" We think he controls a central piece of the puzzle . "
The ads specifically target Bloomberg , claiming that he failed to make good on a campaign promise to revive the struggling agency .
The mayor 's office says Working Families is pointing fingers at the wrong people .
" Their anger on this issue is misdirected , " spokesman Marc LaVorgna told the News , adding that Bloomberg has been a vocal supporter of increased transit funding .
" They should be directing their anger to the state , which has yet to come up with a successful funding source for the MTA .
They should be talking to the entity that controls the MTA , which is the state and the state Legislature . "
Earlier this month , the MTA board approved a list of sweeping cuts and service changes to help close an $ 800 million budget gap .
The cuts , which eliminate the W and V subway lines and some bus routes , take effect in June .

“ There was a goal to have us not talk about it as a port ” , says David Shaw , Bungie ’s PC lead for Destiny 2 .
“ It ’s not a port .
It ’s a ground - up re-envisioning of what this game should be on PC , and that was always what it was about , and we were n’t going to do it any other way ” .
It should be easy to brush such statements off as PR bluster , of course .
PC gamers have often had to await incoming , latecoming versions of big , console productions with gritted teeth and clenched knuckles , bracing for the potential impact of lazy ports , poor optimisation , DRM hell , and any manner of other , detrimental factors speaking to a second - class treatment of the most powerful and versatile format around .
But this time it ’s different .
Because by the time I hear Shaw ’s words , I ’ve already spent a full day with the PC version of Destiny 2 , and its developers do not need to convince me .
Rather , they ’re confirming what I already know to be true .
The PC version of Destiny 2 is not a simple port .
It ’s not even just a good port .
The entire fabric of the game – both technically and experientially – screams of a dedicated , bespoke build of the game , crafted with real attention and care for making not just ‘ Destiny 2 on PC ’ , but Destiny 2 as built for PC .
It screams all of that like a battle - cry .
In hindsight , it perhaps should n’t be surprising , although given the scarcity of Bungie games in the realm of keyboard and mouse – there has n’t been one since Halo 2 in 2007 – low expectations could be justified .
But Destiny has always been a series built with scalability and bespoke requirements in mind .
The first game saw Bungie jump from single platform development to covering Xboxes and PlayStations straddling two different console generations simultaneously .
Things took an immediate and noticeable technical step - up when the Rise of Iron expansion launched for current - gen machines only in 2016 , and Destiny 2 on console marks another resounding leap forward .
In that context , the gains made by the PC version are the next logical step .
But it ’s still impossible not to be impressed .
Breaking through the level cap
On a purely visual level , this is an uncompromised ( and uncompromising ) evolution beyond the already beautiful console version , made all the more impressive by its surprise nature .
Given the first game ’s absence from the PC , it would have been easy to assume a lack of passion for the format at Bungie , but Shaw tells me that ’s far from the case , explaining that the platform ’s importance was actually the reason it did n’t get a version of the first Destiny .
“ We did n’t believe we could do it properly .
We had four platforms .
We ’d gone from shipping our old titles , which were one platform , ever , to shipping on four simultaneously , so Destiny One was a big change for us .
We were developing the processes that we needed to get where we are , and Destiny 2 was an opportunity to say “ Hey , you know what ?
We ’ve got an opportunity to do this and we believe we can do it right .
“ It was n’t whether Destiny was or should or could n’t be a PC game , it ’s that if we were going to bring it to PC , we were n’t going to do it in a limited [ way ] .
“ People say ‘ Well , why did n’t you give us this two or three years ago ? ’
Well , we could n’t give you this two or three years ago , that ’s why .
Not even close . ”
So with Destiny 2 ’s current - gen only launch freeing up Bungie ’s internal bandwidth to take on a PC version , a partner studio was found in Vicarious Visions ( an arrangement that both Shaw and VV lead engineer Thomas Gawrys are keen to emphasise was not an outsourcing process ; staff at both studios formed one collective team , “ on five calls a day sometimes ” ) , and work began .
Or rather , it continued .
Because , despite what you might assume , given Destiny 2 ’s one - month delayed release on the PC , this version was n’t a late addition to the schedule any more than it was a port .
Bungie might not have had the freedom to release a PC version of Destiny in 2014 , but it did have the technical ability , as Shaw clarifies .
“ Technically the PC project started years ago because a lot of our technology ... we tend to think far ahead .
To give an example , our artwork has been HDR capable for years , it ’s just HDR did n’t exist yet in a format that was available to consumers .
All of our stuff has been generated that way , so when it came along , we were just like ‘ Oh we ’ll just need to go and ... ’ ”
Gawrys elaborates .
" We use our PCs to develop , and we ’re using that in all things , so it ’s existed in a sort of very naive , not - shippable form for a long time .
So there ’s been a lot of scalability in development ” .
“ And we know that there ’s going to be future consoles and that there ’ll be future developments in PC hardware ” , continues Shaw , “ and so if you ’re going in adding a feature , sure you might only need it to do X today , but you probably want to make sure you ’re thinking about how to easily go far beyond what ’s there all the time .
So a lot of what we did , the seeds were planted years ago and so we just took advantage of those things ” .
Advantage indeed .
Because while the boons gained by Destiny 2 ’s latest upgrade would be handsome in any game , they feel particularly beneficial to Bungie ’s first PC game in 14 years .
Simply , Destiny 2 just feels right on the PC .
I did worry at first , whether Bungie ’s distinctive FPS combat model - honed over almost two decades , and specifically for console controllers - would translate .
Would the pace and rhythm , that natural ebb and flow of Bungie ’s almost musical combat , prevail in a world of instant 180 spins and pinpoint accuracy ?
But it does .
After acclimatising to the new muscle memory required , one thought very quickly becomes very loud in my head .
“ Holy crap , I ’m playing Destiny ” .
But it is n’t just Destiny .
Destiny on PC is a cleaner , more refined , more immediate version of the game .
Far from being an easy mode – the imagined game - breaking speed and accuracy of keyboard and mouse is tempered surprisingly well by the removal of Bungie ’s invisible but potent aim - assist – this is simply Destiny ’s consummately kinetic , improvisational , omnidirectional gunplay freed from the barriers and limitations of control that were never previously apparent .
While it initially feels like a modified special edition , rather quickly , keyboard - and - mouse Destiny begins to feel like Destiny played in its purest state .
A good , clean fight
Bungie ’s combat is rightly famed for being some of the most adaptably expressive around .
Really , underneath all the loot drops , levelling , and confounding Raid challenges , that ’s the central joy that makes Destiny so endlessly vital , three years after the first game ’s release .
On the PC , we have the most direct , expressive version of it I ’ve ever experienced .
Resolute PC gamers previously deprived are in for a hell of a giddy , dynamic treat .
Stalwart Halo and Destiny fans thinking of making a move can expect to fall for their favourite FPS all over again , in a brand new way .
Visually , too , the extra fidelity ( particularly when running at 60 frames per second , as a Bungie game has never done before ; another barrier removed ) , lends itself especially well to the distinctive design of Destiny ’s world .
The series ’ signature combination of chunky sci- fi weight and ethereal , pseudo - supernatural weirdness has never felt so tangibly heavy , or enjoyed such oddly unsettling grandeur .
And as with so much of Destiny 2 , a multitude of small details stack up to great effect .
The newly slick , industrial crates on Titan , thick with the driving , oceanic rain that crafts so much of the setting ’s atmosphere .
The layered textures and finishes to the rust on Vex installations on Nessus , telling a tale of age , dereliction , and ancient , decaying , technological prowess .
And everywhere , there ’s the simple but powerful way that the option to expand the game ’s field of view adds new impact to Destiny 2 ’s many , now more strikingly lit vistas , across arresting extraterrestrial landscapes and within the vast , arcane otherworlds of its subterranean dungeons .
And I ’d be remiss to round off without mentioning Crucible PvP .
Destiny 2 ’s tighter , more tactical remix of the first game ’s fast - flowing , Halo - inspired multiplayer is an even greater delight on PC .
While nothing has fundamentally changed in its construction , bar the game ’s across - the - board reduction in visual recoil feedback to avoid endless mouse correction , here too Destiny 2 feels purer and more direct .
Without the nominal delays of analogue stick input , the Crucible feels quicker , sharper , and more aggressive , its three - decisions - a- second flow now facilitating five or maybe six .
Strategic experimentation and in - the - moment adaptation are even more viable , now that Guardians are so much more mobile and primed to act .
It remains to be seen how much this will change the way the Crucible is played , long - term , or whether the weapon meta will be different on PC ( though hand cannons do seem to enjoy the extra accuracy ) , but an exciting new flavour it certainly is .
But that ’s Destiny 2 on PC , ultimately .
It ’s still Destiny 2 , with the myriad instant joys and long - terms depths that brings .
However , it ’s Destiny 2 systematically reworked and amped up , with a marvellous , and categorically zestier , essence .
The T1i's not even a year old , and Canon 's knocking it down :
The Rebel T2i pulls from the 7D , delivering 18 megapixels and legit 1080 p video ( 24 , 25 or 30 fps ) for $ 900 .

The T2i pulls from the higher - end 7D almost the same way the T1i pulled from the 50D , though it has its own sensor that simply borrows the gapless microlens tech from the 7D , which was supposedly why it could cram 18 MP onto an APS - C - sized chip without noise the size of boulders .
( We 'll see if that 's the case . )
The main thing you do lose from the 7D is that you only get a 4 - channel readout with this sensor , vs. the 7D 's 8 - channel , and it 's only got one DIGIC IV processor , not two .

It shoots at 18.1 megappixels , with an ISO range of 100- 6400 ( extended up to 12,800 ) , with a 9 - point AF ( only the center point is cross - type though ) and the 7D 's IFCL 63 - layer dual - zone metering system , but adapted for the 9 AF points .
Oh , and it shoots at 3.7 FPS in bursts of up to 34 JPEG or six RAW .

The 1080 p video is n't gimped like the T1i , either , with fully select framerates ( 30 , 24 or 25 fps ) and manual exposure (+/- 5 stops ) , plus the codec 's H.264 .
Sound 's mono , but you can jack in a stereo mic .
Cutting it down to the 720 p or standard def nets you 50 or 60 fps .
Also , there 's a new " movie crop " mode that effectively zooms in 7 x by only using the center part of the sensor , though you only get standard def video out of it .
The interface , ergonomics and controls and more like the 7D's as well , with a dedicated movie button and quick info screen , though you can't customize the controls quite as extensively .
The body 's not quite as durable , swapping metal for polycarbonite ( one of the things the extra $ 1000 for the 7D gets you ) .
The screen sounds impressive : 1.2 - million dots should pop out of the 3 - inch display .
Lastly , for memory you 've got your choice of SDHC of SDXC .

The Rebel 's getting shuffled a bit :
The T1i is sliding down to be the new mid-entry - level , while the XSi is going away , and the XS sticks around as the bottom of the barrel DSLR .
At $ 899 for the kit with a pretty standard 18 - 55 mm lens , or $ 799 body only , this , people , is the new entry - level camera to get when it hits in March .
( At least on paper . )

Today 's photo enthusiast is looking for a camera that will grow with them as they learn , and that is a perfect description of the new EOS Rebel T2i Digital SLR camera .
Retaining all of the traditional characteristics that have made the EOS Rebel series beloved by entry - level photographers and an industry best - seller , the new Rebel T2i succeeds in bridging the gap between an entry - level camera and a true pro-sumer camera .
The Rebel T2i Digital SLR camera includes a variety of new features for photographic assignments as varied as grabbing that action shot from the sidelines or creating memorable family portraits , including : 3.7 fps shooting , an ISO range of 100 - 6400 ( expandable to 12,800 ) , a 63 - zone Dual Layer Metering System , and Canon 's DIGIC 4 Imaging Processor .
There are some moments in our lives where video helps capture the moment better than a still image , and the Rebel T2i offers the best of both worlds with Full HD 1080 p video as well as 18 - megapixel still images .
The Rebel T2i DSLR continues Canon 's industry - leading trend in Full HD DSLR video capture with manual exposure control , selectable frame rates and a new external microphone input .
There is also a new feature for standard definition recording , Movie Crop , which provides an approximate 7 x additional zoom with no loss of image quality when shooting SD quality video .
" There is no question that HD video is the biggest trend in DSLR technology and because of this we are seeing the creativity of still photographers transferring to the moving image .
Still photographers are using the various lenses and accessories they are already familiar with to create amazing video footage , " stated Yuichi Ishizuka , executive vice president and general manager , Consumer Imaging Group , Canon U.S.A .
" Taking that HD video quality and putting it in the hands of entry - level photographers with cameras like our new EOS Rebel T2i , we are seeing a new generation of creative digital artists emerge . "
Lights , Rebel , Action – EOS HD Video
Canon 's EOS HD video capture has helped spark a major movement in digital imaging , empowering still photographers with the ability to experiment , learn and capture stunning high - definition video through a variety of creative lenses .
Continuing this imaging revolution , the new EOS Rebel T2i puts entry - level photographers on the frontline equipped with all the latest EOS HD video features including full HD video at 1920x1080 resolution , selectable frame rates , full manual exposure control and the visual options of interchangeable lenses .
Manual video exposure control provides novice filmmakers with the image control they are accustomed to in a still camera , all while shooting professional - level cinematic video .
Professional photographers utilize creative lighting , adjustable depth - of - field and a variety of lenses to create powerful still images and video footage , and these are exactly the tools that the new Rebel T2i gives to budding photo and video enthusiasts .
Adding a new professional - level feature for EOS cameras , the Rebel T2i includes an Auto ISO function that works in all Creative Zone exposure modes including Manual where users can set a limit to the highest ISO the camera will use , enabling them to retain the lighting and look they desire for a scene .
By setting an Auto ISO range , videographers can retain dark shadow areas and avoid blowing out highlight areas in a scene while still retaining the benefit of automatic ISO adjustments .
The Rebel T2i DSLR captures video in both NTSC ( National Television System Committee ) and PAL ( Phase Altering Line ) standards at selectable frame rates including Full HD 1920 x 1080 at 30 ( 29.97 ) , 25 or 24 ( 23.976 ) fps , and HD 1280 x 720 or Standard Definition 640 x 480 quality video , at 60 ( 59.94 ) or 50 fps .
For easier video recording operation and familiar functionality for beginners , the Rebel T2i's autofocus can be operated before or during video recording by pressing the shutter button half - way down in video mode .
Another feature debuting in the Rebel T2i is Canon 's new Movie Crop mode , where the user can achieve 7 x magnification when shooting SD video for a significantly increased " telephoto " effect .
Unlike the digital zoom feature found in many compact digital cameras , Canon 's new Movie Crop mode actually crops the image directly from the CMOS sensor at full SD resolution to preserve maximum image quality and provide additional zoom power .
The new Movie Crop feature is especially helpful for achieving extra full resolution zoom power when filming youth sports , such as a child running to the furthest end of a field .
For better sound quality when shooting video , the Rebel T2i DSLR includes an external stereo microphone jack , a first for an EOS Rebel model , in addition to its built - in monaural microphone .
These audio and video features supplement a tremendous range of additional must - have video features in an entry - level Digital SLR camera .
For enhanced viewing pleasure and easy video sharing at home , the HDMI video - out capability of the Rebel T2i DSLR includes a new Consumer Electronics Control ( CEC ) compatibility which allows users to play back still or video files on a CEC - compliant HDTV , using the TV remote to control the camera when connected via HDMI interface .
Camera Feature Set
The EOS Rebel T2i DSLR features a newly developed 18 - million - pixel Canon CMOS imaging sensor providing outstanding resolution and light sensitivity for amazing poster - sized prints with fine detail and stunning color .
The camera exhibits exceptional low - noise performance incorporating many of the same technologies used to reduce noise in professional cameras such as the EOS 7D .
The Rebel T2i camera 's basic ISO range is an amazing 100~6400 , and via a Custom Function , it can be extended to ISO 12,800 .
The outstanding ISO range combined with its noise reduction technology allows the Rebel T2 i to capture outstanding low - light pictures at events such as candlelit birthday celebrations or recitals where flash photography may be prohibited .
The camera provides 3.7 fps continuous shooting for still photos , making it the fastest shooting Rebel model to date and enabling users to capture that great image of a little leaguer 's first swing .
The camera features Canon 's proprietary iFCL 63 - zone dual - layer metering system offering intelligent Evaluative metering with much finer segmentation than any previous EOS Rebel model .
The new Rebel T2i also has an expanded ± 5 EV exposure compensation range allowing for much more versatility when shooting in extremely bright or dark environments ; or when shooting HDR ( high dynamic range ) images .
The Rebel T2i DSLR includes a number of professional - level user - selectable Canon image processing features to enhance the image quality of in - camera JPEG files , and to tag RAW images for processing later through Canon 's Digital Photo Professional software ( included with the camera ) .
These features include Canon 's Auto Lighting Optimizer to enhance shadow detail and add contrast to " flat " scenes , Highlight Tone Priority adding up to one stop of detail in bright highlight areas , Peripheral Illumination Correction for automatic correction of vignetting , High ISO Noise Reduction with four user - selectable settings , and Long Exposure Noise Reduction applied to exposures one second or longer .
These Canon image enhancements provide new photographers with professional quality automatic image correction on JPEG files right out of the camera .
The EOS Rebel T2i digital camera includes a new enhanced 3 - inch LCD monitor featuring 1.04 million dots with a wide 3:2 aspect ratio , wider than previous EOS models .
The Rebel T2i camera 's LCD monitor can display a full - screen video image utilizing the entire screen during playback .
For maximum storage capacity the new EOS Rebel T2i Digital SLR camera is the first EOS model to support SDXC memory cards .
With all the new and exciting features of the EOS Rebel T2i , the Rebel series continues to provide great Canon features such as Live View , a built - in pop - up flash , and the EOS integrated cleaning system , as well as compatibility with Canon EX - series Speedlites and Canon EF and EF - S lenses allowing users to fully explore multiple creative photographic possibilities .

A more detailed description of abortion beliefs from
400 BCE to 1980 CE is covered in a separate essay
A brief history :
Many religions , including many denominations within Christianity , have adopted the general principle that abortion is a form of murder if it is performed at or after the time that a soul enters the body of an embryo or fetus .
Down through the ages , beliefs varied about when this " animation " happened .
Various church authorities and popes placed the time at :
WASHINGTON — House Democratic leaders on Wednesday banned budget earmarks to private industry , ending a practice that has steered billions of dollars in no-bid contracts to companies and set off corruption scandals .
The ban is the most forceful step yet in a three - year effort in Congress to curb abuses in the use of earmarks , which allow individual lawmakers to award financing for pet projects to groups and businesses , many of them campaign donors .
But House Republicans , in a quick round of political one - upmanship , tried to outmaneuver Democrats by calling for a ban on earmarks across the board , not just to for - profit companies .
Republicans , who expect an intra-party vote on the issue Thursday , called earmarks “ a symbol of a broken Washington . ”
Both parties are seeking to claim the ethical high ground on the issue by racing to rein in a budgeting practice that has become rife with political influence peddling .
So far , though , the Senate is not joining in .
House Democrats had tried to reach an agreement with their counterparts to ban for - profit earmarks , but the senators balked , Congressional officials said .

Today , Equal Pay Day , marks how far women , on average , have to work into 2010 to be paid the same as men were paid in 2009 .
In other words , women have to work almost 16 months — nearly four months longer than men do — to make the same amount of money .
This is because women who work full time still earn , on average , 77 cents for every dollar men earn .
This day is an important reminder of this ongoing problem , but not one we want to continue " celebrating " year after year .
When people hear about the sex - based wage gap , they are often surprised .
After all , the Equal Pay Act was passed in 1963 — so why does the difference continue ?
Unfortunately , the Equal Pay Act has not worked as Congress originally intended .
In many instances , the pay disparity exists because of ongoing discrimination , the lingering effects of past discrimination , and inadequate tools and remedies to do something about it .
Besides being unfair , the existence of pay disparities depresses the wages of single - female households and the working families who rely on the salary of all family members to make ends meet .
The wage gap also undermines women 's retirement security , which is often based on earnings while in the workforce .
According to the congressional testimony of economist Evelyn Murphy , chronic wage discrimination can deprive a woman of between $ 700,000 and $ 2 million over her career .
This figure grows when the loss of pension and social security benefits is included .
The stark reality for many women is that this difference in pay is a basic survival issue .
According to the National Women 's Law Center 's calculations , more than 15.1 million women — about one in eight — are living below the poverty level .
In 2008 , women were 35 percent more likely to live in poverty than men .
President Obama said it well when he noted that equal pay often means :
the difference between affording the mortgage — or not ; between keeping the heat on , or paying the doctor bills — or not .
And in this economy , when so many folks are already working harder for less and struggling to get by , the last thing they can afford is losing part of each month 's paycheck to simple and plain discrimination .
Modifications and improvements to the Equal Pay Act are necessary to ensure effective protection against sex - based wage discrimination in the workplace , and to provide women with the tools necessary to realize the decades - old promise of equal pay for equal work .
A bill , which has passed the House of Representatives and is currently pending in the Senate , would do just that .
The Paycheck Fairness Act ( S. 182 ) would address the shortcomings of the Equal Pay Act in several ways .
It would finally close loopholes in the law by requiring employers to show that any wage differences between employees performing the same work must be based on legitimate reasons unrelated to the employees ' sex .
In addition , the bill prohibits retaliation against employees who inquire about their employer 's wage practices or disclose their wage information to other employees .
And the bill levels the playing field by ensuring that women who are discriminated against in the workplace can obtain the same remedies as those who suffer from discrimination based on race or national origin .
Finally , the Paycheck Fairness
Act would also improve data collection about pay disparities and provide training and technical assistance to both employees and employers alike .
While today marks the 16 months that it takes a woman to earn a man 's yearly pay , today also marks the almost 16 months it has been since the House of Representatives passed Paycheck Fairness Act .
Unfortunately , the Senate is yet to schedule a vote .
There can be no better to way to mark Equal Pay Day than for the Senate to help end this injustice and pass the Paycheck Fairness
Act now .
The Senate has the chance to make " celebrating " Equal Pay Day obsolete .
The government ’s civil fraud case against Goldman Sachs raises so many provocative questions .
Did the firm deliberately mislead its clients who bought a mortgage - related investment without the knowledge that it was devised to fail ?
Was it fair that a bearish hedge fund manager helped to pick the parts of an investment marketed as bullish , so that he could bask in the winnings ?
Who besides the vice president named in the lawsuit knew details of the deal in question ?
Were there other deals like this one ?
But if there is a larger question , it is this :
Why was Goldman , or any regulated bank , allowed to create and sell a product like the synthetic collateralized debt obligation at the center of this case ?
What purpose does a synthetic C.D.O. , which contains no actual mortgage bonds , serve for the capital markets , and for society ?
The blaring Goldman Sachs headlines of the last few days have given the public a crash course in synthetic C.D.O.’s .
Many more people now know that synthetic C.D.O. ’s are a simple wager .
* Govt picks TVO , Fennovoima to build new nuclear reactors
* Says no to utility Fortum
* Says aims to make Finland electricity self - sufficient
( Rewrites , adds government ’s decision , quotes )
By Terhi Kinnunen
HELSINKI , April 21 ( Reuters ) - Finland 's government granted on Wednesday a permission to utility Teollisuuden Voima ( TVO ) and consortium Fennovoima to build new nuclear power stations , but rejected Fortum 's FUM1V.HE application .
“ We are giving a strong signal to the industry that it is worthwhile to invest in Finland .
Granting one ( nuclear reactor ) permission is not enough , ” Mauri Pekkarinen , Minister of the Economy , told a news conference .
He added the aim was to get rid of Finland ’s dependency on electricity imports from neighbouring countries , especially Russia and to cut CO2 emissions .
Reaching a unananimous decision on the multi-billion - euro nuclear projects in the coalition government was not easy as the four parties have different views on the matter .
Anni Sinnemaki , leader of the Greens , said the party still opposed building new nuclear reactors and would vote against it .
Also Fortum said it was disappointed with the decision and would consider if it could participate in a nuclear reactor project in some other country .
“ Yes , of course our main reaction is disappointment , we think the decision is unfortunate .
We met all the requirements , ” said Fortum ’s Chief Executive Tapio Kuula .
“ I do n’t think it is very likely that Fortum would build a nuclear reactor for itself ( abroad ) , but we are not excluding ownership in another nuclear plant .
Or we could have another role , for instance as an expert . ”
PARLIAMENTARY APPROVAL STILL NEEDED
The decision to build two new nuclear reactors must be approved by parliament , which is expected to start processing the parliamentary term ’s most important decision in May and the final vote is estimated to take place in the summer at the earliest .
Energy companies and Finnish industry have said all three reactors should be built to secure cheap electricity to meet expected rising demand .
Such investment would be a shot in the arm for the export - dependent Nordic country , which has struggled to emerge from the recession as global markets for electronics , timber and metals remain weak .
TVO , whose owners include utility Pohjolan Voima , Fortum and Finnish industrial companies like Kemira KRA1V.HE , is currently building Finland 's fifth nuclear reactor in western coast at Olkiluoto .
The building of Olkiluoto 3 has fallen well behind its original schedule by more than three years , with the estimated start now expected in the second half of 2012 .
TVO and French Areva CEPFi .
PA have taken the dispute over the ballooning costs to the International Chamber of Commerce .

Much of the commentary on the financial meltdown and regulatory reform has been first - rate .
Many writers , including in the mainstream press , have explained in popular language how Wall Street ruined the economy and how it got richer doing so .
It ’s not a pretty picture – far from the rosy concepts college students learn in introductory economics courses .
In the real world , in contrast to college textbooks , financial markets are neither free nor self - correcting .
Nor do they act as an intermediary that connects savers and borrowers .
Nor is their main function to channel investment dollars to the productive economy as they once did .
Financial giants – Goldman Sachs , Citigroup , JPMorgan Chase , Morgan Stanley , Wells Fargo , Bank of America – sit at the apex of our financial system .
And in that position ( because of their connections , insider knowledge , bottomless pockets and strategic position in the global economy , and because of weak regulation ) , they are able to legally and illegally rig markets to their advantage .
More and more , their profits come from speculative and non-productive activities within the sphere of finance – packaging , buying , swapping and selling various kinds of financial instruments , most of which are only incidentally and remotely connected to the real economy of goods and services .
To say that the financial system has turned into a gambling casino is pretty much on the mark .
Moreover , as we have just learned , these markets – filled with hyper - inflated toxic assets , interconnected by a thousand threads , and concentrated in a few hands - can go south at breakneck speed , leaving the larger economy in shambles and slow to recover .
Indeed , long - term stagnation in the aftermath of a financial shock is more likely than robust growth , as evidenced recently in Japan .
There a real estate bubble burst and threw the economy into a decade - long funk in the 1990s .
In other words , unregulated financial markets have a built - in tendency to systemic meltdown – that is , the collapse of one or two major banks or investment houses can derail the whole economy .
No non-financial corporation can claim that power .
So how do we change this ?
Some say increase oversight and capital requirements ; others argue for a new up - to - date regulatory structure ; still others talk about tightening control of derivatives and a tax on short - term capital movements ; and finally , many insist that financial institutions should not be so big that if they fail , they bring the economy to its knees .
Each of these elements is a part of the current Senate debate over a financial reform bill .
True to form , Republicans , who have been portraying themselves as anti-Wall - Street populists , want none of it .
So far they have been able to prevent debate and any action on regulatory reform .
Democrats , with one exception , favor reform , but most ( along with the White House ) are keeping their distance from the needed step of breaking up giant financial institutions into smaller units .
Nevertheless , it appears that some form of regulatory reform will pass and place some restraints on Wall Street .
And that will be a good first step .
As I see it , however , no regulatory reform , even far - reaching reform , is foolproof as long as the financial system is embedded in an economic system – capitalism – that contains inherent pressures on its players to grow bigger , out - compete their rivals , pursue a risky investment strategy , bend and break the law , and , above all , maximize their year - end profits and bonuses .
The pressures are both external ( other competitors ) and internal ( capitalists are in business to make money in the first place ) .
Therefore , a more fundamental solution to the recent financial crisis requires taking over and democratizing the financial system , including the Federal Reserve Bank .
By any objective measure , Wall Street has given up its right to manage our nation ’s finances .
But there is a hitch .
The American people and Congress have yet to be convinced that such action is necessary .
But worry not !
In my opinion the dialectics of struggle will bring this idea into the mainstream .
It is hard , for me anyway , to see how the economy can be restructured along a robust , sustainable and job - creating developmental path without turning the financial system into a public utility and resource .
The chairman of China Construction Bank , the country ’s second largest by assets , has warned of the perils of rapid growth , adding his voice to a growing chorus of economists concerned about overheating .
GDP growth of 9.5 per cent or above would “ be very problematic ” , Guo Shuqing told the Financial Times .
“ It will mean more duplication of construction , more excess capacity and higher waste of capital . ”
In its latest estimate , the World Bank has predicted a growth rate of 9.5 per cent for 2010 , but many analysts predict even faster expansion of the Chinese economy this year .
Growth in the first quarter alone is estimated at between 11 and 12 per cent .
Mr Guo ’s warning comes at a time when China has been sucking up imports from the rest of the world at an accelerating rate and growth in imports has exceeded the pace of exports for most of the last year .
But China ’s trading partners , particularly the US , fear that its policy of holding down its exchange rate relative to the dollar is driving overseas demand for its exports which , in turn , is fuelling rapid economic expansion and inflation .
We 've been curious about the Google TV initiative since hearing about the search giant 's foray into set - top box land , and although scant few details have emerged since then we can now look forward to a full reveal at next month 's I/O Developer Conference .
According to The Wall Street Journal , Google will unveil the Android - based television platform at its annual developer event in San Francisco on May 19 and 20 .
Hardware partners , including Sony , Intel and Logitech , have already announced plans to release products on the Google TV platform .
Consumer electronics giant Samsung also recently confirmed that it 's considering the platform as well — an interesting move considering Samsung already has its own app store for Internet - connected TVs .
Google has extended significant tendrils into the television space lately , both with the Google TV project and with a television search initiative with Dish Network .
In some ways it 's a logical " third screen " move now that the internet company has established itself as a significant player in the mobile space .
We 're eagerly awaiting new details about Google TV at I /O .
What would make you interested in a Google set - top box ?
DETROIT --
The Calgary Flames will have a much different look than the team the Detroit Red Wings are accustoming to seeing when the clubs meet Tuesday in a key game for playoff positioning in the Western Conference .
Calgary is still led by star right wing Jarome Iginla , who is coming off his 10th career hat trick in a 5 - 2 win at Minnesota on Sunday .
And Miikka Kiprusoff , who shut out the Red Wings 3 - 0 in Detroit on Nov. 27 will be in net .
But gone are hard - hitting defenseman Dion Phaneuf and big center Olli Jokinen , among others .
The Flames made several changes prior to and at the trading deadline .
They added forwards Niklas Hagman , Matt Stajan and Jamal Mayers from Toronto and Christopher Higgins and Ales Kotalik from the New York Rangers .
They also picked up defensemen Steve Staios from Edmonton and Ian White from Toronto and backup goaltender Vesa Toskala from Anaheim .
" They 're in exactly the same boat as we are , they 're battling for their playoff life , '' Red Wings coach Mike Babcock said .
" They got solid goaltending .
They 've changed their team around quite a bit .
In saying that , they got real good depth up front .
When they brought in White , they brought a puck mover . ''
The Red Wings could be seventh in the Western Conference after the game .
Or they could drop to ninth .
Detroit , currently eighth , is one point behind Nashville and one point ahead of the Flames .
" It does n't matter who we 're playing , that sense of urgency has to stay with us , '' Red Wings forward Kris Draper said .
" If we win , we leapfrog an opponent and kind of keep Calgary a little bit behind us . ''
Detroit captain Nicklas Lidstrom said the team has played more of a north - south game its last two outings .
" I think we 've been playing more straight ahead , going hard to the net , getting the puck to the net and creating scoring chances that way instead of ending up in the corners too much , '' Lidstrom said .
Investigators looking into corruption involving reconstruction in Iraq say they have opened more than 50 new cases in six months by scrutinizing large cash transactions — involving banks , land deals , loan payments , casinos and even plastic surgery — made by some of the Americans involved in the nearly $ 150 billion program .
Some of the cases involve people who are suspected of having mailed tens of thousands of dollars to themselves from Iraq , or of having stuffed the money into duffel bags and suitcases when leaving the country , the federal investigators said .
In other cases , millions of dollars were moved through wire transfers .
Suspects then used cash to buy BMWs , Humvees and expensive jewelry , or to pay off enormous casino debts .
Some suspects also tried to conceal foreign bank accounts in Ghana , Switzerland , the Netherlands and Britain , the investigators said , while in other cases , cash was simply found stacked in home safes .
There have already been dozens of indictments and convictions for corruption since the 2003 invasion of Iraq .
But the new cases seem to confirm what investigators have long speculated : that the chaos , weak oversight and wide use of cash payments in the reconstruction program in Iraq allowed many more Americans who took bribes or stole money to get off scot - free .

Why peer - to - peer is efficient
When a user wishes to download a file from a website , the submit a HTTP GET request .
This request for the file uses a single TCP socket , and communicates with a single server which transfers the entire file .
By contrast , a P2P protocol creates TCP connections with multiple hosts and makes many small data requests to each .
The P2P client then combines the chunks to recreate the file .
A single file host will usually have limited upload capacity , but connecting to many servers simultaneously allows for higher file transfers , and disperses the costs associated with data transfers amongst many peers .
Moreover , a client mid-way through downloading the file also acts as a server , hosting the bits to others which they have already downloaded .
These differences from traditional HTTP GET requests allow for lower costs and higher redundancy since many people are sharing the files .

The International Brotherhood of Electric Workers is doing more than complaining about how much money bailed - out bank executives are making :
Goldman Sachs Group Inc ( GS.N ) was sued on Monday by a large union pension fund that accused the Wall Street investment bank of overpaying its executives .
The International Brotherhood of Electric Workers fund filed the lawsuit in Delaware Chancery Court , seeking to recover money for the company on behalf of other shareholders .
It seeks to stop Goldman from allocating roughly 47 percent of 2009 net revenue as compensation , saying such allocations " vastly overcompensate management and constitute corporate waste . "
The lawsuit also wants Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein and others in management , rather than shareholders , to be responsible for charitable contributions that Goldman is making as a an apology for its activities .
Farr grew up in a family of teachers in central Texas .
When he graduated from the University of Texas , in 1993 , he had a philosophy degree and an acceptance letter to Yale Law School , neither of which felt quite right .
So he deferred law school and joined a new , floundering outfit , Teach for America .
After a little more than a month of somewhat uneven training , Farr walked into Donna High School in the Rio Grande Valley in Texas — a place he ’d never been .
Many of the three dozen kids in his classroom were the children of migrant workers ; they would disappear for weeks at a time as their families followed the harvests .
Talking to Farr about those two years feels a little like talking to a war veteran .
You and he both know that you can never understand what it was like , and the clichés come marching in .
“ It was the hardest , proudest , all of that , ” he says , his voice drifting away .
Then : “ I was not the teacher I want our teachers to be . ”
Farr lived with three other Teach for America teachers , in a house that had been confiscated by U.S. Marshals in a drug raid .
He taught English and English as a Second Language .
Texas required that students pass a standardized test before they graduate , and as test day approached , Farr felt a mixture of anxiety and resentment .
About a month afterward , he got the news : 76 percent of his students had passed ; 24 percent were told they did n’t yet have the skills to graduate .
Even though many were only sophomores , some of them dropped out as a result .
The principal congratulated him on his scores , but Farr cried into his pillow that night .
“ Some of those kids did not pass because I was not as effective as I needed to be . ”
After his two years were up , Farr went to law school , as planned .
He came back to Teach for America in 2001 — this time in charge of training and support .
By then , the organization ’s founder , Wendy Kopp , had begun to notice something puzzling when she visited classrooms : many Teach for America teachers were doing good work .
But a small number were getting phenomenal results — and it was not clear why .
Farr was tasked with finding out .
Starting in 2002 , Teach for America began using student test - score progress data to put teachers into one of three categories : those who move their students one and a half or more years ahead in one year ; those who achieve one to one and a half years of growth ; and those who yield less than one year of gains .
In the beginning , reliable data was hard to come by , and many teachers could not be put into any category .
Moreover , the data could never capture the entire story of a teacher ’s impact , Farr acknowledges .
But in desperately failing schools , where most kids lack basic skills , the only way to bushwhack a path out of the darkness is with a good , solid measuring stick .
As Teach for America began to identify exceptional teachers using this data , Farr began to watch them .
He observed their classes , read their lesson plans , and talked to them about their teaching methods and beliefs .
He and his colleagues surveyed Teach for America teachers at least four times a year to find out what they were doing and what kinds of training had helped them the most .
Facebook 's new system for connecting together the web seems to have a serious privacy hole , a web developer has discovered .
Some people report that they are able to see the public " events " that Facebook users have said they will attend – even if they person is not a " friend " on the social network .
The discovery was made by Ka-Ping Yee , a software engineer for the charitable arm of Google , who was trying out the search query system known as the " Graph API " released by Facebook last Friday .
In some cases – though not all – it will let you see the public events that people have said they will attend , or have attended .
Yee demonstrated the flaw by showing how the API – which plugs directly into Facebook 's databases – can show you a list of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg 's planned public events .
Yee says that he was very disturbed by the discovery – because there seemed to be no way to prevent the events from appearing on the API , which is publicly accessible , except by saying you were " not attending " an event .
" It seemed that anyone could get this list .
Today , I spent a while checking to make sure I was n't crazy , " he wrote on his blog .
" I did n't opt in for this .
I even tried setting all my privacy settings for maximum privacy .
But Facebook is still exposing the list of events I 've attended , and maybe your event . "
The discovery will intensify the debate over Facebook 's new system – which has drawn complaints that it makes it far too difficult to keep personal information private .
The implications of being able to find out the movements of any of the 400 m people on Facebook are potentially wide - ranging – although the flaw does not seem to apply to every user , or every event .
Yee says that the simplest way to prevent your name appearing in such lists is to put " not attending " against any event you are invited to .
" This kind of event list is not even accessible to your friends on Facebook , " noted Yee .
" As far as I can tell , there is no way to turn this off with your own privacy settings . "
The problem mirrors that which Google ran into when it created its new Buzz systems , which aimed to create a Twitter - like social network – but annoyed people because it assumed that anyone with whom you had exchanged email would want to be part of your network .
But the example of a wife who wanted to stay away from her abusive husband – but with whom she had once swapped an email – showed that Buzz had a flawed approach to privacy .
Similarly the Facebook API system may turn out to be crucially flawed .
" What can your event list say about you ?
Quite a bit , " wrote Yee .
" It might reveal your home address , your friends ' home addresses , the names and groups of people you associate with , your hobbies , or your political or religious activities , for example . "
However some people who have tried
Yee 's method of accessing the site were not able to repeat widespread invasion of privacy – though Zuckerberg 's calendar was discoverable by everyone .
The accessibility seemed to be semi-random : despite Yee 's best efforts , a list of events still shows up for him .
Although the system only reveals data about " open " events – which by definition are public already – the new system changes the game radically .
" There 's a big difference between publishing an event page with a list of people attending , and publishing a list of events that you attended .
Before last Wednesday , to find out which events you attended , I 'd have to visit every single event page on Facebook and look for your name among the people attending .
Now , I can just ask the API what you 've been doing , and it will tell me .
This kind of event list is not even accessible to your friends on the Facebook website ; I have n't found any page at http://facebook.com/
that lets me list a friend 's events .
The API provides this list to anyone , so this is newly exposed information . "
Art Lebedev managed to impress us with its Segmentus analog clock last month , but it looks like the prolific design firm has now already outdone itself with its new Reflectius clock concept , which uses a single laser beam and sixty rotating mirrors to display the time .
That impressive mechanism is matched by the clock 's angular exterior ( pictured after the break ) , which Art Lebedev describes as " a complex triangulated surface that reminds of the complicated trajectory the beam of light travels in no time . "
Unfortunately , it is still just a concept , but you can at least get your usual glimpse of Art Lebedev 's design process at the source link below .

The game , still in the early stages , is said to feature Matt Smith as the Eleventh Doctor as well as key adversaries such as the Daleks , the Cybermen and the Silurians .
A BBC insider reportedly told the Sun , " This has been in the pipeline for years .
We 're delighted to have finally nailed down a deal .
We went with Nintendo as they have huge appeal for families and Doctor Who is very much a family brand .
The Wii console is key for us as it's something families play together .
" The Sun quotesas saying that the element that kept this from getting off the ground before now was how developers treated the character of the Doctor .
" The video game was quite actively developed , but it 's difficult to nail as the Doctor does n't blow things up .
He 's not Batman , who goes around smacking people in the head . "
The insider added : " BBC Worldwide , which licenses BBC shows , has been trying to find some way of doing it .
But you can't have Doctor Who blowing things to bits with a laser gun .
That would massively change the nature of the show . "
According to the Sun , the plan is to have the game in shops in time for the 2010 Christmas season .

Beaver : A semi-aquatic rodent , but also a vulgar slang term After 90 years , one of Canada 's oldest magazines , The Beaver , is changing its name .
Its publishers say it was only natural that a Canadian history journal should have been named in honour of the industrious dam - building creature which is the country 's national emblem .
But in recent times the magazine 's attempts to reach a new online audience kept falling foul of spam filters - particularly in schools - because beaver is also a slang term for female genitalia .
The publishers of the magazine - now to be known as Canada 's History - also noticed that most of the 30,000 or so visitors to their website per month stayed for less than 10 seconds .
Scunthorpe problem
And they suspect that learning about the trade in beaver fur which built Canada 's early economic fortunes was not what they were interested in .
WHEN SPAM FILTERS GO ROGUE
In 2004 , the Horniman Museum in London failed to receive e-mails as filters thought its name was a version of " horny man " A history website for children , RomansInSussex , was blocked due to the substring " sex " Filters have trashed e-mails with the word " socialist " ; substring " Cialis " is erectile dysfunction drug Harmless e-mails promoting the pantomime Dick Whittington have been shot down by filters E - mails to councils objecting to planning applications rejected for having the word " erection " Deborah Morrison , publisher of the Winnipeg - based journal , told the BBC News website : " Back in 1920 , The Beaver was a perfectly appropriate name .
" And while its other meaning is nothing new , its ambiguity began to pose a whole new challenge with the advance of the internet .
The name became an impediment to our growth . "
Similar concerns in part prompted Beaver College in the US state of Pennsylvania to change its name in 2001 .
The blocking of harmless websites or e-mails by trigger - happy filters is nothing new .
In 1996 , residents in the British town of Scunthorpe were initially banned from registering with internet service provider AOL because the town 's name contained an obscenity .
This became known as the Scunthorpe problem .
Cyber prudery Elsewhere in England , residents of the South Yorkshire town of Penistone and Lightwater in Surrey had the same trouble .

International Computer Science Institute Such ham - fisted cyber prudery might have been forgivable in the internet 's infancy .
But why are some filters still apparently unable to distinguish between clean and dirty content ?
Are their chastity belts fastened too tight ?
The problem , technology experts say , is that with a worldwide web awash with filth , broad blocking rules often result in a false positive , meaning innocent content is binned just to be on the safe side .
Furthermore , distinguishing the e-mail sheep from the goats can be a tricky business , especially given the intensity of the so - called " arms race " between the filters and the spammers .
The spammers develop ever - more sophisticated techniques for slam - dunking our inboxes with ads extolling the benefits of manhood enlargements , pornography and virility pills , among other things .
Clbuttic mistake
Then the spam filter engineers have to hit back by creating smarter deterrents , in a perpetual game of cat and mouse .
US sprinter Tyson Gay was the subject of a disastrous filtering error Christian Kreibich , from the International Computer Science Institute in Berkeley , California , says : " The talent of quickly inferring message intent that humans have is very hard to automate .
" You can try to parse the language , but you 'll find a lot of it is unfortunately deliberately misleading or broken , for example , with entirely unrelated passages from the latest Dan Brown novel . "
The research scientist adds : " The filtering systems are - all in all - working rather well , but of course , individual users do n't realise this when a few slip through into their inboxes yet again . "
In a farcical sequel to the Scunthorpe problem , some filters have been known to act like rogue spell checkers , replacing " rude " words with what they deem to be more acceptable variants .
" Butt " replaces " ass " , " breast " is substituted for " tit " , and so on , even within longer words containing the banned letter combinations .
This is known as the " clbuttic mistake " , because classic is edited as clbuttic , passport becomes pbuttport , and so on .
Spam tsunami
In 2008 , a news website run by the American Family Association censored an Associated Press article on the sprinter Tyson Gay .
Up to 400 bn spam e-mails a day would deluge us without filters , says Cisco A filter decided that " gay " was an offensive word , which should be replaced with " homosexual " .
The resulting article began with the memorable headline : " Homosexual eases into 100 m final at Olympic trials " .
Some believe correcting the glitches that see countless legitimate e-mails automatically jettisoned into the junk is not in the financial interests of spam filterers .
Bennett Haselton , webmaster for Peace Fire , an organisation supporting free speech for young people on the internet , said : " The main problem is not that filters are dumb .
" Lots of technology starts out dumb and improves over time .
" The problem here is that there are no marketplace incentives for the filters to improve , because end - users often do n't even realise what e-mails they 've missed . "
Not so , according to Henry Stern , Cisco Systems ' senior security researcher , who says spam filters are rated by the industry on their ability not to block legitimate e-mails or websites .
He says without the blockers , a tsunami of between 250bn and 400bn spam messages a day would deluge our inboxes , crashing computer networks around the world .
The spam filter engineer reckons Scunthorpe - related gremlins are largely a thing of the past .
However , at least one e-mail , mentioning the Scunthorpe problem and sent to a university for this article , was zapped by a filter .

LOL .
Twice .
I think my Dr. is gay , but if he ever says , " Do your eyes close when you sleep , " I 'm going to strip like right now .
Loved the 1st blonde 's breasts .
They made my clit hard .
Would like to see the full length version of this movie , even maybe just to see more of the 1st blonde .
Okay , maybe the Obamas ’ Asheville , N.C. , trip is just a romantic getaway and a chance to grab some 12 Bones BBQ , as the White House suggests .
But you know something is going on when even the local “ tea party ” affiliate welcomes Obama to their “ mountain paradise . ”
Critics like Hoover Institution fellow Shelby Steele have complained that Obama ’s “ ultimate vision , he has not been very clear about . ”
So given that the Obamas “ kind of fell in love ” with the Buncombe County burg during a debate prep visit during the 2008 campaign , could Asheville itself be a clue to what the President is thinking when he talks about “ transforming ” America ?
' Hillbilly - hippies '
Founded as a health resort , the little city of “ hillbilly - hippies , ” entrepreneurs , musicians , retirees , and community drum circles is , indeed , a progressive ’s vision of America .
Nestled in the oldest hills on earth , Asheville ( pop. 70,000 ) , the first East Coast city to require sustainable green construction , is a sort of experiment in environmentalism that has made the city the gateway to the new Appalachia and gotten it listed both as one of America ’s “ happiest places ” and as one of the “ best places to reinvent your life . ”
But it also represents conservative fears about what President ’s intentions might wreak : A dearth of high - paying jobs , relatively high taxes , large numbers of homeless and other wards of the state , a high crime rate , and a progressive ruling class perhaps more interested in maintaining quaintness than thickening residents ’ wallets .
“ At least as far back as the arrival of the Vanderbilts , it has been a haven for artists , innovative types , sophisticated thinkers , and people who want a little something more out of life than the average , ” writes former resident Thomas Osborne on City - Data.com .
“ Asheville is cultured and educated , perhaps more like a New England town , but amazingly friendly and polite , like a piece of decent southern aristocracy . ”
To be sure , the visit also fits into Obama ’s “ White House to Main Street ” program , where he will travel next week to the struggling small towns of the Midwest who first gave him real traction in the 2008 campaign .
' A guy like the rest of us '
And compared to other presidential vacations to tony Martha ’s Vineyard , this trip represents a “ middle class ” vacation to portray Obama as what Dolly Jenkins - Mullen of the University of North Carolina calls “ a guy like the rest of us ” as Congress ponders a crackdown on Wall Street .
Politically , the visit – the President ’s fourth to North Carolina – also could be a signal , writes Politico , that his popularity in North Carolina , a state he stole from the Republicans in 2008 , is turning as Democratic support fractures .
But if Asheville is indeed an Obama vision for America , there ’s a stark lesson about the impact of soaring debt in hard times to glean from the city , as well .
The city ’s success today – embodied by its rich catalog of Art Deco buildings – came at a price .
As a result of the 1920s building spree , Asheville “ entered the Depression with the highest per capita debt in the country , ” writes New Hampshire native Terry Pindell in “ A Good Place to Live . ”
“ All across America , governments declared bankruptcy , further contributing … to the national depression .
But Ashevillians ’ stubborn mountain pride led them to choose a different path [ which ] made Asheville what it is today .
They created a sinking fund to pay off every cent of the debt , no matter how long it took .
[ T ] he debt was n’t retired until 1977 .
For forty years Asheville lay in an economic cocoon – a long sleep . ”
[ Company -> Update ] - News related to Top Story : Fallout : New Vegas press event | More info on Game : Fallout : New Vegas
UPDATES TOWARD THE BOTTOM
I noticed this a few days ago , but due to sporadic internet access forgot to post about it until Ausir reminded me .
There appears to be an event related to Fallout : New Vegas taking place in Las Vegas right now .
Whether this is just a chance for Bethesda and Obsidian to get together or a new press event is unknown at this time .
What I have been able to find out is that Bethesda 's Pete Hines and Jason Bergman are in attendance , as well as Obsidian 's Josh Sawyer and Feargus Urquhart .
More people may be there , but details are sketchy right now .
More updates as they come .
UPDATE : I can now confirm that there IS a Fallout : New Vegas press event taking place in Las Vegas right now ( possibly already finished ) .
Guys from
The Escapist are there , and have been allowed to tweet as such .
Escapist editor - in - chief Russ Pitts tweets : I 've been informed that I can now safely tweet that I am in Las Vegas at the Bethesda press event .
In addition , he posted the following : Want .
Stay tuned to DAC for continuing updates .
How brilliant is this ?
Designer Patrick Sung ’s Universal Packaging System is meant to precisely fit anything that needs shipping .
The individual cardboard sheets are scored with a triangle pattern that can either be fitted to an oddly shaped object , or formed into a custom fitted cardboard box :
Potentially massive savings would result from all the extra shipping space saved–cutting down on how much space each package takes up , and therefore the number of gas - guzzling trucks needed during shipping .
There ’s just a few niggles .
For one , would anyone really put up with the added hassle of folding a custom - sized box , given all the added complexity ?
And two , the space savings issue might be more complicated than it seems :
If people pack things in oddly shaped boxes , there ’s every possibility that these all do n’t fit together well enough to actually save space .
( That ’s why square - shaped boxes are so efficient . )
But still , with a few tweaks–such as printed guidelines for easily creating boxes of different size –this could be the cleverest thing since the Puma shoebox redesign .

So you 're ready for the Dark side of Akihabara with experimental material !
Uh-uh-uh !
HTML5 is my Arcade .
Akihabara is a major Tokyo shopping area for electronic , computer , anime , and otaku goods .
You can find any sort of old & new videogames , starting from the 8 - bit era to modern motion - sensing videogames .
But is also the promised land for nostalgic gamers who has left the heart in their Super Nintendo and actually sees the world in pixels .
The Akihabara which you can download here is my personal dream too .
It is a set of libraries , tools and presets to create pixelated indie - style 8/16 - bit era games in Javascript that runs in your browser without any Flash plugin , making use of a small small small subset of the HTML5 features , that are actually available on many modern browsers .
I wrote this for fast game developing / prototyping , since Javascript is not only a funny scripting language but is also available quite anytime during the day , for some coding - on - lunch - break ( my unique spare time ) .
The engine is not very refined but results are enjoyable on Google Chrome , Safari , Firefox , Opera , Konqueror and Internet Explorer 9 Beta in IE9 mode .
Games run in the same way on all these browsers and on all the supported platforms , that are virtually all ; ) .
Using Javascript gives you a nice side effect too : games are also playable on modern mobile devices like the iPhone / iPod , Nintendo Wii via Internet Channel , Android devices and the just arrived iPad .
Show me the pixels .
Akihabara is composed of a number of libraries that use HTML5 canvas tag and some standard hooks .
Gamebox module is complete and compact enough for making games : it allows multiple grouped objects moving simultaneously , it helps with collisions , rendering and moving objects .
It provides monospaced pixel - fonts rendering too .
It handles keyboard , double buffering and FSEs .
Games can also store some kind of data easily using cookies and load / unload resources at start or while the game is running .
Audio is provided via the HTML5 audio tag and allow volume / muting / seeking / tracking of multiple audio files .
Gamecycle module provides a complete generic game cycle : intro , menus , crossfading between stages / lifes , gameover and ending .
You can use the same game cycle for many games and implement only the main game .
Toys module provides lots lots of common routines during the game developing : from effects for screen titles to HUD handling to platform / SHMUP / RPG oriented routines , like jumping characters , Z - Indexed objects , bullets , sparks , staff rolls , bonus screens , dialogues , audio crossfading etc .
Help module provides some Javascript - specific functions , such object copying , randomizing functions , string / array handlers and the akihabaraInit function , that automatically sets a comfortable preset of configurations : 25 fps , landscape 320x240 resolution with double - sized display for non-mobile devices , dynamic frameskip .
This default behaviour can be changed with its arguments .
Also setup different settings depending on the used browser .
Tool module provides simple developing tools .
Actually there is only a cel - composer : it can compose an image stacking a set of frames for animating objects , applying a number of filters to each frame .
Trigo module provides some math stuff for moving objects in a direction or following a round path .
Iphopad / Iphofretboard module provides a touchpad / fretboard for touch - based device ( for now , Android and iDevices ) .
Download
Since starting from the 1.2 version the full package has grown very much because of audio files , I 've decided to distribute from the project page a core verison , that includes the full set of libraries and the Capman demo and Hall Of Fame only .
You can download the latest core version here : Akihabara 1.3.1 Core
If you want to download the full package , with all the demos and audio , you can find the development version ( and collaborate ) on Github .
( this software is GPL2 / MIT licensed )
Notice that the stable version and the GitHub version may differ in some experimental features that are collected into the GitHub README Experimental Features section .
Demos showed here are likely including most of the experimental features for public testing .
Since version 1.3 in - depth documentation is available into the " akihabara " directory of the package and all this was possible thanks to Darius and Darren .
The five included demos ( Hall Of Fame , a simple credits scroller , Leave me alone a multiple scrolling platform with intro and ending , Solitude , a quite simple SHMUP with in - game narration , The Legend of Sadness , a quite inspired action - RPG with NPCs , quests , multiple weapons and complex HUD , T - Spin , a collection of many reproductions of a classic puzzle game , Capman , a reproduction of a well known classic and Akiba Hero , a stripped down music game written using Akihabara ) shows a number of use cases so you can peep their source code if you 've any doubt .
You can also have a look to Capman 's sources for a quick walkthrought to the major features of Akihabara .
Demos shown here are using a snapshot of the Github version but the older version are available here :
Who ?
Me ?
I 'm KesieV and you can contact me here ( strip the numbers ) and follow my adventures on Twitter .
Please , contact me for anything but ABSOLUTELY mail me if you have any suggestion or - better - any patch or improvement of Akihabara and its demos .
Obviously direct commits on Github are WAY better .
Starting from 1.2 version , Akihabara has sound .
If I was able to make some sound effect with the great CFXR , I 'm quite unable to put together a music so I 've asked some help for the demos - and I was really lucky , since I 've found the kind collaboration of great artists .
Artists for each game are credited on staff rolls at the end of the games but , since I 've stripped down their masterpieces , I 'd like to credit them also here , linking the original quality version of their works .
All stuff that your audio player needs !
Thank you all guys !

You can apply the same parameter set for any game that uses the akihabaraInit command , like all the included demos .
Some browsers need to focus an input box or a textarea for picking keyboard input : click on the first 30 pixels of the screen to open a small textarea to capture the keyboard focus .
There is a little prize for having reached the bottom of this page .

Independents evenly split in their basic reactions , but more are " angry " than " enthusiastic "
PRINCETON , NJ -- Nearly half of Americans give a thumbs - up to Congress ' passage of a healthcare reform bill last weekend , with 49 % calling it " a good thing . "
Republicans and Democrats have polar opposite reactions , with independents evenly split .
The findings , from a March 22 USA Today / Gallup poll conducted one day after the bill received a majority of votes in the U.S. House of Representatives , represent immediate reactions to the vote .
Americans ' emotional responses to the bill 's passage are more positive than negative -- with 50 % enthusiastic or pleased versus 42 % angry or disappointed -- and are similar to their general reactions .
Although much of the public debate over healthcare reform has been heated , barely a third of rank - and - file citizens express either enthusiasm ( 15 % ) or anger ( 19 % ) about the bill 's passage .
However , only Democrats show greater enthusiasm than anger .
Independents are twice as likely to be angry as enthusiastic , and Republicans 10 times as likely .
Bottom Line
Passage of healthcare reform was a clear political victory for President Obama and his allies in Congress .
While it also pleases most of his Democratic base nationwide , it is met with greater ambivalence among independents and with considerable antipathy among Republicans .
Whether these groups ' views on the issue harden or soften in the coming months could be crucial to how healthcare reform factors into this year 's midterm elections .
Given that initial public reaction to Sunday 's vote is more positive than recent public opinion about passing a healthcare reform bill , it appears some softening has already occurred .
Survey Methods
Results are based on telephone interviews with 1,005 national adults , aged 18 and older , conducted March 22 , 2010 , as part of Gallup Daily tracking .
For results based on the total sample of national adults , one can say with 95 % confidence that the maximum margin of sampling error is ±4 percentage points .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones and cellular phones .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .
Polls conducted entirely in one day , such as this one , are subject to additional error or bias not found in polls conducted over several days .
Though I have the utmost respect for Massimo Vignelli , and am a fan of his work , his we use too many typefaces is just plain wrong .
It ’s by no means the first time Vignelli has voiced these views .
If you have no idea what I ’m writing about , then watch this video :
For any designer to claim that a half - dozen or a dozen typefaces is enough — well that ’s their prerogative .
However , it ’s one thing to say ‘ twelve typefaces is enough for me ’ , but to claim ‘ twelve typefaces is enough ’ , period ; extrapolating a generalisation from a personal imposition is rarely , if ever helpful .
Taking his statement at face value , imagine a Vignellian world in which only twelve typefaces exist .
Ignore for now that such an arbitrary limit would mean that a number of writing systems would be left without typefaces .
Sorry , Chinese , sorry Arabic , but there are n’t enough to go round ; pen and paper for you , I ’m afraid .
The global typographic landscape would look pretty bleak indeed .
So , in deference to Mr Vignelii , let ’s suppose that he is talking about twelve latin alphabet typefaces .
Enough ?
Let ’s answer that below .
For now , let us pose another related question .
Why , instead of a handful of typefaces , do thousands upon thousands exist ?
True , a large number of them could be shredded tomorrow , and we ’d probably be none the worse for their deletion .
In fact , we might be better off as a consequence .
Again , hold that thought , and join me in the arbitrarily selected sixteenth century .
Looking around , we see that we already have more than our quota of a dozen typefaces at our disposal ; in fact , there are thousands to choose from .
German - speaking countries , and a swathe of Northern Europe have numerous blackletter types , while the remainder load their setting sticks with roman types first developed by pioneers like the brothers da Spira , and honed by Jenson .
We even have numerous italic styles , ornaments , some wood type , broader - and narrower - set designs , varying x-heights , and different lengths of extenders .
Surely , then , we have enough ?
Despite all these typefaces , Caslon , Baskerville , Bodoni ( inventions of the 18th century ) , the slab serifs ( e.g. the Clarendons ) , the grotesques ( e.g. Akzidenz Grotesk ) , the geometric sans ( e.g. Futura and Gotham ) , the neo-grotesques ( e.g. Helvetica ) , the humanist sans of Martin Majoor ( e.g. Scala Sans ) , Adrian Frutiger ’s eponymous Frutiger , Erik Spiekermann ’s Meta , and a comprehensive , unified super - familiy like Lucas de Groot ’s Thesis — well , none of these has yet to make an appearance .
No doubt there were those in the 16th century who shared Vignelli ’s views .
Every age is populated by those who think we ’ve reached the apogee of progress .
Let ’s return to the why question : why are there so many typefaces ?
For that matter , why are there so many designs of chair ?
Surely a dozen designs of chair would suffice .
And , while we ’re at it , let ’s make do with a dozen designs of houses , tables , books , bridges , teacups , salt - shakers … everything .
Why , then , do we see such profligacy in design ?
Because that ’s what we do , that ’s who we are .
Our restless minds are always striving for ‘ better ’ , for more functional , more comfortable , stronger , more durable , more economical , more ornate , simpler , more complex , smaller , bigger , greener , healthier , clearer , more legible ; even , more aesthetically pleasing .
That ’s what we do .
That same spirit , that inherent desire for progress , that indefatigable obsession with creation , that ’s what we do .
During the Industrial Revolution ( which Vignelli mentions ) , there was explosive growth in the number of typefaces available , a gargantuan proliferation of new designs .
Advertisers demanded new designs , so that their work could be differentiated from the competition ; and type designers too created new , non-commissioned type designs ; thus demand drove supply , and supply fed and elicited demand .
This era gave birth to the grandparents of Vignelli ’s beloved Helvetica , a typeface that would never have existed but for our desire to do better , to progress , to create .
Thousands of typefaces exist simply because they are demanded and supplied , supplied and consumed .
Moreover , technological progress , the desire for differentiation , the desire for more legible types , for types appropriate for new printing techniques , for the screen , for printing on new substrates — these challenges , these changing needs demand new solutions .
Vignelli is an exceptional designer , and graphic design is arguably better off for its association with him .
He has succeeded despite his limited , self - imposed type palette , but the world is bigger and more beautiful than Vignelli and his twelve apostles .

Prelude
Before I do anything else , I ’d like to thank the folks at MEElectronics for sending me samples of the SX - 31 and M2 earphones for review .
MEElectronics has made something of a name for itself in the budget - fi community by providing a number of great earphone choices to consumers who want better sound quality than they ’re getting from their stock earbuds and do n’t want to break the bank in the pursuit of such an upgrade .
The SX - 31 and M2 IEMs are specifically aimed at people who are looking to spend less than $ 20 on a pair of earphones .
The lower end SX - 31s are designed to cater to the subsection of the market that loses , breaks or disposes of their headphones often and the M2s are designed for a similar subset that wants stylish earphones that will last .
So , has MEElectronics created a couple of winners here or will these disappoint in terms of sound quality like so many other sub $ 20 IEMs ?
Read on to find out .
Technical Specifications
SX - 31
Driver : 10 mm dynamic driver
Frequency Response : 20 Hz – 20KHz
Impedance : 16 Ω
Sensitivity : 95dB/mW
Cable Length : 1.2m/4ft .
M2
Driver : 9 mm dynamic driver
Frequency Response : 20 Hz – 20KHz
Impedance : 16 Ω
Sensitivity : 95dB/mW
Cable Length : 1.22m/4ft .
Packaging and Accessories
The packaging for both the SX - 31s and M2s are identical , both being shipped in a tall transparent cylinder which does a good job of showing off the product .
In terms of accessories , three pairs of single flange silicone eartips are included with both the SX - 31s and the M2s but the M2s have the added bonus of a shirt clip that ’s already attached to the cable .
All in all , in terms of accessories , the offerings here are decidedly meager but considering that these are so inexpensive , the lack of accessories is n’t really an issue .
Design and Build Quality
SX - 31 : These are the most inexpensive IEMs in the MEElectronics lineup and it shows in the design .
The housings are made entirely of plastic and are as a result very light feeling in hand and in your ears .
The problem here is that the plastic housings also make them feel cheap .
The cord is very rubbery and there is n’t a proper strain relief on the nickel - plated straight plug .
Extending down from the housings is a long stem which doubles as a pseudo - strain relief but it is n’t very flexible so I ’m not sure what kind of a benefit it will offer .
It ’s also worth noting that driver flex was a bit of an issue and inserting these into my ears almost always resulted in crackling noises but these noises were n’t prevalent during actual usage .
Overall , these feel like they could stand up to moderate abuse , despite their entirely plastic housings and considering their price , I ca n’t really find much fault with them .
Given MEElectronics ’ target market for this product , the disposable build quality on the SX - 31s is n’t necessarily a bad thing .
M2 : The build quality on these is a huge step up from the SX - 31s .
The M2s feature lightweight straight barrel aluminum housings and a similar cable to that of my M9Ps which is a very good thing .
The metal housings feel as though they could take a bit of a beating , much more so than the SX - 31s and seem to be built to last .
The cable is thin , but is very flexible , transmits very little cable noise and is decently relieved at both ends .
Extending down from the housings is a short clear tube , which acts as a strain relief and the cable terminates in a right angled gold - plated plug which has a very nice and flexible strain relief .
One interesting thing to note is that there are no filters on the M2s , which may or may not be an issue for some folks and was not an issue for me .
These are my new benchmark when it comes to build quality in a sub $ 20 IEM .
The design of the M2 is elegant , durable as well as functional and the cable is just excellent .
Comfort and Fit
SX - 31 : These are very light on the ears and are very comfortable to wear for long periods of time .
Their long stems make them somewhat difficult to wear over the ear and could possibly present some issues to some users who prefer deep insertion but neither of these problems was a big deal to me .
With the smallest single flange eartips , getting a good fit and a solid seal was very easy .
M2 : Being straight barrel IEMs , these lend themselves well to deep or shallow insertion and are very comfortable no matter how they are worn .
I prefer wearing them over the ear to reduce the already minimal microphonics but I have absolutely no problem wearing them straight down .
These IEMs practically disappear once they ’re inside my ears and are well suited for long periods of listening .
Sound Quality
Burn in : Both of these earphones were given no less than 20 hours of burn in time prior to review .
SX - 31 : Right off of the bat , it ’s hard not to notice that these are very bassy IEMs .
The low end is forward and boasts decent impact and detail but rolls off as you go further down .
I did find that control was a bit off , and because of a very prominent mid-bass hump , the bass can impact on the mids , which are fairly recessed and veiled .
Treble is rolled off as well but boasts decent clarity considering the price but is a bit harsh .
The soundstage is rather small but I did notice that the SX - 31s do a decent job at presenting a sense of space between instruments .
These are definitely more suited to budget minded bass - heads than anyone else but across the board , sound quality is rather decent .
These are certainly not going to knock your socks off but for the price MEElectronics is asking for them , you ’d be hard pressed to find something that sounds as good .
M2 : These are much more balanced than the SX - 31s and remind me somewhat of the M9Ps in terms of their sound signature .
Bass can be boomy at times but never as much so as the SX - 31s .
The low end is surprisingly well controlled , not rolling off as early as the SX - 31s and it does n’t creep up on the mids in the same way either .
Mids are clear and linear for the most part and slightly warm sounding without sounding forward or recessed .
Treble is very smooth as well and clear and is surprisingly refined .
While treble is rolled off , it does so rather gradually but there is a bit of harshness and sibilance to be heard in the upper treble .
The soundstage is above average in size and airiness and positioning is rather good as well , considering the price .
These seem to be the little brother of the M9s as they boast similar airiness , width of soundstage and overall sound quality .
While the M2s ca n’t match the M9s in terms of the depth or impact of their bass or the clarity or extension of their treble , just like the M9s , these still sound very good for the price .
Value and Conclusion
MEElectronics has created two appealing IEM choices in the sub $ 20 price bracket .
The M2 IEMs represent an excellent value in their price range because of their fairly balanced , inoffensive sound that does n’t do very much wrong .
Do n’t get me wrong , the SX - 31s are certainly good for the price and , as long as you ’re not looking for very neutral IEMs , they would be a good choice but the problem is , the M2s are more capable performers and thus , a much better choice .
The SX - 31 and M2 IEMs retail for $ 12.99 and $ 17.99 , respectively on MEElectronics ’ website but the M2s can easily be found for around $ 10 or so at online retailers such as Overstock and Amazon and given the choice , I ’d choose the M2s over the SX - 31s any day , if only for the improvements in build quality .
Overall , these are two very good performers in their price bracket and I doubt most listeners would be disappointed with either of these choices .
Sound quality is admirable for the price these are going for and I can recommend both of these IEMs to different kinds of people , even if the M2s come with a higher recommendation across the board .
APRIL FOOOOOOOLS !
Original Message : I just made a journal entry about this , but I 'll repeat it here .
My interest in Sister Claire has been dwindling , and ever since Lady Gaga promoted my fanart , most of my new followers are now fans of HER , rather than of my silly little pregnant nun .
So I 've made the difficult decision to drop Sister Claire and start working on a new , more Gaga - centric comment .
I 'm sure all of my old fans will understand , and enjoy the new comic .
In other news , I finally started reading Twilight , and you know what ?
It 's actually really GOOD .
EDITORS ' NOTE
In a number of business articles in The Times over the past year , and in posts on the DealBook blog on NYTimes.com , a Times reporter appears to have improperly appropriated wording and passages published by other news organizations .
The reporter , Zachery Kouwe , reused language from The Wall Street Journal , Reuters and other sources without attribution or acknowledgment .
The Times was alerted to the problem by editors at The Wall Street Journal .
They pointed out extensive similarities between a Journal article , first published on The Journal ’s Web site around 12:30 p.m. on Feb. 5 , and a DealBook post published two hours later , as well as a related article published in The Times on Feb .

Those articles described an agreement on an asset freeze for members of Bernard L. Madoff ’s family , in a lawsuit filed by a court - appointed trustee .
In the Times article and the DealBook post , several passages are repeated almost exactly from the Journal article .

Protests are growing against Pope Benedict XVI ’s planned trip to Britain , where some lawyers question whether the Vatican ’s implicit statehood status should shield the pope from prosecution over sex crimes by pedophile priests .
More than 10,000 people have signed a petition on Downing Street ’s web site against the pope ’s 4 - day visit to England and Scotland in September , which will cost U.K. taxpayers an estimated 15 million pounds ( $ 22.5 million ) .
The campaign has gained momentum as more Catholic sex abuse scandals have swept across Europe .
ADVERTISEMENT
Although Benedict has not been accused of any crime , senior British lawyers are now examining whether the pope should have immunity as a head of state and whether he could be prosecuted under the principle of universal jurisdiction for an alleged systematic cover - up of sexual abuses by priests .
Universal jurisdiction Ã¢â‚¬â€ a concept in international law Ã¢â‚¬â€ allows judges to issue warrants for nearly any visitor accused of grievous crimes , no matter where they live .
British judges have been more open to the concept than those in other countries .
Lawyers are divided over the immunity issue .
Some argue that the Vatican is n’t a true state , while others note the Vatican has national relations with about 170 countries , including Britain .
The Vatican is also the only non-member to have permanent observer status at the U.N .
Then again , no other top religious leaders enjoy the same U.N. privileges or immunity , so why should the pope ?
David Crane , former chief prosecutor at the Sierra Leone war crimes tribunal , said it would be difficult to implicate the pope in anything criminal .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ It ’s a fascinating kind of academic , theoretical discussion , ” said Crane , who prosecuted Sierra Leone ’s Charles Taylor when he was still a sitting head of state .
“ At this point , there ’s no liability at all . ”
But Geoffrey Robertson , who as a U.N. appeals judge delivered key decisions on the illegality of conscripting child soldiers and the invalidity of amnesties for war crimes , believes it could be time to challenge the immunity of the pope Ã¢â‚¬â€ and Britain could be the place .
He wrote a legal opinion on the topic that was published Friday in the U.S. news site The Daily Beast and Saturday in the British newspaper the Guardian .
“ Unlike in the United States , where the judges commonly uphold what the executive says , the British courts do n’t accept these things at face value , ” Robertson told The Associated Press on Saturday .
“ The Vatican is not a state Ã¢â‚¬â€  it was a construct of Italian dictator Benito Mussolini . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
But Jeffrey Lena , the California attorney who argued Ã¢â‚¬â€ and won Ã¢â‚¬â€ head of state immunity for Benedict in U.S. sex abuse cases , said the pope could not successfully be prosecuted for crimes under international law .
“ Those who would claim that ‘ universal jurisdiction ’ could be asserted over the pope appear to completely misunderstand the sorts of violations , such as genocide , which are required to assert such jurisdiction , ” he said in a statement to the AP .
ADVERTISEMENT
Still , Israeli officials , including former Prime Minister Ehud Barak , have recently been targeted by groups in Britain under universal jurisdiction .
The law principle is rooted in the belief that certain crimes Ã¢â‚¬â€ such as genocide , war crimes , torture and crimes against humanity Ã¢â‚¬â€ are so serious that they are an offense against humanity and must be addressed .
It ’s a tactic that the British government would likely abhor , but British judges have often gone against government wishes in lawsuits .
Recent examples include British judges who issued an arrest warrant against Israel ’s former foreign minister for alleged war crimes , and a British court ruling this year that forced the government to release its intelligence exchanges with U.S. officials about the torture claims of a former Guantanamo detainee .
ADVERTISEMENT
Prosecution in the deepening cleric sex abuse scandal , however , ultimately rests on the question of immunity .
If British judges do challenge the pope ’s immunity , there are a handful of possible legal scenarios Ã¢â‚¬â€ all of them speculative .
The pope could be served for a writ for civil damages , a complaint could be lodged with the International Criminal Court , or abuse victims could try to have Benedict arrested for crimes against humanity Ã¢â‚¬â€ perhaps the least likely scenario .
Lawyers question whether an alleged systematic cover - up could be considered a crime against humanity Ã¢â‚¬â€ a charge usually reserved for the International Criminal Court Ã¢â‚¬â€  and whether it could be pursued under universal jurisdiction .
Attorney Jennifer Robinson in London , who has been researching the possibilities , says rape and sexual slavery can be considered crimes against humanity .
ADVERTISEMENT
Others , like Hurst Hannum with the Fletcher School of Law & Diplomacy at Tufts University near Boston , are skeptical .
“ No one would question that the Church ’s response to widespread abuses has been atrocious , but it ’s very difficult for me to see how that would fit ‘ crimes against humanity , ' ” said Hannum .
Robertson is more in favor of challenging the immunity question .
“ Head of state immunity provides no protection in the International Criminal Court , ” said Robertson , who represented The Associated Press and other media organizations who sought to make U.S. - U.K. intelligence exchanges public in the case of former Guantanamo detainee Binyam Mohamed .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ If acts of sexual abuse by priests are not isolated or sporadic events but part of a wide practice both known to and unpunished by their de facto - authority Ã¢â‚¬â€ i.e. the Catholic Church … then the commander can be held criminally liable , ” Robertson said .
Even though the Vatican Ã¢â‚¬â€ like the United States Ã¢â‚¬â€ did not sign the accord that established the international court , a crime would only have to occur in a country which did sign , like Britain .
Still , lawyers would have to prove that the crimes or an alleged cover - up occurred or continued after the court was set up in July 2002 .
In a 2005 test case in Texas that involved alleged victims of sex abuse by priests , the Vatican obtained the intervention of President George W. Bush , who agreed the pope should have immunity against such prosecutions because he was an acting head of a foreign state .
It was around 1929 when Mussolini decided that the Vatican Ã¢â‚¬â€ a tiny enclave about 0.17 of a square mile with some 900 people Ã¢â‚¬â€ was a sovereign state .
“ The notion that statehood can be created by another country ’s unilateral declaration is risible , ” Robertson said .
ADVERTISEMENT
Others say the last 80 years of history have turned the Vatican into a state , and it would be almost impossible to strip the pope of his immunity now .
“ My guess is the weight of opinion would allow the pope to enjoy immunity , ” said Hannum .
“ It ’s not automatically clear that the Holy See is a state , although it ’s treated as one for almost every purpose . ”
Last year , a Palestinian bid to have Barak Ã¢â‚¬â€  the Israeli defense chief who also served as prime minister until 2001 Ã¢â‚¬â€ arrested for alleged war crimes during a visit to Britain failed when the courts determined that he should be given immunity from arrest .
But months later , pro-Palestinian activists persuaded a London judge to issue an arrest warrant for Israeli politician Tzipi Livni , who was foreign minister during the 2008 - 2009 war in Gaza .
The warrant was eventually withdrawn after Livni canceled her trip .

Spain and Britain jointly pioneered the universal jurisdiction concept when , in 1998 , Britain executed a Spanish arrest warrant for former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet on torture claims .
Pinochet was kept under house arrest in London until he was ruled physically and mentally unfit to stand trial and released in 2000 .
When he was arrested , however , Pinochet was no longer head of state .
In 2001 , activists brought Israel ’s then - Prime Minister Ariel Sharon to trial in Belgium in connection with a 1982 massacre at a Beirut refugee camp .
Sharon canceled a planned trip to Belgium and was tried in absentia in a Belgian court .
He was not convicted but the case provoked diplomatic protests and prompted Belgium in 2003 to tighten the law that had permitted the trial .
Prime Minister Gordon Brown has vowed to block private groups from taking legal action against visiting foreign dignitaries but any new law is unlikely before Britain ’s expected May 6 election .

The parent company of Wikipedia is knowingly distributing child pornography , the co-founder of the online encyclopedia says , and he 's imploring the FBI to investigate .
Larry Sanger , who left Wikipedia in 2002 , said Wikimedia Commons ( the parent company of Wiki products including Wikipedia , Wiktionary , Wikinews and Wikiquote ) is rife with renderings of children performing sexual acts .
Sanger sent a letter to the FBI earlier this month outlining his concerns and identifying two specific Wikimedia Commons categories he believes violate federal obscenity law .
The first category , entitled “ Pedophilia , ” contains 25 - 30 explicit and detailed drawings of children performing sexual acts .
The category was created three years ago .
The second , “ Lolicon , ” provides cartoons similar in detail and depiction .
One of the more egregious cartoons shows a rendering of a young child about to perform oral sex on a much older man .
“ I was n’t shocked that it was online , but I was shocked that it was on a Wikimedia Foundation site that purports to be a reference site , ” said Sanger , who is now involved in educational projects like Citizendium.org and WatchKnow.org , non-profit directories of videos for students grades pre-K to 12 .
( Wikimedia Commons is owned and hosted by the California - based Wikimedia Foundation . )
“ I think a lot of teachers and education technologists responsible for the filters at public schools do n’t realize how much and what level of pornography there is in the system .
I ’m quite sure that if they knew there were pages devoted to pedophilia , it might make them think twice about giving students unrestricted access in schools . ”
Wikimedia ’s general counsel did not respond to a request for comment .
An e-mail sent to the foundation 's press contact was not returned .
Following publication of this article , both Moeller and Wikimedia posted responses online .
See the update note at the end of this story .
After numerous phone calls and e-mails with an FBI spokeswoman over the span of three days — and despite multiple requests by the FBI for more time , including a weekend , to reply to a request for comment — the bureau on Monday refused to say whether it is investigating Wikimedia or following up on Sanger ’s allegations .
Sanger says he began looking for explicit content after realizing during a mailing list discussion with other educators that most of them had no idea that Wikimedia had content that might be deemed inappropriate for students .
When Sanger ’s research led him to graphic images of children , he looked up the law and realized that under the obscenity statute he ’d homed in on , a person who sees obscene renderings of child abuse and does not report them to authorities is as culpable as the person who actually distributes the obscene content .
“ I read , “ You must report this to the FBI or else you are prosecutable under the same statute , ” Sanger recalled .
“ And then I thought , ' Oh my . ' ”
That ’s when he began composing his letter to the FBI .
He says burning bridges within the industry was not an easy thing to do , but he really did n't have a choice .
“ I ’m going to sound really old fashioned , but I felt that it was my duty .
I really did , ” he said .
“ Wikimedia has quite a bit of pornography on it and they had no idea . ”
But the threat is even greater than the images themselves , says James Marsh , an attorney who wrote about Sanger ’s letter to the FBI on his Child Law Blog .
“ Wikipedia ’s continued interest in child sexual exploitation is troubling not only because the site hosts some questionable images , but because it can easily serve as a gateway to other sites containing child pornography , " Marsh told FoxNews.com .
" One simple link buried in the text of an article on Japanese anime or child pornography could easily take an unsuspecting child or adult user to a place which is not only disturbing , but illegal . ”
In addition to mentioning the two categories of possibly illegal content , Sanger also named the controversial high - level Wikipedia manager Erik Moeller , who Sanger said “ is well known for his views in defense of pedophilia . ”
“ What is my position on pedophilia , then ?
It ’s really simple .
If the child does n’t want it , is neutral or ambiguous , it ’s inappropriate , ” Moeller wrote in 2001 in a post on Kuro5hin.org that he titled , " Pleasure , Affection , Cause and Effect . "
These writings were drudged up by Valleywag in May 2008 .
" The real issue for Wikipedia and sites like it is who is monitoring the content ?
Who is accountable ?
And who exactly is responsible ?
Anonymous editors and contributors and a complete lack of transparency presents a real risk of uncensored content being distributed worldwide . "
On his blog , he pointed out some of Moeller ’s additions to Wikipedia articles :
To Wikipedia ’s “ Human Sexual Behavior ” article , Moeller added :
" It is generally acknowledged that children are capable of feeling sexual pleasure , even if they are not yet able to engage in sexual intercourse with each other , and / or are not yet biologically able to reproduce . "
To “ Homosexuality and Morality , ” he added :
“ A small minority believes that children are capable of consenting to homosexual acts with older men , but all major pro-homosexual groups have rejected that view . ”
Moeller , who did not reply to requests for comment , wrote into the “ Pedophilia ” entry :
" Again , someone who sexually abuses a minor is not necessarily a pedophile ( ' exclusively ' ' attracted ' to ' preadolescents ' — emphasis on every word ) , but may simply be acting out of opportunity .
The title ' pedophiles and pederasts ' is redundant — pedophilia includes pederasty .
This does not in any way mitigate the definitional problems of this article . "
“ I do n’t think Wikimedia should be censored , " Sanger said .
" If they have decided to include pornography , then that ought to be their legal right .
But I think the public ought to know that there ’s a lot of that there . ”
Sanger said he wants Wikimedia projects including Wikipedia to start using a consistent tagging system to mark all of its adult content and make it easy for filters to remove such content .
But Marsh thinks things are more serious than Sanger suggests .
“ As Wikipedia becomes an authoritative source in law , politics and news , it makes a great target and medium for people with all kinds of questionable agendas , ” he said .
“ Wikipedia is like the Wizard of Oz .
You never know exactly who is standing behind that green curtain .
And that ’s the real risk here . ”
UPDATES :
-- Following publication of this article , Wikimedia Foundation posted an online response that reads in part :
“ The Wikimedia Foundation obeys the law .
In the weeks since Sanger ’s published allegations , the Wikimedia Foundation has not been contacted by the FBI or any other law - enforcement agency with regard to allegedly illegal content on any Wikimedia projects .
Our community of volunteer editors takes action to remove illegal material when such material is brought to its attention .
The Wikimedia Foundation is proud of the Wikimedia editors who zealously work to keep the projects free of illegal material .
If and when we are informed by law enforcement agencies of illegal content that has not already been removed through self - policing , we will take quick action to delete it . ”
-- Erik Moeller also posted a response that reads in part :
“ I want to say definitively : I do not defend nor support acts of sexual violence against children and have never defended pedophilia in any way .
“ I have consistently defended the right of children of comparable age to engage in consensual , harmless sexual interactions with each other – what ’s commonly called “ playing doctor ” , and also safe sex among teens .
I have never defended the “ right ” of pedophiles to abuse children ; child sexual abuse is a crime , and there is no such right .
Children also do n’t have the ability to consent to sexual activity with pedophiles , and such activities are sexual violence against children by definition . ”
In response to the content mentioned in Larry Sanger ’s letter to the FBI , Moeller wrote :
“ It ’s a false claim related largely to some historic early 20th century drawings , as described in the summary published by the Wikipedia Signpost .
The Wikimedia Foundation ’s General Counsel examined the drawings and concluded that they do not violate federal laws ; we have not received any communication from the FBI to the contrary , and when and if we are asked by authorities to remove images that are illegal , we will do so . ”
-- FoxNews.com has been informed that Sen. Sherrod Brown , D - Ohio , sent a copy of Sanger 's letter to the FBI on April 21 , and Rep. Steve Austria , R - Ohio , sent a copy of the same letter to the FBI on April 27 .
Is Kantabai becoming your child ’s guru ?
That ’s how a recent full - page advertisement of the Genesis Global School in Noida began .
“ When your child is wasting her after - school hours at home , ” the pitch went on , “ someone else ’s child is mastering her dribbling in our basketball court .
While your child is learning your maid ’s language , someone else ’s child is learning a foreign language … ”
Hopefully , the ad got your attention not for what was intended – publicising the five - star school – but for its shocking elitist tone .
There ’s the obvious class - bias that makes the rich think they are born entitled to trod on the poor and all that they represent .
To the creators and sponsors of this repugnant ad , I have two simple retaliatory questions :
Why ca n’t Kantabai be my child ’s guru ?
And why should some opinionated and prejudiced faculty member at Genesis be instead my child ’s guru ?
It may seem an exaggeration but “ global ” education like this will only deepen the divide between India ’s haves and have - nots .
That point made , I want to move to another that I found equally enraging , if not more .
It is the inherent and distinct language bias in the ad .
Your children , the ad preached , would only be a loser if she spent time learning your maid ’s language .
Instead , it was suggested , he or she ought to be mastering a foreign one at Genesis .
I hope you are equally repulsed .
Why should a maid ’s language be inferior to any other language , Indian or foreign ?
I am no linguistic romantic or idealist .
If a language has to survive , a thriving economy must be built around it .
Why else do you think there is a sudden rush to learn Mandarin ?
The central reason why languages are dying – and there ’s one that perishes somewhere in the world every fortnight – is because its speakers find no economic incentive to learn , speak and teach it .
That ’s also the reason why “ foreign ” languages offered at schools like Genesis do not go beyond the few profitable ones like French , German and Spanish .
You think Genesis and its ilk offer foreign languages like Swahili , Amharic , Berber or Inuit ?
For that matter , even Arabic or Persian ?
I wish they did .
It ’s fair for a school to offer languages that promise better careers for their students .
I ca n’t challenge that .
But does that give them , and us , a carte blanche to denigrate other languages ?
What can you expect of an “ international ” or a “ global ” school that insists Kantabai ’s fascinating creole of Marathi , Hindi and English is inferior to French ?
And will any foreign - educated faculty at Genesis be able to match Kantabai ’s vast repertoire of folk tales ?
The thought that the language and culture of the poor and marginalized must be inferior should only evoke revulsion .
Languages thrive among the marginalized , often more than in privileged circles .
Verlan , a spunky language that borrows words from French and inverts the syllables , has flourished in the Parisian suburbs known for their poor immigrant neighbourhoods .
Linguistic discrimination of the Genesis kind , something many Indians are guilty of , makes for the first blow to the plurality of languages that India enjoys .
This unique diversity is under increasing threat and biased grooming at schools like these can only speed up the unfortunate process of linguistic homogenisation .
Even the relatively well - off Hindi suffers from this as its speakers replace words , even entire phrases , in Hindi with those from English .
Ever noticed how numbers in Hindi in the Devanagari script have nearly vanished ?
Take any Hindi paper and you will see that numbers are written in their Latin form .
You probably missed this significant shift , which proves my point that Indians have n’t learnt to respect indigenous linguistic traditions .
You also probably do n’t take offence when Hindi or any other Indian language is rendered in ads in the Latin script .
It is because of this inferiority complex that , for example , a waiter at a five - star will make it a point to speak in halting and incomprehensible English when he and his guest can speak fluently in Hindi .
Languages , other than English , seemingly are not suited to air - conditioned environs .
No child must grow up feeling that the language spoken at home is inferior to English or a foreign language .
The fact that so many children today in India look down on their mother tongues and speak barely passable versions of indigenous languages must stand as an indictment of our educational system and families who have collectively failed to develop any attachment among them to Indian languages .
And it is the convent , “ international ” and “ global ” schools that have done more damage than any other .
Many of them actually forbid their students from speaking any language but English .
Government schools , despite their poor quality , fare much better and deserve more support for the stupendous task they do of keeping indigenous languages alive .
It is clear that schools like Genesis before going global must inculcate and respect all that ’s local – that includes Kantabai , her language and her culture .

Mars in a Manger
Image Credit & Copyright : John Ambrose
Explanation :
At opposition in late January , Mars shone very brightly in planet Earth 's night sky , among the stars of the constellation Cancer the Crab .
Since then the Red Planet has been fading , but still lingers in Cancer during April and May .
In mid-April , Mars wandered remarkably close to Cancer 's famous star cluster M44 , the Beehive Cluster .
M44 is also known by an older name , Praesepe , Latin for cradle or manger .
Captured in this 60 second time exposure made on April 14 , a yellow - tinged Mars and M44 are near the center of the field , seemingly just beyond the reach of a pine tree .
Of course , M44's stars are about 600 light - years away , while Mars was more like 600 light - seconds from Earth .
The digital photograph was made with a camera mounted on a telescope tracking the stars through dark skies above a camp ground in Virginia , USA .
During the exposure , passing car lights briefly illuminated the tree branches .
This is one of my personal favorites .
Not only do I love the delivery of this comic but the title for it is “ Without the Super , He ’s Just a Man ” .
Running another Classic Dueling Analogs today .
First off , changed the name of these from “ If Scott Johnson can do this then so can I ” numbered sequentially to “ Class Dueling Analogs ” numbered sequentially .
Second , sorry for the lack of a new comic .
Currently living in the house that sick built and not feeling the motivation nor the funny to create anything new .
Third , I want to thank Griffin McElroy for including Dueling Analogs in the latest Joystiq ’s Weekly Webcomic Wrapup .
I really appreciate it .
And lastly , I really think Thursday ’s comic will make up for the lack of new material today .
It ’s a comic that I ’ve wanted to do for a very long time now and the positive response to the previous comic gave me the confidence that I could actually pull it off .
Thanks , everyone .
Until Thursday …
Technology is wonderful , until it stops working as expected .
Computers have a nasty habit of developing glitches or just going belly up altogether at the worst possible times .
There 's nothing that can prevent that , but a couple of open source tools can help mitigate disaster and maybe even save the day altogether .
With Clonezilla you can create a perfect copy of your system .
Using the System Rescue CD , you 'll have all the tools you need to recover from many system crashes .
To thy data be kind
It might be tempting to rely on system troubleshooting skills to save the day , but the only guaranteed way to keep your data safe is to do regular system backups .
Never ask " should I be paranoid about losing my data ? "
Ask " just how paranoid should I be about losing my data ?
"
The answer to that question , if you have any files that can't be easily replaced — especially things like family photos or documents that you 've created — is very paranoid .
So let 's start with Clonezilla , an open source clone system .
That is to say , it 's a system for creating a clone of your existing system .
Clonezilla is designed to do more than just back up your data — it 's actually designed to create a fully working copy of an installed system .
Clonezilla comes in two editions : Clonezilla Live and Clonezilla Server .
The server edition is geared towards massive clone / restore scenarios and it requires a server to receive the cloned partitions and a system or systems booted off of PXE or Etherboot .
That 's probably overkill for most users , so I 'll focus here on Clonezilla Live .
What you 'll need , aside from the the CD itself , is a system to clone and a target system or hard drive to receive the image or images .
Using Clonezilla you can copy images over SSH , Samba , NFS , or to a USB disk .
Clonezilla is n't just for Linux systems , either .
You can create clone images of Linux machines , sure , but also Microsoft Windows systems , and even Intel - based Mac OS X systems .
Clonezilla supports Ext2 , Ext3 , Ext4 , ReiserFS , FAT , NTFS , and HFS +.
If your filesystem is n't on that list , Clonezilla can still tackle it with the dd utility , but it loses a bit of flexibility .
With supported filesystems , Clonezilla can save space by copying only the used blocks on partitions .
With unsupported filesystems , Clonezilla has to do a total copy of the filesystem regardless of space used .
As an example , if you 're backing up an Ext3 - based system with a 90 GB partition that has 45 GB of space used , Clonezilla should only copy 45 GB of data ( give or take ) .
In the same scenario with an unsupported filesystem , Clonezilla would copy the whole partition , even the empty space .
Using Clonezilla
The simplest way to use Clonezilla , and my preference , is to boot a system using the Clonezilla Live CD with an attached USB drive .
Note that you 'll want to have the USB drive partitioned beforehand .
Clonezilla boot choices
Truth be told , Clonezilla is n't quite as user - friendly as its proprietary counterparts .
Tons of functionality , but it does suffer from a few rough edges .
Case in point , when you start walking though the Clonezilla startup the first time , it requires you to mount an image as / home / partimag — but the language in the Clonezilla dialogs makes it murky as to whether / home / partimag is the target device or the device being backed up .
You 'll want to mount / home / partimag as the target device to receive the clone image .
Choosing Clonezilla modes
Clonezilla uses Partclone to copy the system images .
As soon as the process is underway , there 's not much to do but watch the status messages tick by .
Once you 've kicked off the process , it 's time to go get a cup of coffee , a slice of pizza , and maybe read a goodly chunk of War and Peace .
To put it another way , the process of copying a relatively large system image can take a whlie .
Using a recent vintage laptop with two Ext3 partitions weighing in at 69GB and an external USB drive , Clonezilla took more than two hours to run the process .
Once you 've got a cloned image , you can restore by booting into Clonezilla and following the same steps , but choosing the " restore image " option and choosing the cloned images you created the first time .
Again , this will take some time , but it beats having to re-install a system by hand .
Restoring from the Clonezilla image
Aside from being somewhat slow , the other downside of Clonezilla is this : it 's an all - or - nothing proposition , and it does n't support live imaging .
This means that the system being cloned is going to be offline while Clonezilla is working .
Not so bad for home desktop systems , laptops , workstations , etc .
Not so good when you 're looking at backups for servers .
Clonezilla Server is still a great solution for creating and deploying production images , but not for regular backups .
Because of these limitations , I recommend a dual strategy of cloning your system on a weekly or monthly basis , and daily ( if not hourly ) backups of your data using rsync or another system backup tool .
You do n't want to restore your entire system just to recover a few files deleted by accident .
But having a full system clone can get you up and running in an hour or two with all your apps intact in the event of a disaster .
Having a recent backup of your data means not losing any work due to disk crashes or hardware disasters .
If at all possible , it 's also a very good idea to do a trial run or two to test restoring your system before disaster strikes .
There 's nothing like attempting a restore after a system crash to find out that the backups are useless !
The roots of racism are in our brains , based on empathy
Cognitive activity :
The study found that there is a basic difference in the way peoples ' brains react to those from other ethnic backgrounds
The roots of racial prejudice lie deep within the brain , research has suggested .
A study found that when we watch someone from our own race do something our brain simulates the action mentally as a form of empathy , known as ' mirroring ' .
But when we see someone of a different race do the same thing we make much less effort to empathise .
Researchers asked a group of white men to watch film clips of white , black and Asian men picking up a glass of water and drinking .
While the men watched the videos the scientists hooked them up to machines that monitored whether their brains mimicked the action .
The men's brains lit up most when watching someone of their own race .
All the viewers were white but the researchers believe the results would still have been similar with any other group .
Writing in the Journal Experimental Social Psychology , Dr Michael Inzlicht said he believed people are born with a tendency to group others on how like themselves they are .
Dr Inzlicht said the research did not necessarily mean prejudice was innate , adding that discrimination about race , religion or hair colour was ' probably learnt ' .
Every week , Pizza Girl ( Diary of a Pizza Girl ) stops by with insights and a behind - the - scenes look into the world of pizza - delivery drivers .
Take it away , PG !
— The Mgmt .
Lately the future 's been on my mind and particularly that pie - in - the - sky dream I 've had of opening a pizzeria .
I know that reality will be far from my vision , but right now , I 'm having fun coming up with visions , so here 's what I 've got so far ( licensing concerns aside ) :
I have a friend who wants to open up a comic shop .
That 's his dream .
If he won the lottery , he 'd spend it opening up the coziest comic shop that ever existed .
It would be every geek 's heaven .
I want to put my pizzeria right next to it and I thought , just for kicks , I might go with a geek theme .
I 'm thinking that it would start with Pizza Girl , the pizza delivering superhero from Questionable Content , because she 's my favorite superhero and therefore the guardian of the whole place .
Maybe , just for kicks , I 'd even dress up ( or find someone to dress up ) as her every once in a while .
The best part of this fantasy , and the part I 'm really geeking out about , is coming up with my specialty pizzas .
First , my plain pepperoni slice is the Pizza Girl slice .
Obviously my " everything " pizza is Superman , afterall , he has just about every power possible .
Two Face is a half meats , half vegi pizza ; you get to decide which half is the evil half .
Thing has as many boulders of sausage as I can possibly fit on a slice .
For The Human Torch I 'm thinking some sort of really really hot pepper , the kind I have to make you sign a waver for so that you can't hold me liable for the hole this is going to burn in your stomach .
Maybe as an occasional specialty I can put some green food coloring in my dough ( does that even work ? ) and make The Hulk .
Mario would have lots of mushrooms .
I 'm thinking of some sort of desert " pizza " involving Pop Rocks for Starfire .
The possibilities are nearly endless and it's just a matter of time before I get a hold of a pizza oven and start testing out recipes , though right now I 'll have to stick to scoping out the competition and dreaming .
Other awesome things I have yet to even start thinking about : how to make my delivery vehicles geektastic ( Batmobile maybe ? ) , having my menu in both standard and graphic novel format , and what the heck my Green Lantern pizza would be .

Defense juggernaut KBR Inc. was awarded a contract potentially worth $ 2.8 billion for support work in Iraq as U.S. forces continue to leave the country , military authorities said Tuesday .
KBR was notified of the award Friday , a day after the company told shareholders it lost about $ 25 million in award fees because of flawed electrical work in Iraq .
The Houston - based company was charged with maintaining the barracks where Staff Sgt. Ryan Maseth of Pittsburgh , a 24 - year - old Green Beret , was electrocuted in 2008 while showering .
The company has denied wrongdoing , and investigators said in August there was “ insufficient evidence to prove or disprove ” that anyone was criminally culpable in Maseth ’s death .
ADVERTISEMENT
The uproar over his death triggered a review of 17 other electrocution deaths in Iraq and widespread inspections and repairs of electrical work in Iraq , much of it performed by KBR .
Dan Carlson , a spokesman for the Army Sustainment Command in Rock Island , Ill. , said the new contract is for one year , with an option for four more .
KBR will handle logistics support , transportation mission , and postal operations .
KBR has long been the military ’s largest support contractor in Iraq , providing troops with everything from mail and laundry to housing and meals .
The new award was made through a revamped contract structure intended to foster competition among companies .
“ The award demonstrates that the government recognizes KBR ’s ability and expertise in delivering high quality service in challenging contingency environments , ” KBR said in a statement .
Charles Tiefer , a professor of government contracting at the University of Baltimore Law School and a vocal critic of KBR , called the award an “ outrage ” because of the company ’s record in Iraq .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ Giving KBR this contract while denying them award fees for their enormous problem of accidentally electrocuting soldiers amounts to rapping them on the knuckles on one hand while handing them a multibillion dollar deal in the other , ” said Tiefer , who is also a member of the independent Commission on Wartime Contracting .
Last October , the Defense Contract Audit Agency criticized KBR for having more employees in Iraq than were necessary .
The excess , the agency said , was unnecessarily costing U.S. taxpayers .
KBR said it had reduced the size of its work force in Iraq consistent with guidance from U.S. military commanders .
The company also fired back at the audit agency for its “ heavy - handed intrusion ” into the military ’s complex logistics process .

Carlson said Army Sustainment Command is working closely with commanders in Iraq to make sure the contractor work force is properly sized to support drawdown operations in Iraq .

For many NFL prospects , life begins at 40 ( yards ) .
Covering that distance in a scorching time -- as Clemson ’s Jacoby Ford did Sunday at the NFL scouting combine -- can turn the heads of potential employers , just as a slow 40 time can send a player ’s draft stock into a tailspin .
According to an NFL scout who , along with dozens of others , was keeping his own stopwatch on Ford , the 5 - foot - 8 , 182 - pound receiver clocked in at hand times ranging between 4.18 and 4.23 seconds .
The official ( electronic ) combine record is 4.24 , set in 2008 by Chris Johnson , now of the Tennessee Titans .
Ford ’s electronic time posted on NFL.com was 4.28 .
Regardless , he was blistering fast , and that ’s the type of performance that could significantly elevate him in some teams ’ eyes .
Advertisement
Among the other players who performed especially well in drills and physical tests were Oklahoma State quarterback Zac Robinson , who some felt upstaged Cincinnati ’s Tony Pike ( the elite quarterbacks are waiting for their campus pro days to throw ) , and receivers Golden Tate of Notre Dame ; Taylor Price of Ohio University ; Mike Williams of Syracuse ; Damian Williams of USC ; and Carlton Mitchell of South Florida .
Clemson ’s C.J. Spiller appears to have a strong grip on the top spot among running backs , and Fresno State ’s Ryan Matthews is widely regarded the second - best at that position .
The drills Monday and Tuesday , the final two days of the combine , are mostly devoted to evaluating defensive players .
Thankful to be back

USC ’s Stafon Johnson spoke to reporters in his now - husky voice , not much louder than a whisper , and said he one day hopes to be regarded as simply a football player and not as someone who recovered from a near - fatal accident .
His windpipe was crushed in September when the weight he was bench - pressing slipped out of his hands and the bar fell on his neck .
He said working his way to the combine when it initially appeared that his playing days were over “ just shows how bad I love this game , and how much I wanted to get back and prove to everybody that injuries are not always the downfall or the end of what you want to do . ”
He said scouts have asked him about the injury , but only to inquire if he thinks it will affect him as a player , which he does n’t .
Johnson , who scored 19 touchdowns in college , is seen as a short - yardage and goal - line runner who lacks the speed of other prospects in this draft class .
Pro Football
Weekly ranked him as the 14th - best back heading into the combine , and he ’s generally expected to be a mid- or late - round selection .

Possible OT change
The NFL is looking into tweaking its sudden - death overtime format so that a team would not be able to win with a field goal on the opening possession .
If owners approve the plan with a three - quarters vote at meetings in Orlando , Fla. , this month , the format could go into effect for the upcoming postseason .
Under the proposal , first reported by Sports Illustrated ’s Peter King , the club that gets the ball at the start of overtime would win on the opening possession only with a touchdown .
If that team kicks a field goal , the other team would get a possession with a chance to either win with a touchdown or tie with a field goal .
It the score is tied after that , it would be sudden death from that point on .
Advertisement
If neither team scores on its first possession , overtime would continue on a sudden - death basis .
Why would the format initially be in place only for the postseason ?
Because that ’s often the way rule changes happen in the NFL -- on a limited basis at first .
For instance , it used to be that if the kicking team failed to recover an onside kick because the ball did not travel the required 10 yards , that team got a second chance .
A lot of people did n’t think that was fair , but a proposal to scrap that rule was defeated because enough owners thought the onside kick was an exciting , fan - friendly play .
So the league ’s competition committee came back with an amended rule :
If a team attempted an onside kick at any time other than the last five minutes of the fourth quarter , it could have another chance if its first kick did n’t travel 10 yards .
Inside of five minutes , a team got one chance .
That modified rule was voted in .

After the modified rule was in place for a while , the mulligan caveat was eliminated .
That could be the case with an overtime proposal :
It goes in on a limited basis , then -- assuming it ’s a good rule -- eventually becomes the full - time procedure .

Not -So -Daily Link of the Day : Yoshitoshi ABe , the character designer of the Serial Experiments Lain anime and the creator of the Haibane Renmei anime , posted a Monday blog video in which he draws a sketch using just his finger and an app on the new Apple iPad device .
ABe said that he actually received two Wi-Fi-enabled iPads — a 64 - gigabyte version for himself , and a 32 - gigabyte version for fellow artist Yukaly Sasaki — on April 9 after waiting impatiently for customs to process them .
However , he is considering buying the upcoming Wi -Fi/3G version for the GPS location - pinpointing feature .
While he praised the intuitiveness and multiple uses of the iPad , he acknowledged that not everyone needs to have one just yet , compared to more essential items such as a television , a refrigerator , and a mobile phone .
ABe had self - published a dōjinshi manga titled I am an Alien , I have a Question on Amazon 's Kindle e-book store .
ABe tested this dōjinshi on the iPad , and opined that manga , photographs , and similar images look better on the iPad than on Amazon 's own Kindle devices .
He also remarked on how simple it was to buy and read off Marvel Comics ' e-comic app .
Besides I am an Alien , I have a Question , ABe had previously uploaded a 53 - page dōjinshi called Pochiyama at the Pharmacy in 2008 for the Apple iPhone and iPod Touch in 20 countries , including the United States and Canada .
He has since released an iPad version of his 2007 easy drawings dōjinshi .

So much for his " resurrection " in 2010 .
Systems that are inflexible and thus incapable of positive change do one of two things .
They collapse like Rome or the USSR or have revolutions like Bourbon France or Tsarist Russia .
For a system to reform , there must be viable political alternatives and such options must get an intelligent hearing in the media .
The US political system has reduced the political spectrum to a fraction – the centre - right / far - right .
All other views are marginalized , have no media access and no hope of gaining seats in Congress .
The extra -parliamentary option is also restricted by repression .
The time - dishonored tradition is to use the courts to persecute radicals , the secret police to disrupt organizations , and when all else fails , vigilante terror .
While ideologically rooted in reactionary European ideologues like Mises and Hayek , neoliberalism is really an American product .
They have exported the US " narrow spectrum democracy " to the rest of the world .
Labour and the Conservatives are now political Bobsey Twins .
French , Spanish , German Social democracy embraced neoliberal policies , opting for being the " kinder face " of corporatist inhumanity .
Here in Canada , there is constant pressure from self - styled pundits that the NDP has to jetison its " old fashioned " relationship with labour and what little remains of its traditional social democracy should be tossed in the ash can .
The parliamentary systems , unlike the US form of government , are not fully closed systems .
New parties can gain seats and thus influence policy .
Opposition is not considered treason and opposition parties have an important role to play .
Nor is the media always so subservient , nor do Europeans and Canadians have to worry about " night riders . "
But this does not mean that countries with greater political flexibility are off the hook .
As mentioned in my previous article " Restoring Our Social Democratic Past " , what has to be changed just to get us back to a 1970 's quality of life – let alone something better - is almost impossible to do outside of having a revolution .
And this is n't half of it .
As before mentioned , I was only referring to the 1970's and not the enormous Triple Crises we now face .
Dealing effectively with the global economic crisis , peak oil , and climate change seem way beyond the capacity of any present party or government , or for that matter , any party or government in the foreseeable future .
Such an obvious thing as peak oil , parties and states should be preparing us for a life with a lot less petroleum dependency , but in fact they are doing nothing .
They can't , since they are beholden to auto / petroleum / agribusiness interests .
But if Canada and Europe are boxed in by the brutal legacies of neoliberalism and the Triple Crises , all the more so , the USA .
The Americans have these problems plus a political system that will allow no attempts at rectification .
Will the US go the way of the USSR ?
Federal prosecutors are conducting a criminal investigation into whether Goldman Sachs Group Inc. or its employees committed securities fraud in connection with its mortgage trading , people familiar with the probe say .

What a strange weekend it has been for Santonio Holmes .
Yesterday , we reported that Holmes is facing a four - game suspension under the substance abuse policy .
Tonight , we ’re told that the Steelers have traded Holmes to the New York Jets .
It ’s the second time in less than a year that the Jets have swung a deal for a former first - round receiver .
Last October , they acquired Braylon Edwards from the Browns .
Like Holmes , Edwards also is facing a possible suspension , after pleading no contest to an assault that occurred only days before he was traded .
Also , both players are signed through 2010 .
Suddenly , HBO ’s Hard Knocks got a lot more interesting .
UPDATE : Peter King of SI.com and NBC confirms that it ’s a done deal .
Bart Hubbuch of the New York Post reports that the Jets gave up a fifth - round draft pick for Holmes , who was the MVP of Super Bowl XLIII .
A fifth - round draft pick for a former Super Bowl MVP .
Many of the researchers caught up in the " climategate " saga have spent years in the firing line of sceptics .
And they have felt the heat .
In late 2006 , I interviewed a number of them for an article in New Scientist magazine , which focused on how the propaganda war was shaping up prior to the publication of the next Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) assessment the following year .
Kevin Trenberth had suffered abuse for publicly linking global warming to the exceptional 2005 Atlantic hurricane season , which culminated in hurricane Katrina .
He told me : " The attacks on me are clearly designed to get me fired or to resign . "
Ben Santer of the Lawrence Livermore laboratory in California , and formerly of the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia , was attacked for his role in writing the 1995 IPCC report , which claimed to see the hand of man in climate change .
He said : " There is a strategy to single out individuals , tarnish them and try to bring the whole of science into disrepute . "
Prof Mike Mann of Pennsylvania State University , fresh from his battle over the hockey stick in 2001 , said : " There is an orchestrated campaign against the IPCC . "
Funding trails to some of the more prominent sceptics also emerged at that time .
Steve McIntyre , who runs the influential sceptic blog Climate Audit was free of financial conflicts of interest , but it emerged that prominent sceptic Patrick Michaels received hundreds of thousands of dollars in " consultancy " fees from the Intermountain Rural Electric Association , a coal - burning electric company based in Colorado .
A leaked letter from the company 's general manager , Stanley Lewandowski , said : " We believe it is necessary to support the scientific community that is willing to stand up against the alarmists . "
The funding of climate sceptics has a long and probably ongoing history .
In 1998 , I revealed in the Guardian leaked documents showing that the powerful American Petroleum Institute ( API ) was planning to recruit a team of " independent scientists " to do battle against climatologists on global warming .
The aim was to bolster a campaign to prevent the US government ratifying the Kyoto protocol .
The API 's eight - page Global Climate Science Communications Plan said it aimed to change the US political climate so that " those promoting the Kyoto treaty on the basis of extant science appear to be out of touch with reality " .
The leaked document said : " If we can show that science does not support the Kyoto treaty … this puts the US in a stronger moral position and frees its negotiators from the need to make concessions as a defence against perceived selfish economic concerns . "
Its first task was to " identify , recruit and train a team of five independent scientists to participate in media outreach " .
It is not clear if the plan went ahead , but the policy objective was achieved .

More thoughts on Conspiracies
The Illuminati Agenda Today we realize that the Illuminati exerts almost 100 % control over all three branches of the American government and the few remaining congressional defenders of America can be counted on one hand as the intense public vilification and disparagement recently directed at McKinney of Georgia will bear witness to .
It 's too late in the game now to expect any patriot remaining within government service to rescue us from the brutal destruction that lies ahead , but the American people can save themselves from these satanic destroyers of liberty & life through NON - COOPERATION and NON - COMPLIANCE .
The Most Powerful Man In The World ?
So , you thought you were pretty well informed by now about all of the main players on the " conspiracy " playing field ?
You�ve maybe been hearing for years about ( or bumped into on your own ) the various elements of society who control our world from behind the scenes .
Secret Organizations and Hidden Agendas
Now lets put theory behind us and get back into some real history .
From the minutes of the Carnegie Endowment , we recall the curious words :  We must control education in America . 
Who is this we ?
Who are the people who are planning to do that ?
To answer that question we must set the co-ordinates on our machine once again , and we are now moving further back in time to the year 1870 .
We find ourselves suddenly in England in an elegant classroom of Oxford University , and we are listing to a lecture by a brilliant intellectual , John Ruskin .
The Chasm Are we doomed to repeat history in the war on terrorism ?
If we continue to follow the circular path we are now taking , I believe that we are .
But to find out if that is true , we need to go back in time .
So , I invite you to join me , now , in my time machine .
We are going to splash around in history for a while and look at some great events and huge mistakes to see if there are parallels , any lessons to be learned for today .
I must warn you : it will seem that we are lost in time .
We are going to go here and there , and then jump back further , and then forward in time , and we will be examining issues that may make you wonder  What on earth has this to do with today ? 
But I can assure you , when we reach the end of our journey , you will see that everything we cover has a direct relevance to today and , in particular , to the war on terrorism .
The Iron Mountain report
For those of you that remember the sixties , this may be a revisit .
For those of you who do n't , it may be a unique opportunity to consider the prophetic nature of a document written twenty - eight years ago .
The book became a New York Times Best Seller .
The conclusions arrived at by the " think - tank " are , at the very least , disturbing .
John F. Kennedy vs The Federal Reserve On June 4 , 1963 , a virtually unknown Presidential decree , Executive Order 11110 , was signed with the authority to basically strip the Federal Reserve Bank of its power to loan money to the United States Federal Government at interest .
With the stroke of a pen , President Kennedy declared that the privately owned Federal Reserve Bank would soon be out of business .

If you are looking for a site that indexes the less known , older & rarer movies do n't hesitate to try this one out .
I hasten to reflect on the past a little here by pointing out that I mentioned some time ago that the speed with which your site opens ( site speed ) is measured and can affect your rankings by Google .
Well today I get to say what my best friend irritatingly says to me all the time – “ I told you so ! ”
Site Speed Importance
I have included some links below to quote some noted urgent references which confirm my above statement about site opening speed and it ’s relevance to rankings .
Here ’s a highly relevant piece by Amit Singhal , Google Fellow and Matt Cutts at the webmaster central .
Here ’s another reference directly from Matt Cutts ( Google ) blog .
What can you learn from this and what can you do about it ?
There are already complaints about the fairness of this speed index but I hasten to point out that the customer will always reign supreme .
If the customer is enjoying themselves surfing or searching the web with sites opening quickly and churning pages quickly , what happens when they come a cross a slow poke website ?
Disappointment !
That ’s what .
The tendancy is ( in general ) to get away from this ( slow ) site because it ’s frustrating and could keep me waiting more and more when I could easily find another site that works faster .
You will see in one of the references that content is still more valuable than site speed but it all adds up .
Remember that !
If you are in position ten on the first page of Google and your site is slow , there may well be twenty other sites who are much faster with just marginal ranking differences keeping them below your site .
Get a fast host sooner rather than later .
If you have to pay a few extra dollars a month , it ’s going to be well worth it .
Should I dare mention that worn out cliche ‘ you get what you pay for ? ’
Well here ’s one person who ’s learned that the cliche reflects what is more often the case .
That said , I have included a couple of hosting sites below I ’ve had good experiences with .
I ’ve separated them based on the category in which I use them .
I ’ve also cleverly disguised my affiliate links so you would n’t think I was just a normal person trying to make a living from this exceptional post . 🙂
More seriously though .
These are hosting services I use and that ’s why they ’re on this page for you to check out .
I have been down the road of horrible hosting too and that really sucks .
Fast hosting services I use
1 . My best all round experience with what I refer to as a general hosting service with great speed and equally important , reliability for the dollar you pay is this one .
They also have an SEO hosting service ( uses C class servers ) but you ’ll need to hunt around on their site to find it .
2 . This one has a good reputation and is unusually effective with wordpress AND it is probably one of the easiest hosts to use no matter what level you ’re at .
3 . My favourite .
At the time of writing this host is like the new kid on the block but Oh boy … they really know their stuff !
This is a really special service and can be useful if you get or expect bursts of traffic or you simply want a smoother operation , speed with flexibility .
I ’m in the process of sending more of my sites here as I type this because I am so impressed with this mob .
* Reliability in this post refers to up - time .
Here ’s an old video where I provide few ( very basic ) tips on website traffic but it also mentions the importance of site speed .
You can play air guitar while you watch and tap your feet a bit … 🙂
Anyway , I hope you can see the light with this article .
Site speed IS important .

How many games does a football team play in a season ?
And how many of those do the big premiership teams win ?
If they win more than they lose conisistanty then you can bet over a season rather than just on the odd game and be pretty sure of ending up gaining .

USA to Get 16 Gigawatts of Renewable Energy from the Recovery Act
February 24th , 2010 by Susan Kraemer
By the end of last year , nine months after passage of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act ( ARRA ) , $ 263 billion had been disbursed of the $ 787 billion available .
[ social_buttons ]
While Fox News disagrees , independent economists do agree that 1.5 million to 2 million people are now working as a result of stimulus funds disbursed to businesses and city , county and state governments so far , but the bulk of ARRA funds will be disbursed in 2010 .
What is less discussed , but important , is : just how much green energy are we getting for our green ?
When all spent – we will have added 16,000 MW ( that ’s 16 Gigawatts ! ) of clean energy to the grid .
To grow the clean energy economy – $ 90 billion was set aside , with one third being disbursed by the end of 2009 .
Of that total , $ 60 billion will be in direct spending and $ 29.5 billion ii tax incentives to build renewable energy .
How that is allocated is in this graph :
The previously near - moribund Department of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy had to ramp up its approval process to deal with this sudden funding ; with enough new hires to speed up the technology review process .
The remaining $ 60 billion for clean energy and efficiency should be out in the economy by this September .
What will we get for this historic investment in clean , safe , permanent renewable energy ?
Once spent , the funds set aside for renewable energy will have bought us 16,000 megawatts of wind , solar , geothermal , and other renewable energy capacity propelled by the stimulus .
That is enough to permanently take 4 to 5 million homes 100 % off the dirty grid .
Not just for a week .
Forever .
This use of the stimulus funding is a good investment for America .
Not only will it make energy cleaner , but in the long run , it makes energy cheaper ( and healthier ) for all of us .

IS THE most powerful and controversial firm on Wall Street about to get the comeuppance that so many think it deserves ?
On Friday April 16th America 's Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) filed civil charges against Goldman Sachs and one of its vice - presidents , Fabrice Tourre , for allegedly defrauding investors by failing to disclose vital information about a financial product linked to subprime mortgages , as America 's housing market was starting to wobble .
Goldman 's shares tumbled , dragging down stockmarkets .
The instrument in question , structured and marketed by Goldman , was a synthetic collateralised debt obligation ( CDO ) , whose performance was tied to that of residential mortgage - backed securities .
Goldman told its investors , who included some European banks , that the securities bundled together to form the CDO had been selected by an independent third party , ACA Management .
The SEC alleges that the investment bank failed to disclose that another firm , Paulson & Co , a big hedge - fund manager , had in fact had a hand in choosing what went into the CDO .
This was a crucial omission , since Paulson & Co—run by John Paulson , who made billions in 2007 - 08 betting against the housing market — had taken a short position against the CDO ; in other words , his firm would profit if the instrument performed poorly .
“ The product was new and complex but the deception and conflicts are old and simple , ” said Robert Khuzami , head of the SEC 's enforcement division .
Goldman called the charges “ completely unfounded ” and said it would contest them vigorously .
Paulson &
Co has not been charged ; the firm issued a statement saying that ACA , as the third - party collateral manager , had sole authority over the selection of securities in the CDO .
In a more detailed response issued later , Goldman said it had itself lost money on the transaction and insisted that extensive information about the portfolio had been provided to the buyers , who were sophisticated investors aware of the risks .
The SEC says Paulson had an incentive to select mortgage securities that would bomb
According to the complaint , Paulson shorted the portfolio it helped to select by purchasing protection against the default of certain layers through credit - default swaps ( CDSs ) it entered into with Goldman .
The SEC argues that these derivatives gave the hedge fund an incentive to select mortgage securities that would bomb .
And bomb they did .
The deal closed in April 2007 ; by the end of January 2008 , 99 % of the portfolio had been downgraded by credit - rating agencies .
Mr Tourre was responsible for the CDO , known as ABACUS .
He is alleged not only to have known about Paulson 's undisclosed short position , but also to have misled ACA into believing that Paulson & Co had ploughed around $ 200 m into the equity of the CDO .
The charges could hardly come at a worse time for Goldman .
The firm has been under fire on a number of fronts , including over the handsome payout it secured from the New York Fed as a derivatives counterparty of American International Group , an insurer that almost failed in 2008 .
In a string of negative articles over the past year , Goldman has been accused of everything from double - dealing for its own advantage to planting its own people in the Treasury and other agencies to ensure that its interests were looked after .
One profile memorably likened the firm to a “ great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity , relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money . ”
Goldman has continued to insist that it fared better than most of its rivals because of smart risk management , not because of any conflicts or duplicity .
Its boss , Lloyd Blankfein , launched a vigorous defence of the firm 's practices in his recently published letter to shareholders .
The charge against Goldman will unleash waves of Schadenfreude
But this week 's hammer - blow will unleash waves of Schadenfreude .
Sceptics will say it confirms their suspicions that , for all the talk of helping its customers ( Mr Blankfein used the words “ client ” or “ clients ” 56 times in his letter ) , Goldman puts its own interests , and those of favoured trading partners , first .
The SEC 's move “ marks an escalation in the battle to expose conflicts of interest on Wall Street ” and exposes a “ cynical , savage culture ” that allows dealers to deceive one customer to benefit another , said Christopher Whalen of Institutional Risk Analytics .
The charges also have implications for financial regulation .
American senators are caught up in a heated debate over a wide - ranging reform bill , a key part of which covers over - the - counter derivatives , especially CDSs , which many see as having exacerbated the crisis .
The head of the Senate 's powerful agriculture committee has proposed that large banks be forced to spin off their derivatives - trading units .
Goldman 's problems could make it more difficult to see off such draconian measures .
The cost of any penalties to Goldman , if found guilty , is likely to be in the tens , possibly hundreds , of millions .
The SEC is seeking the return of any ill - gotten gains plus a penalty .
Investors in the CDOs are said to have lost more than $ 1 billion .
But the damage could be much greater , if the affair shatters Goldman 's fragile reputation , weakened as it has been by all the negative publicity of recent months .
In a sign of how seriously the market views the civil charges , Goldman 's shares were down by more than 15 % at one point on Friday .
Its rivals should not feel too smug .
The SEC has been working hard to beef up enforcement .
The case is the first to be brought by its new structured - products group .
It will not be the last .
On a call with reporters , Mr Khuzami said the team was looking at other instruments , some of them no doubt structured by other firms .
Goldman 's rivals have long been envious of its prowess .
Some of them may soon be empathising with its plight .
Well , I 've made a few Garlasco jokes lately , and , speak of the Devil , here 's a very good article in Times Online all about Garlasco and the controversy now surrounding Human Rights Watch and its priorities : Nazi scandal engulfs Human Rights Watch .
The Garlasco thing is interesting , and important , but what 's interesting is HRW itself :
... In June 2006 , Garlasco had alleged that an explosion on a Gaza beach that killed seven people had been caused by Israeli shelling .
However , after seeing the details of an Israeli army investigation that closely examined the relevant ballistics and blast patterns , he subsequently told the Jerusalem Post that he had been wrong and that the deaths were probably caused by an unexploded munition in the sand .
But this went down badly at Human Rights Watch HQ in New York , and the admission was retracted by an HRW press release the next day .
Since the Garlasco affair blew up , critics of Human Rights Watch have raised questions about other appointments .
An Israeli newspaper revealed that Joe Stork , the deputy head of HRW 's Middle East department , was a radical leftist who put out a magazine in the 1970s that praised the murder of Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics .
In 1976 he attended an anti-Zionist conference in Baghdad hosted by the Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein .
As Kenneth Roth pointed out to me , this was all three decades ago , Stork was just one of seven editors of the magazine when its editorial praised the massacre , and he later became a staunch critic of Saddam Hussein .
Certainly , he no longer spices up reports with talk of " revolutionary potential of the Palestinian masses . "
That said , when Stork was hired by HRW in 1996 he had never worked for a human - rights group , had never held an academic position , and had a history of anti-Israel activism ... [ Much more . ]
Giving credit where credit is due , Laurie Carr of Beyond the Blueshirts did a fantastic job unraveling this story , having to " decode " a Russian article that has some details on the New York Rangers off - season plans .
So remember the entire Nikolai Zherdev saga that dragged out until late July , early August last summer ?
When the Blueshirts elected to walk away from the enigmatic winger 's rights , as fans , we all felt that it was the end of " Nikki Z's " tenure here in New York .
However , what you are about to read from Laurie suggests otherwise , and possibly implies that we may be hearing more and more of Zherdev 's name as we approach the 2010 - 11 season .
So before I present a portion of Laurie 's story to you , allow me to set the stage .
The Rangers faced the New Jersey Devils a little over a week ago in Newark , New Jersey at the Prudential Center .
At the time of the game , newly appointed Team Russia assistant coach Andrei Nazarov was also in Newark .
Rangers General Manager Glen Sather reportedly met with Nazarov , and on that note , I pass you on to Laurie , below .
In an interview in Sport Express , published Monday , Nazarov revealed that New York Rangers President and General Manager Glen Sather asked him for his opinion on three players from the KHL which he claims the Rangers are interested in .
" After the game in Newark I had a long conversation with the President of the Rangers , founder of the Edmonton dynasty of the 1980s , Glen Sather , " Nazarov shared .
" He asked my expert opinion on three hockey players from the KHL which the Rangers seek to acquire . "
Prompted to reveal the identities of those players , Nazarov refused .
" I ’m sorry , but Sather insisted that I keep their names secret , " the veteran of 571 NHL games and current coach of KHL club Traktor Chelyabinsk replied .
The Rangers do have three prospects who ’s rights they currently own playing in the KHL — Ivan Baranka , Pavel Valentenko and Mikhail Pashnin — but Nazarov ’s comment seems to suggest the players in question are players who ’s rights the Rangers do not yet own .
The article ’s author , Igor Larin , fuels speculation by including the the following ( unsourced ) note after Nazarov ’s comment : " According to some reports , the president of the Rangers is interested in Nikolai Zherdev from Atlant . "
More after the jump .
At the conclusion of the last season , the Rangers offered a 1 - year / $ 3.2 million contract to Zherdev , which his agent and he argued was not as much as they felt Zherdev should be valued at .
They were seeking something in the $ 4 million range , and after arbitration , the arbitrator settled about in the middle at $ 3.9 million .
Much to the surprise of many , the Blueshirts walked away and moved on .
In 82 games played with the Rangers last season , Zherdev recorded 23 goals and 35 assists for 58 points .
Let 's be honest here , those were decent stats and had Nikolai near the top of the scoresheet for the season .
However , the price he was seeking was far too expensive for what he brings , and as we know , the Rangers have far too many of those contracts already .
My standpoint on the situation at the time , and still now , was that Sather should have agreed to the terms granted at arbitration , and then did his best to trade Nik and get a return .
There were several teams that were supposedly interested in Zherdev , so the Rangers likely would have had options .
However , they chose to go down a different road and just move on .
We shall see what comes of this .
The Rangers did not want any part of Zherdev if he was to be paid more than what they wanted , and I think if Zherdev does attempt to return to the National Hockey League like several reports have claimed , he will be looking for something around $ 3.5 million .
In my opinion , this shipped has sailed , and the Blueshirts should not put themselves through what they did last summer with Nikolai Zherdev .

Those same people also make smart decisions without transparency  smart for them , if not the country .
Even if the reform bill does bring stringent regulation to derivatives  a big if  that wo n’t rectify capitalism ’s worst “ innovation ” in our own Gilded Age : the advent of exotic , speculative “ investments ” that have no redeeming social value and are instead concocted to facilitate gambling for its own sake .
Such are the Goldman instruments of mass financial destruction that paid off for John Paulson .
In 2007 alone , according to Gregory Zuckerman in his book “ The Greatest Trade Ever , ” Paulson ’s personal take amounted to over $ 10 million a day , “ more than the earnings of J. K. Rowling , Oprah Winfrey and Tiger Woods put together . ”
That “ financial alchemy , ” as Zuckerman calls it , explains why the finance sector ’s share of domestic corporate profits , never higher than 16 percent until 1986 , hit 41 percent in the last decade .

As many have said  though not many politicians in either party  something is fundamentally amiss in a financial culture that thrives on “ products ” that create nothing and produce nothing except new ways to make bigger bets and stack the deck in favor of the house .
“ At least in an actual casino , the damage is contained to gamblers , ” wrote the financial journalist Roger Lowenstein in The Times Magazine last month .
This catastrophe cost the economy eight million jobs .
Lowenstein argued for a transfer tax on financial trading , a reform that has found favor with Britain ’s prime minister , Gordon Brown , if not our own Treasury secretary , Timothy Geithner .
Equally compelling is the notion articulated by Ryan Avent , a blogger at The Economist , that “ public anger ” and “ hooting derision ” be increased to shame Wall Street into changing its ethos .
This assumes , of course , that there is any capacity for shame .
Perhaps the most productive tactic comes from Ted Kaufman , Democrat of Delaware , who is using his lame - duck residence in the Senate ( as the appointee to Joe Biden ’s old seat ) to demand that we root out the “ fraud and potential criminal conduct ” that “ were at the heart of the financial crisis . ”
To achieve this overdue reckoning will require action  by the S.E.C. , the Justice Department and any other legal authority that wants to get into the act .
That no one at Lehman Brothers has yet been held liable for its Enronesque bookkeeping deceit is appalling .
That we still have n’t seen the e-mail and documents that would illuminate A.I.G. ’s machinations with Goldman and the rest of its counterparties amounts to a cover-up .
That investigative journalists have consistently been way ahead of the authorities , the S.E.C. included , in uncovering Wall Street ’s foul play is a scandal .
If this culture remains in place , the whole crisis will have gone to waste .
As a reminder of the unchastened status quo , Blankfein remains the gift that keeps on giving .
On Thursday , The Financial Times reported that he had been calling clients to argue that the S.E.C. case against Goldman would ultimately “ hurt America . ”
The opposing point of view was presented by Ira Glass on his radio show “ This American Life ” this month .
With reporters from the nonprofit journalistic organization ProPublica , it told the story of another hedge fund , Magnetar , that gamed the housing bubble .
Bankers who worked on Magnetar deals walked away with their huge bonuses well before disaster struck  or , as the program put it , “ bankers made money even when they were buying things that eventually blew up the bank . ”
Not to mention the economy .
And it was all legal .
To award the audience a bonus , “ This American Life ” concluded with a Broadway song commissioned from a co- author of the satirical musical “ Avenue Q. ” Titled “ Bet Against the American Dream , ” it distills a complex financial saga to its essence :
Those who shorted the housing market shorted the country .
Go online , listen to it and laugh .
But the fact remains that those who truly hurt America are laughing harder still , all the way to the bank .

Ten 's comedy show Good News
Week had overstepped the boundaries of humour according to the Federal Government , after it made continued jokes about autistic children on last night 's program .
Federal parliamentary secretary for disabilities Bill Shorten has slammed the producers of the show , claiming he was bombarded with calls from upset families after it went to air .
" I 've got a good sense of humour but I fail to see the funny side of making people feel terrible , " he told The Daily Telegraph .
" Kids with autism and their parents ' battle prejudice every day .
Now I 'm not in the political correctness brigade but there have been many parents that have rung me and are upset .
" Humiliating kids who are vulnerable is not humour . "
Click to see the clip that caused most outrage and have your say below
The attempt at humour came initially from the show 's guest , UK comedian Russell Kane , who appears to trademark his comedy routine by attacking people with autism .
He was boasting about how his team beat the show 's host Paul McDermott 's team in the great comedy debate .
He later tried to mimic an autistic person .
" We went at you like an autistic kid on a drumwe destroyed you , " said Mr Kane , to a muted response from the audience .
Mr McDermott replied : " You can see that they do n't like autism humour here . "
Later in the program another of the show 's alleged funny men Mikey Robbins also made reference to autism .
NSW mother of six Candy Jubb , who has three children with autism , said she was a regular watcher of the program but was appalled at the comments .
" I was pretty disgusted with it , " she said .
" I watch that show a lot and I was very disappointed .
I did a bit of research and found that Russel Kane uses autistic jokes a lot . "
" We are sorry for any offence the autistic comment may have caused but felt Good News Week host Paul McDermott 's immediate comment of ' you can see they do n't like autistic humour here ' made it clear it was a step too far , " said a Network Ten spokesperson .
" TEN is a strong supporter of autism awareness .
We are currently supporting the Alpha Autism campaign and we intend to increase our Community Service Announcement commitment for the AEIOU Foundation .
" We are also looking at opportunities to increase awareness of issues surrounding autism through our regular programming line - up and will include a link on The Good News
Week website for viewers who would like to get involved with an autism support organisation .
Anthony Perl , the head of autism support group Aspect NSW , said the joke was unfortunate considering April was Autism Awareness month .
Mr Shorten invited the show 's hosts to meet with families of children with autism so they could be educated as to what the reality of life is like for them and their parents .

Scientists at the University of Delaware have developed a new method for producing proteins critical to research on cancer , Alzheimer 's , and other diseases .
Developed by Zhihao Zhuang , UD assistant professor of chemistry and biochemistry , and his research group , the chemical method yields hundredsfold more ubiquitylated proteins than current approaches .
Such proteins may hold the key to revealing such mysteries as how cancer cells gain resistance to cancer drugs .
The advance is reported in the April issue of Nature Chemical Biology , the leading journal in the field of chemical biology .
Zhuang 's co-authors include graduate students Junjun Chen and Jialiang Wang and postdoctoral fellow Yongxing Ai , all from UD , and Lajos Haracska , a researcher in the Institute of Genetics at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences .
Ubiquitin is a small protein , the basis of Nobel Prize - winning research in 2004 , which deemed the molecule the " kiss of death " for its role in tagging damaged or unneeded proteins for the cell 's waste disposal in the constant process of protein generation and degradation .
In recent years , the non-proteolytic functions of ubiquitin in diverse cellular processes , including protein trafficking , immune response , and DNA damage tolerance , have been discovered at a rapid pace , and it has become clear that ubiquitin plays far - broader roles in cell biology .
However , preparing sufficient samples of ubiquitylated proteins for study has been a major challenge facing scientists .
The availability of these proteins is critical for Zhuang and members of his research team , who are working at the interface of chemistry and biology trying to understand the molecular basis of human cancer development and prevention .

The new method for developing ubiquitylated proteins , which Zhuang and his team developed , combines the power of intein chemistry and disulfide crosslinking to bond ubiquitin to another essential protein called proliferating cell nuclear antigen .
" Our yield is hundredsfold higher compared to the commonly used enzymatic approach , " Zhuang says .
" We also have the flexibility of modifying the selected residues , which has not been possible with the previous approach . "
In investigating the effect of the differently modified proteins , Zhuang and his group also revealed a surprising phenomenon regarding ubiquitylation .
" We found that ubiquitin as a protein modifier is far more flexible than we have thought .
This property distinguishes ubiquitylation from other better studied protein post - translational modifications , such as phosphorylation and acetylation , " Zhuang says .
The new UD approach will help researchers studying ubiquitin biology by providing the means to prepare milligrams of protein samples for in - depth structural and functional characterization .
SInce the publication of the work online in Nature Chemical Biology , Zhuang has received requests for samples from research groups across the United States .
Additionally , the new approach has already opened up doors to new research in Zhuang 's own laboratory , where he and his team are investigating new anti-cancer therapies .
The research on the new method was supported by Zhuang 's laboratory start - up funding from UD , as well as a recent grant from the University of Delaware Research Foundation ( UDRF ) .
HUNDREDS of harmless historic RSL displays , containing rifles , machineguns and cannons , may have to be removed from public view because they are unlicensed .
The red tape farce , which will hit clubs throughout Queensland , was triggered in Cooktown in the far north where police last week confiscated two guns – including a replica firearm made entirely of wood .
Cooktown RSL members have lashed out at the crackdown that requires them to prove the guns are inactive following a complaint from a local pacifist who felt the weapons promoted war and violence .
RSL Queensland chief executive Chris McHugh yesterday admitted an unknown quantity of weapons on display in more than 80 clubs across the state would have to be taken down if found to be unlicensed .
A law introduced after the Port Arthur massacre in 1996 requires weapons made after 1900 to be proved inactive and registered with the Queensland Police Weapons Licensing Branch , with gun barrels required to be welded shut .
" While we do n't have any problems with the law introduced after the Port Arthur massacre , it has always caused us some grief and hassle and we would hope it would be applied with some common sense , " Mr McHugh said .
" We 'll be sending out reminders to all clubs about their obligations .
It is a massive amount of paperwork . "
A wooden replica of a Vickers machinegun and a rusted World War II machinegun , had been displayed on the roof of two RSL buildings in Cooktown 's main street for more than a year but are now being held in the police station until licences are processed .
Despite being rusted through after spending 30 years in a Cape York rainforest , the World War II machinegun must be licensed to prove it is inactive .
The wooden replica requires a separate licence because of its likeness to the real thing .
Cooktown RSL sub - branch secretary Jim Fay was stunned when told he had to dismantle the guns and hand them in to police .
The club is fighting to get them back on display and has installed a plastic water gun in place of the confiscated weapons until they 're returned .
" They are going to have to go around Australia and check every gun in every RSL , because I 'm pretty certain we 're not the only ones in this crazy situation , " he said .
The confiscated weapons are classified as Category R , which includes fully automatic machine and submachineguns and any replica or facsimile of a machine or sub - machinegun that is not a toy .
Mr McHugh was disappointed by the petty nature of the complaint that led to the guns being removed , saying they had become a landmark .
" Over 100,000 Australians died at war fighting for the rights this whinger enjoys today , " he said .
" The RSL and sub - branch does enormous work in the local community and we 're disappointed someone would be so petty to say it glorifies war . "
The Cooktown woman who lodged the complained told The Sunday Mail she was proud of the efforts of Australian soldiers but was disgusted at displaying " killing machines " .
The woman asked not to be named for fear she would be targeted by those opposed to her pacifist views .
" My grandfather was a World War I digger and he came back a shattered man , so I do n't think he would have approved at all of the public display of these killing machines , " she said .
All guns on display at Norths Leagues and Services Club at Kallangur are licensed , but treasurer Shaun Smith can understand why clubs may not have appropriate licences .
" If a gun is made of wood and it 's been on display for ages it 's a bit of a joke to make them take it down to get a licence , " he said .
" All the weapons we have on display are certified as inactive . . . but it 's understandable that there are examples across the state where things have n't been done so thoroughly . "

THE recently reopened Louis Vuitton store on the Champs Elysées is a deliberate exercise in democratic luxury .
On its new , opulent art deco terraces , elegant French ladies of a certain age — the epitome of the traditional consumer of luxury fashion — rub padded shoulders with jeans - and - tee - shirt sporting younger women who could be their daughters , or , just as easily , rap singers or a gaggle of British working - class hen - weekenders .
What traditional buyers of luxury make of their nouveau co-consumers they are , of course , too civilised to say .
But it seems unlikely that they consider Louis Vuitton 's still - exquisite handbags , shoes and other indulgences to be quite as exclusive as before .
If they continue to shop there — and the store 's owner , LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton , thinks it can extend its brand to a broader market without losing its existing customers — it may no longer be because its products are a signal of exalted social status .
In this respect , LVMH 's goods are by no means unique .
Products and services that were once the preserve of a very wealthy few — from designer handbags to fast cars , bespoke tailoring and domestic servants — are increasingly becoming accessible , if not to everyone , then certainly to millions of people around the world .
This may appall killjoy economists such as Robert Frank , the author a few years ago of a book condemning “ Luxury Fever ” in this new “ era of excess ” .
But it is arguably even more upsetting to those super - rich folk who have long been able to afford luxury , and may in one crucial respect even regard it as a necessity .
As Thorstein Veblen noted over a century ago in “ The Theory of the Leisure Class ” — the book in which he coined the phrase “ conspicuous consumption ” — spending lavishly on expensive but essentially wasteful goods and services is “ evidence of wealth ” and the “ failure to consume in due quantity and quality becomes a mark of inferiority and demerit . ”
But in the 21st century , “ being a conspicuous consumer is getting harder and harder ” , says James Lawson of Ledbury Research , a firm that advises luxury businesses on market trends .
What does a billionaire have to do to get noticed nowadays ?
Luxury for the people
A stone 's throw from the Louis Vuitton store , the classical grandeur of the five - star Four Seasons George V hotel was the perfect Old World venue for the World Luxury Congress in October .
But all the talk at the gathering was of the potentially lucrative opportunities presented by new consumers of luxury , in rich and emerging economies alike .
Being a millionaire , for instance , is becoming commonplace .
In 2004 there were 8.3 m households worldwide with assets of at least $ 1 m , up by 7 % on a year earlier , according to the latest annual survey by Merrill Lynch and Capgemini .
The newly wealthy are often desperate to affirm their status by conspicuously consuming the favoured brands of the already rich .
In developed countries this can be seen , in its extreme form , in the rise of “ Bling ” — jewellery , diamonds and other luxuries sported initially by rappers — and Britain 's unsophisticated Burberry - loving “ chavs ” .
( Burberry is considered unusually successful at tapping a broader market .
But even it now understands that not every new customer is desirable : in January it withdrew its distinctive checked baseball caps because of their popularity with chavs . )
The number of luxury buyers in the developed world is also being swelled by two other trends .
First , consumers are increasingly adopting a “ trading up , trading down ” shopping strategy .
Many traditional mid-market shoppers are abandoning middle - of - the - range products for a mix of lots of extremely cheap goods and a few genuine luxuries that they would once have thought out of their price league .
Alongside this “ selective extravagance ” is the growth of “ fractional ownership ” : time - shares in luxury goods and services formerly available only to those paying full price .
Fractional ownership first got noticed when firms such as NetJets started selling access to private jets .
It has since spread to luxury resorts , fast cars and much more .
In America , From Bags to Riches — “ better bags , better value ” — lets less - well - off people rent designer handbags .
In Britain , Damon Hill , a former racing driver , has launched P1 International .
A £ 2,500 ( $ 4,300 ) joining fee , plus annual membership of £ 13,750 , buys around 50 - 70 driving days a year in cars ranging from a Range Rover Sport to a Bentley or a Ferrari .
AIM
As a result , “ the price of entry for much of what traditionally was available to the top 0.001 % is now far lower ” , says Mr Lawson , who notes the sorry implications for a would - be conspicuous consumer : “ How do I know if the guy who drives past me in a Ferrari owns it or is just renting it for the weekend ? ”
Demand for luxury is also soaring from emerging economies such as Russia , India , Brazil and China .
Antoine Colonna , an analyst at Merrill Lynch , estimates that last year Chinese consumers already accounted for 11 % of the worldwide revenues of luxury - goods firms , with most of their buying done outside mainland China .
He forecasts that by 2014 , they will have overtaken both American and Japanese consumers , becoming the world 's leading luxury shoppers , yielding 24 % of global revenues .
These emerging consumers have a big appetite for the top luxury brands — and the owners of those brands are increasingly keen to oblige .
Russia is producing today 's most determinedly conspicuous consumers .
Roman Abramovich , the best - known oligarch not in jail , has conspicuously set new standards in buying mansions , ski resorts and soccer teams .
Veblen revisited
For the already rich , strategies such as splashing out on ever bigger houses , longer yachts or getting special treatment from luxury - goods firms does not contribute much marginal conspicuousness .
Meanwhile , the list of new ways to get noticed by the masses is shrinking fast .
Even space tourism — impressive in 2001 , when Dennis Tito paid Russia $ 20 m to visit the International Space Station — will soon be humdrum .
As it gets ever harder to consume conspicuously , are some traditional luxury consumers giving up trying ?
According to Virginia Postrel , author of “ The Substance of Style ” , conspicuous consumption is much more important when people are not far from being poor , as in today 's emerging economies .
In developed countries , in particular , “ status is always there , but the shift in the balance is towards enjoyment ” .
For instance , the first thing the newly super - rich tend to buy is a private plane .
But that , she says , is “ not so much about distinguishing themselves from the masses as not being stuck with them in a security line ” .
Rex
In his new book , “ Hypermodern Times ” , Gilles Lipovetsky , the favourite philosopher of LVMH 's boss , Bernard Arnaud , has coined the term “ hyperconsumption ” .
This is consumption which pervades ever more spheres of life and which encourages people to consume for their own pleasure rather than to enhance their social status .
H.L. Mencken made the same point more crisply in a critique of Veblen in 1919 : “ Do I prefer kissing a pretty girl to kissing a charwoman because even a janitor may kiss a charwoman — or because the pretty girl looks better , smells better and kisses better ? ”
Yet rather than abandoning status anxiety , the way the rich seek to display status may simply be getting more complex .
As inequality grows again in rich countries , some of the very rich worry about consumption that is so conspicuous to the masses that it provokes them to try to take their wealth away .
Some car - industry experts blame weak sales of the latest luxury limousines on this fear .
As well as traditional conspicuous consumption and “ self - treating ” , Ledbury Research identifies two other motives that are driving buying by the rich : connoisseurship and being an “ early adopter ” .
Both are arguably consumption that is conspicuous only to those you really want to impress .
Connoisseurs are people whom their friends respect for their deep knowledge of , say , fine wine or handmade Swiss watches .
Early adopters are those who are first with a new technology .
Silicon Valley millionaires currently impress their friends by buying an amphibian vehicle to avoid the commuter traffic on the Bay Bridge .
Several millionaires have already paid $ 50,000 a go to clone their pet cat .
In America , at least , says Marian Salzman , a leading trendspotter , the focus of conspicuous consumption is increasingly on getting your children into the best schools and universities .
Harvard may be today 's ultimate luxury good .
Getting into the right clubs is also as important a social statement as ever .
America 's young wealthy may currently be seen at the Core Club in New York : membership is by invitation only , with a joining fee of $ 55,000 plus annual dues of $ 12,000 .
But perhaps the true symbol of exalted status in the era of mass luxury is conspicuous non-consumption .
This is not just the growing tendency of the very rich to dress scruffily and drive beaten - up cars , as described by David Brooks in “ Bobos in Paradise ” .
It is showing that you have more money than you know how to spend .
So , for example , philanthropy is increasingly fashionable , and multi-billion - dollar endowments such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation are certainly conspicuous .
However , since the new philanthropists are keen to demonstrate that their giving produces results , this does not quite meet Veblen 's threshold of being a complete waste of money .
So the laurels surely go to those who are so wealthy that they are willing to buy adverts encouraging the state to tax them .
Kudos , then , to those conspicuously non-consuming wealthy American opponents of recent efforts to abolish estate taxes : George Soros , Bill Gates senior ( the father of the world 's richest man ) and Warren Buffett .
