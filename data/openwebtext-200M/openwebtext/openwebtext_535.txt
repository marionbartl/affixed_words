She was born with ovaries !
I was born with ovaries !
Remember the first time you saw the vase / two faces image ?
Remember staring until your perspective shifted and you saw the “ other thing ” in the picture ?
You probably felt a thrill accomplishing it .
Did you show your sibling how easy it was , vaunting your ability to see both images ?
Remember how it felt ?
It felt powerful — a revelation .
Article Continues Below
What would it be like to experience that same powerful feeling at work ?
Or at your town council meeting ?
Seeing the same thing from different perspectives is much praised but little practiced .
We do n’t often realize what we can gain by seeing another scene in the picture .
Step out of your problem - solving role#section2
Whether we ’re improving what we make , how we make it , or how we share it , we normally take the perspective of the creator by default .
We ca n’t help it .
We ’re drawn into decisions about all sorts of details .
We love the minutia — solving problems , finding a way around a limitation .
We do n’t try to see past our own role in the process .
The field of user experience ( UX ) helps us change that .
UX practitioners examine the everyday lives of the people we endeavor to help .
Bill Buxton , in his presentation at Interactions08 , offered the best illustration of UX I have seen .
He showed a catalog picture of a mountain bike next to a picture of a guy careening through a stream with water splashing everywhere .
You could n’t even see much of the bike in the second picture .
Bill said , “ You do n’t buy a bike .
You buy the right to scare yourself to death . ”
This is exactly it !

The people who designed the bike talk about what the bike can do , but the rider wants to find out what she can do .
In the former vocabulary : “ We give you 20 gears . ”
In the latter vocabulary : “ I ’ve decided to bike to work twice a week , but I fear the pain of getting up that steep hill on the way there . ”
If the bike company were smart , they ’d be talking about making it easier to get up hills while commuting to work , or suggesting alternate routes or techniques so that you ’ll arrive at the office without needing a shower and a nap .
Pretend your organization does n’t exist#section3
Thinking from the potential customer ’s perspective is a Zen - like exercise .
It requires you to drop your problem - solving role completely , and spend time — at least two hours , or maybe two weeks — engrossed in the world of this person .
Stop thinking of them as a “ user ” of the thing you provide .
Think about how and why they accomplish what they want to get done , not how or why they might use your stuff .
Pretend you and your organization do not exist , and study what this person does with all the resources available in her life .
For example , what does a citizen need from her town government ?
She needs a way to get from her house to the grocery store , the library , the post office , her workplace , etc .
These could be roads , bike paths , public transit , and sidewalks .
She needs utilities like water and electricity to be delivered to her property .
She needs assurance that her property will be defended from fire , protected from floods , and accessible during a disaster .
She wants to feel safe from assault , whether by a human , an animal , pollution , noise , or disease .
This list goes on .
When you look at how this person would approach the town government , she is faced with a list of departments :
Parking Services
Public Works
Redevelopment Agency
Emergency Services
Community Development
To whom would she turn if she wanted to report a strong pesticide smell ?
If the list contained titles such as the following , she might find the right person a little faster :
Getting Around Town
Water , Sewer & Utility Infrastructure
Fire / Flood / Disaster Preparation
Concerns About Feeling Exposed / Invaded
Changing Your Property
Look for differences in audience beliefs and behaviors #section4
This step can be tricky .
Almost always , there are different types of people trying to do slightly different things .
Most organizations divide these people into segments separated by their relationship to what the organization produces .
For example , I see much attention paid to whether a segment is “ web savvy , ” has a certain social or economic power , or is a new or existing customer .
Defining groups by their relationship to your product blinds you to the relationship they might have with products you have n’t thought of yet .
That may sound pretty axiomatic , but consider that the leap from existing products to something groundbreaking is still thought of as genius .
To dispel this belief , many folks have argued that innovation is the result of constant , earnest effort [ 1 ] .
This constant effort becomes frustrating when aimed at the customary perception of audience segments .
You can wear a groove in your brain thinking through the same old problems defined in the same old way .
Rather than looking for differences in how segments use your product , look for differences between the beliefs and behaviors of these segments in real life .
Like the vase and the two faces , suddenly new , less complicated segments will come into focus .
For example , rather than categorizing customers of a statistical graphing package by industry and expertise , they might fall into two behavioral segments like “ people who think visually and like to sketch what - if situations ” and “ people who need to communicate a result . ”
Play psychotherapist to key audiences : explore root causes #section5
Select the groups most important to you and get to know them deeply .
Ask them to explain their approach to achieving something .
They may not have formally defined the approach in their head yet , so keep asking and help them articulate why they do certain things .
Is their behavior motivated by a belief or a personality trait ?
What are their reactions to things that come up along the way ?
Everybody out of the pool !#section6
Let ’s say you ’re the administrator for a public recreation center .
You zero in on the pool as a conduit to increase summer revenue , and you know that swimming lessons are an important contributor .
You tried offering more levels of swimming lessons last summer , but it did n’t attract the crowds you were hoping for .
This winter , you decide to study people who might be interested in swimming lessons .
Instead of looking at “ kids ” and “ adults , ” you divide people into new groups :
People interested in fitness .
People inspired by the current Olympic swimming hero .
People afraid of drowning and want to do something about their fear .
People compelled by others to take lessons .
People interested in improving their technique to get faster .
You skip the fourth group because you feel like you understand that group pretty well .
( Think of kids enrolled by parents to take swimming lessons , or asked by swim team coaches to learn a new stroke . )
You study the remaining four groups .
During interviews with members of group three , you are prepared to hear a lot of emotion .
What surprises you is that these people do n’t ever see themselves in a pool at all .
They see themselves surviving a capsized boat on their upcoming nature cruise in Baja .
They want to appear relaxed and natural at the family reunion at Lake Shasta — able to play with the nephews and nieces in the water .
You get the idea that they do n’t want swimming lessons so much as “ drowning avoidance ” lessons .
They want their fear respected , recognized , and taken care of .
Based on your research , you advertise a new kind of class .
You run it in the evening when the pool is not full of observers .
Participants do n’t wear bathing suits or even get in the water — they ’re encouraged to describe the specific situation they ’re afraid of , and watch as an instructor demonstrates different methods to survive in the water .
You get six people at the first class — one who is 13 years old and others aged 37 through 63 .
You get 22 people at the next class .
You really met the needs of this group , and word gets passed throughout the community .
It ’s a big success throughout the summer .
Taking the robot out of reps#section7
What if you ’re the VP in charge of internet customer support at a really large telecommunications corporation ?
Customer satisfaction surveys indicate that people really are n’t getting what they need from your division , yet figures show that 88 % of the questions are “ completed . ”
The kicker is , your boss tells you to expect budget cuts .
Your predecessor established all sorts of workflows to allow customer service reps to route customers to the right information .
Last year , the voice - activated system was upgraded to try to answer more questions before involving a real live rep .
Instead of erecting more processes , you decide to explore the root of the problem .
You review 40 recorded calls from the past month and a picture forms in your mind .
Callers have a really negative reaction to interacting with a system , even if that “ system ” is actually a rep .
The negative reaction stems from being forced to state things discretely , one idea at a time , in terms that the “ system ” can deal with in a branching manner .
System :
Is this line you ’re calling from the line you are having trouble with ?
Customer :
Well , yes , but I ’m not specifically having trouble ; I just want to ask about compatible modems for my DSL service .
System :
Is this line you ’re calling from the line you are having trouble with ?
Customer : Yes .
System :
Are you having trouble with your password or with connectivity ?
Customer : No , neither !
System : I ’m sorry .
I am having trouble understanding your response .
Customer : Just give me the OPERATOR ! [ yelling ]
Rep : Hello , I ’m John .
Welcome to XYZ where we appreciate your business .
Let me look up some data about this call .
Are you Suzie Queue ?
Customer : Yes .
Rep : Thank you , Suzie Queue .
You have reached the technical support department .
We are here to answer your questions .
I see that you have Super - Ultra - Internet service and you ’ve been a customer for eight years .
How may I assist you today ?
Customer :
Well , I want a list of compatible modems for this service I have , and I want to find out how to log into the free wireless that comes with my account when I ’m at Starbucks .
Rep :
Let me see if I understand your question .
You want to purchase a modem ?
Customer : Um …
Not right now .
I just want to see which devices are compatible so I can do a little shopping around on the internet .
I did have two questions , but we ’ll get to the second one later , I guess .
Rep :
You do n’t want to purchase a modem ?
Customer : I do , eventually , yes .
Rep : I apologize , but I cannot help you here in tech support .
I ’ll need you to call the Store for that information .
Here is the toll - free number …
You realize that even your reps have been dumbed - down to replicate the digital system , reading possible topics from a branching list without putting any effort into a human conversation .
The root of the problem is that customers are looking for answers they could n’t find online or through the digital voice recognition system .
When they reach a rep , they expect an intelligent being who is able to provide more complex answers .
You decide to add “ none of the above ” options at every level of the digital voice recognition system .
This allows the customer to navigate through the system or not , acknowledging that they know whether their question is simple or complex .
You decide to put more complex information online where customers can find it , based on customer needs mentioned in the recorded calls .
You describe it to other VP ’s as “ maintainer information , ” while pointing out how it differs from the pre-purchase marketing information currently out there .
Finally , you yank all the branching topics from the reps and ask them to talk to the customer informally , the same way they would if they were a detective helping someone solve a mystery .
By getting rid of the self - limiting branching topics that assume there are no mysteries , you train reps to extract information through conversation , and how to use the internal company knowledgebase .
You allow them to instant message each other and other key people in the actual production departments .
Over the first month , the reps identify among themselves the people who have the most knowledge on a certain topic .
They are free to say , “ I do n’t know the answer , but let me ask somebody in another department who might know . ”
There is now a culture of respect for those with the knowledge among the reps , and a bit of competition to become the “ go to ” person in a certain area .
Those that are n’t as enthusiastic about the new culture leave .
Those that remain become much better equipped to move up into other positions within the company .
In the next customer satisfaction survey , your scores increase .
You have fewer people answering phones , and more questions being answered by information online .
Build a model of behaviors and how you support them #section8
When you understand what drives people ’s behavior , you can imagine new ideas pretty easily .
In each of these examples , the protagonist formed a model of a specific segment of people .
The model outlined the mental processes of the people as they went about their business , including the underpinning philosophies and emotions behind certain actions .
The protagonists took these “ mental models ” and mapped how they were already supporting certain things but missing other areas .
In the areas where there were gaps , the protagonists came up with several ideas that might support that part of the segment ’s mental model .
Sketch your mental model like this : put behaviors , beliefs , and reactions across the top , and the ways you support these things as a foundation underneath .
An example mental model for dating from Engage.com , with behaviors , beliefs , and reactions across the top , and the ways Engage plans to support them underneath .
Harness the visualization for a wider perspective #section9
Mental models frequently fall prey to our own assumptions and understanding of a particular field .
When creating one , turn off your internal problem - solver and just listen to people .
Allow patterns of behavior and motivation to reveal themselves to you .
Work from the bottom up , rather than designating several behavior areas and trying to fit people ’s actions into them .
Make sure you ’ve asked questions that dig into a person ’s soul .
Find out what makes them tick .
For example , you ’ll find that many health patients go to a doctor not to “ remove pain ” but to “ get back to my old life . ”
Removing pain is just one underlying root motivator .
When your organization redefines the way you see and support customers , you take a step toward a more mature design approach .
Instead of simply making existing solutions work better or applying stylish cosmetics , you open up new perspectives that allow you to see something that was n’t apparent before .
Focus first on what it ’s like to be these people , and then focus on what you have to give them .
With this vision , creativity tumbles forth .

Bush Bankrupts America , But You Can Still Get A Free DVD Of The Impeachment Play , And There Is Still Time To Impeach
Many were skeptical that the criminal creeps in the White House could
actually bankrupt the entire United States of America in a mere 8
years , and yet here we are , staring into the abyss of that “ Mission
Accomplished ” right now .
And deliberately lying the American people
into a counterproductive and illegal two trillion dollar war was just
another days treason for those occupants .
Now , even WE do not expect action on impeachment this particular
week .
Congress is too preoccupied scrambling to try to salvage the
disaster that has become our economy because of 8 years of corrupt
Republicans hell bent on deregulation , and EQUALLY corrupt Democrats
too cowardly to stop them , even when they had the actual power to do
so .
And unfortunately , the plan they are likely to present to us
before the end of the weekend as a fait accompli looks like it will
be the biggest theft from the American taxpayer in history .
But at the same time , there is no assurance they will not start a
full blown World War 3 on top of everything else , even before the
next election , to try to swing that election to the new Armageddon
Twins in the wings .
Believe it , they are perfectly capable of
something that evil , and will do it without a second thought for
partisan political advantage .
And
that is why we must keep the heat
on for impeachment , and do everything we can to educate our friends
and neighbors about its constitutional imperative .
And that is why we have made the DVD of the new Impeachment Play
available for you and no donation is required .
Impeachment Play DVD and Video : http://www.impeachplay.com
So if you have not requested yours yet , please do so from the page
above .
Although there is an optional donation section on the page ,
that is not a requirement .
Just remember , if you CAN make a donation
of amount , that is what is making it possible for us to distribute so
many thousands of free DVDs to those who cannot make a contribution
right now , to pay our valiant actors through the union ( which we are
thrilled to be able to support ) for their magnificent and deserving
work , for the bandwidth on the free viewing site above where you can
watch the whole production
right now , and everything else .
And when you get it , throw parties for your friends to show it , put
on screenings in your community at libraries and community centers as
so many are already doing .
And encourage everyone you know to get
their own copies , just as you got yours , and do the same thing .
There is a very simple solution to the mortgage - based financial
crisis .
Ease the terms on the hardworking homeowners who are
struggling to make their payments , and thereby help them directly .
We
remember when we fought against the hideously cruel new bankruptcy
bill a couple year ago , rammed through without a serious attempt at a
filibuster .
If only we had been able to get more people to speak out
then .
But instead , Congress will probably fall over itself , in a sickly
show of staged bipartisanship , to hand hundreds of billions dollars
to the very reckless shysters who drove us off this cliff
in the
first place .
For the partially inflated punching bags which pass for
most members of Congress , in case of fire , pour on more gasoline .
Just remember , as long as there are 15 minutes left , even for a
president and vice president supposed to leave office anyway , there
is PLENTY of time left to impeach , for that is how long a vote in the
House takes , and any talk to the contrary is just silly , defeatist
babble .
And all we have to do to make it happen is get MORE people to
speak out and DEMAND it .
It may be the only thing that can deter
future presidents from doing the same and worse .
In case anybody is not paying attention , an impeachment movement
against the president of Pakistan just developed so fast , from the
talk of initially doing it until the “ done deal ” , it was only a
matter of a couple days .
So while some here are WASTING time talking
about “ not enough time ” , Pakistan just went
ahead about doing it , and
forced the instant resignation of Musharraf
Is Pakistan a better democracy that the good ole United States of
America ?
Does Pakistan have a better and more effective Constitution ?
There is enough time to impeach ten presidents and vice presidents if
only we rally the people to speak out .
And anybody who tries to tell
you different is just a right wing tool whether they know it or not .
But to actually make life imitate art , we need millions of people to
watch the impeachment play video , to really bring home the issues
involved , and to inspire them to raise their voices too .

Virgin Media will launch a campaign against illegal downloading next week , when it ’ll begin firing off warning letters to subscribers the BPI believes are sharing copyright music files .
The move is being billed by the cable firm as an “ education campaign ” .
At this stage there will be no “ three strikes ” process ; customers who continue to fileshare illegally will not be disconnected .
Accounts identified as being used for illegal music sharing by the record industry will receive two letters : one from Virgin Media and one from the BPI .
Investigators will monitor copyright - infringing BitTorrent swarms and log Virgin Media IP addresses , which will be passed on to the ISP to identify the customers .
Virgin Media will distribute both letters , and no personally identifiable information will be disclosed to the BPI .
The letters will include advice on “ how to prevent account misuse ” , “ avoid the risk of legal action ” , and warn customers that peer to peer networks carry “ increased threats from viruses and spyware ” , a Virgin Media statement said .
You can read the Virgin Media letter here and the BPI letter here ( PDFs ) .
The campaign will run as a trial for a flexible period of about two months .
Its effect on behaviour will then be reviewed .
Virgin Media claims a lot of account holders may not be aware their kids or others are using their line to download music illegally , for example via an unsecured Wi -Fi network .
The BPI has been pushing for enforcement alongside education , but Virgin Media said it was unwilling to disconnect customers who do n’t stop accessing illegal music .
A spokesman said today : “ It ’s a bit of a judgement call for us to be making threats of disconnection or account suspension .
We were n’t willing to do that . ”
“ There are now so many lawful cheap and free music services out there that we believe an education campaign in partnership with the BPI is the best way forward . ”
The ISP industry is under enormous government pressure to cut a deal with the record industry following a successful lobbying campaign by the BPI .
Ministers have vowed to introduce anti-filesharing legislation if a self - regulatory solution is not found .
The BPI has recently begun threatening ISPs with court injunctions if they do not agree to act against illegal filesharers .
One such threat sent to Carphone Warehouse received short shrift from the firm ’s bosses , who said they would never disconnect their customers and that they did n’t believe legislation will be brought forward .
Virgin Media appears to have taken a less confrontational approach to its dealings with the record industry .
Although the “ education campaign ” is toothless in this first trial phase , getting a major ISP to publicly adopt a role in battling illegal downloading is a big win for the BPI .
Its chief executive Geoff Taylor said in a statement : “ Education is absolutely key to reducing the extent of illegal downloading ... this joint campaign with Virgin Media is the first step towards achieving that goal . ”
A survey commissioned by the record industry earlier this year claimed most illegal downloaders would stop if warned .
The BPI struck a deal with Tiscali to implement a full three strikes last year .
Four out of 21 warned account holders ended up disconnected from the internet .
The deal fell apart however in a row over who should pay for the process . ®

The vitamin D recommendations for older children should be raised by 10 times , according to a study conducted by researchers from the American University of Beirut - Medical Center in Lebanon , and published in the " Our research reveals that vitamin D , at doses equivalent to 2,000 IUs a day , is not only safe for adolescents , but it is actually necessary for achieving desirable vitamin D levels , " lead researcher Ghada El - Haff Fuleihan said .
Currently , the U.S. recommended daily allowance for vitamin D is 200 IU per day for children .
But the researchers hypothesized that because of their rapid skeletal growth , children may actually need much higher levels of the vitamin than even adults do .
Vitamin D plays a critical role in bone growth and health .
Deficiency in children can lead to the bone softening disease rickets , and may contribute to osteoporosis risk in adults .
To test their hypothesis , researchers first gave 10 girls and 15 boys between the ages of 10 and 17 a weekly vitamin D dose of 14,000 IU - 10 times the recommended dose - for eight weeks .
When none of the children exhibited any signs of vitamin D toxicity , the researchers deemed it safe to move on to a long - term study .
" Supplementation of children and adolescents with 2,000 IUs a day of vitamin D3 is well tolerated and safe , " Fuleihan said .
" This is particularly relevant in light of the increasingly recognized health benefits of vitamin D for adults and children .
" In the long - term experiment , researchers gave 168 girls and 172 boys in the same age range either 1,400 IU or 14,000 IU per week for one year .
They found that only the children being given 2,000 IU per day had vitamin D blood levels in the range considered optimal for adults .
The researchers noted that few studies have been conducted on the actual vitamin D needs of children and adolescents .
" Data on appropriate vitamin D levels in the pediatric age group are lacking , " Fuleihan said .
" This is a major obstacle to finding the right daily allowance to enhance musculoskeletal health .

Trying to save three women and three screaming children from an angry gunman , Martinez police officers Paul Starzyk and Ian Leong stood in a narrow hallway leading to a second - floor apartment on Saturday - and prepared to go in .
But before they could , police officials said , gunman Felix Sandoval poked a hand out from behind the door and opened fire , blindly , with a .38 - caliber revolver .
Starzyk , a 47 - year - old sergeant , was wearing a bulletproof vest but was hit twice in the upper body .
Starzyk initially returned fire along with Leong , but he was fatally wounded .
Within minutes , officials said , Sandoval was shot dead by a third officer who responded to the apartment and unleashed a German shepherd .
Once inside the apartment , authorities found a 44 - year - old woman - the cousin of Sandoval 's estranged wife - dead in the kitchen .
The account of the three deaths in Martinez emerged Sunday as relatives and friends of the two victims grieved .
Police and witnesses said Sandoval , a 49 - year - old retired laborer with three children and a recent arrest for methamphetamine use , intended to attack his estranged wife - who last year filed for divorce and obtained a restraining order against him .
He tried to find his wife at her business , Elegant Hair Design on Pacheco Boulevard , at about 11:30 a.m. , police said .
Margarita Sandoval hid in her shop , but Sandoval did n't know that - and he continued searching for her in the apartment building the couple owned behind the salon .
" What we had was trained officers determined to attempt to save lives , and they put their own lives in jeopardy , " Martinez Police Chief Tom Simonetti said in an interview Sunday .
" Unfortunately , it 's a one - in - a- million shot , and the suspect managed to hit Sgt. Starzyk . "
Colleagues of Starzyk - described as popular , funny and well - schooled in police tactics - were in mourning Sunday , with officers from neighboring jurisdictions covering their patrols .
Starzyk was the father of two young boys and a girl .
The Chicago native was a banker until his early 30s , then joined the Martinez force as a volunteer reserve before his permanent hiring in 1995 , Simonetti said .
He was a former leader of the agency 's SWAT team , and he taught officers how to shoot weapons properly and how to deal with armed suspects .
He was promoted in December to sergeant .
On the side , he volunteered at a soup kitchen .
" I can't say enough good things about him , " Simonetti said .
" It 's just hard for all of us here .
We 're having a tough time . "
Fought for battered women
Friends of Sandoval 's other apparent victim - Catalina Torres , a 44 - year - old mother of two grown sons - said her death was bitterly ironic because she had worked as a volunteer advocate for battered women at Concord - based Stand !
Against Domestic Violence .
" Catalina was an advocate for women 's rights , and she died doing what she believed in , " said Pam Center , a friend .
" It 's too ironic - it 's terrible . "
Torres was born in Mexico and grew up in Martinez , then attended Diablo Valley College in Pleasant Hill and St. Mary 's College in Moraga , friends said .
She returned to Diablo Valley College to tutor math students for more than 10 years , said Rachel Westlake , division dean of the Mathematics Department .
" She was very good at working with students that had a lot of anxiety with mathematics , " said Westlake .
Sandoval , meanwhile , had been upset with his wife for accusing him of abuse , a friend said Sunday .
" He said , ' I want people to know the truth , ' " said Mario Fiorella , his longtime friend and neighbor on a quiet Martinez cul - de-sac .
" He said he wanted to take a lie detector test " to prove he was n't a threat to his wife .
Last year , Margarita Sandoval petitioned to divorce her husband and obtained a restraining order against him that was to expire in 2010 , Contra Costa County Superior Court records show .
The couple was scheduled to return to court on Oct. 27 for a settlement conference in connection with their divorce .
Fiorella said Sandoval 's divorce was complicated because the couple owned the building that houses the salon and a tattoo parlor , plus the apartment building and a nearby home .
Sandoval talked about moving to Mexico , where he was born , after the divorce was finalized , Fiorella said .
Sandoval retired from contractor Galletti and Sons Inc. in Martinez a few years ago after suffering knee and back injuries , Fiorella said .
He said Sandoval was a gun enthusiast with a small collection of firearms .
Sandoval 's neighbor also said Sandoval was one of the kindest and most loving people he had ever met , and said he trusted him completely .
He said his friend " must have snapped . "
' This was her refuge '
But friends and relatives of Sandoval 's wife , Margarita Sandoval , said she had become increasingly fearful of him .
" She was really scared , " said a longtime friend who declined to give her name as she stood outside the salon .
" She knew her husband could be dangerous , but this was her refuge . "
Felix Sandoval seemed to be in good spirits Saturday morning , Fiorella said , playing pool with his teenage son in his garage at 9:30 a.m. and then attending his son's soccer game near downtown Martinez .
Soon after , though , the father of three drove his classic Ford Mustang convertible to his wife 's small salon .
The first 911 call came in at 11:35 a.m. , Simonetti said .
Kellie Schramm , 43 , of Martinez , said she was getting her hair cut when she heard glass breaking .
Sandoval had used his bare hands and arms to bash through the salon 's front window , bloodying himself in the process .
" Everybody started screaming , " Schramm said in an interview Sunday .
She said Sandoval said , " Where is she ? " while she and two other female customers tried to escape through a side door - which was locked .
The other customers then managed to flee in another direction , but Schramm was stuck .
" I turned and he was standing next to me near the back door , " Schramm said .
" The gun was in his right hand . "
Schramm said Sandoval 's 19 - year - old daughter , who works at the salon , was hysterically pleading with him to stop what he was doing .
But it was no use , and Sandoval , wearing a hat , continued to ask , " Where is your mother ? "
Schramm said she ran past Sandoval and into a small closet , roughly 10 feet wide and 3 feet deep .
" All I could think of was , ' He 's going to shoot me , ' " Schramm said .
" It happened so fast .
" I heard the doorknob turn , and the door opened , and there he was , " she said .
" I said , ' Please do n't shoot !
Please do n't shoot !'
He just shook his head and shut the door .
Luckily for me , he wanted someone specific . "
Simonetti said Sandoval told his daughter that he was going to kill her mother and made comments about killing her and his other children - then climbed stairs to the apartment where Torres had fled .
It appears he then kicked and shot the apartment door to get it open .
Leong , a K - 9 officer , was the first to arrive at 11:37 a.m. , Simonetti said .
He heard gunfire .
He left his dog in his car but grabbed his MP5 submachine gun .
Starzyk pulled up a minute later and grabbed his own AR - 15 semiautomatic rifle .
Children 's screams
After climbing the stairs to the apartment , Simonetti said , the officers heard children screaming inside .
" They decide that they have what we call an ' active shooter ' - type situation , " the chief said .
" We have someone that 's doing harm and we need to stop it . "
All of a sudden , Simonetti said , a hand and revolver came from behind the door .
Both Starzyk and Leong returned fire until the hand disappeared .
Struck twice , Starzyk fell , leaving Leong to try to drag him to safety , Simonetti said .
But Sandoval fired again , the same way , and Leong returned fire again .
Soon , Simonetti said , another K - 9 officer , Cpl. Glenn Walkup , arrived and pulled Starzyk out of the way .
Then he sent his German shepherd , Enzo , into the apartment - where he found Sandoval and dragged his legs into the doorway .
" Walkup sees the suspect on his back with the gun pointed at the dog , " Simonetti said .
" He shoots him twice .
The confrontation is over . "
Leong made an " officer down " call at 11:40 a.m. , Simonetti said .
Officers reported a " code 4 " - a secure scene - at 11:41 a.m .
The whole encounter had lasted six minutes .
Inside the apartment , two women were found screaming hysterically and three small children were found in a closet , cowering , Simonetti said .
He said one of the women said she witnessed Sandoval shoot Torres in the kitchen .
" It was not a pleasant thing , " Simonetti said .
" The reality is , based on their actions , there are five people alive today that might not be . "

There was a small bug in the PHP order form that Jared L. had developed : the form would complain that " $ 1000 " is an " invalid numeric value . "
While technically true , Jared 's boss wanted to make the form as fool - proof as possible , and asked Jared to fix it .
" No problem , " Jared affirmed , " I 'll make sure to have it strip those out . "
" Well , " his boss replied , " I believe we 've got a function to do that " .
He frowned for a second before stating , " Well , I was just going to use regex to make sure they entered it right , or else just use str_replace ( ) to strip out any special chars " .
" No , no we 've already gotten it written , let me ask Brian where it's at , " he insisted .
Crap , Jared thought , for Pete 's sake , anything but that .
He went back to his desk and pulled up TheDailyWTF.com , absolutely sure that whatever transpired next would be worth a submission .
Sure enough , within a few minutes , Jared 's boss came over to his desk .
" Great news , " the boss said enthusiastically , " you do n't have to write any code , we 've already got it !
Go ahead and open up everything.inc and find the fixString ( ) function .
You just pass that a string and an array , and it will strip anything in the array out of it .
You 're set ! " .
" Great ! "
Jared replied , clenching my teeth .
So let me guess , Jared thought , this function is just going to consist of one line returning the results of a " replace " .
He opened it up to see what it contained :
function fixString ( $ string , $ chars = 0 ) { $ string = " A " .
$ string ; if ( empty ( $ chars ) ) { $ chars = array ( ' " ' , '\'' , '\\ ' ) ; } for ( $ i = 0 ; $ i < count ( $ chars ) ; $ i++ ) { while ( strpos ( $ string , $ chars [ $i ] ) !=
0 ) { $ index = strpos ( $ string , $ chars [ $ i ] ) ; $ string = substr ( $ string , 0 , $ index ) . substr ( $ string , $ index+1 ) ; } } $ string = substr ( $ string , 1 ) ; return $ string ; }
Jared shook his head and sighed .
Instead of including the entire , 800 - line everything.inc file in his page , he opted for the built - in replace ( ) :
$ cleaned Price = str_replace ( array ( ' $ ' ) , " " , $ price ) ;
Too bad Brian was the lead developer and team lead .
Aug. 14 , 2008 -- Parents who fail to monitor their school - age children 's activities and leave prescription drugs within easy reach play a major contributing role in teen drug abuse , according to a new survey .
A report based on the survey targets " problem parents " who make it easy for their teens to smoke , drink alcohol , or use illegal and prescription drugs because they frequently do n't know where their children are on school nights , fail to keep their prescription drugs out of reach , and do n't talk about the dangers of drug or alcohol abuse .
The report was based on findings from the 13th annual back - to - school survey of teens and parents conducted by Columbia University 's National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse ( CASA ) .
Among the major findings from the survey :
Almost half of 12 - to 17 - year olds said they routinely left their homes to hang out with their friends on school nights , but only 14 % of parents said their kids did this .
A third of the teens with friends who abused prescription drugs said the friends got the drugs from their home medicine cabinets , and another third said friends or classmates could easily supply them .
One in four teens said they knew of a parent of a classmate or friend who smoked marijuana , and one in 10 said this parent smoked marijuana with teenagers .
For the first time , more teens said prescription drugs were easier to buy than beer .
The percentage of teens who considered prescription drugs the easiest drug to buy increased by 46 % over the previous year .
" Kids are getting these drugs from their homes or from their friends ' homes , but there is a tremendous disconnect or denial among parents about this , " former U.S. Secretary of Health , Education and Welfare and CASA Chairman Joseph A. Califano Jr. tells WebMD .
Concern Raised Over Suspicious Deaths Of 24 Bio-Scientists ‘ Suicide ’ of Bruce Ivins makes it 24 bioterrorism experts who have died over last seven years By Victor Thorn OVER THE PAST SEVEN YEARS , more than two dozen of the world ’s most esteemed microbiologists — all of whom were focused on combating bioterrorism — have died under questionable circumstances .
One was stabbed with a sword , another run over by a car , while a third was bashed over the head until dead .
A scientist was found with repeated stab wounds to the chest ; another was shoved under a chair ( naked from the waist down ) ; one perished in a nitrogen - filled airlock ; another was carjacked , with his keys still in the ignition and a full tank of gas .
None of these men died of natural causes .
Their murders were deliberate , and it ’s sending a clear message to virus experts , immunologists , entomologists , and those researching bio - weaponry : your lives are in grave danger .
The latest casualty was bio - defense pioneer Bruce Ivins , who reportedly committed suicide on July 29 at Frederick Memorial Hospital from an overdose of Tylenol 3 .
( How he obtained enough pills to kill himself in a mental hospital is still open to question . )
Ivins had direct links to the 2001 anthrax case ; first via his potential development of a vaccine to combat the toxin , and secondly as a 2003 recipient of the Decoration for Exceptional Service — the most prestigious award a civilian scientist can receive .
Ivins also assisted the government in its investigation of the anthrax scare .
Those closest to Ivins are publicly skeptical of the suicide story , pointing out that he was a Red Cross volunteer , played keyboards at his local church , enjoyed gardening and was married with two children .
On the other hand , to paint the most horrific picture possible , an FBI - affiliated social worker named Jean Duley stated that Ivins was , in reality , a sociopathic , homicidal revenge killer who wanted to murder his coworkers
in a blaze of glory after discovering that he was the target of a Justice Department investigation into the anthrax case .
This testimony is questionable on a number of different levels .
Samples of human hair from a mailbox in Princeton , N.J. where the anthrax was mailed do not match Ivins , sources involved said .
For 18 years , Ivins held one of the highest security clearances possible in the Department of Defense .
As journalist Scott Creighton asked , “ How did all those educated and degreed psychologists and psychiatrists miss this criminal intent that a social worker ( Jean Duley ) picked up on in one group session ? ”
If Ivins exhibited such homicidal tendencies , would n’t it be identified at least once in nearly two decades , especially since he worked at Fort Detrick , home of the U.S. Army ’s Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases at one of the most guarded facilities in the country ?
Ivins is the second victim of a government witch hunt that began with the concerted harassment of Dr. Steven Hatfill , whose career and reputation were irreparably destroyed before receiving a $ 5.8 million settlement from the feds .
Conveniently enough , less than a month after the government awarded Hatfill his judgment — with their anthrax case seemingly stalled and going nowhere because they pursued the wrong man for years — all of a sudden Bruce Ivins overdoses and the entire matter is suddenly solved .
Nobody has to ever again worry about anthrax - laced letters like the ones Tom Brokaw and former Sen .
Tom Daschle received .
But has the real culprit actually been identified , or is there someone else being shielded from prosecution ?
The answer may lie with Dr. Philip M. Zack , a microbiologist who had already attempted to frame an Arab colleague , Dr. Ayaad Asaad , for the anthrax scare .
Zack , it turns out , is Jewish , and was fired from his post at Fort Detrick for continually harassing Dr. Asaad in an extremely discriminatory fashion because he was Arab .
Continued visits to the top - secret lab after his dismissal were recorded by security cameras .
He was filmed entering Fort Detrick on numerous occasions .
The individual who illegally let him in was Dr. Marian K. Rippy , also Jewish .
In addition , Zack was well acquainted with military - grade anthrax , the same type that was used to lace postal packages in 2001 .
Further evidence implicating the government were DNA tests linking the original source spores ( which are very rare ) to Fort Detrick .
Zack again becomes a prime suspect because the anthrax scare occurred shortly after 9 - 11 , at a time when the neo-cons and Israel were primed to begin their “ war on terror . ”
Zack was known as a rabid “ Arab - hating - Jew , ” and the letters attached to each anthrax sample teemed with anti-Semitic rhetoric meant to implicate Arabs ( “ Death to Israel , Allah is Great ” ) .
Was the entire anthrax hysteria motivated to cast further suspicion on Muslims to justify the neo- cons ’ desire for a Mideast war ?
Was the anthrax scare akin to Saddam Hussein ’s purported WMDs , another tactic to push us toward an Iraqi invasion ?
Were Steven Hatfill and Bruce Ivins scapegoats used by the government to divert attention from Dr. Zack ’s involvement ?
Finally , are many of the world ’s top microbiologists being murdered to minimize efforts to counter the effects of a future bio-terrorist attack ?
Who would have ever thought that brainy , isolated lab workers were in the world ’s most deadly white - collar profession ?
Dr. Bruce Ivins was a shy , dedicated scientist .
Following his death , he ’s been characterized as a madman wearing a bullet - proof vest who poisoned his victims via the nation ’s most deadly act of biological terrorism .
But , if the anthrax scare was simply another neo -con / Mossad psy- op , the implications for a coverup are enormous .
Many of Dr. Ivins ’ colleagues and friends do n’t believe claims that he was a killer , and feel his “ suicide ” was the result of non-stop , heavy - handed harassment by government officials .
Disease specialist W. Russell Byrne characterized him as “ looking
like a guy who was being led to his execution . ”
Has another number just been added to the mysterious microbiologist body count ?
Victor Thorn is a freelance journalist based in Pennsylvania .
He is the author of numerous books about the New World Order and 9 - 11 .
These books include : New World Order Exposed ; New World Order Illusion ; 9 - 11 Evil : The Israeli Connection to 9-11 ; 9 - 11 on Trial ; 9 - 11 Exposed and AFP ’s Phantom Flight 93 and Other Astounding 9 - 11 Mysteries Explored .

Summary
I have two goals in this post .
Firstly I want to revisit the vector space monad I 've used before .
This time I want to show how it provides a great domain specific language for working with multilinear functions on vector spaces .
Secondly I want to apply this monad to talk about Hopf algebras .
In particular I want to address the issue of why Hopf algebras and groups are actually the same thing .
In fact , I want to push this idea to the point where I can use exactly the same code to perform operations in both groups and Hopf algebras .
By parameterising the definition of groups in the right way , Hopf algebras appear as if by magic simply by tweaking one parameter .
What this means is that if you understand groups and vector spaces , and are comfortable with monads in Haskell , then despite their notoriety as something whose definition is a little opaque , you 'll have some idea of what a Hopf algebra is well before the end this post .
Of course there 's the question of why anyone would want to know about Hopf algebras .
They appear in combinatorics , topology and knot theory , and theoretical physics among other subjects .
In fact , there 's a review paper on their ubiquity .
As topics in mathematics go , this is a hot one .
First some administrivia , because this is , as always , a literate Haskell post .
We 'll start with a type class for vector spaces v over a base field k:is vector space addition andis scalar multiplication by elements of the base field .
And now I need a concrete instance .
I 'll be working with vector spaces equipped with a basis .
I 'll use the obvious representation : a list of pairs of coefficients and basis elements .
So 2x - 3y is represented as .
Sometimes it will be clearer if I write 2e - 3e .
x and y are n't really the basis elements but labels .
The eand eare the actual basis elements .
But it 's often more readable to write x and y .
The problem with this representation is that basis elements might appear in any order , the same basis element might appear multiple times , and some basis elements might appear with redundant zero coefficients .
We need a suitable definition of equality .
( I 'm sidestepping the usual issues withand . ) V is a functor .
fmap f just applies f to the basis elements .
Given any type a , V k a is the type of vectors over k generated by elements of a .
Sois the type of vectors whose basis elements are themselves labeled by vectors in .
We can think of an element oflooking something like 2 ( 2x+3y ) - 5( 3x -y ) .
It 's tempting to say this is equal to what we get when we multiply out , but where I wrote ' 2x+3 y '
I really meant e. Nonetheless , we can define a function that does the multiplying out .
I 'll call this function .
So we get a function .
In fact , we get a monad .
What 's really going on here is that the " vector space over basis " functor is a monad in the category Set , but in the category of Haskell types and functions we 're stuck with lists .
is not just a monad , it 's also aSo what 's the use of making our vector space into a monad ?
If m is a monad , then any function f:a→mb can be lifted to a function f': ma→mb .
f maps the basis elements in a to elements of mb .
It 's a standard fact about vector spaces that a linear function is completely defined by its value on a basis .
f ' is the corresponding linear function .
So we only need to implement linear functions for basis elements and the function can be automatically lifted to a linear function on the whole vector space .
An arrow of the form a→mb is a Kleisli arrow and what I 've just argued is that the Kleisli category of themonad is the category of vector spaces with basis .
This gives us lots of advantages .
For example , we can't accidentally implement a function that is n't linear this way .
If we implement the action on a basis , the lift can't help but be linear .
Also , working with basis elements rather than the vector space gives us greater flexibility .
For example , it 'll be easy to form tensor products of vector spaces by directly working with their bases .
Here 's the instantiation of the vector space type : I could have implementedusingbut this definition is more in the spirit of what 's to come .
Now we switch to groups .
Here 's a first attempt at writing a group type classNow we can try testing some of the group laws .
For exampleIf we runwe gain some confidence that we have a group .
If we want to be more categorial then we need to express as much as possible as compositions of functions .
So let 's break downas a composition of elementary operations .
There 's a nice symmetry in .
If we makepart of the definition of a group that we can make this highly symmetric definition of a group : I 've even made a ( useless looking ) symmetric partner forand I 've renamed the inverse operation as , short for antipode .
Let 's makean instance of this class .
I hope I have n't done anything too tricky yet .
This is just the familiar definition of a group except I 've made a trivial ' counit ' and the diagonal function part of the definition .
Now comes the most important step in this post : I 'll tweak this definition so that all of the associated functions are now Kleisli arrows :
We can now straightforwardly reimplementas an instance of this class .
Apart from writing it monad - agnostically , it 's just like before .
We can exactly recover what we had before with the help of the identitiy monad .
Now we can rewrite the group laws .
Before checking to see if aa=1 we 'll make sure aa=aa .
For aawe need to compare with the identity .
We make an identity by applyingto .
We could just provide abut we get something more symmetrical if we construct it using the counit .
We can test associativity easilyIn the interest of symmetry , there ought to be a coassociativity law for comultiplication .
Here it is :
One issue is that we 've introducedwithout making much demand on it .
Here 's a law that is obviously true in any group that helps to pin down .
It 's simply evaluating ( p , q ) → ( pq , pq ) in two different ways .
Out of laziness I 'm not going to test every group law , but shortly I 'll show you where to find all of the laws , including the new laws foris just the usual group of integers with addition .
But the time has come to switch monads .
What 's H= ?
It 's clearly a vector space with basis elements labelled with integers .
It 's also an instance ofmeaning it comes equipped with implementations of functions likeand .
But note this : is no longer trivial .
We have .
In other wordslifts to a linear map from H to , which is isomorphic to .
In fact , it sums the coefficients if the basis elements .now embeds the ground field in our new structure .
But what 's ?
Wellis H⊗H. Solifts to a bilinear map from H×H to H .
We have a vector space with a bilinear multiplication law .
Is this law associative ?
We could write code to check .
But here 's the really cool bit : we can just reusen from above .
By switching monad , we automatically get a new algebraic structure and new ' semantics ' for the group laws .
Unpackingreveals that it gives the associativity law for an algebra .
Unpacking further group laws in this context gives bialgebra laws .
And ' monadifying ' the laws about group inverses give rise to the Hopf algebra laws for the antipode :
In other words , a Hopf algebra overis nothing other than a group in the generalised sense above using the monad .
The underlying object and all of the Hopf algebra laws just follow automatically as soon as you switch monads .
Groups and Hopf algebras are the same thing
But we still have this example Hopf algebrato think about .
It 's none other than the group algebra of .
It 's essentially the algebra of Laurent polynomials .
Clearly we could repeat this group algebra construction for any group andwas just an example .
Now I have this machinery for working with Hopf algebras I might as well construct some examples that are n't simply generated by some underlying group .
I found some pretty combinatorial examples in this paper Firstly I 'd like to define some combinatorial operations on lists : andsimply joins a pair of lists .
computes a kind of inverse of .
This inverse is multivalued so depending on which monad is used it can return all of the possible pairs that could have beented to make a particular list .
finds all the ways that two lists can be riffle shuffled together .is the multivalued inverse ofin that it finds all of the ways pairs of lists could have been riffle shuffled together to give a particular list .
We can now define a pair of Hopf algebras as follows .
We can now test some of the Hopf algebra lawsUnfortunately my code is a inefficient , and the shuffles cause combinatorial explosions , so it 's probably best not to run these examples .
This post is about expressing algebraic structures rather than making practical computations in them .
And of course you can try the same withThere 's one last important thing to come out of these .
We have a powerful notation for working with tensor products of vector spaces but the notation is so easy to use that it 's hidden the fact that there 's complex stuff going on under the hood .
When we 're dealing with themonad then a line likeis pretty straightforward to interpret as an assignment .
But in the vector space monad it means something very different .
Nonetheless , we can often reason ( with care ) as if it were just an assignment .
This is what Sweedler Notation is about .
But it kind of just appears automatically here .
What they say is right .
Hopf algebras really are groups in disguise .
Just take all of the functions that make up the structure of a group and convert each one to a Kleisli arrow for the vector space monad .
You end up with Hopf algebras .
I 'm amazed at the way I could express this level of abstraction in Haskell .
I do n't know of any computer algebra package that comes near to this level of expressivity .
Although algebra packages often come with amazing implementations of algebraic algorithms , the programming languages they come with are generally completely uninteresting in themselves .
I 'm looking forward to the day when computational algebraists and programming language theorists get talking to each other .
By the way , this kind of manipulation was what monads were invented for .
It 's nice to see the two different applications work so well together .
Cinq ans après avoir isolé " mimivirus " , le virus le plus volumineux jamais identifié , une équipe de biologistes français a annoncé , jeudi 7 août , sur le site Internet de la revue Nature , avoir découvert une deuxième souche de cette famille et un virus capable de l'infecter et ainsi de se répliquer .
Cette double découverte remet en partie en question ce que l'on connaissait des origines des virus et des échanges génétiques entre virus .
L'équipe dirigée par Bernard La Scola et Didier Raoult ( CNRS , université de la Méditerranée , Marseille ) avait découvert en 2003 le premier virus géant , baptisé " mimivirus " , dans une amibe qui avait initialement été isolée en 1992 dans l'eau d'une tour d'un système de climatisation située à Bradford ( Royaume - Uni ) .
Supposé être une bactérie , il s'avéra en fait être un virus géant .
Pour les chercheurs , " mimivirus " constituait une double surprise .
D'abord parce que sa taille - 0,4 micromètre - approchait celle de certaines bactéries et faisait de lui le seul virus visible avec un microscope optique .
Ensuite parce que son génome était constitué de plus d'un million de paires de bases d'ADN et d'environ 900 gènes quand la plupart des virus n'ont que quelques milliers ou quelques dizaines de milliers de paires de bases et quelques dizaines de gènes seulement .
Les premières analyses de sa structure laissaient supposer que " mimivirus " était apparu très tôt dans l'évolution et qu'il était le premier représentant d'une nouvelle famille .
Plusieurs arguments donnent à penser qu'il est capable - lui ou un virus très voisin - d'infecter le système respiratoire des mammifères .
" SPOUTNIK "
La même équipe explique aujourd ' hui avoir identifié une nouvelle souche un peu plus volumineuse - d'où la dénomination de " mamavirus " - à partir d'une autre amibe isolée à Paris , également dans l'eau d'un système de climatisation .
Mais ce n'est pas tout .
Les chercheurs ont par la même occasion découvert un nouveau virus , de petite taille et de structure isocaédrique .
" Pensant initialement qu'il ne s'agissait là que d'un virus satellite du premier , nous l'avons dénommé Spoutnik , explique Bernard La Scola .
Notre surprise a été d'observer que ce nouveau virus a , en réalité , la capacité de détourner à son profit la mécanique moléculaire de " mamavirus " quand ce dernier est en phase de réplication , en infectant directement son organe de multiplication dans l'amibe devenue une sorte d'usine à virus .
Nous sommes là face à une situation inédite .
Il était admis jusqu'à présent que , pour échanger des gènes et muter , les virus devaient infecter une cellule .
C'est la première fois que l'on observe , ici , des échanges directs de matériel génétique entre virus étrangers . "
De la même manière que l'on désigne par le terme de bactériophages les virus qui n'infectent que des bactéries , les chercheurs ont choisi de faire de Spoutnik le premier représentant des " virophages " .
L'analyse de son génome ouvre de nouvelles perspectives .
Il constitue une sorte de mosaïque avec une vingtaine de gènes codant pour des protéines existant dans ... les trois grands domaines du vivant : les organismes eucaryotes ( animaux , plantes , champignons ) , les bactéries et cette autre catégorie de micro-organismes que sont les archæa .
Une découverte qui vient bouleverser quelques certitudes de cette science encore toute jeune qu'est la virologie .
Jean - Yves Nau
On June 20 , The New York Times published a report saying that more than 100 Israeli aircraft carried out an exercise in early June over the eastern Mediterranean Sea and Greece .
The article pointed out that the distances covered were roughly the distances from Israel to Iranian nuclear sites and that the exercise was a trial run for a large - scale air strike against Iran .
On June 21 , the British newspaper The Times quoted Israeli military sources as saying that the exercise was a dress rehearsal for an attack on Iran .
The Jerusalem Post , in covering these events , pointedly referred to an article it had published in May saying that Israeli intelligence had changed its forecast for Iran passing a nuclear threshold — whether this was simply the ability to cause an explosion under controlled conditions or the ability to produce an actual weapon was unclear — to 2008 rather than 2009 .
The New York Times article , positioned on the front page , captured the attention of everyone from oil traders to Iran , which claimed that this was entirely psychological warfare on the part of the Israelis and that Israel could not carry out such an attack .
It was not clear why the Iranians thought an attack was impossible , but they were surely right in saying that the exercise was psychological warfare .
The Israelis did everything they could to publicize the exercise , and American officials , who obviously knew about the exercise but had not publicized it , backed them up .
What is important to note is that the fact that this was psychological warfare — and fairly effective , given the Iranian response — does not mean that Israel is not going to attack .
One has nothing to do with the other .
So the question of whether there is going to be an attack must be analyzed carefully .
The first issue , of course , is what might be called the " red line . "
It has always been expected that once the Iranians came close to a line at which they would become a capable nuclear power , the Americans or the Israelis would act to stop them , neither being prepared to tolerate a nuclear Iran .
What has never been clear is what constitutes that red line .
It could simply be having produced sufficient fissionable material to build a bomb , having achieved a nuclear explosion under test conditions in Iran or having approached the point of producing a deliverable nuclear weapon .
Early this month , reports circulated that A.Q. Khan , the former head of Pakistan 's nuclear program who is accused of selling nuclear technology to such countries as Libya , North Korea and Iran , had also possessed detailed design specifications and blueprints for constructing a nuclear weapon small enough to be mounted on missiles available to North Korea and Iran .
The blueprints were found on a computer owned by a Swiss businessman , but the reports pointedly said that it was not known whether these documents had been transferred to Iran or any other country .
It was interesting that the existence of the blueprints in Switzerland was known to the United States — and , we assume , Israel — in 2006 but that , at this point , there was no claim that they had been transferred .
Clearly , the existence of these documents — if Iran had a copy of them — would have helped the Iranians clear some hurdles .
However , as we have pointed out , there is a huge gap between having enriched uranium and having a deliverable weapon , the creation of which requires technologies totally unrelated to each other .
Ruggedizing and miniaturizing a nuclear device requires specializations from materials science to advanced electronics .
Therefore , having enriched uranium or even triggering an underground nuclear device still leaves you a long way from having a weapon .
That ’s why the leak on the nuclear blueprints is so important .
From the Israeli and American point of view , those blueprints give the Iranians the knowledge of precisely how to ruggedize and miniaturize a nuclear device .
But there are two problems here .
First , if we were given blueprints for building a bridge , they would bring us no closer to building one .
We would need experts in multiple disciplines just to understand the blueprints and thousands of trained engineers and workers to actually build the bridge .
Second , the Israelis and Americans have known about the blueprints for two years .
Even if they were certain that they had gotten to the Iranians — which the Israelis or Americans would certainly have announced in order to show the increased pressure at least one of them would be under to justify an attack — it is unclear how much help the blueprints would have been to the Iranians .
The Jerusalem Post story implied that the Iranians were supposed to be crossing an undefined line in 2009 .
It is hard to imagine that they were speeded up to 2008 by a document delivered in 2006 , and that the Israelis only just noticed .
In the end , the Israelis may have intelligence indicating that the blueprints did speed things up , and that the Iranians might acquire nuclear weapons in 2008 .
We doubt that .
But given the statements Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has made over the years , the Israelis have to be planning based on worst - case scenarios .
What the sum total of their leaks adds up to is an attempt to communicate widely that there is an increased urgency in dealing with Iran , based on intelligence that the Iranian program is farther along than previously thought .
The problem is the fact that the Israelis are communicating .
In fact , they are going out of their way to communicate .
That is extremely odd .
If the Israelis were intending to strike Iran 's nuclear facilities , they would want to be absolutely certain that as much of the equipment in the facilities was destroyed as possible .
But the hard truth is that the heart of Iran 's capability , such as it is , does not reside in its facilities but in its scientists , engineers and technicians who collectively constitute the knowledge base of Iran 's nuclear program .
Facilities can be replaced .
It would take at least a generation to replace what we already regard as an insufficient cadre of expertise .
Therefore , if Israel wanted not simply to take out current facilities but to take Iran out of the nuclear game for a very long time , killing these people would have to be a major strategic goal .
The Israelis would want to strike in the middle of the workday , without any warning whatever .
If they strike Iran , they will be condemned widely for their actions .
The additional criticism that would come from killing the workforce would not be a large price to pay for really destroying the Iranian capabilities .
Unlike the Iraqi reactor strike in 1981 , when the Israelis struck at night to minimize casualties , this strike against a more sophisticated program could not afford to be squeamish .
There are obviously parts of Iran 's nuclear capability that can not be moved .
There is other equipment that can be , with enough warning and with more or less difficulty , moved to unknown locations .
But nothing would be easier to disperse than the heart of the program — the people .
They could be moved out of harm 's way with only an hour 's notice .
Therefore , providing warning that an attack was coming makes very little sense .
It runs counter to basic principles of warfare .
The Israelis struck the Osirak reactor in Iraq in 1981 with not the slightest hint of the attack 's imminence .
That was one of the reasons it was successful .
Telegraphing your punch is not very smart in these circumstances .
The Israelis have done more than raise the possibility that an attack might be launched in 2008 .
They have publicized how they plan to do it .
Based on the number and type of aircraft involved in the exercise — more than 100 F - 15 and F - 16 fighter jets — one Israeli attack scenario could involve a third of Israel 's inventory of fourth - generation strike aircraft , including most of its latest - model F - 15I Ra'am and F - 16I Sufa fighter bombers .
If Greece were the target in this exercise , then the equivalent distance would mean that the Israelis are planning to cross Jordanian airspace , transit through Iraq and strike Iran from that direction .
A strike through Turkey — and there is no indication that the Turks would permit it — would take much longer .
The most complex part of the operation 's logistics would be the refueling of aircraft .
They would have to be orbiting in Iraqi airspace .
One of the points discussed about the Mediterranean exercise was the role of Israeli helicopters in rescuing downed flyers .
Rescue helicopters would be involved , but we doubt very much they would be entering Iranian airspace from Israel .
They are a lot slower than the jets , and they would have to be moving hours ahead of time .
The Iranians might not spot them but the Russians would , and there is no guarantee that they would n't pass it on to the Iranians .
That means that the Israeli helicopters would have to move quietly into Iraq and be based there .
And that means that this would have to be a joint American - Israeli operation .
The United States controls Iraqi airspace , meaning that the Americans would have to permit Israeli tankers to orbit in Iraqi airspace .
The search - and - rescue helicopters would have to be based there .
And we strongly suspect that rescued pilots would not be ferried back to Israel by helicopter but would either be sent to U.S. hospitals in Iraq or transferred to Israeli aircraft in Iraq .
The point here is that , given the exercise the Israelis carried out and the distances involved , there is no way Israel could do this without the direct cooperation of the United States .
From a political standpoint in the region , it is actually easier for the United States to take out Iran 's facilities than for it to help the Israelis do so .
There are many Sunni states that might formally protest but be quite pleased to see the United States do the job .
But if the Israelis were to do it , Sunni states would have to be much more serious in their protestations .
In having the United States play the role of handmaiden in the Israeli operation , it would appear that the basic charge against the United States — that it is the handmaiden of the Israelis — is quite true .
If the Americans are going to be involved in a strike against Iran 's nuclear program , they are far better off doing it themselves than playing a supporting role to Israel .
There is something not quite right in this whole story .
The sudden urgency — replete with tales of complete blueprints that might be in Iranian hands — does n't make sense .
We may be wrong , but we have no indication that Iran is that close to producing nuclear weapons .
Second , the extreme publicity given the exercise in the Mediterranean , coming from both Israel and the United States , runs counter to the logic of the mission .
Third , an attack on Iran through Iraqi airspace would create a political nightmare for the United States .
If this is the Israeli attack plan , the Americans would appear to be far better off doing it themselves .
There are a number of possible explanations .
On the question of urgency , the Israelis might have two things in mind .
One is the rumored transfer of S - 300 surface - to - air missiles from Russia to Iran .
This transfer has been rumored for quite a while , but by all accounts has yet to happen .
The S -300 is a very capable system , depending on the variety ( and it is unclear which variety is being transferred ) , and it would increase the cost and complexity of any airstrike against Iran .
Israel may have heard that the Russians are planning to begin transferring the missiles sometime in 2008 .
Second , there is obviously the U.S. presidential election .
George W. Bush will be out of office in early 2009 , and it is possible that Barack Obama will be replacing him .
The Israelis have made no secret of their discomfort with an Obama presidency .
Obviously , Israel cannot attack Iran without U.S. cooperation .
The Israelis ' timetable may be moved up because they are not certain that Obama will permit an attack later on .
There are also explanations for the extreme publicity surrounding the exercise .
The first might be that the Israelis have absolutely no intention of trying to stage long - range attacks but are planning some other type of attack altogether .
The possibilities range from commando raids to cruise missiles fired from Israeli submarines in the Arabian Sea — or something else entirely .
The Mediterranean exercise might have been designed to divert attention .
Alternatively , the Israelis could be engaged in exhausting Iranian defenders .
During the first Gulf War , U.S. aircraft rushed toward the Iraqi border night after night for weeks , pulling away and landing each time .
The purpose was to get the Iraqis to see these feints as routine and slow down their reactions when U.S. aircraft finally attacked .
The Israelis could be engaged in a version of this , tiring out the Iranians with a series of " emergencies " so they are less responsive in the event of a real strike .
Finally , the Israelis and Americans might not be intending an attack at all .
Rather , they are — as the Iranians have said — engaged in psychological warfare for political reasons .
The Iranians appear to be split now between those who think that Ahmadinejad has led Iran into an extremely dangerous situation and those who think Ahmadinejad has done a fine job .
The prospect of an imminent and massive attack on Iran could give his opponents ammunition against him .
This would explain the Iranian government response to the reports of a possible attack — which was that such an attack was just psychological warfare and could not happen .
That clearly was directed more for internal consumption than it was for the Israelis or Americans .
We tend toward this latter theory .
Frankly , the Bush administration has been talking about an attack on Iran for years .
It is hard for us to see that the situation has changed materially over the past months .
But if it has , then either Israel or the United States would have attacked — and not with front - page spreads in The New York Times before the attack was launched .
In the end , we tend toward the view that this is psychological warfare for the simple reason that you do n't launch a surprise attack of the kind necessary to take out Iran 's nuclear program with a media blitz beforehand .
It just does n't work that way .
But during the credit market upheaval in August , 14 percent of trades in these contracts were unconfirmed , meaning one of the parties in the resale transaction was unidentified in trade documents and remained unknown 30 days later .
In December , that number stood at 13 percent .
Because these trades are unregulated , there is no requirement that all parties to a contract be told when it is sold .
As investors who have purchased such swaps try to cash them in , they may have trouble tracking down who is supposed to pay their claims .
“ This is just a giant insurance industry that is underregulated and not very well reserved for and does not have very good standards as a result , ” said Michael A. J. Farrell , chief executive of Annaly Capital Management in New York .
“ I think unregulated markets that overshadow , in terms of size , the regulated ones are a real question mark . ”
Because these contracts are sold and resold among financial institutions , an original buyer may not know that a new , potentially weaker entity has taken over the obligation to pay a claim .
In late 2005 , at the urging of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , market participants agreed to advise their trading partners in a swap when they assigned contracts to others .
But it is unclear how closely participants adhere to this practice .
It would be as if homeowners , facing losses after a hurricane , could not identify the insurance companies to pay on their claims .
Or , if they could , they discovered that their insurer had transferred the policy to another company that could not cover the claim .
Credit default swaps were invented by major banks in the mid-1990s as a way to offset risk in their lending or bond portfolios .
At the outset , each contract was different , volume in the market was small and participants knew whom they were dealing with .
Palmer was inducted into the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2000
Drummer Earl Palmer , described by rock ' n ' roll pioneer Little Richard as " probably the greatest session drummer of all time " , has died aged 84 .
Palmer , who played on Little Richard 's hits including Tutti Frutti , died at his Los Angeles home after " a lengthy illness " , his spokesman said .
Other hits he drummed on include You 've Lost That Lovin ' Feelin ' by The Righteous Brothers .
In 2000 , he was inducted into the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame .
He appeared on the records of artists as diverse as The Monkees , Elvis Costello , Frank Sinatra and Neil Young .
Other records he performed on include Ike and Tina Turner 's River Deep , Mountain High and I Hear You Knockin ' by Smiley Lewis .
Ed Vodika , pianist in the Earl Palmer Trio - formed 10 years ago - said the drummer had " shaped American music for the ' 50s , '60s and ' 70s " .
" He worked with so many people in his career , you never knew who would be in the audience , " he added .
Palmer married four times and he is survived by seven children .
A quantum trick might be behind birds ’ ability to navigate using Earth ’s magnetic field lines .
Some researchers think birds might be able to “ see ” the magnetic field via photosensitive proteins in their retinas .
The theory is that when a photon strikes one of these proteins , it creates a pair of oppositely charged ions , which separate for a fleeting moment before recombining .
Each of these ions contains electrons with a quantum property called spin .
Initially , these spins point in opposite directions – but in a magnetic field , they tend to become aligned .
When the ions recombine , this alignment triggers a …

“ Well , if you ’re like me –explains the author , writer Robert Steven “ Corpsy ” Rhine– you like two things : beautiful girls and rotting corpses .
So , I thought , why not bring these two great tastes together in one magazine ? ”
Probably the world ’s most bizarre magazine in history , Girls and Corpses is sort of like Maxim Magazine meets Dawn Of The Dead .
There are pictures in each issue of beautiful , scantily clad young beauties posing with hideous , decaying , festering corpses .
As they would put it , “ so many corpses … so little time ” .

The Prison Workout
The Prison Workout .
New idea ?
Nah .
It ’s been around as long as there has been anyone locked up that is looking to stay in shape .
Still compelling ?
Absolutely .
Here is MDA ’s take on why we think it is worth another look , along with our own variations on this classic routine .
Why We Can Appreciate the Prison Workout :
1. Unlimited time
You have no excuses .
You ca n’t fall back on the most often used excuse to not get in shape .
2. Limited space
You do n’t get to decide whether you should go to the basketball court , to the gym , to the tennis court , to the park , ride your bike , play ultimate Frisbee with friends etc. etc. because you do n’t have a choice .
Your options are limited .
But this is a good thing .
You do n’t get bogged down with endless decision - making .
You ’ll be working out while Joe Schmo is still deciding what to do .
No specialized equipment , no gimmicks , no late - night infomercial tchotchkes , no gym membership .
You do n’t even have dumbbells .
It ’s just you .
In a room .
With endless potential .
The only thing stopping you from getting fit is your resolve to do so .
4 . Lone soldier mentality
There is something about being on your own .
There are no support groups or personal trainers .
No buddy system , and no lazy spouse to drag you down .
The results you achieve are all a result of your hard work .
It is you against everyone else in prison , so you better get in shape .
How is this Primal , you ask ?
It ’s intense , it builds muscle , it requires that you use your local environment and resources to get fit , and there is a survival - of - the - fittest aspect here .
Prison is n’t a fun place to be ( so we ’ve heard … ) .
You have to constantly be on guard , watching your back and ready to protect yourself at any moment .
If you are n’t prepared you ’re going to pay the price .
With this in mind you need to build functional strength .
The kind that allows you to sprint and move quickly , and fight when it is called for .
On the outside it is n’t everyday that we are put into survival - of - the - fittest or literal fight - or - flight situations , but it is always better to be prepared than to be a victim .
Prison Workout ?
Really ?
This is n’t for me …
We hear you , but you do n’t have to get yourself locked up to take part in the Prison Workout .
There are plenty of real - world applications .
Do it in your apartment when winter snow or spring rain keeps you indoors .
Do it when you are away on business and you only have a few minutes to spare in your dinky hotel room .
Do it at home so you do n’t have to pay for a gym membership .
Enough talking .
Let ’s get to the Prison Workout :
At the core of any self - respecting prisoner ’s workout regimen is THE BURPEE .
If you have never done one you are in for a world of hurt – especially if you are to attempt the holy grail of 20 descending sets .
Here ’s how :
The Burpee
From a standing position squat down , drop your hands to the ground and jump your feet back to assume a push - up position .
Do a push - up .
Jump your legs forward to between your hands then jump up into the air bringing your knees to your chest and your hands into the air over your head .
Repeat 20 times .
Doing this at any speed 20 times is enough to get anyone ’s heart rate up .
Now comes the really tough part .
Catch your breath before going into another set .
This time completing 19 burpees .
Catch your breath .
Now do 18 burpees .
Repeat until you have done all descending sets .
Variations include not starting with 20 .
Do a descending set starting from 10 or some other number .
Or do n’t do descending sets at all .
Instead do as many burpees as you can before you get to the pass - out / throw - up stage .
Also , you do n’t have to bring your knees to your chest .
This lowers the intensity considerably .
( Check out this video for a visualization of the possibilities , and this video that ups the ante by combining burpees with pull - ups . )
This is a full body workout and covers your bases for most muscle groups .
In fact , you could almost whip your body into shape by mastering this workout alone .
But if you want to take it to the next level here are some additional options when all you have is a 10 × 10 cell and an iron will .
Upper Body
Play Cards
We do n’t mean solitaire .
Get a deck of cards and some sort of receptacle – trash bin , cup , shoe , does n’t matter .
Sitting some distance from the target toss a card attempting to land it in the hole .
If the card does n’t make it and lands face up this is how many push - ups you will be doing .
( Face cards equal 10 . )
Do the whole deck .
Repeat if you ’re a tough guy or gal ( or if you are aces at tossing cards ) .
Everyone knows what a push - up is so I wo n’t explain the basics .
The important thing is to remember to keep your body level ( no sticking your butt up in the air … especially if you are actually in prison ) and to do the many variations on this old favorite – incline , decline , military , staggered hands etc .
Mix it up and watch your chest and triceps get shredded .
Watch this 19 Push - Up Variations video plus Jack Lalanne ’s crazy fingertip push - ups for ideas .
Tricep Dips
Put your hands on your prison chair or bed and dip your body toward the ground .
Variations ( from easiest to hardest ) include : feet on the ground with bent knees , feet on the ground with straight legs , feet up off of the ground on another piece of furniture ( toilet ? sink ? ) , and one foot on another piece of furniture while the other leg is raised in the air , alternating legs .
Pull - Ups
All you need is something overhead to grab onto .
Variations include overhand grip , underhand grip , wide grip , and narrow all with varying speeds .
Watch this Cross Fit video for inspiration .
Lower Body
Squat Jump
This is basically the burpee without the push - up part .
Squat from a standing position until your fingertips touch the floor and then explode upwards , leaving the floor and raising your arms into the air .
Repeat .
Your quads will start burning quicker than you probably expect .
Jump Lunge
From a lunge position jump upward bringing both feet off the ground at the same time and switch your stance ending in a lunge position with your other foot now in the front .
The speed and number of reps are up to you .
We recommend fast and max .
( Video example . )
Core
Planks
Try holding a plank for 3 minutes straight .
Sounds easy , right ?
Think again .
But , if you were a hardcore caged animal you could do it .
Do standard and side planks holding the position as long as you can .
Read this for more on planks .
Isometrics
Mark told us all about isometrics for abs in his post Washboard Abs on a High - Fat Diet , No Ab Workouts and No Cardio ?
So check it out for more info .
Hardcore Additions
Handstand Push - Ups
Do a handstand with your back facing and feet against a wall .
Once in the position lower your head towards the ground and then explode upward .
( Handstand Push - Up video example )
If you do n’t have the strength to do a Handstand Push - Up work your way up by doing the Pike Press ( video – FYI : You do n’t need a fancy swiss ball ) to build shoulder and tricep strength .
If you are really hardcore do n’t use the wall ( video ) .
Wall Squats
All you need is a wall for this simple move .
Put your back up against the wall and lower it until there is a 90 degree angle between your upper and lower legs .
Hold this position as long as you can .
Does n’t sound hardcore , you say ?
Try holding the position for 1 , 2 , 3 or even 5 minutes and then tell us it is n’t hardcore .
Just like with planks after a minute or two you ’ll be begging for mercy .
Check out this CrossFit tutorial for video instruction .
That ’s two Hardcore Additions added to our Prison Workout routine .
We ’ll leave the rest up to you , fellow Apples .
CrossFitters , too !
We know you ’re out there and have something to add .
So hit us up with a comment and tell us what your favorite tight - quarters exercise regimen includes and how ours could be even more extreme .
Note :
This routine may not be for everyone , but there is plenty to be learned here by anyone that wants to stay in shape and has limited space and resources .

Posted by Big Gav in australia , concentrating solar power , csp , solar thermal , worley parsons
As solar thermal power is probably my favoured form of large scale clean energy , I was very pleased to see today 's press on a plan by Worley Parsons to build the world 's largest CSP plant in Australia - a 8.5 GW plant in the Pilbara - something I 've suggested here a few times , due to the concentration of industry in the area and the world leading solar insolation levels .
The Business Spectator reports - Dream solar system .
So much for those hoary old arguments that Australia could not possibly meet an ambitious renewable energy target of 20 per cent by 2020 .
Australian engineering firm WorleyParsons has unveiled an ambitious project to build up to 34 solar thermal power stations that could provide 10 per cent of the country ’s energy needs by 2020 .
The $ 34 billion project – each station could cost around $ 1 billion – would meet half of the 20 per cent renewable energy target that has been set by the Rudd Government for 2020 and could provide significantly more over time .
Worley Parsons hopes that the first solar thermal plant – using proven parabolic mirror technology in use in California for the pasts 20 years – could be built in Australia by 2011 .
Other solar thermal technologies would also be considered over time .
Peter Meurs , who heads the project , says each plant would be a " utility ” sized installation of around 250 Mw , the size of many gas and coal fired stations , and would most likely produce electricity at a cost of 15 c per kilowatt hour .
Meurs says the technology is ideal to meet Australia ’s “ peak energy ” requirements , the daylight hours when energy use surges as air conditioners and the like are turned on .
“ The generators used in solar thermal are the same as coal fired generators , ” he says .
“ They provide reliable power from when the sun comes up in the morning to when the sun goes down at night . ”
Solar thermal can also store energy for 24 hours or more , but the costs rise significantly in those circumstances .
Meurs says this is why solar thermal is best used with a base - load source such as coal , gas , or geothermal when the technology emerges .
While WorleyParsons has brought together a consortium to consider the project and is conducting the feasibility studies , it will not be an investor in the project .
This it will leave to consortium members including the likes of BHP , Rio Tinto , Wesfarmers , Delta Electricity , Woodside and Fortescue Metals .
Meurs says the project would not be feasible without the renewable energy target , noting that California and Spain had both generated large investments in solar thermal because of either renewable energy targets or generous feed in tariffs .
He says a carbon price would also help , although a minimum price per tonne had not yet been identified .
“ At around $ 10 investors would not be too enthusiastic .
$ 20 is better , and $ 50 is a very strong signal . ”
Meurs says Australia has the opportunity to become a world leader in solar thermal technology through the development , design , manufacture and operation of solar - thermal plants .
As well as expertise in grid integration .
“ We are at a tipping point for solar power . ”
Worley Parsons Ltd , Australia 's largest engineering company , says the Pilbara region of Western Australia could be a location for a $ 1 billion thermal solar power station .
The company made the comments after delivering a record profit for 2007 /08 of $ 343.9 million , up 53 per cent on the previous 12 months to June 30 .
It said the fiscal 2008 result was underpinned by acquisitions and strong demand for its oil and gas , and metals and minerals services .
WorleyParsons said commodity demand from China and India remained strong but the full extent of volatile economic conditions on the project development sector was unknown .
Despite the caution , the engineering group said the outlook for its minerals and metals division remained positive this year .
The company launched a proposal Tuesday to build a 34 250 - megawatt solar power station in Australia by 2020 with technology used in the United States over the past 20 years .
Nine groups , including Rio Tinto Ltd , BHP Billiton Ltd and Fortescue Metals Group Ltd , are funding a study to examine the potential development of the power stations .
The Managing Director of Worley Parson 's sustainability arm , Peter Meurs , says the search will focus on desert locations .
" The ideal location for a thermal solar power station is a desert type location , you want maximum solar with the least cloud cover or interference and our dry desert locations are ideal , " he said .
The Greens say the decision is an acknowledgment that clean coal technology is not achievable .
Green 's Climate Change spokeswoman , Christine Milne says it is a big boost for the renewable energy sector and should be supported by the Federal Government .
" This is really an acknowledgment that clean coal is never going to be achievable and the coal industry itself is leapfrogging clean coal and recognising the power of renewable energy and solar thermal in particular , " she said .

The ABC reports that the proposal has been greeted enthusiastically - Aust firm unveils plans to build ' world 's biggest solar plant '
Rock Band is ready for a comeback tour .
Today , Harmonix announced Rock Band 2 is set to ship for Xbox 360 this September and PS3 later in the year .
However , theis sparse on details , so we went straight to Harmonix to learn more .
We spoke with Lead Designer Dan Teasdale to get the full scoop on the mega - sequel .
Teasdale gave us his thoughts on user - created content , improving accessibility , upgrading last year 's model and more .
Time+to+get+the+band+back+together .+
The +interface+hasn't+changed+much,+but+why+fix+what's+not+broken?+
Yes .
We 've been developing Rock Band as a music platform from the start .
All of the songs that you 've purchased so far ( and will be able to purchase in the future ) are instantly playable and fully supported in Rock Band 2 .
We 've even added some cool new features that let you play your DLC in different ways , which I think people will be very excited to get their hands on .
Absolutely !
We 've been working hard with Microsoft and Sony to develop a way to share content between games , and we 're really happy that we 'll be the first game to support fully functional cross - title DLC .
As far as Harmonix is concerned , there 's no difference between " Rock Band 1 DLC " and " Rock Band 2 DLC " – we 're just releasing awesome songs every week onto the Rock Band platform , all of which are playable by the Rock Band titles that support DLC .
At Harmonix , we have a very clear method for making games – we innovate , then we perfect .
With Rock Band , we innovated by being the first full band game that you can play in your living room or online .
Rock Band 2 takes all the lessons we 've learned from making a multi- instrument music game , addresses them , then adds some amazing new ways for you to experience your music library that have never been seen in a music game before .
We 've been scouring forums and parties everywhere for what people liked and did n't like , and I 'm pretty confident we 've addressed everything I 've heard people ask for .
On that note , we 've also secured what I can easily say is the best setlist I 've ever seen in a music game .
The PR team would kill me if I revealed some early , but it reads like a who 's who list of rock music .
We have a couple of surprises that we 'll be announcing soon regarding this .
Rock Band 2 really is the ultimate rock experience , and I think people will find it hard going back to the original Rock Band after playing Rock Band 2 for a few minutes .
One of our biggest focuses of the design team has been to make the game " party safe . "
We 've made navigation improvements to Rock Band 2 across the board based on the feedback we 've been getting both from fans on forums as well as from our own personal experiences at Rock Band nights .
I 'm pretty sure John Drake ( Harmonix PR Coordinator ) will hit me if I confirm or deny anything , but I can say this :
We 've taken almost everything people have asked for in Rock Band and added it to Rock Band 2 , as well as including some " first time ever " features .

A Rice University computer science student whose disappearance eight months ago made national news was found Wednesday , not begging in the streets or roughing it in the wilderness , but using a laptop at the University of California , Berkeley .
Matthew Wilson , 21 , was in temporary custody today pending an evaluation after a campus police officer discovered him in a classroom , according to police .
" You do n't know how good I feel about this .
It is better than anything in the world , " his mother , Cathy Wilson , said by phone this morning from her home in Oklahoma .
" We know he is alive and physically OK , " she said .
" I 've got to gun it out there . "
As of this morning , he was being kept in a health - care facility , his mother said .
The San Francisco Chronicle reported that UC Berkeley Assistant Police Chief Mitch Celaya said late Wednesday that the laptop Wilson was using was stolen .
They have started a theft investigation , but no charges been filed .
Wilson had shaved off his beard since withdrawing $ 500 from his bank account and mysteriously leaving Houston in December and failing to turn in all of his exams .
He apparently did n't say goodbye to anyone or let them know where he was going or what he planned to do .
Wilson had applied to four universities , including UC Berkeley , but he enrolled at Rice because he received a full scholarship there , his mother said .
His disappearance touched off widespread speculation on what could have pushed him to abandon what many would see as a life of opportunity .
Some speculated that Wilson might have taken up an Into the Wild - type journey , such as what was portrayed in the 2007 movie about a college student who abandoned his life and headed for the wilds of California , Alaska and other places .
Wilson 's car was found in June , abandoned on a residential street in Berkeley .
Inside , police found a scattering of clothes and books , but Wilson apparently was no longer using the vehicle .
His family said he had n't touched his bank account or used his credit cards , and they were at a loss as to why he would retreat from his life .
Cathy Wilson said her son probably is in delicate shape and that she wo n't pepper him with questions about why he left or what he 's been doing .
" I 'm not going to say , ' Woe is me , Matthew , look what you 've put me through , ' '' she said .
" I want him to be all right .
If he is living a good life , fine .
If he is living on the streets , I 'm not going to have that . "
She suspects that the stress of trying to be excellent at school finally got to him .
As recently as two weeks ago , Cathy Wilson was on the Berkeley campus and the surrounding area to put up handbills regarding his disappearance .
B.J. Almond , a spokesman for the Rice University Police Department , said investigators are still gathering information about how Wilson was discovered .
" We 're real grateful to hear he 's alive , but we 're still trying to get all the facts straight " he said .
Private search groups had gotten involved in searching for Wilson .
His family , along with Rice , offered up to $ 25,000 for information on his whereabouts .

You can easily extract audio from video files such as avi , mpg , even flv ! into mp3 uses either mplayer or ffmpeg .
You can even record online stream into mp3 , such as stream from radio cast .
Lets begin with mplayer .
To extract audio from video files , use - dumpaudio option and specified the output filename with - dumpfile
mplayer - dumpaudio nodame_theme.flv - dumpfile nodame_theme.mp3
Okay check out the output :
file nodame_theme.mp3
Output :
MPEG ADTS , layer III , v2 , 8 kBits , 22.05 kHz , Monaural
Okay ,
The audio extracted from flv , so quality is quite low , haha .
But you can change the audio rate by using ffmpeg .
Let see how to use ffmpeg .
ffmpeg - i nodame_theme.flv - ab 128 - ar 44100 nodame_theme.mp3
- i is to specified input file , - ab audio bitrate , - ar audio sampling frequency
Let say what file tells you .
MPEG ADTS , layer II , v1 , 128 kBits , 44.1 kHz , Monaural
How about record online stream ?
First , find an online radio cast to try , you can have plenty of it from shoutcast .
mplayer - dumpstream http://64.236.34.97:80/stream/1005 - dumpfile smoothjazz.mp3
ffmpeg -i http://64.236.34.97:80/stream/1005 - ab 128 - ar 44100 smoothjazz.mp3

Australian cuisine is one of the most diverse types of cuisine in the world .
The proximity to the ocean provides a bounty of fresh seafood while its thriving agriculture also offers an extensive array of fresh fruits and vegetables all year round .
The indigenous Australians featured a very distinctive cuisine that made use of the native flora and fauna of the land they were living in .
The earliest inhabitants in Australia survived from hunting emu , kangaroo , and wallaby .
Meanwhile , they also used honey , bush berries and other similar types of fruits for preparing their dishes .
Food preparation and the type of food served varied from one region to another as it depended mainly on the availability of natural resources .
Modern Australian cuisine has seen a major transformation , thanks to global influences .
Fresh produce , as mentioned earlier , is heavily available in Australia .
The coffee culture in Australia is also unique .
Most coffee shops in Australia were not born out of coffee chains but were independent cafes introduced by immigrants from Europe .
In fact , coffee chains like Starbucks have a small market share in Australia ’s coffee industry .
Wine is another major component in the country ’s food and drinks culture .
With over 60 wine regions spread throughout the country , wine is , therefore , an integral part of the cuisine .
In fact , wine is also one of the biggest components that make up Australia ’s economy since they are fourth in the world in terms of exporting wines .

My Stories of Travel to Australia
There is nothing special about me .
After college , I went into construction , and worked hands on for over 15 years .
I hung steel on the NB Handy Building in Lynchburg Va .
I attended Mountain Productions Rigging School , I was Head Rigger for Showman Fabricators in New York City and installed the new ( at that time ) MSNBC Studios .
I also weld a little ( MIG only ) .
Since then , I have exclusively worked in architectural design , Computer aided drafting ( CAD ) .
( JPEGS of my work available upon request ) i do engineering specifications for commercial and residential new construction ( I am not an engineer ) .
A recent project put me in Atlanta ( last month ) for the installation of a project I designed the technical specifications for - commercial project involving massive steel structures , design weight bearing loads , and even THERMAL EXPANSION RATIOS .
That is my background .
Now , I will tell you this ; those buildings , all of them , were brought down by Controlled Demolition .
Of that , there is no question .
I have seen buildings collapse .
I have seen them collaspe in front of me .
The NB Handy project in Lynchburg fell over as we were working on hanging steel on the second to the last bay in the building .
It was just a steel skeleton at the time , but poorly placed anchor bolts in the concrete peers that supported it caused the building to start leaning as we were setting cross beams in an exterior bay section .
The entire thing leaned and then collapse , in a slow , progressive , manner - through the path of least resistance .
It fell over .
All still held together by the connections ( 1 1/4 " rated bolts ) .
In short , it did n't just " fall apart " into so many different pieces due to gravity .
No steel beams shot 300 yards across the street .
Buildings just do n't behave that way .
They are not designed to .
Period .
Now , you add that to all the f-ed up stories that NIST , FEMA , The 9/11 Commission Report , FBI , Popular Mechanics , the History Channel ... has told us .
Then you factor in the great work and research and investigations from people like Ryan , Jones , Griffin , and the 400 + Architects and Engineers , the 500 + Pilots , 9/11 Blogger , and the 300 + ex-Federal agents who have come forward to call for a new investigation into the events of Sept.11th ...
... you put all that together , and you get one huge stinking pile of s___ that they call " the official story " .
Now , I did n't know all of this the day it happened as some claim they did .
More power to them I suppose .
I had to come to this understanding very reluctantly ; kicking and clawing and arguing every inch of the way .
This is n't something you WANT to know about the country you have loved your entire life .
I was born in a little town in Virginia .
My father was career NAVY .
I remember holding his hand walking through Miller Park on July 4th , 1976 with my Mother , my Grandmother , and my brother .
I went to the Prom and drank PBR longnecks .
I watched rockets launch and Mohamed Ali fight live on my floor model console television .
I have been backstage of the Lincoln Center .
I stood at the feet of a seated Lincoln and read his words engraved in stone 20 feet high in our capital .
I love the country that is my home , but know this ; as I have learned through painstaking research and many years , this was not my country that did this , nor even my government .
This is a small group of fanatics ( terrorists ) who have proven time and time again that they just do n't care about the people they serve ; they actually have a visable distain for the American People as well as for our way of life .
They care about profit and power and nothing else .
They DO hate us for our freedom .
And that is quite obvious in how they have attacked the Constitution since Day 1 ( even before 9/11 ) .
So , that is my background , that is my evidence , and that is my conclusion .
I thank you for asking , Jonathan .

Now this is an oldskool topic , wardialling !
Some people still ask me about wardialling tools though , so here ’s one I found recently written in Python .
PAW / PAWS is a wardialing software in python .
It is designed to scan for ISDN ( PAWS only ) and “ modern ” analog modems ( running at 9.6 k bit /s or higher ) .
Wardialing tools are – despite their martialic naming – used to find nonauthorized modems so one can disable those and as result make access to the internal network harder .
For PAW list all numbers you want to be dialed into the ( text ) file “ dial.lst ” , one in each line – numbers only , no spaces , plus signs , dashes or slashes please .
For PAWS the numbers are accompanied by the ISDN modes to be tested in the ( text ) file “ dial.lst ” in the exact format you find in the example file ( you can delete individual ISDN types , though ) , one in each line – numbers only , no spaces , plus signs , dashes or slashes please .
A syntax check of any kind is effectively non-existant , so be careful .
Make sure the device your modem is attached to is set correctly in paw .py in the variable “ tty ” at the top of the file .
Then simply call “ ./ paw.py ” or “ ./ paws.py ” and watch – a verbatim full log will be written into paw_dialing .log where CR , LF and TAB will be translated into readable equivalents .
For PAW an additional summary will be written as CSV file in paw_dialing .

Nude self - portrait banned from art exhibition because artist 's nipples ' were too erect '
Banned : Organizers said Maxime Xavier 's nude self - portrait was too risque for public viewing
A celebrated artist 's nude self - portrait has been banned from an art competition because organisers deemed it to be too saucy .
Maxime Xavier was told that her nipples were too big in the picture and that it was therefore too risque for public viewing .
Maxime 's painting depicts her naked but for a sarong being held by a lover .
Maxime insists that her picture is no more explicit than nudes by artists such as Rubens exhibited in galleries worldwide .
But organisers of the art competition show in Lyme Regis , Dorset , insisted that she remove it .
Maxime , whose paintings of Sheikh Mohammed 's racehorses and racing legend Desert Orchid have been featured and sold around the world , branded the decision " crazy " .
She said : " It is ludicrous to say that the good people of Lyme Regis need to be protected from seeing my nipples .
" A few people on the organising committee told me that my painting could not be shown because my nipples were too erect .
" It is not as if I am knocking things off shelves with them when I go shopping .
" I use myself as the model in front of a mirror because it saves paying someone else and I paint late at night when I cannot expect another model to pose for me .
" I cannot apologise for my nipples being erect because , luckily , they have always looked this way .
" This is not hard or even soft porn .
It is just a beautiful , sensual painting with a lot of feeling in it .
" Nudes have been exhibited in galleries for hundreds of years .
The paintings in London 's National Gallery are far more explicit than this .
Do they want to close that down too ?
" I can not imagine anyone being offended in this day and age when we have Page 3 girls in newspapers . "
Maxime Xavier hides the nipples in her self - portrait , which the organizer 's said were too big for public viewing
Maxime has lived in Lyme Regis for ten years and runs her own gallery .
She has designed the town 's carnival brochure in the past and won the same art competition two years ago .
But this time around , she was asked to remove her painting .
She said : " I am well known for my work in town and everyone who has seen the painting in my gallery thinks it is harmless and that the ban is ridiculous .
Noone has ever objected to any of my work before .
" They should be promoting local artists rather than squashing them .
This is how I earn a living and I am very passionate about my art .
" The painting is called ' Possession ' .
It is a serious work and shows a man holding his lover tightly as if he owns her while she appears lovey - dovey . "
Mike Cawte , manager of the Town Mill gallery , said the painting had been deemed unsuitable .
He said : " This might be small town prudery but it is just a storm in a teacup .
" Various people were unhappy with Maxime 's painting .
" At this time of year the majority of our visitors are not artists .
They are holidaymakers , families with young children who come off the beach and see the gallery .
" It was just felt when the works were being hung that it was not quite right for the exhibition and we spoke to Maxime to see whether she wanted to submit something else , but she did not feel she wanted to . "
So why -- exactly -- do I not believe in God ?
In many of my writings about religion , I take my atheism as a given .
When I critique religion , or gas on about atheist philosophy , I generally start with the assumption that religion is a mistaken idea about the world and that atheism is a correct one , and go from there .
Which is generally fine with me .
If I always had to start with first principles -- on any topic -- I 'd get nothing written .
( Nothing interesting , anyway . )
But it occurred to me recently that a newcomer to my blog might think that I had n't carefully considered the question of God 's existence .
My arguments against God and religion are scattered all over my blog , and I do n't expect even my most devoted readers to read every single piece of my Atheism archives just to dig them all up .
So here -- largely for my own convenience , and hopefully for the convenience of readers both atheist and not -- is a summary of the Top Ten Reasons I Don't Believe In God .
Or the soul , or metaphysical energy , or any sort of supernatural being ( s ) or substance (s ) .
Something I can point to , and that maybe other atheists can point to , when theists ask , " But have you considered ...? "
( And since I 've probably missed some good ones , I 'll be asking for your own favorite arguments at the end of the piece . )
A couple of quick disclaimers first .
This is really just a summary : a summary of ideas that I , and other atheist writers , have gone into in greater detail elsewhere .
People have written entire books on this topic , and this post is n't an entire book ... nor is it meant to be .
If you 're going to critique me for oversimplifying , please bear that in mind :
It 's a summary .
It 's meant to be somewhat simple .
( I 'm giving links to my own writing and to other people 's that go into the ideas in more detail . )
And no , I do n't think any of these arguments provide a 100 % conclusive airtight case against God .
Not even all of them together do that .
And I do n't think they have to .
I 'm not trying to show that belief in God 's existence is absolutely impossible .
I 'm trying to show that it 's implausible .
I 'm trying to show that it is -- by far -- the least likely hypothesis for how the world works and why it is the way it is .
Oh -- and for the sake of brevity , I 'm generally going to say " God " when I mean " God , or the soul , or metaphysical energy , or any sort of supernatural being ( s ) or substance (s ) . "
I do n't feel like getting into " Well , I do n't believe in an old man in the clouds with a white beard , but I believe ... " discussions .
It 's not just the man in the white beard that I do n't believe in .
I do n't believe in any sort of religion , any sort of soul or spirit or metaphysical guiding force , anything that is n't the physical world and its vast and astonishing manifestations .
And here 's why .
( Divided into two parts , to keep it from being insanely long . )
1 : The consistent replacement of supernatural explanations of the world with natural ones .
When you look at the history of what we know about the world , you see a very noticeable pattern .
Natural explanations of things have been replacing supernatural explanations of them .
Like a steamroller .
Why the sun rises and sets .
Where thunder and lightning come from .
Why people get sick .
Why people look like their parents .
How the complexity of life came into being .
I could go on and on .
All of these things were once explained by religion .
But as we understood the world better , and learned to observe it more carefully , the religious explanations were replaced by physical cause and effect .
Consistently .
Thoroughly .
Like a steamroller .
The number of times that a supernatural or religious explanation of a phenomenon has been replaced by a natural explanation ?
Thousands upon thousands upon thousands .
Now .
The number of times that a natural explanation of a phenomenon has been replaced by a supernatural or religious one ?
The number of times humankind has said , " We used to think ( X ) was caused by physical cause and effect , but now we understand that it 's actually caused by God , or spirits , or demons , or the soul " ?
Exactly zero .
Sure , people come up with new supernatural explanations for stuff all the time .
But explanations with evidence ?
Replicable evidence ?
Carefully gathered , patiently tested , rigorously reviewed evidence ?
Internally consistent evidence ?
Large amounts of it , from many different sources ?
Again -- exactly zero .
Given that this is true , what are the chances that any given phenomenon for which we currently do n't have a thorough explanation -- human consciousness , for instance , or the origin of the universe -- will be best explained by the supernatural ?
Given this pattern , it seems clear that the chances of this are essentially zero .
So close to zero that they might as well be zero .
And the hypothesis of the supernatural is therefore a hypothesis we can comfortably discard .
It is a hypothesis we came up with when we did n't understand the world as well as we do now ... but that , on more careful examination , has never -- not once -- been shown to be correct .
If I see any solid evidence to support a religious or supernatural explanation of a phenomenon , I 'll reconsider my disbelief .
Until then , I 'll assume that the mind - bogglingly consistent pattern of natural explanations replacing supernatural ones is almost certain to continue .
More on this :
The Unexplained , the Unproven , and the Unlikely
2 : The inconsistency of world religions .
If God ( or any other metaphysical being or beings ) were real , and people were really perceiving him / her / it / them , why do those perceptions differ so wildly ?
When different people look at , say , a tree , we more or less agree about what we 're looking at : what size it is , what shape , whether it currently has leaves or not and what color those leaves are , etc .
We may have disagreements regarding the tree -- what other plants it 's most closely related to , where it stands in the evolutionary tree , should it be cut down to make way for a new sports stadium , etc .
But unless one of us is hallucinating or deranged or literally unable to see , we can all agree on the tree 's basic existence , and the basic facts about it .
This is blatantly not the case for God .
Even among people who do believe in God , there is no agreement whatsoever as to what God is , what God does , what God wants from us , how he acts or does not act upon the world , whether he 's a he , whether there 's one or more of him , whether he 's a personal being or a diffuse metaphysical substance .
And this is among smart , thoughtful , sane people .
What 's more , many smart , thoughtful , sane people do n't even think that God exists ... and the number of those people is going up all the time .
And if God existed , he'd be a whole lot bigger , a whole lot more powerful , with a whole lot more effect in the world , than a tree .
Why is it that we can all see a tree in more or less the same way , but we do n't see God in even remotely the same way whatsoever ?
The explanation , of course , is that God does not really exist .
We disagree so radically over what he is because we are n't actually perceiving anything that 's real .
We 're " perceiving " something we made up ; something we were taught to believe ; something that the part of our brains that 's wired to see pattern and intention ( even when none exists ) is wired to see and believe .

The Cosmic Shell Game , by Ebonmuse , on the Ebon Musings website .
The Argument from Divine Hiddenness , ditto .
3 : The weakness of religious arguments , explanations , and apologetics .
I have seen a lot of arguments for the existence of God .
And they all boil down to one or more of the following :
The argument from authority .
( Example : " God exists because the Bible says God exists . " )
The argument from personal experience .
( Example : " God exists because I feel in my heart that God exists . " )
The argument that religion should n't have to logically defend its claims .
( Example : " God is an entity that can not be proven by reason or evidence . " )
Or the redefining of God into an abstract principle -- so abstract that it can't be argued against , but also so abstract that it scarcely deserves the name God .
( Example : " God is love . " )
And all these arguments are incredibly weak .
Sacred books and authorities can be mistaken .
I have yet to see a sacred book that does n't have any mistakes .
( The Bible , for just one example , is shot full of them . )
And the feelings in people 's hearts can definitely be mistaken .
They are mistaken , demonstrably so , much of the time .
Instinct and intuition play an important part of human understanding and experience ... but they should never be treated as the final word on a subject .
I mean , if I told you , " The tree in front of my house is 500 feet tall with hot pink leaves , " and offered as a defense , " I know this is true because my mother / preacher / sacred book tells me so " ... or " I know this is true because I feel it in my heart " ... would you take me seriously ?
Some people do still try to point to evidence in the world that God exists .
But that evidence is inevitably terrible .
Pointing to the perfection of the Bible as a historical and prophetic document , for instance , when it so blatantly is nothing of the kind .
Or pointing to the complexity of life and the world and insisting that it must have been designed ... when the sciences of biology and geology and such have provided far , far better explanations for what looks , at first glance , like design .
As to the " We do n't got to show you no stinking reason or evidence " argument ... that 's just conceding the game before you 've even begun .
It 's basically saying , " I know I can't make my case , therefore I 'm going to concentrate my arguments on why I do n't have to make my case in the first place . "
It 's like a defense lawyer who knows their client is guilty , and thus tries to get the case thrown out on a technicality .
Ditto with the " redefining God out of existence " argument .
If what you believe in is n't a supernatural being ( s ) or substance (s ) that currently has , or at one time had , some sort of effect on the world ... well , your philosophy might be a dandy and clever one , but it is not , by any useful definition of the word , religion .
Again :
If I tried to argue , " The tree in front of my house is 500 feet tall with hot pink leaves -- and the height and color of trees is a question that is best answered with personal faith and feeling , not with reason or evidence " ... or , " I know this is true because I am defining ' 500 feet tall and hot pink ' as the essential nature of tree - ness , regardless of its outward appearance " ... would you take me seriously ?
More on this :
Oh , all over the place .
But probably most succinctly :

4 : The increasing diminishment of God .
This is closely related to # 1 ( the consistent replacement of supernatural explanations of the world with natural ones ) ; but I think it 's different enough to deserve its own number .
When you look at the history of religion , you see that the perceived power of God himself , among believers themselves , has been diminishing .
As our understanding of the natural , physical world has increased -- and our ability to test theories and claims has improved -- the domain of God 's miracles ( or other purported supernatural / metaphysical phenomena ) has consistently shifted , away from the phenomena that are now understood as physical cause and effect , and onto the increasingly shrinking area of phenomena that we still do n't understand .
Examples :
We stopped needing God to explain floods , but we still needed him to explain sickness and health .
Then we did n't need him to explain sickness and health any more ... but we still needed him to explain consciousness .
Now we 're beginning to get a grip on consciousness , so we 'll soon need God to explain ... what , exactly ?
Or , as Ebon Muse so eloquently put it , " " Where the Bible tells us God once shaped worlds out of the void and parted great seas with the power of his word , today his most impressive acts seem to be shaping sticky buns into the likenesses of saints and conferring vaguely - defined warm feelings on his believers ' hearts when they attend church . "
This is what atheists call the " God of the gaps . "
Whatever gap there is in our understanding of the world , that 's what God is responsible for .
Wherever the empty spaces are in our coloring book , that 's what gets filled in with the blue crayon called God .
But the blue crayon is worn down to a nub .
And it 's never proven to be the right color .
And over and over again , throughout history , we have had to go to great trouble to scrape the blue crayon out of people 's minds and replace it with the right color .
Given this pattern , does n't it seem that we should stop reaching for the blue crayon every time we see an empty space in the coloring book ?

5 : The fact that religion runs in families .
Here 's what I mean by this one .
The single strongest factor in determining what religion a person is ?
It 's what religion they were brought up with .
By far .
Very , very few people carefully examine all the religious beliefs currently being followed -- or even some of those beliefs -- and select the one they think most accurately describes the world .
Overwhelmingly , people believe whatever religion they were taught as children .
Now , we do n't do this with , for instance , science .
We do n't hold on to the Steady State theory of the universe , or geocentrism , or the four bodily humours theory of illness , simply because it's what we were taught as children .
We believe whatever scientific understanding is best supported by the best available evidence at the time .
And if the evidence changes , the understanding changes .
( Unless , of course , it 's a scientific understanding that our religion teaches is wrong ... )
Even political opinions do n't run in families as stubbornly as religion .
Witness the opinion polls that consistently show support of same - sex marriage increasing with each younger generation .
Even political beliefs learned from youth can and do break down in the face of the reality that people see and live with every day .
And scientific theories absolutely do this , all the time , on a regular basis .
Once again , this leads me to the conclusion that religion is not a perception of a real entity .
If it were , people would n't just believe whatever religious belief they were taught as children , simply because it was what they were taught as children .
The fact that religion runs so firmly in families strongly suggests that it is not a perception of anything real .
It is a dogma , supported and perpetuated by tradition and social pressure -- and in many cases , by fear and intimidation .
Not by reality .
More :
I have n't written about the " religion running in families " argument at length before , and while I 'm sure it must have been addressed in the atheosphere , offhand I do n't know where .
But Richard Dawkins addresses it in The God Delusion .
You can look it up there if you like .
I have , however , discussed religion as an idea perpetuated largely by fear , intimidation , tradition , and social pressure ... and the ways religion armors itself , not only against criticism , but against the very idea that religion is a legitimate target for criticism .
That discussion : Does The Emperor Have Clothes ?
Religion and the Destructive Force of Asking Questions .
End of Part One .
I 'm breaking this up into two parts , since it 's already ridiculously long ; Part Two will appear tomorrow .
I realize this will probably be a fruitless plea , but if you can stand it , please hold your comments until Part Two is posted : I may have already addressed your ideas there , and anyway , that way all comment threads can be in the same place .
Thanks .
The Houston Chronicle obtained an advance copy of Ron Paul ’s prepared remarks for the press conference he is holding Wednesday at the National Press Club in Washington , D.C. Joining him will be third party presidential candidates Bob Barr ( Libertarian Party ) , Chuck Baldwin ( Constitution Party ) , Ralph Nader ( Independent ) , and Cynthia McKinney ( Green Party ) .
According to the Chronicle :
While Paul will say these individuals have strong philosophical differences on various issues , “ they all stand for challenging the status quo — those special interests who control our federal government . ”
“ People will waste their time in voting for the lesser of two evils , ” according to Paul ’s prepared remarks .
“ Reject the two candidates who demand perpetuation of the status quo and pick one of the alternatives that you have the greatest affinity to , based on the issues . ”
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Real estate prices continued to post steep year - over - year declines during the three months ended June 30 , according to a new report from the National Association of Realtors ( NAR ) .
Nationwide , the median existing single family home price plunged 7.6 % to $ 206,500 in the second quarter , down from $ 223,500 in the same period of 2007 .
The median price represents the point at which half of all homes sold for more and half sold for less .
A record number of foreclosures helped drive down prices , according to NAR .
In fact , foreclosures and short sales accounted for about one third of all existing homes sales .
" Banks price homes to sell , " said Patrick Newport , real estate economist with Global Insight , a forecasting firm .
" When demand for homes drops , ordinary sellers will take their homes off the market , let them sit or reduce their prices in small increments .
But banks will slash prices to where the homes will sell quickly . "
Poor economic conditions are also hurting the housing market , according to Nicholas Retsinas , Director of Harvard University 's Joint Center for Housing Studies , and may continue to take a toll .
During the boom , many housing markets thrived despite tough economies .
At the height of the frenzy in the Spring of 2005 , Stockton , Calif .
saw home prices climb by double - digits , even though the unemployment rate there hit 9.4 % .
" Now we 're getting into a time when the real economy is starting to affect housing markets more , " said Retsinas .
" It 's a little bit of a contest now .
Will lower prices stimulate home sales , or will the slowing economy slow down sales . "
Regional and local prices
Sun Belt metro areas led with price declines .
These areas ran up fabulous gains during the mid-2000s boom , but are experiencing even more severe declines during the bust .
In Sacramento , Calif . prices plunged 35.6 % year - over - year to $ $ 229,500 .
Cape Coral , Fla. saw a decline of 33.1 % , while prices in Riverside , Calif . dropped 32.7 % , and Los Angeles prices are down 29.6 % .
Las Vegas prices fell 23.6 % and Phoenix was down 22.5 % for the quarter .
More bargain hunting buyers are coming into the market , according to the Realtors association .
" The biggest home - sales gains over the previous quarter have been in some of the markets with the steepest and fastest price drops , " said Lawrence Yun , NAR 's chief economist .
" Buyers in these areas are responding to deeply discounted home prices . "
The biggest regional home price declines occurred in the West , where the median home price declined 17.4 % to $ 290,500 .
At the same time , sales in that part of the country increased .
Existing - home sales were up 25.8 % in California , 25 % in Nevada , 20.5 % in Arizona .
Prices in the South , at $ 177,000 , were almost flat , down just 0.9 % , while Florida sales saw an uptick of 10.1 % in the quarter .
The Northeast median home sold for $ 269,000 , down 9.6 % , and prices in the Midwest were down 4.1 % to $ 161,500 .
Among metro areas , Yakima , Wash .
posted the largest price increase , up 8.9 % year - over - year to $ 162,300 .
Binghamton , N.Y. was second with a price jump of 8.7 % to $ 120,900 .
The most expensive metro area in the nation is San Jose , where a median priced home cost $ 755,000 , off 12.7 % from 12 months ago .
The second most expensive area is San Francisco , where homes sold for a median of $ 684,900 , down 19.1 % .
Honolulu was third , with a median price of $ 636,000 , down 4.4 % .
Youngstown ,
Ohio is the nation 's lowest priced major market with a median price of just $ 71,700 , down 6.5 % from 12 months ago .
Elmira , N.Y. is the second - most affordable locale , with a median price of $ 76,400 , which was up 4.4 % year - over - year , followed by Saginaw , Mich. , which saw prices decline by 7.6 % to $ 80,300 .
Condo prices fell much less than single family homes , down just 3 % year - over - year to $ 220,000 from $ 226,900 .
A couple of cities actually recorded double - digit condo price gains , led by Syracuse , N.Y. , up 17.8 % to $ 144,900 , and New Orleans , up 15.9 % to $ 192,100 .
Houston condo prices rose 9.9 % to $ 141,100 .
Still , Global Insight 's Newport does not expect home prices to rebound anytime soon .
" Loan officers are reporting that they are still tightening underwriting standards , " he said .
" We expect that sales volume , which has leveled off some , will drop another 10 % over the next few months over this credit squeeze . "
Reduced demand for housing , combined with high home inventories and so many bank - owned properties on the market , are all factors likely to depress home prices for the foreseeable future .
Have you ever received a gift so bad that you were rendered speechless ?
At some point you have probably received a gift that just seemed totally inappropriate , insensitive or just plain thoughtless .
And perhaps you ’ve even given some ‘ stinky ’ gifts !
Giving is one of the real treasures in life , so everyone should take a little time and use some creativity to find and give the perfect gift !
In the spirit of inspiring you to give your future gift giving more consideration – here ( in no particular order ) are some of the 15 Worst Gifts of All Time !
From a boyfriend no less !
After months of dropping hints for an expensive bottle of perfume one holiday season , an acquaintance received a cactus from her boyfriend !
If that was n’t bad enough , the not so bright guy , wrapped the cactus in paper so that she received cuts on her hands as she unwrapped this stupid gift !
Imagine , opening a card to find out you are the proud recipient of 12 months of a religious magazine that ’s not even for your religion and on top of that you ’re not even particularly spiritual !
Blatantly shows how little the gift giver knew about the recipient !
Most of us have all been guilty of regifting at some point in time but this one takes the cake .
In this case , the original gift buyer had written a note in the book to the original recipient .
That recipient then crossed out the note with one line and regifted the book to a friend for his birthday !
How tacky !
O.k. while a Barbie Doll is a great gift for a six year old girl , it ’s totally inappropriate for a 12 year old boy who is into GI Joe ’s , Transformers and other such toys .
In this instance the gift recipient commented that it was the only time in his childhood that he was happy his dog ate one of his toys !
Here ’s another thoughtless gift – a friend received a ‘ B ’ pin from her mother - in - law when her initials are L.C. !
Is Mom getting passive - aggressive with her daughter - in - law ?
Uh-oh !
Unless you are giving the gift to the child ’s grandparent , it ’s safe to say that no one wants a huge , framed photograph of your baby or child ..
Can you believe that a co-worker I once knew gave her boss an 8x10 framed picture of her newborn baby ?
The worst part was that her boss did n’t know what to do and felt obligated to display this inappropriate gift !
If you are going to the trouble to bring a bottle of wine to friend ’s house as a housewarming or hostess gift , at least buy a decent bottle of wine .
No one wants to receive homemade wine that tastes like vinegar – I wish my father - in - law would realize that some things are n’t meant to be shared !
Every time we have a family gathering , he feels it ’s necessary to bring a huge bottle of his red swill !
There ’s not a lot of toasting going on when that bottle gets opened up !
A friend of mine told me this story … an ex-boyfriend got her a scale one Christmas .
It was a fancy digital scale with all the bells and whistles , but nothing says ‘ you should lose a few pounds ’ more than a scale !
Needless to say , that relationship did n’t last long !
Make a mental note men – a bathroom scale is not a good present !
O.k. underwear and socks just should n’t be given as presents .
First of all , underwear is a personal thing and unless you are buying sexy lingerie for a mate , just do n’t buy it for gift giving to anyone else .
Every year , my aunt gives my husband a three pack of tube socks and he always feels that this gift says ‘ I had no idea what to get you and this was quick , easy and cheap ’ .
Even if someone is on the stinky side , giving deodorant is rude !
I once heard a story about an employee receiving a three pack of deodorant during an office gift exchange !
Even if someone is difficult to buy for ( or smelly ! ) , please … never buy him or her deodorant !
This might be a good gift for a child , but not for a grown woman .
My mom gave me a ceramic bank in the shape of a shoe a couple of years ago under the premise that I was supposed to use it to save for something special .
Come on , is throwing my loose change into a piggy bank supposed to make me feel like a professional person capable of handling her own money – I do n’t think so !
This one goes without saying , but do n’t be so presumptuous as to give anyone an animal as a gift .
I ’ve heard too many sad stories where people are given pets as gifts that they just ca n’t keep .
Pets take time , money and commitment so be careful not to saddle someone with these responsibilities !
I do n’t care if knitting is your passion , no one wants to receive a homemade sweater with a tacky saying like ‘ friends are the best presents ’ .
Do n’t laugh , an acquaintance recently received a sweater that obviously took much time and effort to create , but with the schmaltzy saying , she just ca n’t bring herself to wear it in public .
What kind of gift is this ?
You mean I have to shell out cash to pay for one meal to get the other one for free ?
This actually happened , my friend ’s boss gave her this type of voucher , I think he meant that he ’d take her out for the lunch ( and presumably get her meal for free ) but it just came across as tacky .
Come on people ; shell out for a gift that is meant to be a gift , not a voucher you took from a fundraising coupon book !
My brother received a leather jacket from his wife for Christmas , it did n’t fit quite right so she returned it to the store for exchange – but she never got him another one !!
Maybe he should have held onto it , at least he ’d have some token of appreciation .
Hopefully these 15 terrible gifts are a fun way to get you thinking about your own gift giving .
So , if you happen to receive a terrible gift – try to remember it is the thought that counts and smile sweetly and say thank you !
How Much TV Commercial Length has Grown over the Years :
We all accept commercials as a necessary evil because they pay for the TV shows we watch .
But , how much is commercial time is reasonable to accept ?
This question was answered for me while watching a 2004 episode of Star Trek Enterprise .
The commercials came so often and lasted so long that is was almost impossible to maintain a sense of continuity with the show .
This situation got me wondering about how much the percentage of time given to a show is lost to commercials has increased over the years .
Thanks to the availability of video recordings of past shows this was easy to determine .
Scouring my video library I found shows ranging from 1952 to 2004 .
Combining these with currently aired shows provided the following :
1952 - 13 percent of the time was spent watching commercials ( only 4 minutes out of every half hour ! )
1958 - 13 percent
1961 - 1 8 percent
1963 - 20 percent
1964 - 18 percent
196 7 - 1 9 percent
1976 - 17 percent
1977 - 1 8 percent
1981 - 18 percent
1990 - 22 percent
1994 - 24 percent
2001 - 30 percent
2004 - 30 percent
2006 - 30 percent
2007 - 30 percent
2008 - 3 2 percent
2009 - 3 0 percent
2010 - 32 percent
2011 - 31 percent
2012 - 33 percent
2013 - 32 percent
2014 - 30 percent
2015 - 30 percent
2016 - 31 percent
2017 - 31 percent
NEW !!!
2018 - 32 percent
These were all for top rated , first airings of shows during prime time hours .
So , how did the show that kicked this little study off do ?
Would you believe that a full 35 percent of the air time given to Star Trek Enterprise in 2004 was sacrificed to commercials ?
And to make matters worse the end credits were pushed into the far right margin to make room for a side bar ad , the station logo was continually displayed in the lower right hand corner of the screen , and twice an annoying pop up add appeared in the left hand corner of the screen during the show .
Taking these into account the total effective commercial time was crowding 38 percent .
That means only 62 percent of the time was available to watch the show .
Another aspect of modern television that increases the commercial time , though not as distracting as actual commercials , is the " imbedded commercial . "
This is where a character uses or displays a product in such a way that the brand is clearly evident .
Cars and soft drinks are the two most common users of this technique .
Dates are useful bookmarks of significant turning points in history .
As far as commercials are concerned , February 2 , 2006 will be an important and depressing day to remember .
It was a Thursday night and I was watching Smallville when the imbedded commercial evolved from being covert ( hidden ) to overt ( obvious . )
Up to this time every imbedded commercial I 'd seen was low - profile in nature : you had to look for it to see it .
In this particular episode of Sma llville , the object of the imbedded commercial was Acuview contact lenses .
Instead of just discretely displaying the box , the actress held it up , label pointed directly at the camera , and said in a clear loud voice that Acuview contacts had solved a big problem for her .
Only more disturbing than the clumsy and amateurish way it was done was the fact that this marked a major turning point in commercial television .
If consumers let this catch on then such imbedded commercials could become so prevalent that the shows between commercials may soon become little more than multiple - product infomercials .
I kept an eye on the 2007 - 2008 season and am happy to report that the blatantly imbedded commercial did not proliferated .
Yes , characters still park cars so that the make and model are clearly visible , but they do n't use dialog to draw attention to it .
Correction : During a 2008 summer episode of Eureka , the lead star picked up a deodorant dispenser in such an awkward way to keep the label facing the camera that is was insultingly obvious it was a commercial .
Worse still , this was a science fiction show in which the actor was caught in a repeating time loop .
That 's right , the viewer was forced to watch the clumsy bit of imbedded commercialization every time the time loop repeated .

( Note : Percentage commercial time varies from show to show so those years with only a single show should be considered as having a large error bar . )
For those preferring a visual representation , here 's a chart of the percent of time spent watching commercials versus the year of the show :
The graph suggests there are two independent commercial inflation periods .
From 1952 to 1964 the percent increased very rapidly then suddenly leveled off at 18 percent .
After 20 years at this level it began increasing again , but at a slightly slower rate .
It appears that starting with 2005 the percent commercial time may have hit another plateau at 30 percent .
It will be interesting to see if this continues to be the case .
Perhaps the networks have discovered that adding more commercials drives people away from their shows .
An interesting change in the timing of commercials took place in 2009 .
Previously , the longest commercial breaks took place at the top of the hour when programs changed .
In Fall of 2009 I noticed that many programs jumped directly from the end of the previous program to the beginning of the next program .
Networks may have found that doing so prevents people from changing channels .
An interesting data point is that the commercial time for NCIS , the number 1 rated show in 2009 , was the lowest of the four shows measured .
I had expected it to be the highest because I assumed time fees are highest for the top ranked show so the owning network would want to fit in as many commercials as possible .
One difficult issue with commercial time is how to account for station identification logos in the lower right corner of the screen and pop-up animated video commercials that appear in the lower right of screens .
( I note that these never happen during commercials but only during shows . )
Calculations show that the station identification logos take up 1 - percent of the screen .
Since this is a loss of viewable content I subtract it from the total show time .
Animated pop-up video commercials in the lower left corner are so large , many time 25 - percent of the entire screen area , that they completely distract a viewer 's attention from the show in progress .
For this reason I count them as full commercials and their on - screen time is subtracted from the total show time .
I find this last intrusion the most offensive of all because the networks are sacrificing one show to plug another .
Additionally , rather than an extension to an existing commercial break they represent yet another break in the continuity of the show .
Consider , which commercial break profile creates the least distraction : a single 10 - minute commercial or 10 , 1 - minute commercials spread out through the entire show ?
Obviously , many short commercials are more distracting .
I predict pop-ups are going to be more common because they do n't give the viewer the opportunity to click away or do something else during them .
They also can't be fast - forwarded through if the show was recorded .
I 've seen a few that had their own musical sound track making them even harder to ignore .
There may come a time when a large section of the screen is covered with a windows showing constantly playing commercials .
One influence that might be helping to keep commercial time low is that manhy people are abandoning cable in favor of commercial - free , or at least reduced - commercial , streaming viewing .
( Note : I 'm happy to report that pop-ups do not appear to be escalating . )
Germany and France moved to isolate Ireland in the European Union yesterday , scrambling for ways to resuscitate the Lisbon Treaty a day after the Irish dealt the architects of the EU 's new regime a crushing blow .
Refusing to take Ireland 's ' no ' for an answer , politicians in Berlin and Paris prepared for a crucial EU summit in Brussels this week by trying to ringfence the Irish while demanding that the treaty be ratified by the rest of the EU .
The scene is now set for a major clash between the Irish and their European partners after a Dublin minister and sources in the ruling Fianna Fail party ruled out any chance of a second Irish referendum on the treaty .
Integration minister Conor Lenihan said this weekend that it was unlikely the treaty would be put to the Republic 's electorate again .
Meanwhile , senior strategists in Fianna Fail said it would be ' politically impossible ' for them to try to repeat what happened in 2001 - 02 , when Ireland first rejected the Nice Treaty but then held a second poll which voted in favour of it 12 months later .
' This time around , the turnout was high , so there can be no justification for it .
The government is caught in a political trap .
There are local as well as European elections in Ireland next year and Fianna Fail will not risk having to hold another referendum .
Within the next 12 months at the very least , there is absolutely no chance that Ireland will re-run Lisbon , ' one senior Fianna Fail source said .
Jim Murphy , the government 's Europe minister , warned that Ireland could find itself isolated .
' The Irish government need to come to the European Council meeting this week to tell us , the UK and other governments in the European Union how they think we should be taking this forward based on the sovereign decision of the Irish people , ' he said .
The Tories said that after the rejection of the treaty 's forerunner - the now abandoned EU constitution - by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , EU leaders should finally accept that their blueprint for reform was dead .
Shadow foreign secretary William Hague said : ' It is time to turn away from this whole centralising project and concentrate on things that really matter . '
However France 's Europe minister , Jean - Pierre Jouyet , said a search was on for a way to accommodate the Irish verdict without derailing plans to implement the treaty that aims to change how the EU is run and gives the Union its first sitting president and foreign minister .
The Franco - German plan is to get all 27 EU states to ratify the treaty as soon as possible , to quarantine the Irish and then come up with some legal manoeuvre enabling the treaty to go ahead .
It is not clear yet how or if this will succeed .
' The legal situation is clear , ' said a European Commission official .
' Unless the treaty is ratified by all , there is no treaty . '
Jouyet said that ' specific means of co-operation ' could be invoked to deal with Ireland .
' The most important thing is that the ratification process must continue in the other countries , and then we shall see with the Irish what type of legal arrangement could be found . '
' We 're sticking firmly to our goal of putting this treaty into effect , ' said the German foreign minister , Frank - Walter Steinmeier .
' So the process of ratification must continue . '
Angela Merkel , the German chancellor , who devoted most of last year to getting the EU 's members to agree on the Lisbon Treaty after the failure of the EU 's proposed new constitution in 2005 , said : ' We must carry on . '
The Franco - German refusal to countenance defeat may run into opposition in Scandinavia and eastern Europe , while David Cameron 's Conservatives will continue to pound Gordon Brown over his refusal to stage a referendum .
The first time I went through the exercise of writing a GUI design guide was in the early 1980 ’s ( very much pre-Windows ) .
In the years between I have written a moderate number of GUI applications , but most of my work has been non-GUI , so I often spend years not thinking ( much ) about GUI design .
My most recent task was to add a customized “ File ” “ Save As ” dialog to a desktop application .
Not too big a deal , but once running I had this nagging mental itch …
I knew there was something wrong , but could not first at figure out what was bugging me .
Pulled up and compared the File Open and File Save dialogs as used on Windows , Macintosh , and Gnome ( Linux ) .
Finally it clicked - they are all wrong .
Take the File Open dialog .
Choosing a file to open is a selection task - the file to open must already exist .
What is the first most - likely task ?
Choose a file from a ( short ) list .
The list could be most - recently - used names of saved files .
The list may be files in a particular directory .
Probably a bit of both .
What is the second most - likely task ?
Choose a location from a ( short ) list .
This is not a generic browse - anywhere - on - disk gadget .
This is an application - dependent list of a small number of places where you might have files to open .
Less likely is the need to browse to an arbitrary location on disk .
This is where “ progressive disclosure ” kicks in , with the expectation that most users will never need or want to see this part of the user interface .
This is entirely different organization than the usual File Open dialog , and the usual dialog is wrong .
The first task should be the first thing in the dialog , not buried amid a bunch of controls you are mostly not going to use .
The interesting bit here is that of all the platforms , the Gnome File Open dialog is - not perfect by any means , but the closest to fitting the task .
Guess I need to pay more attention to the Gnome folks . :)
This is not about “ dumbing down ” the user interface for average users .
This is about “ smarting up ” the work done by the programmer .
Think about this … if your application has ever saved files , should n’t that list of saved files show up in the File Open dialog ?
Of course , the standard File Open dialogs do not fit this usage .
Seems pretty silly that the list of “ recently used ” files ( when supported ) are not available as an immediate choice when opening a file .
The File Save dialog is for an entirely different task .
What is the first most - likely task ?
Entering an name for the new file to be saved .
What is the second most - likely task ?
Changing the location where the file is to be stored .
Again , this is a short list , not anywhere on disk .
Less likely is the need to browse to an arbitrary location on disk .
Again , this is the point to apply “ progressive disclosure ” .
Again , note this is different from the usual File Save dialog , and the usual dialog is wrong .
Again , the Gnome File Save dialog is a notch above pretty much everyone else .
Looking at the new dialogs in Windows Vista , without doubt I find the visual appearance “ cool ” … but not well designed for the task .
Bit disturbing that - as I Microsoft with all their money can afford to hire good user interface design folk .
What has gone wrong ?
Update : Two added notes .
First , I do not have access to a Macintosh ( last Mac I used regularly was a Lisa ) so I have to go off screenshots on the web ( seem to remember looking at a design guide on Apple ’s site ) .
Not ideal - so the OS / X behavior is only a guess .
Sure wish Apple had OS / X in a VM for developers , so I could test web applications and web - launched applications to insure compatibility .
Second , the recently - used - files list ( when present ) is both finite and distinct from the File Open dialog - both of which are silly as default behavior .
The history of recently opened files should be accessible from the File Open dialog .
Using the same notion , the File Save dialog should “ remember ” the recently used directories for saved files .
You want a single locus of attention in either case .

Here ’s our picks for most ridiculous political ads ( so far ) from the 2008 campaign trail .
If there ’s one thing I love about politics , it ’s the political ads .
Basically you get to distill complex policy decisions into 25 - 60 second advertisements that will , in all likelihood , be riddled with leaps of logic and poorly constructed arguments .
But hey , it ’s television right ?
Here ’s 8 of the most ridiculous political ads we ’ve seen so far from the 2008 presidential race .
1. John McCain – Obama The Celebrity
What does Obama have in common with Britney Spears and Paris Hilton ?
According to this ad , none of them are ready to lead .
So it makes sense to put them all together in a political ad .
2. Hillary Clinton – If You Ca n’t Stand The Heat
The stock market crash .
Pearl Harbour .
The Cold War. No Gas. Osama Bin Laden .
Judging by the onslaught of imagery , you ’d think you ’re about to watch a documentary on 20th century history .
Instead , you get Hillary Clinton .
3. John McCain – Obama Is The One
Another attack on Obama that bizarrely seems to highlight his leadership as “ the one . ”
Oh yes , and there ’s Moses .
4. Hillary Clinton – Jack Nicholson Approved
Speaking of movies , Jack Nicholson decided to announce his support for Hillary with an ad highlighting scenes from his distinguished career .
Unfortunately , the only thing you come away with is how old Jack looks at the end of the segment .
5. Mike Huckabee – Chuck Norris Approved
A classic .
Chuck Norris does n’t endorse …he tells America how it ’s gonna be .
6. John McCain – Obama And Change
Obama wants change .
Change apparently means putting your head on the Statue of Liberty ?
This will leave you scratching your head .
7. John McCain – The Mccain Girls
True , this is n’t a political ad endorsed by any candidate , but it ’s too amazing for words .
This is why the Internet was invented .
8. Barack Obama – I Got A Crush On Obama
Not to be left out , Obama fans also want to share their love with the world .
Any ridiculous political ads I missed ?

Afghanistan : 10 French Soldiers Killed ; 21 Wounded ; Six Suicide Bombers Attack US Base ; Rockets Hit ISAF HQ August 19 , 2008
A convoy of French soldiers was ambushed 50 km east of Kabul .
The battle lasted for 24 hours and left 10 French soldiers dead and 21 wounded .
The ISAF HQ in Kabul was attacked by rockets but they missed .
An attack on a NATO base – called Camp Salerno – in Khost by six suicide bombers was repelled .
On Monday nine Afghans died when a suicide bomber attacked t he gate of the same base .
These are all signs of the increase in Taliban activities in Afghanistan .
The number of dangerous areas increases and even Kabul is now surrounded by unfriendly territories .
The main highway connecting Kandahar and Kabul was a major project of the US after the Taliban were pushed back in 2001 .
But now heavy attacks on the road increase and it is impossible to drive along without protection .
The Afghan Army has to occupy former Soviet positions along the road to protect the road .
The NATO troops are getting more and more tense .
Firing as soon as they fear an attack .
Which is another big success for the Taliban .
The NATO troops are more and more alienating themselves .
Every new dangerous area on the map is another success for the Taliban .
Because it means that they conquered the " hearts and minds " of the local people or the local governor / warlord .
The NATO troops seem to be weak they drive by by day but by night the Talibs rule the streets .
While the NATO comes by day and gives presents and tries sweet talk the Talibs come by night and chop of the hands of every suspected traitor .
These are your options as a peasant .
Here is a BBC video about the situation on the Kabul - Kandahar - Highway .
( It ca n’t be embedded ) .
Btw . the last major Soviet operation in Afghanistan was an operation to free the highway to Khost .
Mocking Constitutional Rights
On the third day of the Republican National Convention , GOP vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin mocked Barack Obama for believing that individuals accused of terrorism actually have rights under the law .
Bookmark
Digg Email
Printer friendly " Al - Qaeda terrorists still plot to inflict catastrophic harm on America , ” Palin said , “ and he ’s worried that someone wo n’t read them their rights . ”
The implication was that those suspected of being terrorists have no rights under domestic or international law .
The line elicited thunderous approval from the party faithful gathered in St. Paul , Minnesota .
As the GOP delegates cheered , civil libertarians were reminded of the contempt that the Bush administration has shown to basic legal principles in its prosecution of the “ war on terror , ” and the resounding approval these policies have gotten from the Republican Party as a whole .
Perhaps viewers at home even nodded in agreement when thinking of the “ catastrophic harm ” that some individuals would like to inflict on America , and how important it is to keep America safe at all costs .
But just outside the convention hall , police offered a stark reminder of how important those rights are , especially considering how broadly the term “ terrorism ” can be applied to just about anyone who speaks out against government policies .
Over several days of the convention , primarily peaceful Americans protesting the war in Iraq and the broader Republican agenda were targeted by aggressive police decked out in full riot gear and armed with Tasers , pepper spray , rubber bullets and tear gas .
An activist convergence center was raided , as were the homes of several protest organizers , and demonstrators were attacked , manhandled and arrested .
[ See Consortiumnews.com 's " Storm Troopers at the RNC . " ]
In the jails , protesters were mistreated and even tortured , some claim .
A 19 - year - old protester named Elliot Hughes alleged at a press conference that he had been beaten unconscious by police , who then banged his head against the floor to wake him up .
They then moved him to a separate cell where they put a hood over his head with a gag and used pain - compliance holds on him for about an hour and a half .
His injuries were severe enough that he checked himself into a hospital after being released from jail .
Journalists Arrested Several independent journalists were also arrested and manhandled , including Pacifica ’s Amy Goodman , the host of “ Democracy Now ! ”
As Goodman describes what happened to her and two of her colleagues , “ I was at the Xcel Center on the convention floor , interviewing delegates .
I had just made it to the Minnesota delegation when I got a call on my cell phone with news that Sharif ( Abdel Kouddous ) and Nicole ( Salazar ) were being bloody arrested , in every sense .
“ Filmmaker Rick Rowley of Big Noise Films and I raced on foot to the scene .
Out of breath , we arrived at the parking lot .
I went up to the line of riot police and asked to speak to a commanding officer , saying that they had arrested accredited journalists .
“ Within seconds , they grabbed me , pulled me behind the police line and forcibly twisted my arms behind my back and handcuffed me , the rigid plastic cuffs digging into my wrists .
I saw Sharif , his arm bloody , his credentials hanging from his neck .
“ I repeated we were accredited journalists , whereupon a Secret Service agent came over and ripped my convention credential from my neck .
I was taken to the St. Paul police garage where cages were set up for protesters .
I was charged with obstruction of a peace officer .
Nicole and Sharif were taken to jail , facing riot charges . ”
While what happened to Amy Goodman was no doubt deplorable as was the abuse that protesters endured in jail , what could be perhaps more chilling to the average American is the fact that other participants in the RNC protests are actually facing terrorism charges – on little to no actual evidence .
' Furthering Terrorism '
On the same day that Palin gave her speech mocking the rights of terror suspects , eight alleged leaders of an anti-authoritarian activist group called the RNC Welcoming Committee were formally charged with " Conspiracy to Riot in Furtherance of Terrorism . "
The eight are being prosecuted under a 2002 Minnesota state law modeled on the USA Patriot Act .
They now face up to over seven years in prison under the terrorism enhancement charge , with the only evidence against them apparently the testimony of law enforcement officials who infiltrated their organization .
Under the 2002 state law , a crime is considered to " further terrorism " if it is " intended " to " terrorize , intimidate , or coerce a considerable number of members of the public in addition to the direct victims of the act . "
If accused of " furthering terrorism , " individuals face a 50 percent increase in the maximum penalty they would receive for committing similar crimes ( such as vandalism ) that are not " intended " to " coerce " the public .
The language of the Minnesota law is eerily similar to the original Patriot Act , passed hastily in the aftermath of 9/11 .
Section 802 of the Patriot Act defines domestic terrorism as “ activities that ( A ) involve acts dangerous to human life that are a violation of the criminal laws of the U.S. or any state ; ( B ) appear to be intended ( i ) to influence policy of a government by intimidation or coercion ; or ( ii ) to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction , assassination , or kidnapping ; and ( C ) occur primarily within the territorial jurisdiction of the U.S. … ” Groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union and the American Bar Association have long objected to this definition , particularly the provision of ( B ) ( i ) .
The prohibition against seeking to influence government policy by “ intimidation ” is so vague and so subjective that virtually any act of civil disobedience or confrontational protest could fit under the definition , the critics have said .
Now it is clear that these concerns were valid .
While there have been other cases in which activists have been investigated by the FBI ’s Joint Terrorism Task Force and otherwise treated as “ terrorists , ” the arrest of these eight individuals clearly marks an escalation of what some have called “ the criminalization of dissent , ” and what others see as the merger of domestic law enforcement and the larger “ global war on terror . ”
RNC 8
The case of the “ RNC 8 ” reminds those engaged in protest activities that they need not actually commit a crime to be accused of terrorism .
As the National Lawyers Guild points out , “ The criminal complaints filed by the Ramsey County Attorney do not allege that any of the defendants personally have engaged in any act of violence or damage to property .
The complaints list all of [ the ] alleged violations of law during the last few days of the RNC … and seeks to hold the eight defendants responsible for acts committed by other individuals . ”
In other words , without a shred of physical evidence , and based solely on the testimony of police officers who infiltrated the RNC Welcoming Committee , these individuals are being held responsible for the alleged criminal actions of others simply because they were involved with a group that advocated disrupting the RNC with confrontational acts of protest .
At best , it can be considered guilt by association .
But if Sarah Palin and the Republican Party were to have their way , these individuals would not even have the ability to challenge these charges in court .
After all , they are accused of terrorism , and as the Republicans have made clear , those accused of terrorism do n’t have any rights – not even the right to habeas corpus , a centuries - old legal tradition that affords the accused the right to face their accuser and challenge their detention in a court of law .
This is a point that Barack Obama actually made as a follow - up to Palin ’s comment at the RNC .
Obama , who used to teach constitutional law at the University of Chicago , said on Sept. 8 that captured terror suspects deserve at least the right to file writs of habeas corpus challenging their detention .
Calling it “ the foundation of Anglo - American law , ” he said the principle of habeas corpus “ says very simply :
If the government grabs you , then you have the right to at least ask , ‘ Why was I grabbed ? ’
And say , ‘ Maybe you 've got the wrong person . ’”
In the case of the RNC 8 , the principle may be even more fundamental than that .
Without the right of habeas corpus , these individuals would never be able to face their accusers and see the evidence against them – which , according to their lawyers is nothing more than the accusations of police officers who infiltrated their organization .
But considering the direction that law enforcement has been heading , and the ever - growing equation of protest activism with “ terrorism , ” it is not inconceivable that someday defendants such as the RNC 8 may not even have the chance to defend themselves in court .
It is especially chilling how enthusiastically Sarah Palin ’s mockery of Americans ’ constitutional rights was received in St. Paul by the convention delegates .
And with the relative silence that the story of RNC protests and police abuse has received in the mainstream media , it is doubtful many would even notice if constitutional rights continue to be rolled back .

Regarding the Overcoming Masturbation Guide :
Hi Dave :
Given your involvement with Liberated Christians I thought you would be interested to know that the Mormon Masturbation letter you included is legitimate .
I can vouch for it .
I am a former Mormon who served a 2 year Mormon Mission about 17 years ago .
This letter was included in our missionary binder ( it 's no longer included ) .
It was a great source of amusement to most of us but the church and our Mission President took it very seriously .
To this day Mormon Missionary rules require missionaries to sleep in the same room ( though never the same bed ) to help avoid temptation .
The church still views masturbation as a sin severe enough to require face - to - face confession with their Bishop .
There are few things as humiliating as looking a religious authority figure in the eye and telling him you have engaged in " self - gratification " .
The normal punishment for this ( as I learned several times ) was not being able to participate in or partake of the Church Sacrament ( another form of public humiliation since in Mormon congregations the Sacrament is brought to you and you have to either shake your head no or pass it along without partaking ) .
I can laugh about it now but I certainly was n't laughing then .
An excerpt from a Mormon missionary guide , circa 1970 :
STEPS IN OVERCOMING MASTURBATION
Mark E. Petersen
Council of the 12 Apostles
Be assured that you can be cured of your difficulty .
Many have been , both male and female , and you can be also if you determine that it must be so .
This determination is the first step .
That is where we begin .
You must decide that you will end this practice , and when you make that decision , the problem will be greatly reduced at once .
But it must be more than a hope or a whish , more than knowing that it is good for you .
It must be actually a DECISION .
If you truly make up your mind that you will be cured , then you will have the strength to resist any tendencies which you may have and any temptations which may come to you .
After you have made this decision , then observe the following specific guidelines :
A Guide to Self - Control
Never touch the intimate parts of your body except during normal toilet processes .
Avoid being alone as much as possible .
Find good company and stay in this good company .
If you are associated with other persons having this same problem , YOU MUST BREAK OFF THEIR FRIENDSHIP .
Never associate with other people having the same weakness .
Do n't suppose that two of you will quit together , you never will .
You must get away from people of that kind .
Just to be in their presence will keep your problem foremost in your mind .
The problem must be taken OUT OF YOUR MIND for that is where it really exists .
Your mind must be on other and more wholesome things .
When you bathe , do not admire yourself in a mirror .
Never stay in the bath more than five or six minutes -- just long enough to bathe and dry and dress AND THEN GET OUT OF THE BATHROOM into a room where you will have some member of your family present .
When in bed , if that is where you have your problem for the most part , dress yourself for the night so securely that you cannot easily touch your vital parts , and so that it would be difficult and time consuming for you to remove those clothes .
By the time you started to remove protective clothing you would have sufficiently controlled your thinking that the temptation would leave you .
If the temptation seems overpowering while you are in bed , GET OUT OF BED AND GO INTO THE KITCHEN AND FIX YOURSELF A SNACK , even if it is in the middle of the night , and even if you are not hungry , and despite your fears of gaining weight .
The purpose behind this suggestion is that you GET YOUR MIND ON SOMETHING ELSE .
You are the subject of your thoughts , so to speak .
Never read pornographic material .
Never read about your problem .
Keep it out of mind .
Remember --
" First a thought , then an act . "
The thought pattern must be changed .
You must not allow this problem to remain in your mind .
When you accomplish that , you soon will be free of the act .
Put wholesome thoughts into your mind at all times .
Read good books -- Church books -- Scriptures -- Sermons of the Brethern [ sic , Cistern too ? ] .
Make a daily habit of reading at least one chapter of Scripture , preferably from one of the four Gospels in the New Testament , or the Book of Mormon .
The four Gospels -- Matthew , Mark , Luke and John -- above anything else in the Bible can be helpful because of their uplifting qualities .
Pray .
But when you pray , do n't pray about this problem , for that will tend to keep [ it ] in your mind more than ever .
Pray for faith , pray for understanding of the Scriptures , pray for the Missionaries , the General Authorities , your friends , your families , BUT KEEP THE PROBLEM OUT OF YOUR MIND BY NOT MENTIONING IT EVER -- NOT IN CONVERSATION WITH OTHERS , NOT IN YOUR PRAYERS .
KEEP IT _OUT_ of your mind !
The attitude of a person toward his problem has an affect [ sic ] on how easy it is to overcome .
It is essential that a firm commitment be made to control the habit .
As a person understands his reasons for the behavior , and is sensitive to the conditions or situations that may trigger a desire for the act , he develops the power to control it .
We are taught that our bodies are temples of God , and are to be clean so that the Holy Ghost may dwell within us .
Masturbation is a sinful habit that robs one of the Spirit and creates guilt and emotional stress .
It is not physically harmful unless practiced in the extreme .
It is a habit that is totally self - centered , and secretive , and in no way expresses the proper use of the procreative power given to man to fulfill eternal purposes .
It therefore separates a person from God and defeats the gospel plan .
This self - gratifying activity will cause one to lose his self - respect testimony becomes weak , and missionary work and other Church callings become burdensome , offerings .
To help in planning an effective program to overcome the problem a brieation is given of how the reproductive organs in a young man function .
The testes in your body are continually producing hundreds of millions of reproductive cells call spermatozoa .
These are moved up a tube called the vas deferens to a place called the ampulla where they are mixed with fluids from two membranous pouches called seminal vesicles and the prostate gland .
The resultant fluid is calleeminal vesicles are full a signa to the central nervous system indicating they are ready to benother , depending on such things as exercise , state of health , etc. everal times a week , for others .
It is normal for the vesicles to be emptied occasionally at night during the emptying of come from the cetral nervous system .
Often an erotic dream is experienced at the same time , and is a part of this normal process .
Instead ourse , the reproductive system is operating at a more rapid pace , trying to keep up with the loss of semen .
When he stops the habit , the body will continue to produce at his increased rate , for an indefese are not harmful and are to be endured until the normal central nervous system pathway of rel [ NOTE :

As one meets with his Priesthood Leader , a program for overcoming masturbation can be implemented using some of the techniques mentioned above .
Remember it is essential that a regular report program be agreed on , so progress can be recognized and failures understood and eliminated .
Suggestions
Pray daily , ask for the gifts of the Spirit , that which will strengthen you against temptation .
Pray fervently and not lout when the temptations are the strongest .
Follow a program of vigorous daily exercise .
The exercises reduce emotional tension and depression and are absolutely basic to the solution of this problem .
Double your physical activity when you feel stress increasing .
When the temptation to masturbate is strong , yell _STOP_ to those thoughts as loudly as you can in your mind and then recite a prechosen Scripture or sing an inspirational hymn .
It is important to turn your thoughts away from the selfish need to indulge .
Set goals of abstinence , begin with a day , then a week , month , year and finally commit to never doing it again .
Until you commit yourself to _never again_ you will always be open to temptation .
Change in behavior and attitude is most easily achieved through a changed self - image .
Spend time every day imagining yourself strong and in control , easily overcoming tempting situations .
Begin to work daily on a self - improvement program .
Relate this plan to improving your Church service , to improving your relationships with your family , God and others .
Strive to enhance your strengths and talents .
Be outgoing and friendly .
Force yourself to be with others and learn to enjoy working and talking to them .
Use principles of developing friendships found in books such as _How to Win Friends and Influence People_ by Dale Carnegie .
Be aware of situations that depress you or that cause you to feel lonely , bored , frustrated or discouraged .
These emotional states can trigger the desire to masturbate as a way of escape .
Plan in advance to counter these low periods through various activities , such as reading a book , visiting a friend , doing something athletic , etc .
Make a pocket calendar for a month on a small card .
Carry it with you , but show it to no one .
If you have a lapse of self control , color the day black .
Your goal will be to have _no black days_ .
The calendar becomes a strong visual reminder of self control and should be looked at when you are tempted to add another black day .
Keep your calendar up until you have at least three clear months .
A careful study will indicate you have had the problem at certain times and under certain conditions .
Try and recall , in detail , what your particular times and conditions were .
Now that you understand how it happens , plan to break the pattern through counter activities .
In the field of psychotherapy there is a very effective technique called _aversion therapy_ .
When we associate or think of something very distasteful with something which has been pleasurable , but undesirable , the distasteful thought and feeling will begin to cancel out that which was pleasurable .
If you associate something very distasteful with your loss of self - control it will help you to stop the act .
For example , if you are tempted to masturbate , think of having to bathe in a tub of worms , and eat several of them as you do the act .
During your toileting and shower activities leave the bathroom door or shower curtain partly open , to discourage being alone in total privacy .
Take cool brief showers .
Arise immediately in the mornings .
Do not lie in bed awake , no matter what time of day it is .
Get up and do something .
Start each day with an enthusiastic activity .
Keep your bladder empty .
Refrain from drinking large amounts of fluids before retiring .
Reduce the amount of spices and condiments in your food .
Eat as lightly as possible at night .
Wear pajamas that are difficult to open , yet loose and not binding .
Avoid people , situations , pictures or reading materials that might create sexual excitement .
It is sometimes helpful to have a physical object to use in overcoming this problem .
A Book of Mormon , firmly held in hand , even in bed at night has proven helpful in extreme cases .
In very severe cases it may be necessary to tie a hand to the bed frame with a tie in order that the habit of masturbating in a semi-sleep condition can be broken .
This can also be accomplished by wearing several layers of clothing which would be difficult to remove while half asleep .
Set up a reward system for your successes .
It does not have to be a big reward .
A quarter in a receptacle each time you overcome or reach a goal .
Spend it on something which delights you and will be a continuing reminder of your progress .
Do not let yourself return to any past habit or attitude patterns which were part of your problem .
Satan Never Gives Up . Be calmly and confidently on guard .
Keep a positive mental attitude .
You can win this fight !
The joy and strength you will feel when you do will give your whole life a radiant and spiritual glow of satisfaction and fulfillment .
The push toward green everything — green commuting , green shopping , green living , and even green computing — has exploded this year .
But , as we all know , some of these initiatives are easier to take part in than others , and the most successful ones generally require the least amount of effort .
With the launch of Forestle , " green searching " takes this trend to the extreme ; with nothing more than a web search , you too can help the planet .
Forestle.org is an independent , nonprofit site based out of Germany , and it was officially launched today after a period of beta testing .
Results are delivered through Google , so they are as good as one might expect from a favorite search engine .
So what 's this pony 's trick ?
According to the folks behind Forestle , all of the site 's income ( minus administrative costs , of course ) from sponsored links is donated to The Nature Conservancy 's adopt an acre program that helps to sustain the world 's rainforests .
Forestle founder Christian Kroll tells us that , as a result , 0.1 square yards of rainforest are " saved " with every single web search .
" Within our testing phase we already saved more than 15,000 square yards of rainforest , " he said .
In fact , as of this writing , the number appears to be up to 15,258 square yards , and the constantly - updated number appears on the main page of the site .
The company 's about page says that admin costs make up only five percent of Forestle 's overall income , and that Forestle will always remain transparent by posting financial reports on its site .
Using Forestle can be easier than just setting it as your home page , too .
The company offers plugins that work with Firefox , Safari , and Opera in order to let you use Forestle from your browser 's search bar .
I installed the plugin for Firefox , adding it to my list of available search engines and making it even easier to use Forestle to perform my everyday searches .
When you use the Forestle plugin , you can also use " indicators " to search specific sites .
For example , typing " amazon : : " before a search will let you search Amazon 's site — the same applies for others like " digg : : " , " ebay : : " , " weather : : " , and " dictionary : : " .
Of course , the downside to using Forestle is that it's not integrated with all of Google 's other services .
You wo n't get a link to your Gmail , or iGoogle , or Google Calendar at the top of Forestle , although the site does link to things like Google Image Search and Google Maps .
The only real advantage to using Forestle over Google is for the green benefits , but for those interested in Forestle 's work , the site has made going green about as simple as it could possibly be .
That quick 200 - point paring in the Dow 's loss earlier was likely due to the fact that the market was expecting another vote , Pimco fund manager Bill Gross told CNBC .
( Click on the video at left to watch the CNBC interview with Bill Gross . )
But lawmakers said there would n't be another vote today .
“ I honestly do n’t even know where we go from here , ” said Dave Rovelli , managing director of equity trading at Canaccord Adams .
“ It ’s impossible to quantify . ”
“ We were all in shock , ” Rovelli said of the mood on the trading floor .
“ The problem is , out in the boondocks , people do n’t realize what this means .
When they ca n’t get a loan at the bank , then they ’ll figure it out . ”
" If there is no package , there will be a tremendous hole in credit markets .
This must be passed , " Gross said .
" We do n't have a backup plan , " Rovelli added .
" You hate to say it but 10000 seems like a nice , round number that we may need to get to before we get people actually willing to buy some stocks , " Cheslock said .

Investors took some encouragement — though quickly forgot about it — from news that there was a resolution on another troubled bank , Wachovia , that was n't a federal bailout .
Citigroup is buying Wachovia 's banking operationsin a deal facilitated by the FDIC , after engaging in a brief bidding war with Wells Fargo .
More From CNBC.com
Wachovia shares plunged more than 80 percent to below $ 2 ; the stock did n't open until the afternoon and was only trading for about 1 1/2 hours .
Citigroup shares fell 12 percent .
Investors hammered shares of other banks , wondering which one might be next to fall .
Among the biggest decliners were Sovereign Bancorp , which fell 72 percent , National City , which lost 57 percent , and Fifth Third , which shed 44 percent .

Goldman Sachs lost 13 percent .
Meanwhile , Lehman Brothers sold its prized money - management unit , Neuberger Berman , to private - equity firms Bain Capital and Hellman & Friedman for $ 2.15 billion — a lot less than original estimates .
The Federal Reserve and other central banks announced an extraordinary move Monday morning — a massive liquidity injection — to try to revive paralyzed credit markets .
The Fed said it would inject another $ 330 billion of liquidity into the market .

As the U.S. government worked overtime to shore up its financial system , cracks started to show in the world financial sector as two European banks were nationalized over the weekend .
In the biggest European bank bailout since the credit crisis began , three governments jumped in to rescue Belgian - Dutch bank Fortis .
The Belgian , Dutch and Luxembourg governments took a 49 percent stake in Fortis with an 11.2 billion euro ( $ 16.4 billion ) injection .

Outside of the financial sector , technology stocks were the hardest hit as investors worried that a severe downturn in the global economy would drag down tech spending .
Apple , the most actively traded stock on the Nasdaq , fell 18 percent in its worst day since 2002 after several downgrades .
Analysts said it was n't so much that Apple was doing anything wrong as it was a worry about demand .
There has also been criticism that Apple does n't have an under - $ 1,000 computer in its lineup , something that would help soften the blow as consumers cut back spending .
The latest evidence of that came today , when the Commerce Department reported that consumer spending was unchanged in August , even as income rose 0.5 percent .
Shares of Apple rival Research In Motion fell 13 percent .
Shares of Google fell 12 percent to a nearly two - year low .

Circuit City has reported losses for five of the past six quarters .
Shares of rival Best Buy fell 6.5 percent .
Shares of Pilgrim's Pride slipped another 21 percent after plunging 72 percent last week .
The stock fell on warnings that earnings would take a hit because of restricted access to credit , a forecast seen as indicative of problems in the industry itself .
Pilgrim 's Pride said it received a temporary waiver on a credit covenant and retained advisers to review its operations and refinancing strategy .
The waiver will help provide liquidity .

LISBON , Sept 27 ( Reuters ) - Venezuela ’s leftist President Hugo Chavez said on Saturday it was the capitalist system that had caused the financial crisis in the United States and the country should come up with a new constitution .
Speaking to reporters in Lisbon on the last leg of a tour that included visits to China and Russia , he said : “ I think the United States should start a constituent process to create a constituent assembly , a new truly democratic model . ”
A constituent assembly is a body elected to draft and sometimes adopt a new constitution .
“ It was capitalism that caused the ruin ” in the United States , said Chavez , who is one of Washington ’s fiercest critics , calling the financial crunch “ the worst financial crisis in history ” .
“ Let the U.S. empire end and let a great nation and great republic rise from the ruin ...
It ’s time to shout ‘ Liberty ! ’ again in the United States , ” Chavez said , calling for a new government to be free of the “ dictatorship of the elite ” such as big banks and corporations .
Critics accuse Chavez of running an authoritarian , Cuban - style regime in oil - rich Venezuela .
Chavez , who has signed various deals from weapons to energy this week in China and Russia also signed an agreement with Portugal ’s Socialist government on Saturday to buy 1 million ultra-cheap laptops for schools and 50,000 pre-fabricated houses in deals worth $ 3 billion .
They also signed a draft deal between Energias do Portugal EDP.LS and Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA for the development of a liquefied natural gas project from the Blanquilla Este reserve in northern Venezuela .
The computers , which the government started distributing in Portuguese primary schools this week at a subsidised price of 50 euros ( $ 73.15 ) , will be delivered to Venezuela from December .
They cost 285 euros in stores in Portugal .
The laptop is based on Intel Corp 's INTC .O Classmate PC , a cheap computer that has been adopted in various formats in countries such as Brazil and Indonesia .

When the Fort Collins police arrested James and Lisa Masters and carted away their 39 marijuana plants , they put the plants where they normally put confiscated property involved in alleged crimes : the evidence room .
And there they sat , without a grow lamp , water or pruning .
A year later , the case against the Masterses -- who claimed they used the drug for medical purposes -- fell apart , and a judge ordered the police to return their property .
“ All the plants were dead , ” said Brian Vicente , one of the attorneys for the couple .
“ Some had turned to liquid -- this black , moldy liquid .
There was mold over everything . ”
Advertisement
Incensed , the couple asked the Police Department to reimburse them $ 200,000 for the destroyed plants .
City officials refused , and the Masterses are now considering a lawsuit to compel the northern Colorado city to compensate them .
Of the 12 states that have legalized marijuana for medical use , Colorado stands out for its law specifying that police must not “ harm , neglect or destroy ” seized plants in such cases , said Noah Mamber , legal services coordinator for Americans for Safe Access , an advocacy group .
But in the eight years since voters approved the law , no law enforcement agency has had to grapple with that aspect of it , said attorneys familiar with medical marijuana cases .
“ There ’s not a whole lot of case law on this , frankly , ” Vicente said .

Many situations are resolved without police seizing the plants because it becomes apparent to police that the suspect is authorized to have marijuana , said Rob Corry , another attorney for the Masterses .
In other states , police often destroy the plants during or after an arrest .
But that may be changing , Mamber said .
He cited a recent case in Burlingame , Calif. , where police found a number of marijuana plants and confiscated them until they could find the owner and ascertain whether he was a medical marijuana user .
He was .
Police in that case kept the plants less than a week .
They did n’t water or tend them during that time , Burlingame Police Capt .
Mike Matteucci said , adding that the department is not equipped to serve as a nursery .
The outcome of the Colorado case , he said , could help define law enforcement ’s responsibilities in such matters .
“ It ’s uncharted waters here , ” Matteucci said .

In 2006 , James Masters and his wife , Lisa , were arrested on suspicion of felony cultivation and intent to distribute .
At the time , they were growing marijuana for themselves and for at least five other people with medical problems , their attorneys said .
Lisa Masters , 33 , has fibromyalgia and tendinitis ; her husband , 31 , suffers from chronic nausea and pain from knee and hip problems , Corry said .
Both had doctors ’ recommendations that they ingest marijuana for their medical issues , but they had not joined the state ’s registry , Vicente said , because they could not afford the $ 110 fee .
Those in the registry may possess up to 2 ounces of marijuana and as many as six plants , and caregivers may keep up to six plants for each person in their care .
Because the Masterses were also serving as caregivers , Vicente said , they were allowed to have the 39 plants .
Because the Masterses were n’t listed in the registry , police treated the plants as they would evidence in any other drug case , said Fort Collins police spokeswoman Rita Davis .
Advertisement
“ At the time they were confiscated , they did n’t have documents to prove it was medical marijuana .
They have to have some proof , ” Davis said .
The Masterses ’ attorneys maintain that the law does n’t require people to produce documentation when claiming the marijuana is medicinal .
The law says that property should not be neglected or destroyed in cases “ where such property has been seized in connection with the claimed medical use of marijuana . ”
It does not specify a criminal penalty when the law is not followed .
In any event , Corry said , the Masterses did provide paperwork showing their doctors ’ recommendations that they use marijuana .
Advertisement
A judge eventually dismissed the charges , ruling that the police search had been illegal .
Until then , the Masterses , who have since joined the state registry , continued to use marijuana provided to them by others , Vicente said .
He argued that police should care for the plants they take just as they would an animal or child removed from a home .
“ If the police take your pit bull , do they put it in an evidence locker for two months or do they take care of it ? ” Vicente said .
“ We plan on holding the police accountable .
We ’re talking about people ’s medicine here . ”

Penis Contest
Three third - graders , a Jew , an Italian , and an African American are on the playground at recess .
The Jewish kid suggests that they play a new game .
" Let 's see who has the largest dick , " he says .
" Okay , " they all agree .
The Jewish kid pulls down his zipper and whips it out .
" That 's nothing , " says the Italian kid .
He whips his out .
His is a couple of inches longer .
Not to be outdone , the African American whips his out .
It is far the biggest , dwarfing the other two in both length and width .
The Jewish and Italian kid are stunned and amazed .
" Wow , that thing is huge ! " they exclaim .
That night , eating dinner at home , the African American 's mother asks him what he did at school today .

Oh , we worked on a science project , had a math test and read out loud from a new book ... and during recess , my friends and I played " Let 's see who has the largest dick . " " What kind of game is that , honey ? " says the mother .

Beinart Gallery ( Melbourne , Australia ) is dedicated to showcasing figurative artworks with surreal and imaginative themes .
We seek to bring the work of internationally renowned artists to Australia while highlighting emerging Australian artists , thus serving both our local art community and the international art community at large .
Our gallery represents a movement of highly skilled figurative artists who have resisted global art trends and remained true to their artistic visions .
Beinart Gallery is owned and directed jointly by Corinne and Jon Beinart .
The gallery was established in 2016 , but our role within this international movement spans almost two decades through publishing , curating , promoting and educating .
Over the years , we have been honoured to bring the works of numerous renowned international artists to Australia .
Our space has been graced by the impossibly intricate surrealist drawings of Miles Johnston , the gravity - defying architectural paintings of Cinta Vidal , the fierce , tender heroines of Jana Brike ’s paintings and the evocative ceramic creatures of Erika Sanada .
We have hosted solo exhibitions for celebrated Australian artists such as Shaun Tan , while providing greater exposure for talented emerging artists such as Beau White and Sam Yong .
While Beinart Gallery opened its doors in March 2016 , our beginnings trace more than a decade earlier .
In 2003 Jon launched the Beinart Collective , an online gallery featuring his own artwork as well as that of a number of like - minded Australian artists with a mutual affinity for highly detailed works with strange subject matter .
Soon the Collective expanded to include international artists from a range of related art movements , including Fantastic Realism , Pop Surrealism , Lowbrow , Dark Art and Magical Realism .
At its most active point the Collective hosted online galleries for over 600 artists and attracted a huge number of monthly website visitors .
The website included artist interviews , exhibition previews and articles , as well as a lively forum in which the artists connected , forming a community .
The website served not only artists but also their fans and collectors , who discovered new artists as well as new works by familiar artists .
Thus , the Collective was a fabulous resource for anyone interested in contemporary surrealism .
Alongside running the Collective website , Jon established Beinart Publishing in 2007 .
Its first release was Metamorphosis , a compilation of works by 50 figurative artists with surreal themes .
This book ’s success led to publication of Metamorphosis 2 in 2008 .
Following these published works were a series of monographs devoted to the life and works of renowned artists such as Laurie Lipton , Kris Kuksi and Chet Zar .
The publishing arm of Beinart released its final publication in 2012 .
The success of the Beinart Collective as an online resource and art community led , perhaps inevitably , to group exhibitions in brick - and - mortar galleries .
After curating smaller group shows in Australia for a number of years , Jon curated his first international group exhibition in 2010 .
In this exhibition and others that followed , Jon established and continued the practice of featuring emerging artists alongside their better - known peers , helping increase the visibility of newer artists and exposing collectors to a greater variety of works .
While the Collective had a reach doubtless far beyond what Jon had originally imagined , he and Corinne found another vision forming in front of them : that of their own brick - and - mortar gallery in Australia .
With the support of the community the Collective had fostered , Jon and Corinne were able to launch Beinart Gallery , a curated space devoted to masterful figurative artists who explore imaginative themes in their work , promoting Australian artists as well as international ones .
Beinart Gallery is more than a physical space .
Our gallery continues the former Collective ’s efforts to foster community within the art world , to expose people to new art and to educate .
Beinart Gallery maintains a strong
Web presence , including artist interviews and articles aimed at serving as a resource for artists .
It is hoped that by promoting these works and getting them out into the world , we will help light the imaginations of all who get to see them .

( CNN ) -- A Florida man is using billboards with an image of the burning World Trade Center to encourage votes for a Republican presidential candidate , drawing criticism for politicizing the 9/11 attacks .
Businessman Mike Meehan says he has put up three billboards such as this one around Orlando , Florida .
" Please Don't Vote for a Democrat " reads the type over the picture of the twin towers after hijacked airliners hit them on September , 11 , 2001 .
Mike Meehan , a St. Cloud , Florida , businessman who paid to post the billboards in the Orlando area , said former President Clinton should have put a stop to Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda before 9/11 .
He said a Republican president would have done so .
" I believe 9/11 could have been prevented if we'd had a Republican president at the time , " Meehan said Wednesday on CNN's " American Morning . "
But Democrats and Republicans are saying Meehan should n't be using a 9/11 image to make a political point .
" This is a blatant exploitation of that terrible tragedy for political and , perhaps even worse , personal gain , " Bill Robinson , the Orange County , Florida , Democratic Party chairman told CNN affiliate WFTV - TV in Orlando .
The local Republican Party called the billboard " inappropriate , " according to WFTV .
" There are many ways to convey the importance of national security in this election without going to extremes , and we encourage a constructive dialogue , " the Florida Republican Party said in a statement Tuesday .
According to Meehan , President Bush has done " an excellent job ... going after these terrorists . "
Watch Meehan 's take on terrorism and the election »
" You got to remember all the ... people that George Bush did catch and how much success he did have .
And we have n't had an attack on this soil since 9/11 , " Meehan said .
" Unlike Bill Clinton , who actually had bin Laden right in his hand and through the CIA and other high officials decide to get him go , " Meehan said .
In a 2006 interview with " Fox News Sunday , " Clinton said he authorized the killing of bin Laden in 2000 after the attack on the Navy warship USS Cole in Yemen , but the order was never carried out because U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies refused to certify that bin Laden was behind the Cole attack .
" I got closer to killing him than anybody has gotten since , " Clinton said in the 2006 interview .
Meehan also is using the billboard to promote his Web site , the republicansong.com , where he 's trying to sell copies of his song , " Please Don't Vote for a Democrat . "
The song goes beyond the national security issue , ripping Democrats on taxation and energy issues , too .
" They want to take the money from the hard workin ' man , and give it to the lazy folks that do n't give a damn , " Meehan sings .
Another verse takes on the oil issue .
" We 're not fightin ' for oil , we got plenty if we drill it , " he sings .
The song 's not a moneymaker , he said , just an effort to recoup some of what he 's invested in the billboards .
A copy of the song on CD cost $ 5 on the Web site , and the site points out that Meehan can be hired to perform at a " concert , party , meeting or event . "
" I 'm willing to pay the cost for the fact that our soldiers that have died protecting this country have paid a heck of a lot more than what these billboards cost , " Meehan told " American Morning . "
Florida resident Mary Anderson told WFTV she does n't see politics when she 's looking at the billboard .
" Just looking at it , I 'm not thinking about Democrat or Republican , I 'm thinking about the twin towers and all the people killed , " she told WFTV .

The stone would dwarf the Koh - i- Noor diamond in the British Crown Jewels
Miners in Lesotho have discovered a huge gem stone which may become the largest ever polished round diamond .
The stone weighs 478 carats and is the 20th largest rough diamond ever found , said Gem Diamonds .
The company said the uncut rock was recovered recently from the Letseng mine , owned by the company in Lesotho .
The diamond , which is as yet unnamed , has the potential to yield a 150 carat cut stone , and could sell for tens of millions of dollars , the company said .
Clarity
" Preliminary examination of this remarkable diamond indicates it will yield a record - breaking polished stone of the very best colour and clarity , " said the company 's chief executive Clifford Elphick .
It would be bigger than the 105 carat round - cut Koh - i- Noor diamond , which is part of the British Crown Jewels .
It would still be dwarfed by the Cullinan diamond discovered in 1905 , which was 3,106 carats uncut and yielded a teardrop shaped diamond of 530 carats called the Great Star of Africa .
The Letseng mine is owned by a mining company of which Gem Diamonds controls 70 % and the Lesotho government 30 % .
Some of you may start getting jobs out there .

You also do n't want to stay at your parents 's house anymore ... for various reasons .
So you get a job , earn money , so you can spend it any way you like .
Maybe you 've also figured out that if you can make your boss happy , you 're more likely to get a promotion or some kind of raise .
I have talked to several managers and I 've heard them talk about employees , and found out what makes the boss happy ; what you should do .
When you show up for work , do n't get there when your timer starts .
Be there , ready to start , at least 10 minutes beforehand .
Same with when your timer runs out .
Finish what you 're working on , and do n't ask for overpay .
You 'll make the boss happy , and get a chance at something alot better than simple overtime pay .
Now we 've got you coming early , and leaving late .
While you 're on the job , finish all assignments or tasks that your boss gives you on time , or even early if you can .
Guaranteed happiness for the boss .
When you 're done with a task , find something else to do , something productive .
Do n't let your boss come in and see you playing solitaire because you 've finished a task .
By showing initiative , your boss may be able to spot manager material in you !
There are hundreds of ways , and I 'm not gonna list them all , because they 're pretty straight forward .
Like having a smile on your face while you 're working .
Do n't complain .
Do n't beg for days off , or going home early .
Find ways to show that you care about your job , and the company you 're working for .
Do things that are not in your job description .
Be active in meetings , with good ideas , ways to improve the processes or company as a whole .
Do homework .
Basically , do alot of work that you 're not expecting to get paid for .
Bosses love that , and maybe now you 'll feel that you 're letting them take advantage of you , that 's not true .
You 're being tested !
You 're always being tested , so do your best and then some .
At the Rock the Bells festival on Sunday I asked some of the most important hip - hop artists in the game — and my heroes since childhood — what they hated most about the iPhone .
Whether they owned it or not , most of the stars had a good reason to dis the overhyped phone , and their answers ranged from the mundane ( Trugoy from De La Soul says it 's " too cute " ) to the slightly crazy ( dead prez 's M - 1 brought up the Matrix and Big Brother ) .
Only Wu - Tang 's Method Man could n't find a way to bring the pain — we expect a new single , " F - A - N - B - O - Y Man " , any day now .

‘ tell a lie ’ series by henry hadlow and ed cornish
second year central saint martins BA graphics students henry hadlow and ed cornish have put together a series of photographs which have been ‘ photoshopped ’ .
the inspiration behind the ‘ tell a lie ’ series stemmed from the misleading stories which tabloid news photographers tell through their manipulation of photographs , altering the story which was originally captured .
in response to this , hadlow and cornish decided that they would use a camera to actually mimic photoshop effects .

After eight years of inaction , carbon emissions policy may finally take a reality - based turn .
Both Republican senator John McCain and Democratic senator Barack Obama have proposed " cap- and - trade " ( CAT ) plans .
While McCain 's running mate , Alaska governor Sarah Palin , recently declared she does n't believe climate change is " man-made " , I 'll assume that McCain continues to support his plan .
There are two key differences between the candidates ' plans .
First , by 2050 , Obama would reduce emissions by 80 % of 1990 levels .
McCain stops at 60 % .
Second , Obama would use a market - based auction to allocate permits that power CAT policy , while McCain would simply give them to polluters , providing huge annual handouts to a favoured few at everyone else 's expense .
Let 's see why .
When you burn fossil fuels , emitted carbon harms the environment for everyone around you .
Because you do n't bear the costs you impose on others , they 're " external " , and this is known as a negative externality .
Economists have known for eons that with negative externalities , leaving a market alone - " free - market " policy - causes inefficiency in the form of too much pollution .
The only way to avoid this outcome is some sort of government intervention .
Period .
Under old - style " command - and - control " regulations , the government told polluters how much to emit , and that was that .
Pollution stays below the desired level , but this policy is inefficient , since some companies can reduce their carbon footprints more cheaply than others , and all that matters is the total amount emitted .
An alternative policy does n't restrict emissions , but imposes a per-pound tax on emitted carbon .
Producers that can reduce emissions for less than the tax will do so , while others will produce carbon and pay the tax .
In principle , the tax can be set to achieve any desired level of emissions reduction .
But the government might screw up .
Too high a tax brings unnecessarily high reductions in economic production .
Given today 's tax - phobic political climate , it 's more likely that the government would set the tax too low , with disastrous climatic results .
Enter cap - and - trade .
Government chooses the total quantity of carbon emissions ( cap ) and issues permits that companies can buy and sell ( trade ) .
Once permits are allocated , supply and demand determine the price of a permit , which acts just like a carbon tax : companies that can reduce emissions cheaply will sell permits and reduce emissions , while companies on the opposite side of the ledger will buy permits and keep emitting carbon .
The lower the cap , the higher the price .
CAT provides the benefits of both command - and - control and taxes : emissions wo n't top the cap , and the " right " companies will do the reduction .
Research suggests those permits will be worth real money - perhaps as much as $ 50 - $ 300 bn per year by 2020 .
That 's enough money to pay for an awful lot of campaign promises .
Obama would auction off the permits , using the proceeds for taxpayer rebates and investments in green energy sources to help offset CAT - induced increases in production costs , which themselves will lead to reduced employment and higher prices .
Basic fairness and common sense suggest that whatever pain CAT causes should be salved with shared benefits .
By contrast , McCain 's plan fails this fairness test .
While average taxpayers adjust to higher prices due to higher production costs , McCain would shower windfall profits on polluters ' shareholders .
As noted above , CAT is just like imposing a tax , together with a clever mechanism to ensure the chosen reduction in total emissions .
Refusing to auction off the permits , though , is just like letting polluters keep the revenue from a carbon tax .
Would anyone support that ?
Now , it 's true that CAT will increase polluters ' costs , reducing shareholder value .
But we could compensate shareholders with just 15 % of the permits ' value - a far cry from McCain 's 100 % gift .
Let 's leave aside the fact that McCain would reduce emissions by considerably less than Obama .
The simple fact is that McCain 's plan would provide the mother of all handouts , for no good reason .
An annual giveaway of hundreds of billions of dollars to polluters - just because they are polluters - is most certainly not the change anyone should believe in .
[ Note : due to an editing error , the second sentence of the second paragraph previously read " ... reduce emissions to 80 % of 1990 levels " .
It should have read : " ... reduce emissions by 80 % of 1990 levels " .
Apologies . ]
The campaign anticipated that the Obama campaign would attack Palin 's experience , to which they responded by claiming that she has more experience than he does .
They anticipated that some would compare Palin 's Alaska to Clinton 's Little Rock , although Palin , in this comparison , is the anti-establishment figure .
They anticipated that some would compare the pick to Dan Quayle , although Quayle had much more experience and never got along with Bush and was consistently undermined by Bush advisers like James Baker .
Apples and oranges .
Privately , one campaign official says they were aware of several of the more scurrilous rumors about Palin making the rounds of the blogosphere , although the official declined to " dignify " them with any comment .
They 've bragged that Palin opposed the famous " Bridge to Nowhere , " only to learn that Palin supported the project and even told residents of Ketchikan that they were n't " nowhere " to her .
After the national outcry , she decided to spend the funds allocated to the bridge for something else .
Actually , maybe it's more fair to say that coincident with the national outcry , she changed her mind .
The story shows her political judgment , but it is not a reformer 's credential .
Likewise , though she cut taxes as mayor of Wassila , she raised the sales tax , making her hardly a tax cutter .
She denied pressuring the state 's chief of public safety to fire her sister - in - law 's husband even though there 's mounting evidence that the impetus did indeed come from her .
Ostensibly to clear her name , Palin asked her attorney general to open an independent investigation — the legislature had already been investigating .
( I am told that the campaign was aware of the ethics complaint filed against her but accepts Palin 's account . )
McCain 's campaign seemed unaware that she supported a windfalls profits tax on oil companies and that she is more skeptical about human contributions to global warming than McCain is .
They did not know that she took trips as the mayor of Wasilla to beg for earmarks .
They did not know that she told a television interviewer this summer that she did not fully understand what it is that a vice president does .
Had McCain had the time or inclination to think about all of this , he still might have picked her .
Like him , she has a habit of kicking lobbyists out of her office .
Like him , she has a reputation for being a blunt speaker .
Like him , she has a rep for cutting spending , and unlike him , had the executive authority to do so , slashing more than 10 percent of the state 's proposed budget in 2007 .
Like him , she did not seem to care if she offended Republicans .
She was , as he told an interviewer , a soul - mate , one he recognized over the course of a single meeting with her last week .
That reinforced the sense he took away from their first encounter just six months ago .
There was a point in the spring when the media was abuzz with talk of “ plagiarism . ”
Apparently , Barack Obama and Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick ( D ) , who are friends , shared some a few rhetorical lines .
Politicians do this all the time , both Obama and Patrick had each other ’s permission , and there was nothing untoward about it .
The media flap lasted a few days before everyone suddenly realized how inane the story was , and the political world moved on .
I ’m wondering if we may be poised for yet another “ plagiarism ” flap .
CQ’s Taegan Goddard has the story .
A Wikipedia editor notices some similarities between Sen. John McCain ’s speech today on the crisis in Georgia and the Wikipedia article on the country Georgia .
They appear similar enough that most people would consider parts of McCain ’s speech to be derived directly from Wikipedia .
At one point in the speech , McCain described Georgia as “ one of the world ’s first nations to adopt Christianity as an official religion . ”
The Wiki page describes Georgia as “ one of the first countries in the world to adopt Christianity as an official religion . ”
This one was a little more interesting .
Here ’s the Wiki page ( emphasis added throughout ) …
After the Russian Revolution of 1917 , Georgia had a brief period of independence as a Democratic Republic ( 1918 - 1921 ) , which was terminated by the Red Army invasion of Georgia .
Georgia became part of the Soviet Union in 1922 and regained its independence in 1991 .
Early post -Soviet years was marked by a civil unrest and economic crisis .
… and here ’s the McCain speech .
After a brief period of independence following the Russian revolution , the Red Army forced Georgia to join the Soviet Union in 1922 .
As the Soviet Union crumbled at the end of the Cold War , Georgia regained its independence in 1991 , but its early years were marked by instability , corruption , and economic crises .
Taegan has a third , which was relatively similar , but not quite as blatant .
Now , I suppose the most obvious question is one of timing .
Is it possible the Wiki page was edited after McCain ’s speech , and that the person who changed Georgia ’s entry relied on McCain ’s speech for the content ?
I suppose , but if a Wikipedia editor noticed the similarities , it ’s likely that the Wiki page came before the speech .
Truth be told , McCain ’s done far worse than rely on lifted text for a speech .
Hell , practically his entire policy and political agenda was lifted from Bush ’s playbook , and few called that plagiarism .
Nevertheless , it strikes me as something of a gaffe , which when added to the list , points to an embarrassing situation .
McCain thinks Czechoslovakia is still a countrybetween Sudan and Somalia ; he ’s confused about how many U.S. troops are in Iraq ; he ’s confused about Iran ’s relationship with al Qaeda ; and he does n’t understand the difference between Sunni and Shi’ia .
And now , McCain can’t give a speech about the war in Georgia without relying on an online encyclopedia for content .
As Taegan added , “ It should be noted that Wikipedia material can be freely used but always requires attribution under its terms of use .
Whether a presidential candidate should base policy speeches on material from Wikipedia is another question entirely . ”
It ’s not a scandal , but it is embarrassing .

90 minutes !
Today I presented at Gnomedex 8.0 .
( My slides are here ) .
I started with a story about how Ponzi and Chris helped me demonstrate the networked effect with flickr and twitter for a nonprofit training , then told my story about the Case Foundation and Parade Magazine 's America 's Giving Challenge , and then I set up a real time fundraising challenge .
My first fundraising effort was to send Leng Sopharath to college her first year in November 2006 took 3 weeks to raise $ 800 .
In 2007 , Chris Brogan and 81 other people helped raise enough money in 24 hours for her college tuition and in a few days were able to raise enough to help support another student .
So , my challenge was :
Can this room of highly connected gnomedexers get 250 people to donate $ 10 by the end of the conference ?
I sent them to my tweet and asked them to donate and ask a friend or retweet .
Chris and Ponzi kicked it off by giving $ 100 on the stage .
( THANK YOU ! )

Buzz Bruggeman ( above ) said pass the hat .
Then I answered questions .
What I did n't see going on was the back channel ( captured by Marshall K in Iterasi in a cool slide show ) .
Geoff Livingston kicked it off by tweeting his donation .
Later Jeremy
Wright kept tweeting out matching challenges .
At 90 minutes , we raised $ 2,657 from 112 donors - plus whoever gave cash ( probably another 125 people giving a total of $ 902 ) .
Thank you .
The ball kept rolling - the combined total as of $ 3,774 .
THANK YOU GNOMEDEXers and everyone who contributed .
YOU ALL ROCK .
We 're solving real problems !

WASHINGTON — Congressional leaders and the Bush administration reached a tentative agreement early Sunday on what may become the largest financial bailout in American history , authorizing the Treasury to purchase $ 700 billion in troubled debt from ailing firms in an extraordinary intervention to prevent widespread economic collapse .
Officials said that Congressional staff members would work through the night to finalize the language of the agreement and draft a bill , and that the bill would be brought to the House floor for a vote on Monday .
The bill includes pay limits for some executives whose firms seek help , aides said .
And it requires the government to use its new role as owner of distressed mortgage - backed securities to make more aggressive efforts to prevent home foreclosures .
In some cases , the government would receive an equity stake in companies that seek aid , allowing taxpayers to profit should the rescue plan work and the private firms flourish in the months and years ahead .
In 2010 , Apple 's fourth - generation iPod touch got two cameras — one for shooting HD videos and photos , one for FaceTime chats .
In 2011 , the changes to the iPod touch are all based on the new iOS 5 , which brings with it iMessage , iCloud , notifications , and Game Center enhancements .
Physically , the player is unchanged , except now it 's offered in white .
The high - res Retina display remains crisp , colorful , and highly responsive to touch .
Since the ( $ 129 , 3 stars ) no longer supports video , the 8GB touch is the least - expensive video - playing iPod , starting at $ 199 direct — a $ 30 price drop from 2010 .
The other two models remain $ 299 ( 32GB ) and $ 399 ( 64GB ) .
Despite the hefty price , the iPod touch is still , by far , the best portable media player you can buy — and it retains our Editors ' Choice .
Design
There 's a new white model , which is white on the front face and mirrored on the back , but the touch retains its 2010 dimensions : 4.4 by 2.3 by 0.3 inches ( HWD ) and 3.6 ounces .
Apple 's custom A4 chip powers the device , and the super - sharp Retina display remains 3.5 diagonal inches and 960 - by - 640 pixels ( at 326 pixels per inch ) .
The touch 's left - hand panel houses two Volume buttons .
A headphone jack , a speaker , and a 30 - pin connector for USB computer syncing are on the bottom of the player .
The Power button sits up top , and the Home button remains below the display on the front panel .
There are two camera lenses — one toward the top of the display , and one on the back , in the top left corner , which is accompanied by a mic .
The mirrored back panel is excellent for checking your teeth on the sly , but it picks up fingerprints very easily .
In the box , you 'll find a Quick Start Guide , a proprietary USB cable for connecting the touch to your computer , and a pair of Apple signature earbuds .
It 's a good idea to upgrade those bass - deprived , ill - fitting earbuds to earphones , and our is a good place to start your search for the right pair .
User Interface
With the inclusion of iOS 5 , the iPod touch now becomes a messaging device .
It can also use the new iCloud function , which features iTunes in the Cloud , Photo Stream , and Documents in the Cloud , so you can share content wirelessly between your computer , your iPod touch , your iPhone , and your iPad .
Another useful new feature is Notifications , which works with just about any relevant app to keep you informed about updates and friends ' responses .
For more about what iOS 5 can do , check out PCMag 's , or read on here to discover some of the nuances that improve the iPod touch 's performance .
Audio and Video
Navigating the music menus on the iPod touch is completely intuitive .
First off , there are so many ways to do it — using CoverFlow , searching Artist or Song , or perusing playlists .
Apple has made everything fast and easy — scroll song or artist lists by dragging a finger or skip ahead to a letter on the scrollable alphabet on the right side of the screen .
The Now Playing view is a showcase for album art , and you can play music while you surf the Web , view photos , or even play games .
By itself , the iPod touch is a fine audio device — plug in a pair of good - quality headphones and you wo n't be disappointed with the frequency range and overall audio quality .
To my continuing disappointment , Apple still offers its stock , subpar earbuds .
Audiophiles listening to Lossless tracks on the touch will be best served by leaving the EQ off .
The settings Apple provides are presets ; there 's still no user - customizable EQ .
Extra features like Shake to Shuffle , Volume Limit , and Sound Check can all be enabled or disabled easily .
The iTunes Store can be accessed via Wi -Fi for on - the - spot music and video purchases .
Video looks fantastic on the Retina display .
YouTube and Netflix will not look as sharp as video purchased from the iTunes Store , of course , but the speed with which video can be cued up without stuttering is impressive .
Again , this is dependent on the strength of your Wi -Fi signal .
The touch integrates Bluetooth 2.1 + EDR and 802.11b/g/n
Wi -Fi , though 802.11n only operates on the 2.4GHz band .
Nike +
iPod support is also included for those who want to use the touch to help keep in shape .
Camera
The rear - facing camera records video in HD ( 720 p ) , up to 30 fps , capturing audio through the rear panel mic .
Still photos max out at 960 by 720 pixels .
This amounts to less than a megapixel , and compared with the ( $ 199.99 - $ 399.99 , 4.5 stars ) and its 8 - megapixel rear camera , the quality in images is stark .
( See the slideshow for a side - by - side comparison . )
The front - facing camera , intended for FaceTime video chat , offers lower resolutions : VGA - quality for photos and videos , again , up to 30 fps .
Camera operation could n't be more intuitive .
An onscreen slide control toggles between still and video camera modes , and an icon in the lower left takes you to your gallery , where you can peruse your photos and videos .
Video footage plays back onscreen with a scroll tool that shows a thumbnail timeline of your footage , making skipping to a certain spot easy .
You can trim your footage on the player by dragging your finder over the thumbnail timeline of the footage and selecting segments to cut .
Capturing video is achieved by pressing the red Record button onscreen when in video camera mode , and tapping it again to end recording .
The screen acts as your viewfinder and everything moves along in real time without stuttering .
Low - light situations will make for some noisy footage , but in well - lit scenarios , the touch 's video looks colorful and crisp .
Uploading your video to YouTube or sending it as an email attachment , provided you have a Wi -Fi connection , is made easy with a button in the lower left - hand corner of the screen that walks you through a streamlined process to do either .
Unlike the iPhone 4S 's camera , the iPod touch 's has no flash , which makes low - light — particularly back - lit — scenarios rather challenging .
You get 5 x digital zoom for photos , which is activated by moving the slider on the screen above the on - screen shutter button , but zooming in creates noticeable artifacts .
Landscape shots in adequate lighting look decent for a camera built into a player , and well - lit portraits look sharper than you 'd expect , provided you do n't zoom in too far .
Like videos , photos can be sent out immediately via email , or you can assign a photo to be your new wallpaper or a friend 's contact photo , all by pressing the lower left - hand button when viewing your image .
iMessage and FaceTime
iOS 5 brings iMessage to the iPod touch .
If you use an iPhone , the difference between an iMessage and a text message is pretty much undetectable — they appear the same in your Messages app .
However , iMessage uses Wi-Fi rather than a carrier 's signal , which means that Wi -Fi devices , like the iPod touch , are invited to the party .
Not invited : Devices not running iOS 5 .
Still , any friends of yours with an iPhone , iPod touch , or iPad can now be sent virtual texts via iMessage — all you need is a wireless signal .
This means you can send them photo and video straight from your iPod touch , too .
FaceTime still works quite well — images are fairly crisp and clear , aided by the smaller screen , and it 's easy to understand what your chat partner is saying .
Of course , this is contingent on your Wi-Fi signal being strong , but in ideal scenarios , it 's not much different than video chatting on a laptop .
However , Google Talk has a bit of an advantage over FaceTime , in that it works across multiple operating systems .
You can , for instance , chat on Google Talk between a ( $ 599 , 3.5 stars ) and an Apple laptop ; FaceTime , like iMessage , only works between iOS devices and some Apple computers .
But what began as a portable media player with no camera now has video chat and virtual text messaging capabilities — even with its iOS 5 - only limitations , that is quite impressive .
Gaming and Apps
In 2010 , Apple introduced Game Center , a feature that encourages you to find a friend — either someone you know or a stranger with an iPod touch or an iPhone — to play real - time games .
Your success ( or failure ) earns you a ranking you can use for bragging rights or to seek out opponents with similar skill levels .
With iOS 5 , Game Center gets a few new features , like the ability to purchase new games from within the app and add photos to your profile .
Meanwhile , the App Store , which is accessed via Wi -Fi , is loaded with single - player , accelerometer - driven games like Zombie Highway , that look fantastic on the Retina display .
There are more than 500,000 apps with a range far too wide to detail here .
If you 're familiar with the iPhone or iPod touches past , you know the possibilities are endless .
Web , Email , and Notifications
Surfing in Safari on the iPod touch is a great experience .
Now that the ( 4.5 stars ) , which was also a strong Internet device , is officially a relic , the iPod touch offers the strongest Web experience on any device this size that is n't a mobile phone .
Still , there are some annoyances .
Given Apple 's stance on Flash support , you should n't expect it on any iPod or iPhone anytime soon , and that 's the single advantage competing mobile browsers can offer .
Email remains easy to customize and use — AOL , Gmail , Yahoo Mail , Microsoft Exchange , and mobileMe remain options in the mail section , where you can also add an iCloud account .
Multiple accounts can be synced via Exchange .
With the new notifications features in iOS 5 , email notifications appear on - screen , as well as app notifications — say , when your opponent makes a new play or a friend comments on your Facebook post .
Notifications appear on the Lock screen ( Alerts ) , at the top of the home screen ( Banners ) , just over the app's icon ( Badges ) , and you can choose between various combinations of the three for each app — or to turn them off completely .
Battery Life and Conclusions
Apple rates the battery life for the iPod touch at an impressive 40 hours for audio and seven hours for video .
We ran two different battery rundown tests .
Playing music with Wi -Fi off and Auto - Lock set to one minute , we got a great result : 47 hours and 25 minutes .
Playing video with Wi -Fi on and the screen set to full brightness , we got 5 hours , 32 minutes of video playback .
At half brightness , we got more than eight hours .
That 's enough for a good day 's worth of use .
There are very few devices left that you can actually compare directly with the iPod touch , though both Sony and Samsung have announced , but not yet shipped Android - based PMPs .
Many manufacturers have thrown in the towel and are taking on slightly less daunting targets , like the iPod nano or the ( $ 49 , 3.5 stars ) , or are focusing on tablets instead .
The only real problem with the touch is its high price — especially if you want a decent amount of storage .
But with an entry point of $ 199 , you do get a camera , HD video recording , messaging and video chat , a music and video player , portable gaming , the Web , email , and apps all in one slick , pocket - size package .
It was true when it first debuted , and even more so now :
No other portable media player can compete with the iPod touch .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Americans scaled back their driving during June by almost 5 percent in response to soaring fuel costs , the government said on Wednesday -- a day after announcing the biggest six - month drop in U.S. petroleum demand in 26 years .

The Transportation Department said U.S. motorists drove 12.2 billion fewer miles in June compared to a year earlier , marking the eight month in a row that travel declined in the face of record gas prices as Americans change their driving habits , buy more fuel - efficient cars and switch to public transport .
“ Changes in consumer behavior have essentially erased five years of growth in gasoline demand , ” the American Petroleum Institute said on Wednesday in a separate report that showed gasoline use during the first seven months of 2008 fell by 2.1 percent to the lowest level for the period in five years .
The impact of driving less was also reflected in new Energy Department data released on Tuesday that said total U.S. petroleum demand shrank by an average 800,000 barrels a day during the first half of this year , the biggest decline since 1982 , because of soaring pump costs and a weak economy .
Since last November , U.S. motorists have driven 53.2 billion fewer miles than they did over the same period a year earlier , topping the 1970s total drop in U.S. miles traveled of 49.3 billion miles that was caused by several recessions and increases in gasoline prices over the decade .
The Transportation Department collects its highway data from more than 4,000 automatic traffic recorders operated around the clock by state agencies .
The presidential candidates have responded to voter angst over high gasoline prices by offering different solutions they claim will bring down short - term fuel costs .
Democrat Barack Obama wants to release 70 million barrels of crude from the U.S. emergency oil stockpile that he believes will immediately cut prices as more supplies are put into the market .
Republican John McCain wants to expand offshore drilling , which he says said would result in lower prices by sending a message to oil traders that the United States was serious about boosting domestic oil production .
The decline in miles traveled since last November has occurred the most in rural areas , where travel has fallen by 4 percent , compared to the 1.2 percent drop in urban miles traveled , the department detailed .
High fuel costs have the biggest effect on individuals in rural areas , who normally drive more and spend a larger share of their income on gasoline .
In response to soaring fuel prices , Americans appear to have given up their long love affair with big , gas - guzzling vehicles and are leaving them for cars that can save money at the pump .
U.S. automakers reported that car sales in July outpaced SUV and other light truck sales by 10 percentage points , with cars accounting for 55 percent of all vehicles sold .
Trucks sales had consistently made up the majority of vehicles sold between 1997 and 2007 , until rising gasoline prices encouraged consumers to switch to cars with better fuel economy .
“ Hopefully , the era of the Hummer and other gas guzzlers is over , ” said Daniel Weiss , energy expert at the Center for American Progress think thank in Washington .
Honda Motor Corp. , the industry leader in fuel efficient cars , is expanding its fleet in 2009 .
“ Small , fuel - efficient vehicles are not short - term strategies for Honda , ” Richard Colliver , executive vice president of Honda America said on Wednesday at a forum in Traverse City , Michigan .
“ I do think there has been a shift in consumer preference here , ” said Tim Evans , energy analyst for Citi Futures Perspective .
“ Over the intermediate to longer - term , I do n’t think automakers are going to risk building as many SUVs . ”
Many Americans are giving up the car altogether to get to work and instead are using public transportation .
“ Americans are beginning to drive less and less , ” Miami Mayor Manny Diaz , head of the U.S. Conference of Mayors , told Reuters .
“ America is beginning to change its habits , which I think is a good thing , and government investment ought to follow , ” he said , referring to more money for public transportation projects .
However , the downside of less driving for the government is fewer dollars to pay for highway projects and public transportation , which is funded by an 18.4 cent - per - gallon gasoline tax and a 24.4 cent - per - gallon diesel fuel tax .

Past accounts suggest Siegel and Shuster , both 17 , awkward and unpopular in high school , invented the meek Clark Kent and his powerful alter - ego , Superman , to attract girls and rise above their humble Cleveland beginnings .
But now it appears that the origin might have been more profound — that it was the death of Jerry Siegel 's father that pushed the devastated teen to come up with the idea of a " Superman " to right all wrongs .
" In 50 years of interviews , Jerry Siegel never once mentioned that his father died in a robbery , " says Brad Meltzer , a best - selling author whose novel , The Book of Lies , due Sept. 2 , links the Siegel murder to a biblical conspiracy plot .
" But think about it , " Meltzer says .
" Your father dies in a robbery , and you invent a bulletproof man who becomes the world 's greatest hero .
I 'm sorry , but there 's a story there . "
The first ' Superman '
The evidence for such a psychological underpinning is strong .
It was just a year after Mitchell Siegel 's death , 1933 , that writer Siegel and artist Shuster came up with " The Superman , " a grim , flying avenger they tried to sell to newspaper syndicates and publishers for five years .
In the oldest surviving artwork , this early Superman , whom they call " the most astounding fiction character of all time , " flies to the rescue of a man who is being held up by a masked robber .
Was it Jerry 's alter - ego flying to rescue his helpless father ?
" America did not get Superman from our greatest legends , but because a boy lost his father , " Meltzer says .
" Superman came not out of our strength but out of our vulnerability . "
The more Meltzer looked , the more intriguing things became .
A letter published in The ( Cleveland ) Plain Dealer on June 3 , 1932 , the day after the robbery , denounces the need for vigilantes in the harsh days of the Depression .
The letter is signed by an A.L. Luther .
" Is that where ( Superman foe ) Lex Luthor came from ? "
Meltzer says .
" I almost had a heart attack right there .
I thought , ' You have to be kidding me ! ' "
In search of answers Meltzer was not the only one looking .
Comic - book historian Gerard Jones first disclosed the fact of the robbery in 2004 for his book , Men of Tomorrow , after interviews with Siegel 's cousins .
" It had to have an effect , " Jones says .
" Superman 's invulnerability to bullets , loss of family , destruction of his homeland — all seem to overlap with Jerry 's personal experience .
There 's a connection there : the loss of a dad as a source for Superman . "
Although they never went public , the father 's side of the family was told for decades that the elder Siegel had been shot in the robbery .
That 's the dramatic angle Meltzer takes in his conspiracy novel .
Siegel was shot twice in the chest at his store , he writes , and " a puddle of blood seeped toward the door . "
In an afterword to his work of fiction , Meltzer concedes that the facts remain murky .
In an interview , Meltzer said that some in the family were told " since they were little kids " that Siegel died by gunfire .
Others were told he had a heart attack .
" It was probably a heart attack , " Meltzer said .
And yet Meltzer is not ready to embrace either answer as final .
More definitive is Marc Tyler Nobleman , author with artist Ross MacDonald of this year 's illustrated book Boys of Steel : The Creators of Superman , who concludes that Mitchell Siegel died of a heart attack during the robbery .
The coroner , he notes , reported " no wounds " on Siegel 's body , and the gunshot might not have been related to the robbery .
" I spent a long time going after this , " Nobleman says .
" I believe I have the first accurate account .
Jerry 's father was n't shot and robbed .
He had a heart attack during a robbery . "
A fortune sold for $ 130 The rest of the saga of Siegel and Shuster is better known , but no less tragic .
It was n't until 1938 that the familiar red-and - blue - garbed Superman appeared on the cover of Action Comics No. 1 .
The creators got a check for $ 130 .
In return , DC Comics acquired rights to the character " forever . "
Siegel and Shuster bristled as Superman grew in popularity — on radio , in wartime cartoons and serials in the 1940s .
They went to court several times , winning settlements but never rights to the character .
By the 1970s , Siegel had been working as a mail clerk for $ 7,000 a year , and Shuster was almost blind .
" A shameful legacy , " says Blake Bell , author of The World of Steve Ditko , a biography of the co-creator of Spider - Man .
Comic - book creators " had no pensions , no contracts , no health benefits , and companies did n't even pay for the artists ' supplies .
When these artists tried to negotiate greater rights for themselves , they were either collectively cast out or made false promises . "
After hearing that Warner Bros. had paid $ 3 million for the rights to make Superman the Movie in 1975 , Siegel and Shuster tried again to reap some benefits .
This time , though , they had help from the artistic community and from fans who knew their work .
In a landmark settlement , DC Comics agreed to pay the two men $ 20,000 a year for life .
More important , friends say , DC agreed to add " Superman created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster " on all printed and filmed material in the future .
" Having their names listed as Superman 's creators was the biggest victory of all , " says Steve Younis , editor of SupermanHomepage.com .
" It 's worth more than any kind of monetary reimbursement . "
The man who helped negotiate the Siegel and Shuster deal was artist Jerry Robinson , who co-created The Joker in 1939 but who received little recognition for decades .
( He 's now a creative consultant for DC Comics in the wake of The Dark Knight film . )
Robinson says he threw a party in his Manhattan apartment when the Siegel and Shuster settlement was announced .
" Kurt Vonnegut , Jules Pfeiffer , Will Eisner , Eli Wallach and his wife were there , " Robinson , 86 , says .
" Walter Cronkite came on , and they showed Superman flying , and he described what had happened .
At the end , he said , ' Another triumph for truth , justice and the American way . '
" We opened Champagne .
Jerry and Joe were there , and it was a very emotional moment .
There was n't a dry eye in the place . "
The struggle goes on Michael Uslan , executive producer of the six Batman movies since 1989 , including The Dark Knight , says there has been a " sea change " in how corporations view comic books and their creators .
" Here you have people in their 80s and 90s seeing their comic - book work being taken seriously , " Uslan says .
" They are deriving economic benefits now either directly or through consultancies . "
Shuster died in 1992 and Siegel in 1996 , but their legal battles have been never - ending .
In March , a court ruled that Siegel 's heirs ( wife Joanne and daughter Laura ) were entitled to parts of the billion - dollar Superman copyright .
Because of the ongoing litigation , neither the families nor DC Comics would comment , not even about Mitchell Siegel 's death 76 years ago or its implications .
But in an e-mailed response , the Siegel family did say , " It is gratifying to know people want to know about Jerry Siegel , and that he is getting recognition for his creativity . "

Fox guest uses ' anatomical slang ' to describe Palin David Edwards and Nick Juliano
Published : Friday September 19 , 2008
Print This Email This Keith Olbermann is outraged at the lack of outrage that greeted a Fox News guest 's use of a crude " anatomical slur " in reference to Sarah Palin 's appeal to female voters .
" This morning , a Fixed News guest used a word so outrageous about the governor 's anatomy , that had it been said by a Democrat or in any other venue , the conservatives ' phony outrage meter would have burst and Republicans might have been rioting in the street , " Olbermann exclaimed Thursday , approaching full outrage mode himself .
" But it was said on Fox , so it was just funny . "
In his most concerned tone of voice , Olbermann warned his viewers of the " sexist anatomical slang in here which we have not bleeped over " before showing a clip from Thursday 's Fox & Friends .
The crime in question ?
Bloomberg News 's Carolyn Baum said Palin would n't bring women to the Republican ticket just because " she has tits . "
Olbermann went on to highlight Palin's two night interview with conservative host Sean Hannity , accusing the Fox personality of lobbing softballs in an interview " that was slightly less hard hitting than one you 'd see on a late night infomercial . "
He displayed a minute long highlight reel of excerpts from the interview .
The criticism of Hannity going easy on Palin is certainly fair , although the same thing could be -- and was -- said of Olbermann 's own recent sit down with Democratic candidate Barack Obama .
As for the infomercial joke , Jon Stewart did it better on his own show .

“ This is very bad for the party , ” a retiring Senate Republican told Politico as news of Ted Stevens ’ indictment echoed across Capitol Hill on Tuesday .
| John Shinkle / POLITICO
Scandal rocks GOP , roils its plans
Beleaguered congressional Republicans woke up Tuesday morning thinking they ’d gained traction with their focus on offshore oil drilling and hoping that they could pin the “ culture of corruption ” on Democrats .
By lunchtime , the longest - serving Republican senator in history had been indicted on charges that he hid $ 250,000 in gifts from an oil company looking for favors .

Can it get any worse for the GOP ?
“ This is very bad for the party , ” a retiring Senate Republican told Politico as news of Ted Stevens ’ indictment echoed across Capitol Hill on Tuesday .
“ The timing on this could n’t be worse . ”
One year ago today , Stevens pleaded with his Republican colleagues to “ stay with me ” as he rode out a Justice Department investigation and an FBI raid on his Alaska home .
Now , there ’s an arrest warrant out for the 84 - year - old senator .
He ’s been stripped of his top committee rankings .
His iconic career is crumbling .
His hopes for reelection are in serious doubt .
And Senate Republicans have no idea what to do about it .
GOP Senate leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky was a congressional intern in 1964 , when Stevens was planning his first run for the Senate .
McConnell can’t and wo n’t ask a legend to resign , at least at this point .
The Senate ethics committee says it wo n’t do anything until the criminal case runs it course .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) has left the ball in McConnell ’s court , saying it ’s “ all up to [ Republicans ] ” to decide how to handle Stevens .
Rep. Adam Putnam of Florida , the House Republican Conference chairman who had hoped to spend Tuesday blaming Barack Obama for Democratic inaction on energy , instead was left to argue that the indictment of the Senate ’s most senior Republican was somehow “ bad for both parties . ”
The conservative National Review called for Stevens ’ resignation .
Democrats across the country called on their Republican opponents to return Stevens ’ campaign contributions .
Illinois Rep. Mark Kirk , a Republican , used Stevens ’ indictment to demand passage of legislation that would deny congressional pensions to members convicted of felonies .
Stevens proclaimed his innocence Tuesday , saying he “ never knowingly submitted a false disclosure form required by law as a U.S. senator . ”
But the details laid out by the Department of Justice are blistering , suggesting a seven - year pattern of failing to disclose the “ gifts ” provided to the senator by the Alaska oil field services company VECO .
The indictment charges Stevens with failing to report on his financial disclosure forms $ 250,000 in “ things of value ” including remodeling work on his home , a Viking grill and a sweetheart deal on a Land Rover .
The indictment further alleges that “ during the same time he was concealing his continued receipt of these things of value from VECO and [ VECO executive Bill J. ]
Allen , ” that Stevens “ received solicitations for official actions from Allen and other VECO employees , and that Sen .
Stevens used his position and office on behalf of VECO during that same time period . ”
In exchange , according to the indictment , the oil services company asked Stevens for help with company projects in Pakistan and Russia , as well as a National Science Foundation grant to a VECO subsidiary .
Matthew Friedrich , the acting assistant attorney general , said that prosecutors have not been able to establish the quid pro quo necessary for bribery charges .
However , he said that the investigation is ongoing .
Stevens has a reputation as a fighter , so he may very well launch a counterattack on the Justice case against him .
His campaign has said it ’s “ full steam ahead ” for the fall election , adding that Stevens ’ office has been “ flooded ” with calls and e-mails from supporters urging him to press on .
“ The message from them is clear : Alaska needs Ted Stevens in the U.S. Senate . ”
Stevens is a former Senate Appropriations Committee chairman who has funneled billions of dollars in earmarks and federal funds back to his home state , but he become the butt of jokes over the so - called “ bridge to nowhere ” earmark that became a symbol of Washington excess .
While he ’s known in Washington for his explosive temper , Stevens is beloved in Alaska , where Republican Gov. Sarah Palin said Tuesday that news of the senator ’s indictment had “ rock[ed ] the foundation of our state . ”
“ A lot of people here see him like he ’s our uncle , ” said McHugh Pierre , a spokesman for the Alaska Republican Party .
“ A lot of people want to help him ” in his time of need , he added .
Sen. Daniel Inouye ( D - Hawaii ) , a longtime Stevens friend , said he was n’t surprised by the news because Stevens has been under investigation for so long .
He said , however , that he believes Stevens is innocent .
Other senators responded with caution .
“ I need to learn more of the facts before I comment , ” said Sen. John Warner ( R - Va . ) .
“ I have the highest personal regard for him , ” Warner added .
“ He is a strong man .
He fought hard for his state , which he loved .
All of us have unexpected moments in our career .
All of us have to do our best to work through them .
I wish him the best . ”
Sen. Richard J. Durbin of Illinois , emerging from the Democrats ’ weekly policy lunch , said there had been a “ somber ” reaction to word of Stevens ’ indictment .
Sen. Chris Dodd ( D - Conn . ) said he was saddened by the news .
Appearing on MSNBC on Tuesday afternoon , Republican National Committee Chairman Mike Duncan said that the indictment involves “ a serious allegation ” but insisted that it would n’t be a distraction from John McCain ’s presidential campaign .
“ This presidential campaign will not be about the senior senator from Alaska , ” Duncan said .
“ It ’s going to be about big issues , about energy , about tax policy ; it ’s going to be about the future of America .
This is a blip along the way . ”
McCain , who has clashed repeatedly with Stevens in the past , issued no statement on the indictment .
Late Tuesday , an Appropriations Committee aide said that Sen. Thad Cochran ( R - Miss . ) will replace Stevens as ranking member on the Appropriation Committee ’s Defense subcommittee “ through the end of this Congress or until such time as Sen .
Stevens is able to resume his duties as ranking member . ”
Patrick O’Connor and Daniel W. Reilly contributed to this story .

Thanks to Jackster , who , along with Jillster , hurt himself tumbling down a hill .
Let 's be blunt : World of Warcraft is , for a lot of people , a lot of the time , a solo RPG .
Whether starting a first character , casually dipping in to play old ones , or compulsively levelling " alts " in the gaps in your main hero 's raiding schedule , it 's a safe bet that the majority of players out there at any one time are on their own , in the wild , churning through quests .
And it's also a safe bet that they 're doing it wrong .
Although it was shortened last year , the game 's levelling curve is still an epic one , and littered with some inevitably basic and repetitive quest design ( albeit excused by the rich world and carefully - designed areas the quests are set in ) .
Many players battle through it with their heads down and teeth gritted in a masochistic slog , forgetting to do one simple thing : have fun .
But solo questing can be fun .
It can be more than that : it can be one of the most rewarding single - player RPG experiences out there .
All you need to do is sit back , relax , and follow our nine - step plan for a healthier questing lifestyle .
1. Efficiency is n't everything
This one may contradict some of the practical advice that follows , but it 's more of a state of mind than a strategy .
The slightly more experienced quester will fall into the seductive , but ultimately damaging , trap of trying to maximise their questing efficiency .
The entire levelling arc becomes like one of WOW 's battles , a game of percentages , as you attempt to chain quests in a pattern designed for optimum experience reward and nothing else .
This is a fun challenge at first .
But it 's not long before it becomes a tyranny .
Downtime is n't a sin .
A long walk is n't a waste of time if you like the sights on the way , or are interested to run the quest at the end of it ; and the quickest path is n't necessarily the most enjoyable one .
Efficiency is always worth bearing in mind to keep the pace of the game up , but it should never be your prime concern .
2 . Do n't try to do it all Especially with the fast levelling speed that Blizzard introduced last year , there 's simply no need to visit every zone , or complete every quest in a zone .
Be selective .
Pick and choose what 's quickest , most interesting , or what just feels right , and feel free to ignore anything you do n't want to do .
Anything else is just borderline OCD .
Clearing a zone can be worthwhile in some of the more recent , better - designed , more densely - packed and story - driven areas : Ghostlands , for example , or the revamped Dustwallow Marsh .
Otherwise , remember that you 'll probably be levelling another character up one day , and then you 'll thank yourself for not having done everything there is to do already .
Key benefits
One of the most noticeable feature is the user interface – clean , effective , easy - to - use and multilingual .
Other benefits are high - DPI monitors support , low CPU usage and very stable burning process .
Plus support of Windows 10 , as well as any version starting from Windows XP .
Advanced options
Besides standard options , BurnAware offers many advanced options such as BOOT settings , UDF partition and versions , ISO levels and restrictions , session selection , CD - Text for track and disc , byte by byte verification , direct copying , disc spanning and many more .
Gunmen in the Russian republic of Dagestan killed a television journalist who promoted an officially approved form of Islam , police said today .
Abulla Alishayev was the second journalist to die in three days in Russia 's north Caucasus , a region scarred by fighting between federal forces and Muslim rebels .
Unknown assailants shot Alishayev - an editor at an Islamic television station who made a documentary countering the radical Wahabist form of Islam - as he drove through Dagestan 's capital last night .
He died today .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Analysts say predominantly Muslim Dagestan is fertile ground for radical Islam to attract disenfranchised young men , a trend they say could spread further through Russia 's north Caucasus .
" Alishayev received wounds to the shoulder and head .
He was operated on , but his life could not be saved , " Dagestani police said .
Dagestan , with a population of about 2.5 million , lies between the Caspian Sea and Chechnya .
It is one of the most heavily populated and poorest republics in Russia .
Unemployment is widespread and power cute this winter paralysed the capital Makhachkala .
On Sunday the owner of an opposition Web site in the nearby republic Ingushetia died from gunshot wounds while in police custody .
Police said Magomed Yevloyev was shot dead when he lunged for a gun .
Human rights workers said they did not believe this story .
Britain 's libel laws have come under attack from the United Nations committee on human rights for discouraging coverage of matters of major public interest .
The use of the Official Secrets
Act to deter government employees from raising important issues has also been criticised .
The intervention by the UN comes in the wake of international disquiet over the use of British courts for " libel tourism " , whereby wealthy plaintiffs can sue in the high court in London over articles that would not warrant an action in their own country .
The criticisms are made as part of the committee 's concluding observations on the report submitted by the UK on civil and political rights .
UN member states are required to submit reports on human rights in their jurisdictions every three years .
The committee warns that the British libel laws have " served to discourage critical media reporting on matters of serious public interest , adversely affecting the ability of scholars and journalists to publish their work , including through the phenomenon known as libel tourism " .
The case that has provoked the most concern is that of an American researcher , Dr Rachel Ehrenfeld , who was sued in London by a Saudi businessman and his two sons over a book that sold 23 copies over the internet into the UK , where it was never officially published .
One chapter of the book was available online .
The action led to the New York state legislature passing legislation to protect writers and publishers working there from defamation judgements in any country that does not give the same same freedom of speech rights as New York and US federal law .
The committee 's report highlights the grey area created by the internet whereby alleged libel can be read in different countries .
There is a risk , warns the committee , that restrictive libel laws could affect legitimate international discussion , contrary to article 19 of the covenant on civil and political rights , which guarantees the right to freedom of speech " regardless of borders " .
The UK government has been urged to consider " a so - called ' public figure ' exception " that would require a would - be claimant to prove actual malice by a publisher or author .
This would apply in cases involving public officials and prominent public figures , as currently exists in the US , where a public figure can only sue for libel if he or she can demonstrate malice , recklessness or indifference to the truth and that the statement is false .
On the Official Secrets Act , the committee " remains concerned " that powers under the act have been " exercised to frustrate former employees of the crown from bringing into the public domain issues of genuine public interest , and can be exercised to prevent the media from publishing such matters " .
The committee found the act is used even when issues of national security are not involved .
The 2006 Terrorism Act's " broad and vague " definition of the offence of " encouragement of terrorism " was also criticised by the committee .
Media law specialist Mark Stephens , of legal firm Finers Stephens Innocent , said : " I think it is quite remarkable that the UK government has drawn these deficiencies in our libel laws to the attention of the United Nations , while at the same time libel lawyers in this country have remained insouciant to the deficiencies highlighted by the UN . "
Why You ’re a Sucker for the Impact Bias
Psychologists have found that the impact bias is one reason we are often poor at predicting how future events will affect us emotionally .
The impact bias is our tendency to overestimate our emotional reaction to future events .
Research shows that most of the time we do n’t feel as bad as we expect to when things go wrong .
Similarly we usually do n’t get quite the high we expect when things go right for us .
There are exceptions – such as being in a bad mood will tend to make us more realistic about future positive events – but these are far from the norm .
Studies have found that :
Two months after a relationship finishes people are generally not as unhappy as they expect .
Sports fans are generally not as happy as they expect when their team wins .
Academics overestimate how happy they will be when given tenure , and also overestimate their unhappiness at being denied tenure .
This research also show that people overestimate both the initial intensity of their emotional reaction , and also how long it will go on for .
Causes of the impact bias
The impact bias is a pretty reliable finding , so why does it happen ?
Wilson and Gilbert ( 2005 ) find two main reasons :
Focalism : when people think about the impact of future events they tend to forget about all the other things that are going on in their lives .
In reality the one event we are imagining will likely be overshadowed by all sorts of other events that happen at the same time .
We conveniently forget that the future will always contain many other events we can’t predict , some positive and some negative .
: when people think about the impact of future events they tend to forget about all the other things that are going on in their lives .
In reality the one event we are imagining will likely be overshadowed by all sorts of other events that happen at the same time .
We conveniently forget that the future will always contain many other events we can’t predict , some positive and some negative .
Sense - making : people have a natural tendency to rationalise what happens to them .
When something bad happens we initially feel unhappy but immediately start searching for the underlying reasons .
Once when we ’ve decided on the cause (s ) of this bad event , we start to feel better .
For us bad events that are predictable and which submit to rational explanation are not as scary as random unexplained bad events .
Unfortunately the same process also works for positive events – when we rationalise them we reduce their impact on us ( read more on this in my post on how to feel more pleasure ) .
Both making sense of an event as well as our tendency for focalism probably happen either completely unconsciously or at least partially unconsciously .
Consequently we often do n’t realise we ’re doing it .
How can you correct for the impact bias ?
Considering that these processes are probably unconscious it may be difficult .
But evidence does suggest two options .
When considering how a future event will affect you :
Think about all the other events that will happen in the future ; consciously widen your future focus .
Remember that you will usually quickly rationalise any event , thereby reducing its emotional impact on you .
This is good news for negative events , but less good for positive events .
To feel more pleasure , do all you can to hold on to the mystery .

HiRISE Stereo , Color Images Detail Mars Terrain that Tantalizes Explorers
The new HiRISE images totalling more than 3 terabytes of data have been posted on its Web site .
By La Monica Everett - Haynes , University Communications
The High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment aboard NASA 's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter , has returned more than 8,214 gigapixel - size images of the Martian surface since the start of the science phase of the mission in November 2006 .
HiRISE scientists released 1,005 observations of Mars made between April 26 and July 21 to NASA 's mission data archive , called the Planetary Data System , and also to the public last week .
The new images , a total 3.4 terabytes of data , can be found on the HiRISE Web site .
The HiRISE team has so far released a total 26.9 terabytes of data in more than 7,100 observations with 718,000 different image products derived from those observations , said HiRISE operations manager Eric Eliason of The University of Arizona 's Lunar and Planetary Laboratory . Â
That amounts to more data than has been released by all previous deep space missions combined .
The image products include color images and stereo pairs , as well as monochrome images . Â
" If I showed each HiRISE image for 10 seconds , it would take me about 4 years to show them all , " said UA 's Alfred McEwen , HiRISE principal investigator .
Despite this massive data volume , HiRISE images cover less than four - fifths of one percent of the area of the planet .
Stereo imaging has been a very important part of the HiRISE experiment , McEwen said .
The camera has produced 803 stereo pairs .
Each pair consists of two images that were taken on two different orbits as the spacecraft pointed off nadir precisely on target .
Acquiring stereo pairs is a lot of work , but worth it , he added .
McEwen and his team published more than 20 scientific papers on HiRISE results in 2007 and 2008 .
They based much of their analysis on stereo data used to produce digital elevation models that are accurate to within about three feet and to within about eight inches in height .
A new processing pipeline to produce stereo images was recently completed by Eliason and his team .
Within a few months all of the stereo image pairs will be processed and posted .
Color is another important HiRISE capability .
The camera uses a focal plane system that consists of 14 charge - coupled devices , or CCDs , that include 4 middle CCDs for full color coverage .
Spacecraft motion pushes this electronic array so that it records the view down to Mars ' surface at a ground speed of about 3.2 kilometers per second , or about 7,000 miles per hour .
Skeptics doubted that a technique called " time integration delay , " needed to compensate for extremely short exposure times â about one ten - thousandth of a second per pixel â could produce sharp , unsmeared images .
But the technique has worked " wonderfully well , " thanks to accurate spacecraft pointing and stability and precise exposure time calculations , McEwen said .
Colors in HiRISE images are not natural colors seen with normal human vision .
But the colors are important to distinguish ice , frost , dust and rock on the Martian surface .
Colors enhance differences in morphologies , brightness variations and topographic shadings .
The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter 's Compact Imaging Spectrometer for Mars , or CRISM , identifies minerals on Mars , and HiRISE colors are useful in extrapolating that information down to the scale of individual rock outcrops .
That information is needed for science evaluations in choosing future Mars landing sites .
HiRISE data is also used for engineering analysis of candidate landing sites .
McEwen , who is involved in selecting the best possible landing site for NASA 's Mars Science Laboratory planned for 2009 launch , said recent evidence from both U.S. and European Mars orbiters shows clays that contain iron , magnesium and aluminum are widespread throughout ancient Mars bedrock .
" That 's a shocking discovery , " McEwen said .
" The actual environments and processes that deposited and / or altered these clay minerals is poorly understood .
But these places have very quickly become where we have to go with future rovers and sample - return missions . "
Scientists theorize that life in our solar system may have formed during or even before the Late Heavy Bombardment of 3.9 billion years ago .
" We know that Mars underwent heavy bombardment and that it was water - ice rich , " McEwen said .
" Impact - generated hydrothermal systems may have created habitat on Mars similar to Earth's , and the rock record from this time is much better preserved on Mars than it is on Earth . "
HiRISE images show that part of Mars ' hardened , ancient crust is exposed on the planet 's surface as " megabreccia , " a conglomeration of large , chaotic rock fragments that formed from energetic events , mostly large impacts on ancient Mars .
Three candidate Mars Science Laboratory sites are very near megabreccia deposits and would be easily accessible to NASA 's future megarover , McEwen noted .

A re-elected Conservative government would create a tax credit for children 's artistic activities , Stephen Harper pledged on Monday , saying the measure will " help families breathe a little . "
Speaking in Ottawa , Harper said the Conservatives would extend the new credit worth an estimated $ 150 million a year to lower - income families , along with the existing children 's fitness tax credit .
The credit will apply on up to $ 500 of eligible fees for children under 16 who participate in eligible arts activities , he said .
The Conservatives would also allow charities and not - for - profit groups to set up registered education savings plans for kids from low - income families , he said .
The move comes as the Conservatives have faced intense criticism , especially in Quebec , over a decision to cut up to $ 45 million in federal funding for numerous arts programs ahead of the Oct. 14 federal election .
Harper has countered that the funding for the Department of Canadian Heritage has increased by eight per cent since his government came to power in 2006 .
" Today 's announcement shows once again , as I 've been saying , that this government , in fact , does support culture and arts , " Harper told reporters .
" We spend a lot more on culture and arts , but we do so in a way that we ensure is an effective use of taxpayers ' money and ultimately , in this case , benefits families and all of society as well . "
Last week , Harper drew increased fire from critics and artists when he said he believed the outcry over the cuts was " a niche issue " and suggested " ordinary Canadians " could n't relate to the funding complaints of artists at " rich galas " subsidized by the taxpayer .
During the funding announcement , Harper again stressed credits were part of the Conservatives ' " clear , affordable , practical , and believable " proposals at a time of global economic uncertainty , while Stéphane Dion 's Liberals are offering " untested , grandiose , theoretical " proposals .

Norm Stamper is a cop who saw it all during his 34 years on active duty .
As police of Seattle from 1994 through 2000 , he was in charge during violent World Trade Organization protests in the Emerald City .
Stamper , who holds a Ph.D. in leadership and human behavior from United States International University , has emerged as one of the most thoughtful and outspoken critics of the war on drugs , which he believes causes untold misery , undermines effective law enforcement , and does n't begin to pass any sort of cost - benefit analysis .
As important , the libertarian Stamper believes that the drug war–and other wars on the behaviors on consenting adults–does great violence to the idea that we own our bodies .
Stamper is the author of the Breaking Rank : A Top Cop 's Exposé of the Dark Side of American Policing ( 2005 ) and now works with Law Enforcement Against Prohibition ( LEAP ) , a nonprofit created by former cops to " reduce the multitude of unintended harmful consequences resulting from fighting the war on drugs and to lessen the incidence of death , disease , crime , and addiction by ultimately ending drug prohibition .

Obama : People 's families are off limits David Edwards and Mike Sheehan
Published : Monday September 1 , 2008
Print This Email This Democratic presidential nominee Sen. Barack Obama issued this response to news of McCain running mate Gov. Sarah Palin 's announcement that her teen daughter Bristol is pregnant :
" Let me be a clear as possible : I have said before and I will repeat again , I think people 's families are off limits , and people 's children are especially off limits , " said Obama .
" This should n't be part of our politics .
It has no relevance to Gov. Palin 's performance as a governor or her potential performance as a vice president .
" I would strongly urge people to back off these kinds of stories , " Obama continued .
" My mother had me when she was 18 , and how family deals with issues and teenage children -- that should n't be the topic of our politics and I hope that anybody who 's supporting me understands that 's off limits . "
When a journalist followed up by referring to McCain campaign charges that liberal blogs , some even tied to Obama , were behind rumors about Palin , the Illinois senator interjected , " I am offended by that statement .
There is no evidence at all that any of this involved us .
" I hope I am as clear as can be , so in case I 'm not , let me repeat :
We do n't go after people 's families , we do n't get them involved in the politics , " Obama continued .
" It 's not appropriate and it 's not relevant .
" Our people were not involved in any way in this and they will not be .
And if I ever thought that it was somebody in my campaign that was involved in something like that , they'd be fired , " closed Obama before departing .

From some reader …
Conveniently , Gallup released new numbers this afternoon that allow us to quantify the divergent trends you ’ve fingered .
In the three days following Palin ’s selection , McCain brought his level of support among Republican women up five points to 90 % , and eliminated his nagging gender gap .
But that ’s just within the GOP .
Independents and Democrats reacted to Palin ’s selection by turning to Obama – and his gains have more than offset McCain ’s , leaving him with a substantial lead .
BEIJING - Chinese customs officials confiscated more than 300 Bibles on Sunday from four American Christians who arrived in a southwestern city with plans to distribute them , the group 's leader said .
The Bibles were taken from the group 's checked luggage after they landed at the airport in the city of Kunming , said Pat Klein , head of Vision Beyond Borders .
The group , based in Sheridan , Wyoming , distributes Bibles and Christian teaching materials around the world to " strengthen the persecuted church , " according to its Web site .
The group arrived in China on Sunday and had intended to distribute the Bibles to people in the city , Klein told the AP in a telephone interview while still at the airport .
" I heard that there 's freedom of religion in China , so why is there a problem for us to bring Bibles ? "
Klein said .
" We had over 300 copies and customs took all of them from us . "
The move comes as China hosts the Olympics in Beijing , where false media reports last year claimed Bibles would be banned from the games .
The state - run China Daily reported last month that 10,000 bilingual copies of the Bible would be distributed in the Olympic Village , which houses athletes and media .
Bibles are printed under the supervision of the Communist government .
The officially atheistic country only allows them to be used in government - sanctioned churches and in some big hotels catering to foreigners .
A woman who was on duty at Kunming airport 's customs office confirmed over the telephone that 315 Bibles were found in the passengers ' checked baggage .
The officer , who would only give her last name , Xiao , denied confiscating the Bibles .
She said authorities were just " taking care " of them and provided no further details .
She later said she was not authorized to speak to the media and referred questions to the national customs headquarters in Beijing , which did not answer phones on Sunday .
" We 're not selling them ; we give them free to the people , " Klein said .
" We did n't come to cause trouble , we just came to bring Bibles to help out the Chinese Christians . "
The Bibles were printed in Chinese , he said .
Klein said the customs officers had told him that they could each have one Bible for personal use and not more than that .
He said the officers had videotaped them and were insisting that they leave the airport .
" We do n't want to go without taking those books .
It cost us a lot of money to bring them here , " Klein said .
" They 're saying that it 's illegal to bring the Bibles in and that if we wanted to , we had to apply ahead of time for permission . "
China faces routine criticism for its human rights violations and its repression of religious freedom .
Religious practice is heavily regulated by the Communist Party , with worship allowed only in party - controlled churches , temples and mosques , while those gathering outside face harassment , arrest and terms in labor camps or prison .
A Chinese Christian activist was detained Aug. 10 , the opening weekend of the Olympics , on his way to a church service attended by President Bush in Beijing .
A rights group said later that the activist , Hua Huiqi , a leader of the unofficial Protestant church in Beijing , had escaped from police and was in hiding .
Police have denied any involvement in Hua 's disappearance .
DIRECTV Scores Points in the Linux Community
by Ostatic Staff - Sep. 22 , 2008
Unlike NBC 's coverage of the 2008 Olympic Games , DIRECTV customers who have the NFL Sunday Ticket SuperFan viewing package can now watch live football games on computers running Linux .
Using a combination of Adobe Air and the open source Flex framework , DIRECTV will stream the Sunday showdowns and also deliver game highlights , statistics , and real - time scores via a desktop app or Web browser .
According to a prepared statement , DIRECTV claims this service is " the first broadly deployed entertainment package to integrate the Digital Rights Management ( DRM ) capability available in AIR via Adobe Flash Media Rights Management Server ( FMRMS ) "
Though some may balk at using Adobe Air , at least the package is available to Linux users which , for many premium services , is n't always the case .
While TiVo is easily -- and better -- replaced by MythTV , finding open source solutions for tools like Slingbox is n't always easy .
DIRECTV's nod to the open source community is a good start , let 's hope it 's a sign of more to come .
SINCE New York Times economic writer David Leonhardt was good enough to cite the Economist in his piece on John McCain today , we should probably pay it some attention .
Mr Leonhardt has good things to say about Mr McCain 's economic advisor Douglas Holtz - Eakin en route to wondering whether the Arizona senator , " is the least fiscally conservative candidate still in the race . "
He writes :
Last week , Senator McCain laid out his economic vision in a speech in Pittsburgh .
He talked about wasteful spending , but the newest , most detailed part of the speech dealt with a package of tax cuts that would cost about $ 300 billion a year .
They would come on top of $ 350 billion a year in Bush tax cuts that Mr. McCain wants to make permanent .
To put these numbers in perspective , the Iraq war has been costing roughly $ 200 billion a year ...
As Mr. McCain ’s plan currently stands ,
The Economist magazine concluded that it “ will not come anywhere close to paying for the tax cuts . ”
Most telling , I spoke over the past week with several other economists who admire Mr. McCain and have advised him over the years .
None would defend his current fiscal package ( or be quoted ) .
Now , it 's possible that Mr McCain thinks his critics are wrong , and that supply - side orthodoxy holding that tax cuts always raise revenues is correct .
Whether or not this is what Mr McCain thinks , it 's absolutely what he says .
Brendan Nyhan has collected a long list of statements to this effect .
Of course , as Mark Thoma points out , now might not be the best time to seek a balanced budget .
By the time Mr McCain gets around to crafting his first budget , economic conditions may be quite a bit different , but for now , at least , a package of tax increases and spending cuts is not what the economy needs .
Whatever is going on inside Mr McCain 's head , it would be very helpful if he could begin elucidating one clear message , so that the public can weigh it against alternative proposals .
As things stand , with the candidate preaching supply - side voo-doo to partisan audiences while his economic advisor maintains that it's all an election ploy or an episode of " misspeak , " it 's impossible to determine how good or bad an economic leader he might be .
And pity the economic advisor , whose official role is now seemingly to tell the world that his candidate is lying to get elected , and all will be well once he 's safely ensconced in the oval office .

UK tides ... stronger tides are yellow and red .
Image : DTI
Harnessing the vast energy of the UK 's coastal tides could become much simpler and cheaper with a new design for the next generation of underwater turbines .
The device , unveiled by a team of engineers from Oxford University , re-thinks the way power is generated underwater and the inventors believe it will be more robust , more efficient and cheaper to build and maintain than anything in operation today .
There is an immense potential resource of clean energy from the tidal flows around the UK : conservative estimates suggest there is at least five gigawatts of power , but there could be as much as 15GW , equivalent to 15 million average family homes .
Tidal generators can harvest the energy of these moving streams , with the added advantage that the resource is , unlike wind , predictable .
There are only a few underwater turbines in operation today and they all operate like underwater windmills , with their blades turning at right angles to the flow of the water .
In contrast , the Oxford team 's device is built around a cylindrical rotor , which rolls around its long axis as the tide ebbs and flows .
As a result , it can use more of the incoming water than a standard underwater windmill .
At full size , a Transverse Horizontal Axis Water Turbine ( Thawt ) rotor would be 10 m in diameter and 60 m long .
Connecting two of these together with a generator in the middle could produce around 12MW of power , enough for 12,000 average family homes .
" To do that , you only need three foundations and one generator , " said Martin Oldfield , senior research fellow of engineering science at Oxford University .
" To do that with a [ windmill ] would require five foundations and 10 generators . "
The Thawt device is mechanically far less complicated than anything available today , meaning it would cost less to build and maintain .
" The manufacturing costs are about 60 % lower , the maintenance costs are about 40 % lower , " said Malcolm McCulloch , head of the electrical power group at Oxford 's engineering department .
So far , the researchers have successfully tested a version of Thawt that is 1 m in diameter and 6 m long .
They are now planning to build a 5 m - diameter test device that could generate electricity for the grid .
By 2009 the team wants to carry out sea trials to test the device 's durability in open water .
Scaling up the power at a coastal site would involve connecting together a series of Thawt rotors across the sea floor .
The engineers said that , if all went well , farms of Thawt devices could be built starting around 2013 .
" If you have a tidal site of 20 km , you could build 20 km of these turbines going across [ the sea floor ] and then you would be into the gigawatt class , " said Oldfield .
This would make the farm equivalent to a small coal - fired power station .
McCulloch said that their economic analysis of the Thawt device showed that , at farm scale , the Thawt devices could be installed at around £ 1.7 m per MW .
That compares with around £ 3 m per MW for modern marine turbine technology and just over £ 2 m per MW for wind power .
Doug Parr , chief scientist at Greenpeace said the UK is a potential global leader in wave power .
But he noted : " Many good ideas for wave power generation suffer from a lack of finance , lack of assured market and lack of access to business expertise .
" Some of these bottlenecks need to be addressed by the industry - others need government to play a boosting role rather than hoping that the rules and organisations that got us into the climate problem are going to be the ones that get us out . "
In July , Bristol - based company Marine Current Turbines installed the SeaGen device , an underwater windmill device , at Strangford Lough in Northern Ireland .
It is the first commercial - scale tidal device to generate power for the grid .
When it is eventually running at full power , MCT said it will have an output of 1,200 kW , enough for about 1,000 homes .
" There are presently tidal devices undergoing testing – we regard those as first generation device and we regard ours as a second generation , " said Oldfield .
" To some extent we admire them for being pioneers of the technology but we think what we 've got will end up being better . "
Steph Merry , head of marine renewable energy at the Renewable Energy Association welcomed the Oxford team 's work but said that , in terms of backing a technology to harness tide power , nothing can be ruled in or out .
" We 've got this 15 % renewables target for 2020 to achieve , which equates to 40 % electricity , so you have to look at all possible options of generating it . "
Merry added that , technology aside , there were other stumbling blocks in building tidal projects around the UK , including what she sees as an excessive need to monitor the environmental impact of turbines .
" We have to get it in proportion , you can't have an unlimited budget for environmental monitoring when every engineering company has to work to a budget for any project .
At the moment , there is no limit to the monitoring that can be imposed . "
She said that the industry had to sit down with environmental groups and government to find a balance between the need to tackle climate change and the requirements to safeguard the ecology of tidal areas .
Seen from the air , Sarah Palin 's state is an environmental wonderland .
From Anchorage to the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge , there is a vast landscape of snow - capped peaks , fjords , crystal glaciers , coastal lagoons , wide river deltas and tundra .
The guardian of this wilderness – and Governor of Alaska – has , this week , become one of the most recognisable faces in the world .
But behind her beaming smile and wholesome family values is a woman aligned with the big oil and coal firms that are racing to exploit Alaska 's vast energy reserves .
In the short term , that has bought her popularity at home .
" I love the woman , " the pilot on our flight shouts over the noise of the engine , " especially what she wants to do with oil , we just have to drill more , there is no alternative .
What 's the point of leaving it all in the ground ? "
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
It is a stance that guaranteed John McCain 's new running mate a rapturous reception at the Republican convention this week where the response to the coming energy crisis was a chant of " drill , baby , drill " .
But the woman who could soon be a 72 - year - old 's heartbeat away from the United States presidency has an environmental policy so toxic it would make the incumbent , George Bush , blush .
Mr McCain has stressed he is concerned about global warming and has come out against drilling in the Arctic reserve .
But , in recent weeks , he has wobbled on the issue .
And environmentalists are describing Mrs Palin , who denies climate change is man-made , as " either grossly misinformed or intentionally misleading " .
She wants to start drilling .
She wants to block US moves to list the polar bear as an endangered species .
And she has allowed big game hunters to shoot Alaska 's bears and wolves from low - flying planes .
The 44 - year - old governor says a federal government decision to protect the polar bear will cripple energy development offshore .
As a result , she is suing the Bush administration , which ruled the polar bear is endangered and needs protection .
The US Geological Survey says climate change has shrunk Arctic summer sea ice to about 1.65 million sq miles , nearly 40 per cent less than the long - term average between 1979 and 2000 .
In such a situation it was unconscionable for Governor Palin to ignore overwhelming evidence of global warming 's threat to sea ice , says Kassie Siegel of the Centre for Biological Diversity .

" Even the Bush administration can't deny the reality of global warming , " Ms Siegel said .
" The governor is aligning herself and the state of Alaska with the most discredited , fringe , extreme viewpoints by denying this . "
Governor Palin would also like to bring open - cast coal mining to Alaska 's Brooks Range Mountains , an act of environmental vandalism in the eyes of many .
The Palin administration has allowed Chevron to triple the amount of toxic waste it pours into the waters of Cook Inlet .
This , even though the number of beluga whales in the bay has collapsed from 1,300 to 350 – the point of extinction – because of pollution and increased ship traffic .
On the Republican convention floor she said : " We Americans need to produce more of our own oil and gas and take it from a gal who knows the North Slope of Alaska :
We 've got lots of both . "
The fact that drilling wo n't solve every problem " is no excuse to do nothing at all " , she said , putting the country on notice that " starting in January , in a McCain - Palin administration , we 're going to lay more pipelines ... build more nuclear plants ... create jobs with clean coal ... and move forward on solar , wind , geothermal and other alternative sources " .
Mrs Palin also took a swipe at Barack Obama 's environmental stance saying : " What does he actually seek to accomplish , after he 's done turning back the waters and healing the planet ? "
Her support in Alaska relies on squeezing more money for the state from the oil companies themselves .
In Alaska , every man woman and child is in line for a bonus cheque of about $ 2,000 ( £ 1,100 ) from the state 's massive oil wealth fund .
This is , in effect , a vote - buying machine for the would - be Vice - President .
Governor Palin wants nothing to hinder the oil companies .
She maintains that polar bears are well managed and their population has dramatically increased over 30 years as a result of conservation .
And if the ice should go away , then they will adapt to living on the land .
Many oil companies abandoned Alaska when prices fell in the 1980s but they have been rushing back to drill and prospect areas that are among the least hospitable on earth .
That spirit of the Klondike is already in full swing in Prudhoe Bay the epicentre of oil production and one of the world 's largest industrial complexes .
It 's so big that BP , UPS and FedEx operate a special fleet of jets from Anchorage just to service to the region .
Hundreds of spills involving tens of thousands of gallons of crude oil and other petroleum products occur in the area each year .
Decades - old spills are still a problem and 17,000 acres of wildlife and marine habitat have already been destroyed .
But Prudhoe is just a tiny fraction of the area being targeted by Governor Palin and the oil companies .
A similar fate of environmental destruction awaits the entire coastal plain as well as the special areas of the western Arctic – home to migratory caribou herds , musk oxen , wolverines , grizzly and polar bears should a McCain - Palin administration be elected .
The oil boom has attracted oilmen from across America .
One of them is Todd Palin , husband to the vice - presidential candidate who works for BP on Alaska 's North Slope .
It is illegal to hunt polar bears , and that is not about to change .
But in an area known as " Polar Bear Seas " , from Point Hope on Alaska 's far western edge to the pristine coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Reserve , one tenth of the world 's polar bear population is at risk , as well as beluga and bowheaded whales and bearded and spotted seals .
Big game hunters are happy to pay lots of money to shoot wolves and bears from the air .
They also chase them across the snow to the point of exhaustion and then land the planes on skis , shooting them from point - blank range .
The animals are considered endangered across the " lower 48 " states of America , but not Alaska .
The hunters keep and sell the animals ' pelts .
Last year , Mrs Palin proposed offering a bounty of $ 150 per wolf , as long as the hunter provided the wolf 's foreleg as proof of the kill .
The measure did not pass .
She even spent $ 400,000 on a state - funded campaign to block attempts to end the hunt .
Its not just wildlife conservationists who object .
Many ordinary Alaskans also condemn the practice as barbaric .
Trish Rolfe , who runs the Sierra Club's Alaska office , thinks Governor Palin has been a disaster for Alaska 's environment .
" The idea that she stands up to the oil companies is a joke , " she says .
" The governor pays lip service to the issue of global warming but denies it is man made .
She will not even spend money to help the Inupiaq villages which are about to fall into the sea . "
Robert - fisk.com är min personliga hemsida of söt- och saltvattenakvarium .
Här kan du lära dig allt från hur man sätter igång sitt första akvarium och skaffar lämplig nybörjarfisk till hur man odlar Diskus och tar hand om känsliga mjukkoraller .
Jag har för närvarande över 100 artprofiler och mitt arkiv uppdateras kontinuerligt med fler .
Jag har separata avdelningar om hur man sköter och sätter up söt och saltvattensakvarium .
I sötvattensakvariumavdelningen har jag samlat information om allmän akvarieskötsel , akvarieväxter , akvarieutrustning , fiskmat , fisksjukdomar och mycket , mycket mer .
Den som är intresserad av att odla fisk kan ta en titt i min särskilda odlingsavdelning .
Du kan även hitta artspecifik odlingsinformation i de olika artprofilerna , och glöm inte att ta en titt på artikeln om lämplig yngelmat i artikelarkivet .
Sötvattensakvarium
En majoritet av alla fiskarter som hålls av svenska akvarister är tropiska sötvattensfiskar och vi har därför en stor samling artprofiler över tropisk akvariefisk lämplig för sötvattensakvarier .
Jag har försökt inkludera en bra blandning av nybörjarfisk , medelsvår fisk och svårskött fisk , samt ta med arter från många olika delar av världen .
Genom att klicka på en artprofil får du bland annat veta vilket temperment fisken har , hur svår den anses vara att sköta , vilken typ av akvarium den trivs bäst i och inom vilka intervall vattentemperatur , pH -värde och hårdhet bör ligga .
Jag har också strävat efter att inkludera information om hur man odlar tropisk fisk i akvarium .
Populära sötvattensfiskar
Saltvattensakvarium
Att hålla ett saltvattensakvarium är normalt sett svårare än att hålla ett sötvattensakvarium och det är därför bäst att skaffa sig lite erfarenhet från sötvattensarter innan man sätter igång .
Saltvattensakvarier brukar även kräva dyrare utrustning och tillbehör än sötvattensakvarier och är därför ovanliga bland nybörjare .
Den extra tid och kostnad man måste lägga ned är dock väl värt det eftersom man får en chans att hålla så många vackra och spännande marina djur och växter .
Många saltvattensakvarister har flyttat fokus från fisk till andra marina arter såsom koraller , anemoner , sjöstjärnor , sjöhästar och olika sorters snäckor .
Min avdelning om saltvattensakvarium innehåller därför inte bara information om populär akvariefisk såsom Clowfisk , Frökenfisk och Muränor utan har sektioner för en lång rad ryggradslösa djur därtill .
Kallvattensakvarium
Kallvattenfisk kan hållas i såväl akvarium som utomhusdammar och det finns en hel del arter som kan hantera även kalla svenska vintrar så länge de får en tillräckligt djup damm .
Exempel på vanliga kallvatten fisk arter är japansk Koi och de olika guldfiskvarianterna .
Att sköta kallvattenfisk skiljer sig något från att ta hand om tropisk fisk , och om du vill anlägga en trädgårdsdamm i din trädgård så tillkommer givetvis en rad faktorer som måste tas i beaktande .
Kallvatten fisk är dock ofta tuff och tålig , och när man väl läst in sig lite på ämnet och fått igång en fungerande trädgårdsdamm brukar de vara oerhört lättskötta .
Det finns givetvis undantag och det är därför alltid en bra idé att läsa på om de kallvattensfiskar du är intresserad av innan du köper dem .
Så kallade ” Ce gulfiskar ” är bra nybörjarfisk eftersom de behållit mycket av de överlevnadsegenskaper vi finner hos deras vilda förfäder .
Koi däremot är betydligt känsligare och har bland annat högre krav på vattenkvalitén .
A major failure on the Hubble Space Telescope has shut down science operations , as the spacecraft is unable to send any data to Earth , according to an article on NASA Spaceflight.com .
The failure is on the “ Side A ” control system .
There is also a back - up system , Side B which has never been used .
Attempts will be made to switch to Side B later this week .
This switch has never been attempted during the lifetime of the telescope , but it is hoped that the switch will work , allowing the HST to return to functionality .
This may have an impact on the STS - 125 ’s mission to repair the Hubble , delaying it to 2009 , if managers decide to send up a replacement unit , or if a mitigation plan fails to restore the Telescope ’s functionality .
Update : NASA held a news conference this afternoon , and said the servicing mission — which was going to launch on Oct. 14 — is definitely on hold .
They will attempt to turn on Side B later this week , and depending on how that goes , they are working on a plan to have the shuttle servicing mission bring up and install a spare Science Instrument Command and Data Handling System sometime in 2009 .
Phil has the dicey details over at Bad Astronomy
Information obtained by NASA Spaceflight.com reads as follows :
“ Side A of the CUSDF ( Control Unit / Science Data Formatter ) in HST went into safe hold , this means science operations have stopped .
The spacecraft is still operational but unable to operate the instruments , ” noted information acquired by L2 .
“ Attempts to recover the A side have failed so the project is now working to transfer science operations to the B side , this requires transferring the whole spacecraft from Side A to Side B so its a significant operation .
“ Side B side has not been operated on orbit , for HST ’s entire on orbit service life it has operated on Side A .
However , the B side was fully tested before launch .
“ The plan as of now is to complete the transfer to the B side later this week .
The details for this will be provided later by the project .
“ If the B side comes up fine we could still launch on time so I propose that we do not postpone the ( Agency ) FRR ( Flight Readiness Review ) at this time .
“ If the B side does not come on line then we clearly have no mission as there is no way to get science data down . ”
“ Options are in work .
Earlier we had a plan to launch STS - 126 first in November and follow up with HST in Feb. with the Feb. 2009 flight as back - up , ” says a memo obtained by NASA Spaceflight.com
Stay tuned .

Before the days of flat screen monitors ... and Perestroika
By Finlo Rohrer
BBC News Magazine
The conflict in Georgia has awoken fears of a new Cold War between Russia and its allies and the West , nearly 20 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall .
But will the animosity come back to haunt Western imaginations as it once did ?
" We share the same biology ,
regardless of ideology .
Believe me when I say to you ,
I hope the Russians love their children too "
That extract might be a mere piece of lyrical doggerel to any listener born after 9 November 1989 , but when Sting released the single Russians in 1985 , it came out of a deep mine of anxiety in the West about the course of the Cold War .
A good period in which to make profound statements ...
For nearly five decades , the Cold War provided a rich seam running right through popular culture in the West , throwing out films , music , novels and even computer games that carried the fears , conscious and subconscious , of millions .
In the 1950s , science fiction movies were often allegories about different aspects of Cold War politics .
Invasion of the Body - Snatchers was interpreted as a reference to McCarthy - era paranoia , Invaders from Mars as a parable of communist infiltration , and the Day the Earth Stood Still as a simple fantasy that some higher supernatural power would come to try and sort everything out .
After the world reached the brink of war during the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962 , there was another wave of Cold War - inspired fiction , with Stanley Kubrick 's Dr Strangelove perhaps the most notable example .
With the detente of the 1970s the Cold War thread became less noticeable , but with worsening relations in the early 1980s , both sides of the Atlantic were suddenly replete with fictional Cold War dystopian scenarios .
On the British side people were treated to the agonisingly poignant graphic novel When the Wind Blows by Raymond Briggs and its film adaptation , as well as 1984 's Threads , about the terrifying aftermath of a nuclear strike .
On the other side of the Atlantic , there were the mini-series Amerika and World War III , and the gruesome The Day After with its vivid montages of men , women , children and even horses being vaporised .
... and ripe for sensational scare - mongering
On the silver screen WarGames explored the issue of computer hacking against a background of mutually assured destruction , while Red Dawn took the usual brat pack characters complete with preppy letterman jackets , and armed them with AK - 47s to fight a Soviet invasion of the US .
Popular attitudes towards the Eastern Bloc were shaped by movies like Rocky IV , where the drug cheat Ivan Drago was emblematic of suspicions held against Soviet athletes .
As well as Sting 's Russians , Frankie Goes To Hollywood 's chart - topper Two Tribes provided a musical accompaniment to the era .
It seems strange to discuss now what was , even then , viewed as often laughable ephemera , but the course of popular culture reflected deep - seated fears , particularly significant among those too young to temper their concerns with a grasp of the political context .
Almost as soon as it had intensified , the Cold War quickly ebbed away , and by the end of the 1989 , with the Berlin Wall coming down and relations defrosting across the whole of eastern Europe , it suddenly became a bit silly to pick the Soviet state as baddies .
Hollywood had to find new protagonists for a new zeitgeist , and fast .
Bond sabbatical
While rarely casting Russia itself as the main enemy in a storyline , and indeed often featuring a sympathetic KGB general , the James Bond franchise was unmistakably driven by Cold War themes of espionage and fear of weapons technology .
It was inevitably affected , says film critic James King .
It was a competition to be modern - consumer society was used as a bulwark against communism
Jane Pavitt " Bond went into limbo for seven years , for many reasons , but one was that it did n't feel relevant any more .
" The first film I remember that actually caught up was True Lies .
When that came out it was almost a James Bond film and it had a new Hollywood enemy , which was an Arab - this was the new thing . "
Post 9/11 there has been a glut of movies either tackling the threat of terrorism , attacking the politics of the war on terror and Guantanamo Bay , as well as a host of television programmes that have explored the fall - out for Muslim communities on both sides of the Atlantic .
A poster for the current movie Shoot on Sight - with its tagline " Is it a crime to be a Muslim ? " - is typical .
In the space between the end of the Cold War and Islamist terrorism entering the mainstream mindset as the main threat to the West , movie producers did their best to come up with convincing action movie baddies .
Having been conceived long before the fall of the wall , the Hunt for Red October , an adaptation of Tom Clancy 's 1984 novel , still performed well at the box office in 1990 .
But in projects conceived after the end of Cold War hostilities , the baddies are very often neo-nationalists or rebels trying to destabilise a friendly Russia ( Crimson Tide and Air Force One ) or are avaricious terrorists and gangsters of other nationalities ( Die Hard ) .
Cold War the Sequel
The effect of the end of the Cold War on secret services and military personnel came to be a major theme .
John Le Carre was one of those spy novel authors who made the transition smoothly .
The Russia House marked the last of his novels released during the Cold War , the next three deal with the effect of the thaw on intelligence operatives , while the subsequent four , including the Tailor of Panama and the Constant Gardener are not directly related to the Cold War .
But Hodder and Stoughton , his publisher , maintain sales of the Cold War novels were unaffected by the events of 1989 .
Threads - not your average prime - time BBC drama King is sceptical about whether current Cold War fears will quickly feed back into popular culture .
" Films take a while to get on the screen - I do n't think we will see anything for a year . "
Film producers and publishers may also feel that with the long lead times , tensions could be defused by the time anything gets to market .
They are returning to Cold War classics but not necessarily because of modern fears over relations between the West and Russia .
WarGames was recently remade as a straight - to - DVD release although terrorism underpinned the story rather than a renewed Cold War .
It has also been recently reported that Red Dawn is to be remade , although the exact plot is unclear .
But as well as those cultural products directly referencing or making allusions to the Cold War , the conflict also provided the backdrop to massive shifts and vigorous battles in everything from product design and modern art to fashion , says Jane Pavitt , curator of the Cold War Modern exhibition opening next month at the Victoria and Albert Museum .
" It was a competition to be modern , " says Pavitt .
" Consumer society was used as a bulwark against communism in Europe in the 1950s .
That 's why fashion and kitchen goods can be seen as part of this . "
For those who were too young to remember the Berlin Wall coming down , or were born afterwards , the unique fears of the Cold War era , and the popular culture they steered , may be hard to appreciate .
But for anyone over the age of 25 in the West , they remain a deeply significant part of our psyche .
Below is a selection of your comments .
What about Soviet / Eastern Bloc popular culture during the cold war - was it also full of espionage dramas and ' what if ' nuclear bomb scenarios ?
As someone old enough to remember it from a British perspective , I realise I have no idea at all how it was perceived and represented in media the other side of the Iron Curtain .
I 'm sure there is a level of propaganda and also aware that creativity was somewhat stifled , but is there a parallel strand of writing / drama / film - making that we 're all ignorant of over here ?
WorldGirl , Enfield , UK I have grown up at the other side of the Iron Curtain and can assure you : the fear that the Cold War would spiral out of control was just as real on our side , only that we expected the West to make the first move .
This was reflected in our popular culture in a similar way as was quoted in the article .
I used to think : perhaps both sides are just too afraid of each other , perhaps such fears could be calmed by assuring each other that " we " would not make the first move .
However , my views have changed a bit over the years .
Having seen how readily the West is prepared to enter into a war ( Yugoslavia , twice in Iraq , Afghanistan ) and how openly it encroaches on Russia 's borders by supporting various colour - coded revolutions , I am beginning to wonder who was indeed the more aggressive side .
For anyone getting into a rage about this posting : just for one moment , try to forget our view that we are always right and that our view on democracy justifies any means to spread it around the world .
Try to be unbiased and then read again what I said .
Holger Laux , Bristol , UK
It 's interesting , and perhaps significant , that in times of national perceived potential threat from outside , so much creativity happens .
I remember vividly the tension of the 1980s , the big changes in the UK and around the world .
In some ways , it was an exciting time because every new day could bring danger .
Is that what we humans survive on and does it draw us together ?
Krystyna , Sedgley
In the mid 1980 's I can remember being in a 6th form who generally agreed that they would not live to be 30 because nuclear war was both imminent and inevitable .
A strange mix of living a normal life but with the constant knowledge of impending disaster .
This is probably why I felt so uneasy with the worsening relationship between Russia and the West .
The world is , in my opinion , much less stable than it was in the 80s and the politicians are much more dangerous and paranoid than Maggie / Ronnie / Andropov / Chernenko .
John Ferris , Coventry , UK I 'm 27 and can just about remember the Berlin Wall coming down , though I can't say I remember much more about the cold war .
I 'd raise your threshold to at least 30 !
James , London
How true .
I was only nine years old when they installed an air raid siren to the roof of our school .
There were lots of discussions about what we would do with our last three minutes of life before the bombs arrived .
It sounds trivial now but at the time we were convinced it would happen .
Dawn , Redhill Reading the above it confirms my gut feeling that it is the Media that stir up scenarios causing more trouble than most just by publishing half of the story and twisting the facts .
Even the BBC has succumbed to the drum of the gutter press by allowing the papers to show headlines on some of their programmes such as Breakfast , the BBC does not need to give the like of these people air time they have enough journalists to concoct their own stories , so why of why do they ( BBC ) despoil their standards with drivel ?
Robert , Liverpool I was born in 1985 so missed the hysteria , but we were subjected to ' Threads ' in school .
I did n't sleep for weeks and when I did I dreamt of that cat on fire and the melting milk bottles !
Have n't been to Sheffield since !!
Martin Doyle , St Albans
Threads was an excellent - and terrifying - story , and was also the first ' post - holocaust drama ' to incorporate the concept of the nuclear winter , which had only recently been realised .
And it was more than just a story : it included occasional subtitles to spell out what would be happening .
It 's hardly likely to get repeated ( and would in all likelihood be out of date with its figures ) , but as an illustration of why not to play with nuclear weapons it was second to none .
Ruaraidh Gillies , Wirral , UK Please stop doing this .
Drumming up panic when there is no need .
Even Russia has said they do n't want another cold war .
There is NO crisis , just sabre rattling as always .
Rich , UK
Yes a large influence on Culture of the 80's when I grew up .
I went into the RAF and ended up at Greenham Common on the other side from the peace camp .
I have still have a Cold War playlist on my iPod with tracks like ' Two Tribes ' , ' Mad World ' and ' 19 ' .
Recent Computer games like Operation Flashpoint also hark back to the Cold War 80s .
Are we going into a Second Cold War .
Yes and there is nothing the West can do .
Simon CS , Farnham , Surrey , UK The Cold War was fun and inspired some great films .
Matt , Philadelphia USA
Let 's hope that we do n't go back to the scare - mongering of the early eighties .
For once I would like to think that today 's youngsters are a bit de-sensitised to the whole ' we 're all going to die ' thoughts portrayed back then .
I myself started digging out a bunker at the age of seven for our family to shelter in .
When I was discovered I claimed it was a copy of Percy Thrower 's Blue Peter sunken garden !!!
Jenny , Wolves I remember being absolutely terrified of nuclear war growing up .
It was an all too real possibility .
The intro to " Two Tribes " used to frighten me , and " Threads " is just as disturbing to watch now as it ever was .
We also had the misfortune to live nine miles from the RAF / US Navy bases and oil refineries making us a prime target .
When the Air Force did their low - flying exercises in the middle of the night , I 'd lie awake waiting for a bomb blast to follow .
That said , I think the idea of being nuked at any moment really beefed up Western popular culture at the time .
Mandi , Cardiff , Wales
They do n't need to drop the bomb .
Russia has between 1/4 and 1/3 of the world 's oil and natural gas .
All they have to do is turn the taps off .

If you ’re unhappy at work , I ’m sure that the thought “ Man , I really should quit ! ” crosses your mind occasionally .
So why do n’t you ?
Even if you long desperately to quit , to get away from your horrible workplace , annoying co-workers or abusive managers , you may hesitate to actually do anything about it , because right on the heels of that impulse come a lot of other thoughts that hold you back from quitting .
Each of these excuses may sound to you like the voice of sanity , offering perfectly good reasons why it is in fact better to stay and endure that bad job just a little longer , but look a little closer , and they do n’t really hold up .
What they do instead is keep you trapped in a job that is slowly but surely wearing you down .
Here are 10 of the most common bad excuses for staying in a bad job .
# 1 “ Things might get better ”
That jerk manager might be promoted out of there .
That annoying co-worker could quit .
That mound of overwork could suddenly disappear .
On the other hand , things might also get worse .
Or they might not change at all .
If you ’ve already done your best to improve your job situations and nothing ’s happened , just waiting around for things to improve by themselves make little sense .
# 2 “ My boss is such a jerk but if I quit now , he wins . ”
Who cares .
This is not about winning or losing , this is your life .
Move on , already .
# 3 “ I ’m not a quitter . ”
Well guess what these somewhat successful people have in common : Larry Page , Sergey Brin , Tiger Woods , Reese Witherspoon , John McEnroe and John Steinbeck ?
Yep , they all dropped out of Stanford .
The old saying that “ Winners never quit and quitters never win ” is just plain wrong and leaving a bad job is just common sense .
# 4 “ I ’ll never get another job ”
Well not if you stay in your current job while it slowly grinds you down , you wo n’t !
Move on now while you still have some self - confidence , motivation and energy left .
# 5 “ If I quit I ’ll lose my salary , status , company car , the recognition of my peers , etc . ”
Yes , quitting a job carries a price and that makes it scary .
We all know this intimately .
But few of us ask this question :
What is the price of staying in a job that makes you unhappy ?
That price can be very high .
It can ruin your work life but also your marriage , your family life , your health , your self - esteem and your sanity .
Not all at once , but a little bit every day .
# 6 “ Everywhere else is just as bad ”
That ’s just nonsense .
There are plenty of great workplaces in every industry .
# 7 “ I ’ve invested so much in this job already ”
You may have sacrificed a lot of time , energy and dignity already in attempts to make things better .
This will make it more difficult for you to call it quits .
I ’m reminded of how Nigerian email scammers sucker in people .
At first it ’s a small investment , but then the amounts grow and grow .
At each step the victim is reluctant to stop because that would mean losing all the money he ’s spent so far .
Quit anyway .
Staying on is just throwing good time after bad .
# 8 “ I ’ll lose my health insurance . ”
I have a lot of sympathy for this argument .
Where I live ( Denmark ) , everybody gets free health care regardless of their employment situation so I can’t imagine the leverage this must give employers .
One answer : Start looking for another job with similar health benefits .
Also :
Ask yourself what good job related health insurance is if your job is actually making your sick – which bad jobs can absolutely do .
# 9 “ My job pays very well ”
I have zero sympathy for this argument .
I do n’t care how well your job pays ; if it makes you unhappy it ’s not worth it .
Quite the contrary , if you make a lot of money now , use that financial security to quit and find a job that ’ll make you happy .
# 10 “ Quitting will look bad on my CV ”
Whereas staying for years in a job that grinds you down and goes nowhere will look excellent .
The upshot
Many of us would be much happier at work if we quit bad jobs sooner .
I ’ve talked to many people who have finally managed to quit a bad job and only wished they ’d done it sooner .
I have yet to meet a single person who quit a crappy job only to wish they ’d stayed on longer .
You may have perfectly good reasons to stay in your crappy job – all I ’m saying is that it pays to examine those reasons very closely to make sure that they hold up .
‘ Cause it may just be the fear talking .
Your take
What do you think ?
Have you ever been stuck in a lousy workplace ?
What kept you from leaving ?
What finally made you quit ?
Please write a comment , I ’d love to hear your take .

Last Tuesday without any fanfare , the Barack Obama campaign announced Jennifer Joyce and Bob McCulloch , the top prosecutors in St. Louis city and St. Louis County , were joining something called an Obama truth squad .
They plan to respond immediately to any misleading advertisements and statements that might violate Missouri ethics laws .
" We want to keep this campaign focused on issues , " Joyce told me .
" Missourians do n’t want to be distracted by these divisive character attacks . "
The truth squad ’s plan is to indentify false attacks and respond immediately with truthful information , Joyce and McCulloch say .
Truthful information like : Obama is a Christian who plans to cut taxes for anyone making under $ 250,000 a year .
The Obama campaign says prosecutors from the Kansas City area and some rural areas are also joining the truth squad , and Jefferson County Sheriff Glenn Boyer was also expected to be part of the team .
" Whether it is directly attributable to the campaign or one of the soft money operations , " McCulloch told me , " if they ’re not going to tell the truth , then somebody ’s got to step up and say ‘ wait a minute , that ’s not true , this is the truth . ’"
For reasons that are still not fully clear , prosecutors promising to tell the public the truth have sparked outrage among supporters of John McCain .
Three days later , I got a call from KMOX radio talk show host Mark Reardon .
( I ’ll paraphrase . )
That story you did last night is really getting a lot of attention , Reardon said .
I was off yesterday .
What story ?
I asked .
The one about the Obama truth squad , he said .
Oh , that story I did Tuesday at 6 , I responded .
Well , Rush Limbaugh just talked about it , and the blogoshpere has it , and it ’s getting big .
It ’s really going to get big , Reardon said .
Reardon was correct .
More than 90,000 people from across the country watched my report on KMOV.com .
Click here to watch the report
When I returned to the office on Saturday , I spoke with callers from New York to Florida who had heard about Obama ’s truth squad and were outraged about it .
One caller said he was angry , because people were going to be " prosecuted " and " indicted " for stating their political views .
Another caller said Obama was planning to send police to the homes of elderly women because of their political statements .
A third caller said he wanted information about Obama ’s " storm troopers . "
Members of law enforcement never said anyone would be prosecuted , indicted or punished for saying anything , only that they were prepared to tell the public the truth .
By Saturday afternoon , outgoing Missouri Gov. Matt Blunt , a McCain supporter , was also outraged and accused Obama of " police state tactics " that would " intimidate people and kill free debate . "
In a written statement on the governor ’s official Web site , Blunt said the basis for his statement was prompted by " news reports . "
" The only conceivable purpose of Messrs .
McCulloch , Obama and the others is to frighten people away from expressing themselves , to chill open debate , " Blunt said in the statement .
Prosecutor Jennifer Joyce said : " We ’re here to respond to any character attacks , to set the record straight . "
" Barack Obama needs to grow up , " Blunt continued .
" Usually , we ignore false and scurrilous accusations , because the purveyors have no credibility .
When necessary , we refute them . "
Is n’t that what Joyce and McCulloch say they plan to do ?
If we follow Blunt ’s argument , what does that say about his opinion of the John McCain Truth Squad and those responsible for it ?
Yes , McCain has a truth squad , too .

Oil prices are tipped to rise
The Arctic is estimated to hold 90bn barrels of untapped oil , according to figures from the US Geological Survey ( USGS ) .
The USGS says the area has three times as much untapped natural gas as oil .
Drilling plans in the Arctic have been controversial , with environment groups worried about the effect on wildlife .
While oil prices have been falling in recent days to around $ 125 a barrel , many analysts expect oil prices to remain high , and even to rise again .
See map of Arctic
The figures from the USGS are said to be the first estimate of the energy available north of the Arctic circle .
According to the survey , the Arctic holds about 13 % of the world 's undiscovered oil , 30 % of the undiscovered natural gas , and 20 % of the undiscovered natural gas liquids .
" Before we can make decisions about our future use of oil and gas and related decisions about protecting endangered species , native communities and the health of our planet , we need to know what 's out there , " said USGS director Mark Myers .
US President George W Bush has already urged Congress to end a ban on drilling for oil in US coastal waters , to make the US less reliant on imports .
Exploration companies believe the recent rapid ice melt in the Arctic may make it easier to get reserves out of the region .
The oil and gas is said to be recoverable using current technology , but the USGS said it " did not consider economic factors such as the effects of permanent sea ice or oceanic water depth in its assessment of undiscovered oil and gas resources " .
ARCTIC BOUNDARIES
All coastal states are entitled to claim an exclusive economic zone , extending up to 200 nautical miles from their coastline .
Beyond 200 nautical miles , states can claim rights over continental shelf so long as they can provide scientific proof to the UN that it belongs to them .
Russia and Norway have both submitted claims to the UN .
Where a maritime boundary has yet to be agreed , a line equidistant between the two countries is shown .
Return to story
An earlier version of this story erroneously said the Arctic 's estimated oil reserves were equal to Russia's .

NIST Claims “ New Phenomenon ” Occurred For First Time Ever In Collapse Of WTC 7
Yet fails to address why ground zero workers and media outlets had prior knowledge of an “ extraordinary event ” never before observed an hour in advance , plus myriad of other ignored issues
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet
Friday , August 22 , 2008
In its final report on the collapse of WTC 7 that news outlets are reporting “ puts 9/11 conspiracy theories to bed , ” NIST claims that the never before observed “ new phenomenon ” of “ thermal expansion ” was to blame for the destruction of the building , a completely ludicrous conclusion in a report that simply ignores eyewitness testimony and hard evidence that points to the deliberate demolition of the structure .
NIST completely fails to address prior knowledge of the building ’s collapse , including why news outlets like the BBC and CNN reported that the building had collapsed an hour before it actually fell , as well as firefighters on the scene who are heard on video saying , “ Keep your eye on that building , it ’ll be coming down soon . ”
If the collapse of WTC 7 came as a result of a “ new phenomenon ” and an “ extraordinary event ” that had never happened before in the history of building collapses , then why did news stations and ground zero workers know it was about to happen a hour or more in advance ?
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
This on its own completely destroys the very foundation of NIST ’s assertion that a “ new phenomenon ” was responsible for the collapse .
Which is the more likely scenario – that ground zero officials and media outlets got word that the building was going to be “ pulled ” – or that they employed clairvoyant powers of deduction that enabled them to foresee an event that had never happened before in history to a building that was structurally reinforced and had suffered limited fires ?
NIST claims that the collapse of Building 7 is “ The first known instance of fire causing the total collapse of a tall building ” .
We are actually being asked to believe the impossible – that WTC 7 was the only building in history to have defied all precedent and suffered a complete and almost instantaneous collapse from fire damage alone , despite this being an impossibility if one accepts the basic laws of physics as accurate .
The issue of molten metal , which was discovered under both the twin towers and WTC 7 , suggesting an extremely hot burning agent was used in the demolition process , is completely ignored in NIST ’s report , despite it being acknowledged in Appendix C of FEMA ’s World Trade Center Building Performance Study , which stated :
Evidence of a severe high temperature corrosion attack on the steel , including oxidation and sulfidation with subsequent intergranular melting , was readily visible in the near - surface microstructure .
A liquid eutectic mixture containing primarily iron , oxygen , and sulfur formed during this hot corrosion attack on the steel …
The severe corrosion and subsequent erosion of Samples 1 and 2 are a very unusual event .
No clear explanation for the source of the sulfur has been identified .
Speaking during a press conference that was called to counter NIST , Richard Gage , founder of Architects & Engineers for 9/11 Truth and a member of the American Institute of Architects , dismissed the report .
“ Tons of [ molten metal ] was found 21 days after the attack , ” said Gage in an interview with a Vancouver , Canada television station .
“ Steel does n’t begin to melt until 2,700 degrees , which is much hotter than what these fires could have caused . ”
“ There are holes in this story that you can drive a truck through , ” he added , citing NIST ’s claim that no evidence suggested loud explosive booms accompanied the collapse of the building by reminding that Thermite , a steel cutting agent , makes no explosive sound .
Even aside from this argument , there were numerous close proximity eyewitnesses who reported loud explosions , including NYPD officer Craig Bartmer and ground zero first responder Kevin McPadden ( who also experienced the countdown before the building fell ) , but this fact was again simply ignored by NIST .
“ FEMA found it , ” said Gage .
“ Dr. Steven Jones found it , in the dust that landed in the entire area of lower Manhattan .
And he finds it in the chunks of previously molten metal [ from the towers ] . ”
The core of NIST ’s explanation , that an “ extraordinary event ” called “ thermal expansion ” was to blame for the sudden total collapse of the building is of course on the face of it a fraud when one considers the innumerable number of buildings that have suffered roaring fires across the majority of their floors and remained standing , whereas WTC 7 suffered limited fire damage across a handful of floors .
NIST also claims that the building only fell at 40 % free fall speed , as if this is n’t suspicious in itself .
Remember that this 47 - story behemoth took just 7 seconds to completely collapse within its own footprint falling through the path of most resistance .
As the George Washington blog points out , “ NIST said that WTC 7 fell at 40 % slower than free fall speed .
But it collapsed a lot faster than it would have if the structural supports were not all blown away at the same instant .
40 % slower is n’t very impressive — that ’s like arguing that a rock falling through concrete 40 % slower than a rock falling through the air is perfectly normal . ”
The George Washington blog has compiled a list of experts in structural engineering and demolition who have all questioned NIST ’s conclusion .
None of these individuals were approached by NIST to partake in their final report .
Two professors of structural engineering at a prestigious Swiss university ( Dr. Joerg Schneider and Dr. Hugo Bachmann ) said that , on 9/11 , World Trade Center 7 was brought down by controlled demolition ( translation here ) .
Kamal S. Obeid , structural engineer , with a masters degree in Engineering from UC Berkeley , of Fremont , California , says :
“ Photos of the steel , evidence about how the buildings collapsed , the unexplainable collapse of WTC 7 , evidence of thermite in the debris as well as several other red flags , are quite troubling indications of well planned and controlled demolition ”
Ronald H. Brookman , structural engineer , with a masters degree in Engineering from UC Davis , of Novato California , writes :
“ Why would all 47 stories of WTC 7 fall straight down to the ground in about seven seconds … ?
It was not struck by any aircraft or engulfed in any fire .
An independent investigation is justified for all three collapses including the surviving steel samples and the composition of the dust . ”
Graham John Inman , structural engineer , of London , England , points out :
“ WTC 7 Building could not have collapsed as a result of internal fire and external debris .
NO plane hit this building .
This is the only case of a steel frame building collapsing through fire in the world .
The fire on this building was small & localized therefore what is the cause ? ”
A Dutch demolition expert ( Danny Jowenko ) stated that WTC 7 was imploded
A prominent physicist with 33 years of service for the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington , DC ( Dr. David L. Griscom ) said that the official theory for why the Twin Towers and world trade center building 7 collapsed “ does not match the available facts ” and supports the theory that the buildings were brought down by controlled demolition
To claim that the collapse of WTC 7 is “ no longer a mystery , ” as chief NIST investigator Dr. Shyam Sunder stated yesterday smacks of a desperate attempt to proclaim the authority of the official story by mere words alone , when in reality NIST ’s laughable “ new phenomenon ” claim , the latest in a long line of changing explanations for the obvious demolition of Building 7 , only heaps more embarrassment on NIST and makes the official 9/11 story look more untrustworthy than ever before .

I love me a song with a lot of words in it .
For example , Genesis wrote one in the 1970s called " Supper 's Ready "  that has a whopping 997 words - that 's a whole lotta lyric .
At the other end of the spectrum are the ones with supper minimalistic lyrics .
Also from the " ˜70s , for example , how about that Pink Floyd song from The Wall called " Is There Anybody Out There ? "  " “ a nearly three minute - long number with only 4 unique words in it : is , there anybody , out .
Discounting songs like those , that tell a larger story , The Wall - style , here are 7 stand - alone songs I love , each composed with fewer than 35 unique words .
Let 's get a list going .
What are some of your favorites ?
1. You Are So Beautiful
Whether we 're talking Joe Cocker , Ray Charles , or Kenny Rogers , this simple lyric , penned by Billy Preston , Dennis Wilson and Bruce Fisher , only has 31 unique words in it .
2. Everybody 's Gotta Learn Sometimes
Made popular by Beck in the movie Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind , this Korgis song only has 20 unique words in it .
3. Fly , Robin , Fly
According to Wiki , the German band Silver Convention wrote this one with only 6 unique words " due to the group not being able to speak English , and therefore unable to memorize a page of lyrics in a language unfamiliar to them . " 
4. Her Majesty
The Beatles were masters when it comes to packing in a lot of song with as few words as possible .
This one , which appeared as a hidden track at the end of their Abbey Road album and only has 34 unique words in it .
5. Hava Nagila
This traditional Jewish melody recorded by many , including Ben Folds Five and Bob Dylan ( and heard round the country at sporting events ) has only 10 unique words in it .
Translated from the Hebrew , they mostly mean " Let 's rejoice and be happy ! " 
6. In - A - Gadda -Da-Vida
Despite being more than 17 minutes long , this Iron Butterfly classic only has 30 unique words in it .
( I 'm counting In - a - gadda - da - vida as one word , otherwise you can say it has 34 unique words I guess — even though they are slurred , drunken words . )
7 . It 's a Beautiful Day
Not to be confused with U2's # 1 hit , the Queen song of the same name has only 28 unique words .

Colbert demands speaking role at Democratic Convention

Mocking suggestions that Hillary Clinton has to be allowed to speak at the Democratic Convention to give her followers " catharsis , " Stephen Colbert reminded viewers of his own abortive presidential campaign and suggested that " you deserve to have you have me have a speech at the Democratic National Convention . "
" I can already hear the objections , " Colbert continued .
" ' Stephen , do you really have the Democratic Party 's best interests at heart ? ' "
" Maybe not , " he conceded , " but they 're letting this guy speak -- and listen to his glowing endorsement of Obama . "
Colbert then played a clip of former President Bill Clinton responding to a question about whether Obama is ready to be president by saying , " You could argue that no one 's ever ready to be president . "
" I can fake it better than that ! " Colbert insisted .
" So Democrats , give me a speech ... or else , in the cavernous halls of the Denver Convention Center , you just might hear chants of ' Where 's Colbert . ' "
" Do you have any idea what the people of the Colbert Nation will do if they 're denied their catharsis ? " concluded Colbert .
" Let 's not go there . "
Comedy Central already has a petition up for those demanding that Colbert be given a chance to speak .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Say it ai n’t so .
An era ends on Sunday when the curtain comes down on baseball in storied Yankee Stadium , scene of more moments that will live in sporting history than any other place in America .

REUTERS / File
Strangely , in Sunday night ’s final contest between the New York Yankees and the Baltimore Orioles , nothing more than pride is at stake .
The Yankees have had a rare down season and will not be adding to their championship record this year .
Wrecking balls and sledgehammers , not baseballs and bats , will soon be the equipment of choice as the stadium is demolished in coming months , although there may yet be a “ closing ceremony ” featuring big name rock stars before the wrecking crews move in .
Next season , the Yankees will take their bats , balls and fabled pinstriped uniforms to a brand new Yankee Stadium nearing completion across the street from the current one .
Americans have always been wistful about their National Pastime .
Many cherish memories of playing catch with their fathers and of their first childhood visits to ballparks .
“ This field , this game .
It ’s a part of our past .
It reminds us of all that once was good , and it could be again , ” James Earl Jones ’s character said in the film “ Field of Dreams . ”
Through baseball history , no venue came closer to capturing that mystical quality than Yankee Stadium .
Built in 1923 to accommodate fans of slugger Babe Ruth , the first three - tiered baseball stadium quickly became known as “ The House That Ruth Built . ”
Over the next 85 years , the Yankees , who had won only one World Series before moving in , would accrue 25 more World Series crowns and 37 American League pennants at the stadium .
A succession of Yankee superstars achieved almost national mythic status -- Ruth , Lou Gehrig , Joe DiMaggio , Mickey Mantle and others .
Heroes came and went , but through it all , the stadium remained .
NOT JUST BASEBALL HISTORY
Yankee Stadium also provided a venue for historical events , both political and religious , that had nothing do with baseball .
The first papal mass ever on U.S. soil was celebrated there by Pope Paul VI on October 4 , 1965 .
Pope John Paul II and Pope Benedict XVI would also bless the faithful there .
A rally at the stadium on June 21 , 1990 , honored Nelson Mandela after his release from prison following the end of apartheid in South Africa .
There were also memorable moments in other sports .
At halftime of a scoreless college football game between the Fighting Irish of Notre Dame and Army on November 12 , 1928 , coach Knute Rockne delivered his famous “ Win one for the Gipper ! ” speech .
Notre Dame responded with a 12 - 6 victory .
On June 22 , 1938 , boxer Joe Louis avenged his defeat of two years earlier with a first - round knockout of Max Schmeling in a politically - freighted showdown between the “ Brown Bomber ” and the German brawler hailed by Adolf Hitler .
Generations of ballplayers have spoken of their emotions on walking into the stadium for the first time .
They invariably bring up the sense of history and tradition and the place the structure holds in the hearts of fans .
Slideshow ( 3 images )
Arguably the most poignant moment the stadium ever witnessed happened on July 4 , 1939 .
Yankee captain and first baseman Lou Gehrig had been recently diagnosed with a neurodegenerative disease that now bears his name and would take his life in less than two years .
Gehrig was overwhelmed by the outpouring of support he received on a day of appreciation staged for him .
“ Fans , for the past two weeks you have been reading about the bad break I got .
Yet today I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth , ” he said .
He concluded with , “ I may have had a tough break , but I have an awful lot to live for . ”
The EU is considering a plan to extend musical copyrights for another 45 years , ostensibly to help out aging performers who are being cut off when the current 50 - year terms expire .
But those musicians ( can someone introduce them to the concept of saving for retirement ? ) wo n't see much of the new cash , according to the UK's Open Rights Group .
Most performers will make less than € 30 a year , even as major labels and big stars take far more .
The Open Rights Group , a UK " grassroots technology advocacy organization , " is responding to a request for comments from the UK's Intellectual Property Office .
UKIPO wants to know how it should weigh in on the EU - wide proposal , and the Open Rights Group 's response is clear : the proposal is a bad idea .
This was also the conclusion reached by a leading European copyright expert , Professor Bernt Hugenholtz , in a paper actually paid for in part by the European Commission .
( When the Commission simply ignored the paper in making its policy proposal , Hugenholtz went public with his astonishment and displeasure . )
It was also the conclusion reached by the Gowers Review in the UK , which took a wide - angle look at intellectual property issues and concluded that copyright term extensions were n't necessary or justified by the facts .
In its analysis , the Open Rights Group focuses on one of the key problems presented by the EU : aging musicians whose royalties run out just as they become old and infirm .
According to the group , a 45 - year term extension is hardly the best way to address the issue .
" The Commission makes much of the challenging financial situation facing aging performers , " it says .
" While we do not accept that IP law is an appropriate mechanism to deal with this situation , as we will demonstrate in the second section of this submission , it also turns out to be a very inefficient one . "
That 's because 90 percent of the extra money generated during the extended term will go to music labels .
Of the 10 percent that goes directly to artists , eight or nine percent will go to the " top 20 percent of earning performers " — in other words , the most successful groups , which have already made millions .
Courtesy Open Rights Group
That leaves only one to two percent of the entire pie for the remaining 80 percent of performers .
This is the money that most of the poor and aging musicians will split .
There are several proposals for doing this , but even the most optimistic Open Rights Group calculation shows that these performers will average a maximum of € 26.79 per year .
Labels would make anywhere from hundreds of thousands of euros to millions of euros a year .
Such calculations lead the ORG to ask whether it would n't be more sensible to address the issue of poor musicians by looking at " the contractual terms between performers and producers , " or to examine " retirement and social insurance schemes " to make sure they 're effective .
Given the EU 's proposal , ORG can't help but wonder if facts were n't the primary determinant in choosing to go forward with a term extension fight ; the evidence " strongly suggests that [ the Commission ] has been swayed by special - interest lobbying , " says the group .
Let ’s admit it , most elderly people can’t handle today ’s “ new fangled ” television remotes .
They all think that they ’ll break something if they hit a button they ’ve never touched before .
Even my parents , who are in their mid-60s , look like complete idiots when trying to switch from one television channel to another .
They ’re so slow to punch in numbers that when switching to a multi - digit channel , they do n’t even have time to hit the second or third number before the television thinks they ’re done with their choice .
I do n’t know about you , but this drives me totally crazy .
Anyway , if you ’re like me and know some old folks who are afraid of touching remotes of any kind , the following comic by Roz Chast will really make you snicker .

BAGHDAD , Iraq ( CNN ) --
" There are the bloodstains on the wall , and here it is dried on the floor , " Abu Muhanad said as he walked through a torture chamber in a Baghdad mosque where more than two dozen bodies have been found .
Two women clutch photographs of loved ones believed killed by the Mehdi Army .
more photos »
" And here , a woman 's shoes .
She was a victim of the militia .
We found her corpse in the grave . "
Chunks of hair waft lazily across the floor in the hot Baghdad breeze .
" This was the torture room , " said Muhanad , the leader of a U.S. - backed armed group that now controls the mosque .
" This is what they used for hanging , " he said , pointing to a cord dangling from the ceiling .
" Here is a chain we found tied to an old man 's body . "
Go inside the mosque 's torture chamber »
The horrific scene at this southwestern Baghdad mosque is what officials say was the work of a Shiite militia known as the Mehdi Army .
Residents who live near the mosque say they could hear the victims ' screams .
The militia had been in control of the mosque , called Adib al - Jumaili , from at least January 2007 until May of this year .
Residents say coalition forces were n't in the region and the torture and killings went unchecked .
Some of the victims were accused of being spies for U.S. forces .
Other family members do n't know why their loved ones disappeared .
The family members at the mosque who spoke to CNN were all Shiite , the same branch of Islam as the Mehdi militia .
But , they say , some of the victims were Sunni as well .
Watch mosque atrocities uncovered »
The neighborhood lies in an area that became one of the capital 's many sectarian fault lines when violence was at its worst .
It 's been about three months since the Mehdi Army , loyal to radical Shiite cleric Muqtada al - Sadr , abandoned this mosque as it withdrew from several strongholds across the country .
Spray painted on the walls is a chilling warning : " Spies , you will dig your own graves .
Long live the Mehdi Army . "
Now the mosque is under the watch of the Sons of Iraq , a local armed group that is largely financed by the Americans working alongside the Iraqi police .
They are charged with trying to keep the peace in the neighborhood .
Muhanad is their leader .
" We found this chain on an old man 's corpse that we dug out of the grave , " he said , gesturing to a bloodied chain on the floor .
" We recovered about 22 corpses and then another five . "
Only now are people able to understand the true magnitude of the Shiite militia 's atrocities and the brutal laws they were enforcing on the people .
" This was my son 's grave , " Abu Wissam said , pointing to one of the many shallow holes in the mosque 's garden .
" We recovered his corpse completely rotten .
His hands and legs were amputated , and his head was decapitated . "
" He was just a college graduate , " his mother sobbed , clutching her 25 - year - old son 's photo .
They say the Mehdi Army abducted their son about a year ago , accusing him of being a traitor .
They shot up and looted his home .
The family fled .
A gruesome video of their son's mutilated body was delivered to their doorstep .
The militia " still raid our homes , " Abu Wissam said .
" Their families are in the district .
The day before yesterday , at noon , they tried to assassinate me , but I was able to call the police for help . "
The neighborhood is eerily deserted .
Most of the residents fled the militia 's reign ; many who stayed bore the brunt of the violence .
Homes stand abandoned , shops shuttered , buildings shot up .
A single car drives down the main street as a pack of dogs runs through the twisted piles of metal that was once an outdoor market .
Lingering at the mosque are a handful of residents whose loved ones were also abducted , looking for clues .
" They said they were just taking him for a few minutes , for an investigation , " said Karima , who only wanted to be identified by her first name , as her eyes filled with tears .
" But they never released him and we heard he might be buried behind the mosque . "
Umm Diab 's breath came in shallow gasps as tears flowed from her turquoise - green eyes .
She wiped them away using the corner of her abaya , or robe .
In her hand , there 's a passport photo of her father , who was abducted by the militia .
" All we want are their dead bodies , " she said .
Although the Mehdi Army has moved out of this mosque and is less visible on the street , residents know that they 're not gone .
" They 're still threatening us , " Umm Diab said .

Marcus Aurelius ruled over the empire for 19 years
Enlarge Image
Parts of a giant , exquisitely carved marble sculpture depicting the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius have been found at an archaeological site in Turkey .
Fragments of the statue were unearthed at the ancient city of Sagalassos .
So far the statue 's head , right arm and leg parts have been discovered , high in the mountains of southern Turkey .
Marcus Aurelius was portrayed by Richard Harris in the Oscar - winning 2000 film Gladiator and was one of the so - called " Five Good Emperors " .
He reigned from 161AD until his death in 180AD .
In addition to his deeds as emperor , Marcus Aurelius is remembered for his writings , and is considered one of the foremost Stoic philosophers .
The partial statue was unearthed in the largest room at Sagalassos 's Roman baths .
The cross -shaped room measures 1,250 sq m ( 13,500 sq ft ) , is covered in mosaics and was probably used as a frigidarium - a room with a cold pool which Romans could sink into after a hot bath .
It was partially destroyed in an earthquake between 540AD and 620 AD , filling the room with rubble .
Archaeologists have been excavating the frigidarium for the past 12 years .
The dig is part of wider excavations at the ruined city , which was once an important regional centre .
Imperial gallery Last year , the team led by Prof Marc Waelkens , from the Catholic University of Leuven in Belgium , uncovered fragments of a colossal marble statue of the emperor Hadrian in the rubble .
This month , the researchers found a huge head and arm belonging to Faustina the Elder - wife of the emperor Antoninus Pius .
Archaeologists now think the room hosted a gallery of sculptures depicting the " Antonine dynasty " - rulers of Spanish origin who presided over the Roman Empire during the second century AD .
The emperor wore army boots decorated with lion skins Early on 20 August , a huge pair of marble lower legs , broken just above the knee , turned up in the debris .
They also found a 1.5 m - long ( 5 ft - long ) right arm and hand holding a globe which was probably once crowned by a gilded bronze " Victory " figure .
But it was the giant marble head which identified this statue as the young Marcus Aurelius .
The colossal head , which is just under 1 m ( 3 ft ) in height , is said to bear his characteristic bulging eyes and beard .
Prof Waelkens said the pupils were gazing upwards " as if in deep contemplation , perfectly fitting of an emperor who was more of a philosopher than a soldier " .
He added that the sculpture , which stood about 4.5 m ( nearly 15 ft ) tall , was one of the finest depictions of the Roman ruler .
The emperor wore exquisitely carved army boots decorated with a lion skin , tendrils and Amazon shields .
The torso was probably covered in bronze armour filled inside with terracotta or wood .
When the niche 's vault collapsed in the earthquake , the torso would have exploded .
Bath complex
The statue of Hadrian was found lying halfway down in the frigidarium 's rubble .
This initially led archaeologists to think it had been hauled in there from another part of the huge bath complex , perhaps to remove its gilded bronze armour , or to burn the huge marble pieces to make cement in a nearby lime kiln .
However , they now think sculptures of Hadrian , his wife Vibia Sabina , another Roman emperor Antoninus Pius , his wife Faustina the Elder , and Marcus Aurelius all once adorned niches situated around the room .
There were three large niches on both the western and eastern sides .
The fragments of Hadrian 's statue were found near the south - west niche .
The front parts of two female feet were discovered in the opposite niche , on the room 's south - eastern side .
The remains of a globe can still be seen , cupped in the right hand
The archaeologists now think these belonged to a colossal figure of Vibia Sabina , who was forced into marriage with the homosexual Hadrian at the age of 14 .
Remains of the statue depicting Faustina the Elder were found further along , on the eastern side .
In the opposite niche , they found the front parts of a pair of male feet in sandals , which could belong to her husband , Antoninus Pius - who succeeded Hadrian as emperor .
The experts suggest Antonine emperors occupied niches on the western side of the room , while their spouses stood opposite , on the east side .
Five good emperors
After the discovery of Faustina and her male counterpart , the archaeologists guessed the north - western niche would contain a colossal statue of Marcus Aurelius - the longest - surviving successor of Antoninus Pius .
The discovery on Wednesday confirmed this prediction , and suggests the north - eastern niche may contain remains of a statue depicting Faustina the Younger , Marcus Aurelius 's wife .
Archaeologists will get the opportunity to excavate this part of the room next year .
The statue of Marcus Aurelius stood in the north - western niche Despite his philosophical leanings , Marcus Aurelius had to spend much of his reign fighting Germanic tribes along the Austrian Danube where , in 180 AD , he died in nearby Carnuntum .
The part of Marcus Aurelius in Gladiator was one of Richard Harris 's last roles ( the actor died in 2002 ) .
Although much of the storyline is fictional , it is set against an historical backdrop of the imperial succession from Marcus Aurelius to his son Commodus .
While Marcus Aurelius is considered , along with Nerva , Trajan , Hadrian and Antoninus Pius , as one of Rome 's Five Good Emperors , Commodus 's reign was marked by internal strife , cruelty and conspiracies .
Commodus took part , naked , in gladiatorial battles - which he always won .
Opponents , whose lives were apparently spared , would eventually submit to the emperor .
He was murdered in 192AD - not by a general called Maximus , but by an athlete named Narcissus , sent by conspirators to strangle the megalomaniac emperor in his bath .

Stewart : Bush , McCain have ' memory loss ' on invading countries David Edwards and Stephen C. Webster
Published : Friday August 15 , 2008
Print This Email This How serious is the conflict between Russia and Georgia ?
So serious , President Bush has decided to delay his vacation to Crawford by ' a day or two , ' said spokeswoman Dana Perino .
" Well , I hope you 're happy , Russia ! " jeered a comically indignant Jon Stewart on Thursday night 's Daily Show .
But , said the host , it is ' short - term memory loss , ' and probably not delayed vacations , that the administration should be concerned about .
" Our president was trying to get a little brush clearing R&R in , between his visit to the Olympics and the beginning of football season , " said Stewart .
" Now who 's gonna clear the brush ?
His team of professional landscapers ? "
The host added : " We always know the president is pissed off when he starts talking in nonsensical absolutes that he , himself , would never follow . "
The show transitioned to a video clip of Bush , stating : " Russia has invaded a sovereign , neighboring state , and threatens a democratic government , elected by its people .
Such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century . "
Snapping his right hand , Stewart fluttered his eyelids and jeered , " Russia is so 20th century !
This century is all about preemptive strikes . "
Sec. of State Condoleezza Rice , recently dispatched to Georgia , surely holds " a more nuanced , less stunningly oblivious view , " the host sarcastically opined .
" This is not 1968 , " said Rice during a recent news conference . " ...
Where Russia can threaten its neighbors , occupy a capital , overthrow a government , and get away with it .
Things have changed . "
Stewart , uncomfortably glancing at his surroundings , belted , " Do you guys have any short - term memory ?
Anything ?
Yeah , no , let 's be clear about it .
You can't just overthrow a government , occupy a capital , knock over their statues , stack their prisoners , refer to the horrific levels of civilian casualties as ' birth pangs of democracy ' ... "
Though his comments , the on - screen graphics displayed iconic , and iconoclastic , imagery of the US occupation of Iraq .
Of course , what fun would a foreign war be to the Daily Show if the presidential candidates were n't hopping into the ' commander - in - chief simulator , to play a little make - believe ' ?
" The situation in Georgia remains fluid and dangerous , " said Sen. McCain .
" As soon as possible , my colleagues Sen. Lieberman and Sen. Graham will be traveling , they 're both mem ... Uh , to Georgia . "
Confused , Stewart shrugged .
" You 're just some f*ing guy !
You can't deploy ambassadors .
You were mad when Obama shook hands with the leader of Jordan .
Now you 're sending envoys ? "
The host joked that because he has as much authority as McCain on the Russia - Georgia crisis , he 'll be sending over Don Rickles and Jimmy " J.J. "
Walker .
" Why not ? " he asked .
" See what they can do ... "
" In the 21st century , nations do n't invade other nations , " said McCain near the close of Stewart 's segment .
Flashing an image of McCain embracing Bush , Stewart grinned and cracked , " You have learned your lesson well , grasshopper . "

CNN investigates McCain's ' greatest moral failure ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Wednesday August 20 , 2008
Print This Email This McCain ducks question about " discrepancies " in account of his divorce and remarriage Senator John McCain has repeatedly acknowledged that he was responsible for the failure of his first marriage , which he described as his " greatest moral failure " at last weekend 's Saddleback Forum , but he has always been reticent about the details .
CNN 's John King has been looking into the circumstances of McCain 's divorce from his first wife , Carol , and on Wednesday 's American Morning he presented a preview of the full story that will air on CNN tonight .
King explained that this chapter of McCain 's life " began nearly 30 years ago , when John McCain was in Hawaii and had a life - changing encounter . "
" I was a little taken aback , because I was a lot younger than he was , " Cindy McCain told King of that first encounter .
" And you lied about your age ? " King asked John McCain .
" I lied , " McCain agreed , breaking out in a reminiscent chuckle .
Not only was McCain 17 years older than Cindy , but he was still married to Carol , and their daughter was only 12 years old .
" The marriage was in trouble , " King explains .
" He 'd been having affairs for several years . "
Cindy told King that it did n't bother her to be dating a married man because " my husband had been separated .
...
You know , six and a half years , it was a long separation . "
McCain also wrote in his memoir that he had separated from Carol before he started dating Cindy .
However , notes King , " his own divorce filing shows they dated for nine months while he was still living with Carol , and records show he applied for a marriage license in Arizona before his divorce was final . "
When King asked McCain about the fact that " the chronology that is presented publicly does n't necessarily match the chronology of the documents , " McCain 's only answer was , " It 's 30 years ago .
I have a happy marriage . "
Cindy McCain similarly replied , " His reasons are his reasons .
I think I 've been a good wife . "

Computer researchers built a tool that demonstrates how hackers could silently turn Facebook users into a powerful zombie army that can attack other websites or scout for vulnerable sites on the net .
All that is necessary to create the Facebook Botnet is to have users choose install a rogue Facebook application written by an outside developer – in this case , one called Photo of the Day .
Once the user chooses to install the application , the unsuspecting user is inducted into the hacker 's army and unknowingly follows orders any time he or she logs into Facebook .
Facebook downplayed the attack , saying that any developer that could figure out how to make a successful application would make money other ways .
The researchers – mostly affiliated with the Greece - based Institute of Computer Science – describe their innovation in a paper ( .pdf ) as a demonstration of an " anti- social network " – essentially a hijacked social network that can be used for a number of nefarious purposes .
Their demo attack was very simple and surprisingly effective .
They created an application that displayed a new National Geographic photo daily on a user 's Facebook page – though the app was not approved of by National Geographic .
But in the background , the application is also downloading three large photos from a targeted site .
But the user 's browser never displays the images .
Any application with enough users will then act like a denial of service attack flooding the chosen website with requests for data .
The user stops being a part of the attack after logging out , but joins again every time he returns .
But Facebook spokesman Barry Schnitt disputes the economics of the attack .
" As a practical matter , it is not that easy to get an application with millions of users , " Schnitt said .
" Why would n't you get venture capital or make money with ad rather than use it to take down a website ? "
The researchers chose to point the hidden attack at their own server , of course – but were surprised that more than 1,000 Facebook users installed the application , even though they only mentioned it to friends .
That led to a peak of 300 requests per hour and on its peak day , the traffic went above 6 Mbits per second .
That 's an impressive number for an application with only 1,000 users , using only the most basic attack .
A much more sophisticated attack could be launched using a bit of JavaScript , and if that were married to an application such as Super Wall that has millions of daily users , one would likely have the worlds ' most powerful botnet .
Now , coders who control a really popular social networking app are n't likely to jeopardize their oil well for a prank , but it would not be hard for a slightly popular application to become rogue without anyone ever knowing or being able to figure out it was happening .
Facebook does not monitor each application 's source code , but does talk with developers of the most popular applications and monitors the site to look for anomalies , according to Schnitt .

MOSCOW --
The Kremlin is set to boost its defense budget by more than one - quarter , taking it to a post - Soviet high of $ 50 billion next year as it seeks to add muscle to its foreign policy and reverse underinvestment .
The cash infusion also is aimed at fixing problems revealed by last month 's brief war with Georgia .
Though the Russian military crushed the smaller Georgian one , it suffered substantial losses , according to military analysts .

At Saturday night ’s event at Saddleback Church , John McCain told the largely evangelical audience a version of history that the religious right likes to believe : “ Our nation was founded on Judeo - Christian values and principles . ”
That is , to put it mildly , historically dubious — the nation was founded on the secular principles , as part of the separation of church and state — but it ’s nevertheless a phrase McCain seems to be especially fond of lately .
On a frozen winter evening at a Town Hall meeting in a school in the Manchester , N.H. , suburbs , John McCain expressed surprise and irritation with an intelligence report downplaying the threat of Iran ’s nuclear program .
At the end of a long list of reasons to be suspicious of the Iranians , McCain declared : “ And they sure do n’t share our Judeo - Christian values . ”
It seemed at the time to be an odd thing to say about a Muslim country .
After all , even if there were no nuclear program , no oil , and no rabble - rousing president , Iran still would n’t have Judeo - Christian values .
And it ’s troubling to wonder if that alone would be a reason for suspicion .
Quite right .
For McCain to characterize our hostility for a rival nation in such starkly religious terms reminds us that when it comes to foreign policy , McCain frequently does n’t know what he ’s talking about .
But it ’s that phrase that continues to stand out .
The Boston Globe dug around a bit and noticed that McCain references “ Judeo - Christian values ” all the time , when talking about policies as varied as the economy , immigration , and foreign policy .
McCain , the Globe noted , seems to use the term as a synonym for “ American values . ”
That ’s really not a good idea .
Eric writes :
New deal or no deal :
It ’s certainly both brief and expansive .
The Secretary of the Treasury may purchase mortgage - related assets , and hire people to help him do it , and designate agents to do it , pretty much insofar as he pleases , up to $ 700,000,000,000 , beholden to nobody and subject to no review , for the next two years .
Compare for example the Reconstruction Finance Corporation , created in January 1932 , at 47 Stat. 5 , and authorized to loan to pretty much any lending agency as it pleased , with not more than $ 200,000,000 for the relief of banks closed or in the process of liquidation .
All loans had to be secured , could n’t be made on foreign securities or acceptances , no more than 5 % of the money could go to any one company , could n’t exceed three years ’ term , could n’t pay fees or commission to applicants for loans , and so forth .
Railroads accepting such loans had to do so under terms acceptable to the regulatory Interstate Commerce Commission .
The law in addition made provision for winding up the Corporation when appropriate and requiring it to report quarterly to the Congress on its activities and employees .
In short , although the situation in January of 1932 was visibly more dire than it is now , Congress was less willing to hand over utter independent authority to the Hoover administration .
rEVOLution site BreakTheMatrix.com ( BtM ) announced Sep. 24 that “ We ’re holding a live debate to be immediately followed by a four way money bomb during the first week of October . ”
On the same day , a website , ThirdPartyTicket.com ( TPT ) , was launched to promote the event .
BtM is a partnership of libertarians , and Ron Paul supporters , Trevor Lyman and Rick Williams .
Lyman organized the November 5 and December 16 , 2007 , money bombs which raised over $ 10 million for Paul 's presidential campaign , setting new one - day fundraising records .
TPT reports that the debate will be held in New York City in early October .
The target date is Oct. 8 , although a firm date will be announced later .
“ All of the major party candidates will be invited to participate ” – presumably , the six candidates listed on the TPT home page :
Constitution Party Candidate : Chuck Baldwin
Democratic Party Candidate : Barack Obama
Green Party Candidate : Cynthia McKinney
Independent Candidate : Ralph Nader
Libertarian Party Candidate : Bob Barr
Republican Party Candidate : John McCain
There is no word as yet on which candidates have accepted .
( The expectation is that Obama and McCain , who have contracted with the Commission on Presidential Debates ( CPD ) for a series of three exclusive presidential debates , will not participate . )
Two days ago I reported that Nader had let out that a third - party debate was “ set to take place ” in the coming weeks .
I believe this TPT debate is the event he was referring to .
UPDATE , Sep. 29 : The Nader campaign endorsed TPT on Sep. 27 .
Oct. 2 : The Baldwin campaign joined up on Sep. 30 .
The debate will be broadcast on the Internet by BtM “ and many others ( details to come ) . ”
Simultaneous with the debate , TPT will also hold a money bomb for the participating candidates .
That will not be a winner - take - all , as previously planned and reported .
Instead , TPT “ will launch a money bomb for each of the candidates .
Contributions will be made directly to the candidates via their respective websites .
ThirdPartyTicket.com will report the totals of all the candidates in one location as the moneybomb proceeds . ”
Adds the site : “ If a significant amount of funds are raised for one or more candidates the mainstream media will take notice ! ”
Besides BtM , the initial sponsors include OpenDebates.org and FreeandEqual.org , with “ Many more to come ! ”
Open Debates “ is a 501 ( c ) 3 nonprofit , nonpartisan organization committed to reforming the presidential debate process ” supported by over 60 supporting organizations .
It calls for replacing the bipartisan CPD with the non-partisan Citizens ' Debate Commission — the group which will presumably run the TPT debate .
I enthusiastically support this idea , with three reservations .
First , I do not think that an internet - only broadcast will generate enough interest to fundamentally change the dynamics of this election .
Network television coverage looks absolutely essential .
I hope that can be added as the planning develops .
C-SPAN televised an Oct. 6 , 2004 debate between presidential candidates Michael Badnarik of the Libertarian Party , Michael Peroutka of the Constitution Party , David Cobb of the Green Party and Walt Brown of the Socialist Party — a bunch of relative unknowns .
This year 's candidates all have higher public and media profiles .
Nader is the country 's best - known consumer advocate , and even has his own verb .
Barr and McKinney are both former Congressmen .
Baldwin , though less well known , received a huge boost in popularity this week with Ron Paul 's endorsement .
I expect C - SPAN , at least , to be televising the 2008 debate .
Second , I am worried about the relatively short lead time : just two weeks from website launch to target date .
However , Lyman has worked under tight deadlines before ; his November 2007 money bomb , which raised over $ 4 million for Paul 's presidential campaign , was organized in just three weeks .
Third , I am concerned with the low participation level so far .
TPT is aiming for 10,000 sponsors for the money bomb ; they have less than 1,000 to date .
That is mainly , I suspect , because relatively few people have heard of it .
Open Debates has not yet begun promoting the event ; nor have I seen it promoted on any of the candidates ' websites .
I would urge all supporters of all of the above candidates : please contact your campaign , tell them about the TPT debate , urge them to attend , and ask them to have it promoted on their campaign and party websites .
Similarly , if you are a member of Open Debates or any of the more than 60 groups on its List of Supporters , please contact your organization and urge it to get with the program .
For my part , I will be writing to websites and blogs that have written about third parties and the debates , plugging my article but also asking them to promote the debate .
Of course , I wo n't reach everyone ; so I would urge other readers to promote the TPT debate at the sites , blogs , and groups they read .

Sea ice in the Arctic Ocean has reached its second lowest level in nearly 30 years , according to new satellite measurements released this week .
The National Snow and Ice Data Center reported that sea ice in the Arctic now covers about 2.03 million square miles .
The lowest point since satellite measurements began in 1979 was 1.65 million square miles set last September .
With about three weeks left in the Arctic summer , this year could wind up breaking that record , according to scientists .
Arctic ice always melts in summer and refreezes in winter .

But over the years , more of the ice is lost to the sea with less recovered in winter .
While ice reflects the sun ’s heat , the open ocean absorbs more heat and the melting accelerates warming in other parts of the world .
“ We could very well be in that quick slide downward in terms of passing a tipping point , ” said senior scientist Mark Serreze at the data center in Boulder , Colo .
“ It ’s tipping now .
We ’re seeing it happen now . ”
NASA ice scientist Jay Zwally added that within “ five to less than 10 years , ” the Arctic could be free of sea ice in the summer .

“ It also means that climate warming is also coming larger and faster than the models are predicting , and nobody ’s really taken into account that change yet , ” he said .
The most recent ice retreat primarily reflects melt in the Chukchi Sea off Alaska ’s northwest coast and the East Siberian Sea off the coast of eastern Russia , according to the center .
The melt in sea ice has kicked in a long - predicted effect called “ Arctic amplification , ” Serreze said .
That ’s when the warming up north is increased in a feedback mechanism and the effects spill southward starting in autumn , he said .

Over the last few years , the bigger melt has meant more warm water that releases more heat into the air during fall cooling , making the atmosphere warmer than normal .
SAN FRANCISCO  Google has begun scanning microfilm from some newspapers ’ historic archives to make them searchable online , first through Google News and eventually on the papers ’ own Web sites , the company said Monday .
The new program expands a two - year - old service that allows Google News users to search the archives of some major newspapers and magazines , including The New York Times , The Washington Post and Time , that were already available in digital form .
Readers will be able to search the archives using keywords and view articles as they appeared originally in the print pages of newspapers .
Under the expanded program , Google will shoulder the cost of digitizing newspaper archives , much as the company does with its book - scanning project .
Google angered some book publishers because it had failed to seek permission to scan books that were protected by copyrights .
It will obtain permission from newspaper publishers before scanning their archives .
Google , based in Mountain View , Calif. , will place advertisements alongside search results , and share the revenue from those ads with newspaper publishers .
A CNN report on Wall Street 's freefall , in which a top trader says " How big 's the graveyard ?
We do n't know . "
Between one and two trillion dollars - that 's what Kenneth Rogoff , professor of economics at Harvard University and former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund , thinks the financial crisis will cost American taxpayers .
He writes in the Financial Times :
Were the financial crisis to end today , the costs would be painful but manageable , roughly equivalent to the cost of another year in Iraq .
Unfortunately , however , the financial crisis is far from over , and it is hard to imagine how the US government is going to succeed in creating a firewall against further contagion without spending five to 10 times more than it has already , that is , an amount closer to $ 1,000bn to $ 2,000bn .
That 's a massive increase , and it 's going to effect everyone somehow .
A large expansion in debt will impose enormous fiscal costs on the US , ultimately hitting growth through a combination of higher taxes and lower spending .
It will certainly make it harder for the US to maintain its military dominance , which has been one of the linchpins of the dollar .
The shrinking financial system will also undermine another central foundation of the strength of the US economy .
And it is hard to see how the central bank will be able to resist a period of allowing elevated levels of inflation , as this offers a convenient way for the US to deflate the mounting cost of its private and public debts .
" Rising interest rates and a rapidly devaluing dollar " are going to hit all of us , in loan repayments and in rising costs for imports - meaning a far more expensive weekly grocery bill as well .
And all of this means John McCain 's budget - with tax cuts and rising military spending - is absolutely unsustainable while even Obama 's figures must be revised .
As much as it pains me to say it - because the taste of corporate socialism as a reward for corporate robbery is so bitter - I believe that the US and other governments must do what they must to save us all from the excesses of “ laissez fair ” financial markets that were self - rigged in favor of a few insiders out to asset - strip and make hay while the sun shone .
The alternative is too horrid to contemplate .
Take AIG - it is inextricably bound through investments with Lloyd's of London and other international big fish .
It the Lloyd 's / AIG pairing were to have collapsed , the international finance system would have also collapsed , beyond repair - not so much from actual losses as from perception of irremediable weakness .
I do n't think it would be hyperbolic to say we'd have been looking at a financial wasteland with costs ultimately born be each of us far in excess of $ 2 trillion .
Over at Economists for Obama , though , they 're looking for a thin silver lining even while being dpressed about prospects for one :
it means the next president will face highly constrained choices .
At the same time , I 've been wondering if the crisis sets the stage for Obama to be a transformative president in the mold of FDR .
If the crisis gets to the point that many people feel it in their everyday lives -- and I think it will -- there will be demands for government to restore trust in the system and strengthen the frayed social safety net , e.g. through universal health care and modernized regulation like that Obama has called for repeatedly , most recently in yesterday 's speech .
My worry is that Obama will step into the White House facing loud calls for the government to take a greater role but will find the crisis has left the nation 's finances in tatters and without the resources to respond to those demands .

True or false :
___ I would be happier if I made more money , found the perfect mate , lost 10 pounds or moved to a new house .
___ Happiness is genetic .
You ca n’t change how happy you are any more than you can change how tall you are .
___ Success brings happiness .
Answers : False , false and false .
IF RECENT scientific research on happiness  and there has been quite a bit  has proved anything , it ’s that happiness is not a goal .
It ’s a process .
Although our tendency to be happy or not is partly inborn , it ’s also partly within our control .
And , perhaps more surprising , happiness brings success , not the other way around .
Though many people think happiness is elusive , scientists have actually pinned it down and know how to get it .
For years , many in the field of psychology saw the science of happiness as an oxymoron .
“ We got no respect , ” says Ed Diener , a professor of psychology at the University of Illinois , who began studying happiness in 1981 .
“ Critics said you could n’t study happiness because you could n’t measure it . ”
In the mid-1990s , he and a few other researchers started to prove the naysayers wrong .
As a result , Americans now have an abundance of consumer books , academic articles , journals and associations to help them find happiness .
“ Many of us have material things and our basic needs met , so we are looking for what comes after that , ” says Diener , co-author with his son , Robert Biswas - Diener , of the forthcoming “ Happiness : Unlocking the Mysteries of Psychological Wealth . ”
“ Materialism is n’t bad .
It ’s only bad if we use it to replace other things in life like meaningful work , a good marriage , kids and friends .
People are recognizing that those who make money more important than love have lower levels of life satisfaction . ”
In recent months , the following titles have hit bookstore shelves : “ What Happy Women Know , ” “ The Happiness Trap , ” “ The How of Happiness : A Scientific Approach to Getting the Life You Want ” and “ Happiness for Two . ”
Christine Cardone , executive editor of psychology books for Wiley - Blackwell , whose titles include Diener ’s forthcoming book , points to 2000 as the tipping point : Happiness science began to mushroom and flood society with new , positive ways of thinking .
That year , Martin Seligman , then - president of the American Psychological Assn. , started the positive psychology movement , which focuses on what makes people mentally healthy .
That concept got out to the media , spawning more interest and research .
Meanwhile , neuroscientists were discovering better ways to measure what ’s going on in the brain .
“ Popular interest in happiness is only one driver , ” says Seligman , a psychology professor at the University of Pennsylvania and director of the Positive Psychology Center there .
“ The books are coming out because the science is coming out . ”
Academic publications have enjoyed a similar boon .
Between 1980 and 1985 , only 2,125 articles were published on happiness , compared with 10,553 on depression .
From 2000 to 2005 , the number of articles on happiness increased sixteenfold to 35,069 , while articles on depression numbered 80,161 .
From 2006 to present , just over 2 1/ 2 years , a search found 27,335 articles on happiness , more than half the 53,092 found on depression .
The field of happiness also now has its own publications  the Journal of Positive Psychology and the Journal of Happiness Studies  and its own professional organization , which Diener started last year .
The International Positive Psychology Assn. for academics and scholars already has 3,500 members .
The trend shows no signs of slowing .
Sonja Lyubomirsky , a professor of psychology at UC Riverside and author of “ The How of Happiness : A Scientific Approach to Getting the Life You Want , ” believes that ’s because happiness is like the Holy Grail .
“ People around the world want it .
If you ask people what they want for their children , they ’ll say for them to be happy .
It ’s in our Declaration of Independence .
It matters to and affects everyone . ”
Among the major findings of the last decade is that the pursuit of happiness is a worthy cause , Diener says .
“ Happiness does n’t just feel good .
It ’s good for you and for society .
Happy people are more successful , have better relationships , are healthier and live longer . ”
Seligman adds , “ We ’ve learned in 10 years that happy people are more productive at work , learn more in school , get promoted more , are more creative and are liked more . ”
And if that does n’t make you happy , here ’s more happy news :
Around the world , happiness is on the rise .
Beyond your genes
Great if you happen to be one of the people born happy , right ?
Not exactly .
Another major finding is that about half of our tendency toward happiness is genetic , while the rest is controlled by the individual .
Lyubomirsky and her colleagues analyzed studies on identical twins and other research and came to the conclusion that happiness is 50 % genetic , 40 % intentional and 10 % circumstantial .
“ Half of your predisposition toward happiness you ca n’t change , ” she says .
“ It ’s in your genes .
Your circumstances  where you live , your health , your work , your marriage  can be tough to change .
But most people are surprised that circumstances do n’t account for as much of their happiness as they think . ”
Life circumstances do n’t result in sustained happiness , she said , because we adapt .
That new car , promotion or house feels great at first .
Then we get used to it .
An old but often - cited study found lottery winners were no happier than control groups after a year .
That does n’t mean that getting out of a bad job or a terrible marriage wo n’t give your happiness a boost .
But sustaining that good feeling requires something else : deliberate control of how you act and think .
That ’s the 40 % intentional part that Lyubomirsky and others are most interested in .
In her research , Lyubomirsky led controlled studies to determine what behaviors positively affect happiness , and has come up with at least 12 strategies that measurably increase levels .
For instance , one strategy she ’s tested is the practice of gratitude .
In her gratitude study , she had a group of 57 subjects express gratitude once a week in a journal .
A second group of 58 expressed gratitude in a journal three times a week .
And a control group of 32 did nothing .
At the end of six weeks , she retested all three groups and found a significant increase in happiness in the first one .
( The participants who journaled three times a week showed less change , perhaps because the exercise did n’t feel as fresh , she theorized . )
She and other researchers also recommend practicing forgiveness , savoring positive moments and becoming more involved in your church , synagogue or religious organization .
“ Not every strategy fits everyone , ” she says .
“ People need to try a few to find which ones work . ”
Happiness defined
Although Lyubomirsky likes to let people define happiness for themselves , clinically , she describes it as “ a combination of frequent positive emotions , plus the sense that your life is good . ”
Seligman , who has written several books on the subject , including the bestselling “ Authentic Happiness , ” says it ’s the pursuit of engaging and meaningful activities .
By engaging , he means being in a state of flow or “ at one with the music . ”
You get so absorbed in what you ’re doing that you lose track of time .
But one person ’s flow is another person ’s torture .
What puts you in a state of flow is usually an activity that uses your strengths and talents .
It ’s even better when it ’s part of your work .
“ Meaningful ” would be using what you ’re best at to serve others or to participate in a cause that ’s bigger than yourself .
( To find out what you ’re good at , or your strengths , Seligman offers a free survey on his website , www.authentichappiness.org.)
“ Your purpose does n’t have to be giant , ” says Dan Baker , a psychologist who founded the life enhancement program at Canyon Ranch in Tucson and is the author of “ What Happy Women Know . ”
“ If you ’re 17 , your purpose can be getting into the college of your choice .
When you ’re a parent , it can be getting your kids off to school safely and prepared for each day .
You do n’t have to adopt a Romanian orphan or build a church in Chile . ”
What happiness is n’t , Diener adds , is getting everything right in your life .
“ A man might think , ‘ If I get the right education , the right job and the right wife , I ’ll be happy . ’
But that ’s not how it works .
For instance , once basic needs are met , the effects of income on happiness get smaller and smaller .
That ’s because happiness lies in the way you live and look at the world .
“ If you have no goal other than your personal happiness , you ’ll never achieve it .
If you want to be happy , pursue something else vigorously and happiness will catch up with you . ”
External factors
Although happiness is largely up to the individual , new research shows that what ’s going on around you  specifically how much personal freedom you have  also plays a role .
In a paper published in the July issue of Perspectives on Psychological Science , lead researcher Ronald Inglehart , a professor of political science at the University of Michigan , refuted the long - held belief that happiness among societies is constant .
His research concluded that significant and enduring changes in happiness can occur not only for individuals , but also for entire societies .
The study , which Seligman calls the best he ’s seen on happiness in five years , analyzed polls taken from 1981 to 2007 by the World Values Survey .
The surveys consisted of 88 countries containing 90 % of the world ’s population , and measured happiness and overall life satisfaction .
Among the 52 countries that completed all the surveys over the 17 - year period , happiness rose in 45 of them , or 86 % .
In six countries , it declined , and in one ( Australia ) , levels showed no change .
Overall , happiness increased 6.8 percentage points .
Inglehart credits economic development , democratization and increasing social tolerance for the happiness bump .
Economic gains that bring more food , clothing , shelter , medical care and longer life can result in a substantial increase in subjective well - being for poor societies , he says .
But once a society reaches a certain threshold , further economic growth brings only minimal gains .
Among the richest societies , increases in income are only weakly linked with higher levels of subjective well - being .
While economic growth helps promote happiness for some , democratization and rising social tolerance contribute even more .
Democracy provides more choice , which promotes happiness .
Support for gender equality and tolerance of people who are different from oneself are also strongly linked , not just because tolerant people are happier , but because living in a tolerant society enhances everyone ’s freedom , Inglehart says .
The fact that happiness and our understanding of it are on the rise bode well .
“ In the future , more people will understand the nature of happiness and its process , ” Baker says .
“ They will understand that they have to take an active role if they want it . ”
Apparently , more people around the world are getting that message .
“ It ’s true , ” Seligman says .
“ We ’re happier .
And more happiness in the world is a great thing . ”

The MySQL community — who create , maintain and support the leading free database — are raising funds for Andrii Nikitin , a MySQL support engineer in Ukraine whose little boy , Ivan , needs a $ 400,000 bone - barrow transplant .
" My family got bad news – doctors said allogenic bone marrow transplantation is the only chance for my son Ivan .
" 8 months of heavy and expensive immune suppression brought some positive results so we hoped that recovering is just question of time .
" Ivan is very brave boy – not every human meets so much suffering during whole life , like Ivan already met in his 2,5 years .
But long road is still in front of us to get full recover – we are ready to come it through .
" Ukrainian clinics have no technical possibility to do such complex operation , so we need 150 - 250K EUR for Israel or European or US clinic .
The final decision will be made considering amount we able to find .
Perhaps my family is able to get ~ 60 % of that by selling the flat where parents leave and some other goods , but we still require external help . "

DENVER — General Wesley Clark , whom the left feared was dissed by Barack Obama into not attending the convention , is right here , underneath the stage , in a crisp suit .
I ’m looking at him right now .
Get ready for something special .
BY THE NUMBERS BY THE NUMBERS Colorectal cancer is the second - leading cause of cancer death .
There will be an estimated 153,000 cases this year , resulting in 52,000 deaths .
The disease is most curable in its early stages .
5 - year survival rates by stage
• Stage 1 ( limited to colon ) : 93 %
• Stage 2 ( spread through wall of colon ) : 72 % to 85 %
• Stage 3 ( spread to lymph nodes ) : 44 % to 83 %
• Stage 4 ( spread to other organs ) : 8 % Source : The American Cancer Society YOU CLICKED : WEEK'S MOST POPULAR HEALTH STORIES YOU CLICKED : WEEK'S MOST POPULAR HEALTH STORIES 1 : Feds rate U.S. nursing homes 2 : Doctors detail first U.S. face transplant 3 : Surgeon finds foot in newborn 's brain tumor 4 : Nursing homes talk new ratings 5 : Colonoscopy prep pills carry kidney risk 6 : Duggars welcome 18th child No. 7 - 10 : Diabetes drug risks , placebo effect WASHINGTON ( AP ) 
Nearly two - thirds of hospitals fail to check colon cancer patients well enough for signs that their tumor is spreading , says a study that advises patients to ask about this mark of quality care before surgery .
National guidelines say when colon cancer is removed , doctors should check at least 12 lymph nodes for signs of spread .
Checking fewer than 12 is n't considered enough to be sure the cancer is contained .
BETTER LIFE : More cancer news
But a study of nearly 1,300 hospitals found that overall , just 38 % fully comply with the guideline , Northwestern University researchers report Tuesday in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute .
" It 's a fairly simple thing we can do to try to improve care for our patients , " said lead author Dr. Kyle Bilimoria , of Northwestern and the American College of Surgeons .
Colorectal cancer is the nation 's second leading cancer killer , set to claim almost 50,000 lives this year .
Some 148,000 Americans are diagnosed annually .
For many , the node check can be crucial .
Whether cancer has entered these doorways to the rest of the body is an important factor in long - term survival — and thus helps doctors decide who gets chemotherapy after surgery and who can skip it .
" Patients who could benefit from additional chemotherapy may not be getting complete treatment and have a higher chance of relapse , " said Dr. Durado Brooks of the American Cancer Society , who was n't involved with the study .
" It is something that consumers need to begin asking .
...
Frankly , that is most likely to change medical practice . "
To check enough nodes , surgeons must remove enough of the fat tissue by the colon where they hide , and pathologists must painstakingly dissect that tissue to find the tiny nodes .
Surgeons frequently tell of getting a pathology report of four clean nodes and asking the pathologist to find more , " and lo and behold , one of those additional nodes turns out to be positive , " Bilimoria said .
Previous studies have estimated that up to half of colon cancer patients have at least 12 nodes checked .
Bilimoria 's study is the first look at which hospitals are most likely to follow the guideline — and will report the rates directly to each institution .
His team examined a national cancer database for records showing which hospitals checked 12 or more lymph nodes in at least 75 % of eligible patients in 2004 and 2005 , the latest data available .
National Cancer Institute - designated " Comprehensive Cancer Centers " did the best job , with 78 % complying .
Just under 34 % of community hospitals , which are far more common and care for many more patients , complied .
Just over half of other academic medical centers and Veterans Administration hospitals met the standard .
Improvement takes work from both surgeons and pathologists , Bilimoria said , noting that Northwestern went from about 50 % compliance a decade ago to full compliance today .
But he expects more 12 - node checks soon , saying the National Quality Forum recently listed the standard as a sign of quality care and that at least one insurance giant has begun requiring proof of 12 - node checks before listing surgeons as preferred providers .
Meanwhile , he advises patients to ask about the 12 - node check in choosing a surgeon and to check their pathology report to be sure it was done .

There is no end in sight to the problems in US banking and finance .
Washington Mutual ( WaMu ) has also been the center of rumors so today is there day for the Feds to locate a buyer .
You know , a “ buyer ” just like the “ buyer ” of AIG .
How soon before taxpayers get stuck nationalizing these bums as well ?
Surely we have billions more laying around to spend on another company who gambled wildly , paid everyone millions and then went kaput .
Heck , let ’s just throw in tens of millions to the exec team , just because .
Just do n’t ask for money if you are an individual or small business because you ’re not really important .
To even ask would be offensive and a violation of our great capitalist system .
Even thinking about it makes you a freeloader .
I ’m going to show you how to create a wordpress theme from scratch in these 3 parts of tutorial series .
I will cover from Structuring , designing in Photoshop , slicing , coding into fully css based html , and finally wordpress implementation .
Table Of Content
Below is the index of the topics that we will go through :
Structuring
This is a very important part in designing a web layout .
We need to structure our layout before open Photoshop .
The first thing is the purpose of the layout .
In our case , this will be a blog layout for WordPress .
So , below is what we have in a blog :
Header Posting area Sidebar Single page Comment Feedback Searching field Page menu RSS Archives , Links and About Page
Something we need to keep in mind .
We ca n’t put all things into one basket .
So , we CANNOT :
Display too many things in one single page .
Use too many colors and font type .
In this sample , I also try to make is as simple as possible because the purpose of this series of tutorial is to give an example on how to create a wordpress theme .
I am going to have a featured post section on the main page .
Below is the Final image that we will create .
Final Result
Photoshop
Step 1
Create a new document with 1024px X 768 px as we are going to create a layout which suit for 1024px resolution .
Fill it the background layer with # eae8 c6 .
Now , CTRL + R to bring out the ruler .
Draw some guide line for the divine proportion we need .
Before this , make sure it is snap .
Go to View > snap ( selected ) .
Step 2
Grab the rectangle tool and draw a header for it .
The height , you have to estimate how much you want .
Balance is the main thing you need to concern .
Then , apply the blending option as shown below .
A black to white gradient with soft light blend mode .
Create another rectangle , apply gradient overlay with setting as shown below .
Put it 1 px below the green bar .
It will make it more details .
Then , draw a 1 pixel line and put it right above the gap between the two bars you created before .
Give it a darker color .
Step 3
I use Myriad Pro .
So , you guys can edit it by yourself later .
Apply drop shadow with the setting shown below .
Then , also apply Gradient Overlay with 12 % opacity , black to white .
For the white outline stroke .
Simply hold the CTRL tab and click on the text layer to get the selection .
Go to Select > Modify > Contract > 1 px .
After that , create a new layer .
Go to Edit > Stroke > 1 px , white , inside .
Step 4
Draw a rectangle , remember , the maximum width you can use is 600 px .
Ok , make its white color .
Apply 1 px inside white stroke .
And , Gradient Overlay with the setting as shown below .
Step 5
The read more button is actually using the same technique where we used for the logo .
This time , we apply Inner Glow with 8 px size and 75 % Opacity in Soft Light Blend Mode .
Gradient Overlay with 70 % opacity also in Soft Light Blend Mode .
Finally , A 1px outside stroke with color # 47670b .
Then , for the 1px inside white stroke .
It is same with what we did in step 3 .
Step 6
Place in some dummy text and photo .
You will have something like this .
You can use a text generator for this .
Step 7
Put in some Dummy Text again .
Try to use none anti-alias font for testing .
Do n’t forget what a wordpress theme needed .
Post title , tags , post date , comments number .
This time , I add in author photo part to be shown in every post .
Step 8
Place a RSS icon .
I forgot where I downloaded it already … sorry about that …
Then ,
For the search area , create a rounded rectangle with a maximum width of 330 px .
Fill it with black color and set it blend mode to soft light .
Create another rounded rectangle inside .
This will be our input field .
Fill it with white color .
Apply 1 px inside stroke with color – # d0 ceae .
Then , apply inner Glow , with setting shown below .
After that , place the searching icon .
Step 9
Draw a rounded rectangle and use the pen tool to draw a dialog box as shown below .
You can refer to my previous tutorial in LoonDesign on how to create a custom shape in photoshop .
Then , apply drop shadow on it .
Use the rectangle tool to create the categories and links content box .
The maximum width will be 160 px .
We need a 10 px space in between them .
Step 10
We are almost there .
Now , we will use the same technique we used to create the header part .
Conclusion
You may found that I do not mention about the page navigation part .
I think it is too simple for you .
Try it out yourself .
If really can ’t , I am also providing the source file for you here .
Overall , there is several things we need to consider when creating a wordpress theme .
In this example , we are creating for blogging purpose .
So , the major section will be , categories , tagging , author photo , comments and also the RSS feed .
I prefer to make things more organizes .
So , you can found that all the layers in my psd file are well renamed and each section is well separated .
This is for future modification purpose and also for my dear reader to modify it easily .
Single Page
As we are creating theme for wordpress , there must be a single page to display a post and comment section .
Here is the final output .

While everyone ( including yours truly ) was busy arguing the political and ethical implications of a pregnant 17 year old , the bloody fucking fascists of the St Paul Police Department arrested Amy Goodman while she was covering today ’s RNC protests .
Yeah , that Amy Goodman :
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYjyvkR0bGQ
Glenn Greenwald reports that Goodman has been charged with “ conspiracy to riot ” :
I just attended a Press Conference with St. Paul Mayor Chris Coleman and Police Chief John M. Harrington and — after they boasted of how “ restrained ” their police actions were — asked about the journalists and lawyers who had been detained and / or arrested both today and over the weekend .
They said they would n’t give any information about journalists who had been arrested today , though they said they believed that “ one journalist ” had been , and that she “ was sima participant in the riots , not simply a non-participant . ”
Lots more RNC protest footage at The Uptake ; news conference footage here ; more on Goodman ’s arrest from Cliff Schecter ( note : FDL is currently down ) .
h/t pale @ ACR and Sylvia ( via Twitter )
Update : lots more links at Sylvia ’s place .
The Uptake ’s RNC protest blog reports that Goodman has been released .
Will update once this has been confirmed .
Update 2 : Via Mike in comemnts , Democracy Now ! press release :
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
www.democracynow.org
September 1 , 2008 Contact :
Dennis Moynihan
Mike Burke ST .
PAUL , MN — Democracy Now ! host Amy Goodman was unlawfully arrested in downtown St. Paul , Minnesota at approximately 5 p.m. local time .
Police violently manhandled Goodman , yanking her arm , as they arrested her .
Video of her arrest can be seen here :
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYjyvkR0bGQ
Goodman was arrested while attempting to free two Democracy Now ! producers who were being unlawfuly detained .
They are Sharif Abdel Kouddous and Nicole Salazar .
Kouddous and Salazar were arrested while they carried out their journalistic duties in covering street demonstrations at the Republican National Convention .
Goodman ’s crime appears to have been defending her colleagues and the freedom of the press .
Ramsey County Sherrif Bob Fletcher told Democracy Now ! that Kouddous and Salazar were being arrested on suspicion of rioting .
They are currently being held at the Ramsey County jail in St. Paul .
Democracy Now ! is calling on all journalists and concerned citizens to call the office of Mayor Chris Coleman and the Ramsey County Jail and demand the immediate release of Goodman , Kouddous and Salazar .
These calls can be directed to : Chris Rider from Mayor Coleman ’s office at 651-266-8535 and the Ramsey County Jail at 651-266-9350 ( press extension 0 ) .
Democracy Now ! stands by Goodman , Kouddous and Salazar and condemns this action by Twin Cities law enforcement as a clear violation of the freedom of the press and the First Amenmdent rights of these journalists .
During the demonstration in which they were arrested law enforcement officers used pepper spray , rubber bullets , concussion grenades and excessive force .
Several dozen others were also arrested during this action .
Amy Goodman is one of the most well - known and well - respected journalists in the United States .
She has received journalism ’s top honors for her reporting and has a distinguished reputation of bravery and courage .
The arrest of Goodman , Kouddous and Salazar is a transparent attempt to intimidate journalists from the nation ’s leading independent news outlet .
Democracy Now ! is a nationally - syndicated public TV and radio program that airs on over 700 radio and TV stations across the US and the globe .
Update 3 : Democracy Now !
producer Mike Burke just confirmed via email that Goodman has been released , but still faces charges ; Kouddous and Salazar both remain in custody , so please call the office of Mayor Chris Coleman and the Ramsey County Jail and demand the immediate release of Kouddous and Salazar .
As previously mentioned , calls can be directed to : Chris Rider from Mayor Coleman ’s office at 651-266-8535 and the Ramsey County Jail at 651-266-9350 ( press extension 0 ) .
Update 4 Greenwald updates and links to a SF Chronicle interview with Goodman immediately following her release , in which Goodman says she was charged with a misdemeanor , and confirms that both Kouddous and Salazar have been released and face felony charges .
Greenwald also notes that an AP photographer was arrested , and DNC superdelegate and CNN commentator Donna Brazile was pepper sprayed on the way to the Xcel Center .
MyFox Twin Cities reports that as of 9:40 PM CDT , “ 283 people [ have been arrested ] for riot .
129 have been arrested for felonies , 51 for gross misdemeanors and 103 for misdemeanors ” .
( Apparently ‘ anarchist ’ is the new ‘ terrorist ’ as far as the St Paul PD ’s public affairs office is concerned . )

PAUL–Democracy Now ! host Amy Goodman and producers Sharif Abdel Kouddous and Nicole Salazar have all been released from police custody in St. Paul following their illegal arrest by Minneapolis Police on Monday afternoon .
All three were violently manhandled by law enforcement officers .
Abdel Kouddous was slammed against a wall and the ground , leaving his arms scraped and bloodied .
He sustained other injuries to his chest and back .
Salazar ’s violent arrest by baton - wielding officers , during which she was slammed to the ground while yelling , “ I ’m Press ! Press ! , ” resulted in her nose bleeding , as well as causing facial pain .
Goodman ’s arm was violently yanked by police as she was arrested .
On Tuesday , Democracy Now ! will broadcast video of these arrests , as well as the broader police action .
These will also be available on : www.democracynow.org
Goodman was arrested while questioning police about the unlawful detention of Kouddous and Salazar who were arrested while they carried out their journalistic duties in covering street demonstrations at the Republican National Convention .
Goodman ’s crime appears to have been defending her colleagues and the freedom of the press .
Ramsey County Sheriff Bob Fletcher told Democracy Now ! that Kouddous and Salazar were arrested on suspicion of rioting , a felony .
While the three have been released , they all still face charges stemming from their unlawful arrest .
Kouddous and Salazar face pending charges of suspicion of felony riot , while Goodman has been officially charged with obstruction of a legal process and interference with a “ peace officer . ”
Democracy Now !
forcefully rejects all of these charges as false and an attempt at intimidation of these journalists .
We demand that the charges be immediately and completely dropped .
Democracy Now ! stands by Goodman , Kouddous and Salazar and condemns this action by Twin Cities ’ law enforcement as a clear violation of the freedom of the press and the First Amendment rights of these journalists .
During the demonstration in which the Democracy Now ! team was arrested , law enforcement officers used pepper spray , rubber bullets , concussion grenades and excessive force against protesters and journalists .
Several dozen demonstrators were also arrested during this action , including a photographer for the Associated Press .
Amy Goodman is one of the most well - known and well - respected journalists in the United States .
She has received journalism ’s top honors for her reporting and has a distinguished reputation of bravery and courage .
The arrest of Goodman , Kouddous and Salazar and the subsequent criminal charges and threat of charges are a transparent attempt to intimidate journalists .
Democracy Now ! is a nationally - syndicated public TV and radio program that airs on over 700 radio and TV stations across the US and the globe .
As Juan Cole says , “ Democracy Now ! is among the few news programs that tries to deliver real news to the American public , not the babysitting pap that passes for such so often in the corporate media . ”
We at CFLF echo Democracy Now ! ’s rejection of illegal police intimidation and suppression of the press and call for all charges against Goodman , Salazar , and Kouddous to be dropped forthwith .
The final stage of the carbon capture and storage ( CCS ) chain involves storing the CO2 deep underground in locations where it will remain locked away for thousands of years .
In order to transport carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) most efficiently , it needs to be liquefied .
This is achieved by pressurising the gas .
" If you increase the pressure to about 70 atmospheres , the CO2 becomes a dense liquid - about the same density as crude oil , " explained Stuart Haszeldine from the University of Edinburgh 's School of GeoSciences .
" This means that you can transport much more carbon dioxide in a small space . "
In this state , the gas is then ready to be moved , either by tanker or pipeline , to the location where it will be buried deep underground .
Some people are trying to solve all storage problems all at once before taking the first step of the journey
Professor Stuart Haszeldine ,
University of Edinburgh A storage site 800 m or more underground will ensure that the pressure will be great enough to keep the CO2 in its liquid state .
When the CO2 is pumped into the subterranean storage site , it spreads out into the surrounding porous rock ( eg limestone ) .
" Although they may appear solid , most of these rocks are sedimentary and made of sand or carbonate pieces , " explained Professor Haszeldine .
" About a third of the rock is space made up of microscopic pores , and this is where the CO2 seeps into . "
Because the CO2 is buoyant , the storage area needs to have a geological " cap " to prevent the molecules escaping .
This means the location requires an impermeable layer , such as mud or clay , above the area where the CO2 is being pumped .
There are three main geological options that are being assessed for their suitability : • Oil and gas fields : Considered to be " secure vessels " because the sites have safely stored oil or gas for millions of years .
A natural porous reservoir with an impermeable seal above it .
• Saline aquifers :
The injected CO2 physically pushes the salt water out of the way before dissolving into the water over time , forming fizzy salty water .
•
Unmineable coal seams :
Works in a slightly different way to the previous two options .
The liquid CO2 chemically " sticks " on to the small fractures and pores in the coal .
This option is a less attractive option at the moment , because it is still at an experimental stage .
Current estimates show that we could store up to 40 years of global CO2 emissions in the world 's known oil and gas fields .
Saline aquifers are 100 times bigger than oil and gas fields , which could mean that there is potential to lock away carbon dioxide for at least several centuries .
One problem is that while some nations are well - endowed with oil fields or saline aquifers , such as the UK , others have few .
India and Japan , for example , have very little in the way or oil or gas fields .
This means that they will have difficulty finding sites in which they can lock away their liquid CO2 .
" These nations may have to export their CO2 to other storage sites around the world , " Professor Haszeldine suggested .
He added that another hurdle to overcome was the use of saline aquifers to store CO2 on a large industrial scale .
This still needed further investigation , he said .
" There are possibilities that the increased pressure to push in the CO2 could cause complex interferences between different boreholes used to inject the CO2 .
" It is possible to overcome this , but this has not been physically demonstrated yet . "
Lessons to come Professor Haszeldine highlighted another potential problem : " When you are storing CO2 under a landmass with a large human population , we will have to be extra vigilant .
" We need to make sure that when the CO2 is pushed in , we know where the salty water that is pushed out of the way ends up .
" If the salty water is pushed upwards within the layering within the sedimentary basin , it could enter freshwater aquifers used for agriculture or drinking water .
" Although it is not very likely , it does mean that there is an extra factor that needs to be demonstrated . "
However , he said that this should not be used as a reason not to push ahead with carbon capture and storage technologies .
" Some people are trying to solve all storage problems all at once before taking the first step of the journey .
" We do n't need to answer all of those questions right now ; we can get on and use the best sites now and progressively learn more as we go along . "

The Mystery of Mass Extinctions Is No Longer Murky
Ebb and flow of the sea is the primary cause of the world 's mass extinctions over the past 500 million years
Fossils of crinoids , commonly known as " sea lilies , " from Ontario , Canada .
June 17 , 2008
View a video interview with geoscientist Shanan Peters .
This material is available primarily for archival purposes .
Telephone numbers or other contact information may be out of date ; please see current contact information at media contacts .
If you are curious about Earth 's periodic mass extinction events such as the sudden demise of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago , you might consider crashing asteroids and sky - darkening super volcanoes as culprits .
But a new study , published online June 15 , 2008 , in the journal Nature , suggests that it is the ocean , and in particular the epic ebbs and flows of sea level and sediment over the course of geologic time , that is the primary cause of the world 's periodic mass extinctions over the past 500 million years .
" The expansions and contractions of those environments have pretty profound effects on life on Earth , " says Shanan Peters , a University of Wisconsin - Madison assistant professor of geology and geophysics and the author of the new Nature report .
In short , according to Peters , changes in ocean environments related to sea level exert a driving influence on rates of extinction , which animals and plants survive or vanish , and generally determine the composition of life in the oceans .
Since the advent of life on Earth 3.5 billion years ago , scientists think there may have been as many as 23 mass extinction events , many involving simple forms of life such as single - celled microorganisms .
Over the past 540 million years , there have been five well - documented mass extinctions , primarily of marine plants and animals , with as many as 75 - 95 percent of species lost .
For the most part , scientists have been unable to pin down the causes of such dramatic events .
In the case of the demise of the dinosaurs , scientists have a smoking gun , an impact crater that suggests dinosaurs were wiped out as the result of a large asteroid crashing into the planet .
But the causes of other mass extinction events have been murky , at best .
" No matter what the ultimate driving extinction mechanisms might be at any one time , Professor Peters brings the repeated and resultant extinction on oceanic shelves front and forward where it belongs , " says National Science Foundation ( NSF ) Program Manager Rich Lane .
" This breakthrough speaks loudly to the future impending modern shelf extinction due to climate change on Earth . "
Paleontologists have been chipping away at the causes of mass extinctions for almost 60 years , according to Peters , whose work was supported by NSF .
" Impacts , for the most part , are n't associated with most extinctions .
There have also been studies of volcanism , and some eruptions correspond to extinction , but many do not . "
Arnold I. Miller , a paleobiologist and professor of geology at the University of Cincinnati , says the new study is striking because it establishes a clear relationship between the tempo of mass extinction events and changes in sea level and sediment : " Over the years , researchers have become fairly dismissive of the idea that marine mass extinctions like the great extinction of the Late Permian might be linked to sea - level declines , even though these declines are known to have occurred many times throughout the history of life .
The clear relationship this study documents will motivate many to rethink their previous views . "
Peters measured two principal types of marine shelf environments preserved in the rock record , one where sediments are derived from erosion of land and the other composed primarily of calcium carbonate , which is produced in - place by shelled organisms and by chemical processes .
" The physical differences between these two types of marine environments have important biological consequences , " Peters explains noting differences in sediment stability , temperature and the availability of nutrients and sunlight .
In the course of hundreds of millions of years the world 's oceans have expanded and contracted in response to the shifting of the Earth 's tectonic plates and to changes in climate .
There were periods of the planet 's history when vast areas of the continents were flooded by shallow seas such as the shark and mosasaur infested seaway that neatly split North America during the age of the dinosaurs .
As those epicontinental seas drained , animals like mosasaurs and giant sharks went extinct , and conditions on the marine shelves where life exhibited its greatest diversity in the form of things like clams and snails changed as well .
The new Wisconsin study , Peters says , does not preclude other influences on extinction such as physical events like volcanic eruptions or killer asteroids , or biological influences such as disease and competition among species .
But what it does do , he argues , is provide a common link to mass extinction events over a significant stretch of Earth history .
" The major mass extinctions tend to be treated in isolation by scientists , " Peters says .
" This work links them and smaller events in terms of a forcing mechanism , and it also tells us something about who survives and who does n't across these boundaries .
These results argue for a substantial fraction of change in extinction rates being controlled by just one environmental parameter . "

Perhaps I ’m mistaken , but it seems that some Canadians like to use vivid examples from nature to help illustrate their political talking points .
Several days ago , the Conservative Party ’s website featured an attack ad that utilized a bird pooping on Stephane Dion , the leader of Canada ’s Liberal Party , to enhance the negative message ’s effect .
Steven Harper , Canada ’s Prime Minister , apologized today for the ad which he called “ totally inappropriate . ”
The bird , which is an animation of a puffin , pooped while a voiceover said that Dion is “ not a leader and not worth the risk . ”
The offensive material has now been edited out of a newer version of the commercial .
You can see the revised version where the bird simply flies through by clicking here .
The puffin was actually a subtle reference to another Liberal Party leader ,
Harper dissolved Canada ’s Parliament on Sunday , forcing elections to come sooner than scheduled , within about a month ’s time .
The Conservative Party hopes to strengthen its power in the Canadian government , and its unclear if a negative attack ad like this one will help .
While most people say that they do n’t like these kinds of ads , conventional wisdom suggests that they are effective .

S. 900 ( 106th ) was a bill in the United States Congress .
A bill must be passed by both the House and Senate in identical form and then be signed by the President to become law .
Bills numbers restart every two years .
That means there are other bills with the number S. 900 .
This is the one from the 106th Congress .
This bill was introduced in the 106th Congress , which met from Jan 6 , 1999 to Dec 15 , 2000 .
Legislation not enacted by the end of a Congress is cleared from the books .

Hardcore RP delegates to the Republican national convention hope to convince enough McCain delegates to abstain on the first ballot to deny the fascist neocon the nomination , with the hope of eventually nominating Ron .
They rightly point out that , as St. Thomas Aquinas said , an unjust law is no law at all , so anyone with a conscience is not required to vote for McCain , no matter what their state government says ; indeed , just the opposite .
Of course , the hardcores have absolutely no chance , since anyone the party chooses to be a McCain delegate is evil .
Still , the RP guys and gals have worked their hearts out for many months , and spent lots of money they ca n’t afford .
Even though they are doomed to defeat , who can tell them not to do what they believe to be right ?
Here is my only advice : the St. Paul convention , like the Denver one , is a key State - legitimizing event , with much of the power elite in attendance .
They are funded by the taxpayers , and by the military - industrial - petro complex , in arrogant display .
Since 9/11 especially , the conventions are totalitarian regimes in miniature ( and examples of what they ’d like the whole of America to look like ) .
Their jackbooted thugs will not hesitate to gas you , taser you , beat you into a bloody pulp , and then put you into one of their animal cages for years .
Do not do anything that gives them even the slighest excuse .

It may not be on your PC , but chances are Linux is somewhere in your home
A few years ago , it looked like Linux might – just might – take over the world .
Companies like Lindows / Linspire were going to make it easy enough for your mother to use .
Bright coloured boxes of SUSE and Red Hat and plenty of others were piled high in every computer store .
The letters MS rarely went without an ironic ' $ ' , and oh , how we laughed .
It was going to be a whole new era .
Except it did n't really happen , did it ?
The promise of Linux becoming a dominant player on the desktop was always just over the horizon , and over the years , the visible excitement waned .
What went wrong ?
The most important thing is that desktop Linux was only ever ' easy ' for two sets of people – hardcore types , and people with a very specific set of tools that could be installed and made bulletproof through security .
If all you want from your PC is the ability to edit documents , send emails , and browse the web , Linux is indeed easy to use .
The trouble comes when you advance to the part where you want to install a new printer , or play a new game , or the screen fills up with babble .
Tools like Linspire 's Click and Run Warehouse went some distance to fixing this , but could only go so far without the support of hardware manufacturers and software developers .
It 's the chicken and egg problem .
Without a big market , companies are reluctant to spend money supporting it ; without support , the market can't grow .
Making it tougher was the fact that few people had a reason to move .
Far from the centre of the world , to most , Windows is just that thing that came with the PC and lets their real programs run .
A solid reason was required to get people to switch , and none really presented themselves .
Do n't get us wrong – many of the reasons provided are valid .
You 'll find a list of most of the most common ones at makethemove .
net / why.php .
However , there 's a massive gulf from technical improvements to compelling benefits for the average PC user who 's never even going to run into that kind of page , never mind pull the trigger on a distro .
Viruses and spyware are covered by tools like Norton and McAfee to the level that most people care about : feeling protected .
Free software ?
Most of the best stuff , like OpenOffice.org and Firefox , is available on Windows .
The OS X coffin nail
Another nail in the coffin came in the form of OS X , which fulfilled most of the criteria that the average user actually cared about , and did so with style on its side .
It 's easy to use .
The technobabble is hidden behind the scenes .
Its apps are slick and well integrated .
The hardware support quickly became relatively ubiquitous .
Where Linux was offering a technological advantage , Apple was in place to offer a whole new lifestyle to people wanting to step away from the Windows hegemony .
Linux could offer many of the same features – indeed , OS X is based on a UNIX core – but the stigma of being the geeky OS never left it .
Even if the user never had to compile anything or go to the terminal , they'd be hit in the face with that side of maintaining their system every time they went hunting for advice .
Online comedy group Three Dead Trolls
In A Baggie summed up the general sentiment in a verse of its snappily named 2001 song Every OS Sucks
" It 's free , they say , if you can get it to run
The geeks say ' Hey , that 's half the fun ! '
Yeah , well I got a girlfriend and things to get done .
The Linux OS sucks ! "
Invisible Linux
The irony of all this negativity is that Linux has never been closer to the victory its supporters have dreamed of all these years .
It 's simply coming from the other direction – encircling the enemy instead of stampeding towards its stronghold .
Just because most of us do n't see Linux on our screens when we boot up does n't mean that we do n't use it every day .
Linux based netbooks like the Asus Eee are not only affordable , but beat their Windows equivalents in terms of price and performance any day .
Google Android , the first model of which is due out this month , is based on Linux , too , as are many portable devices , PVRs like TiVo , and the web servers that run so many of our important services .
We 're never likely to see Microsoft bow its head in defeat and step back , but that was always an impossible idea .
Just because we increasingly wo n't be aware of Linux in no way means that it 's given up the fight .
The difference is that this time , it 's in a battle it might eventually win .

China has already launched two manned flights China will launch its third manned space mission in late September , state - run news agency Xinhua reports .
The Shenzhou VII flight will feature China 's first ever space walk , which will be broadcast live with cameras inside and outside the spacecraft .
Three " yuhangyuan " ( astronauts ) will blast off on a Long - March II -F rocket sometime between 25 and 30 September .
Previous reports in state media had put the launch in October , possibly during the National Day holiday .
In 2003 , China became only the third country in the world to send a human into orbit .
It followed with a two - man mission in 2005 .
The spacecraft will be launched from Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre in the country 's north - western Gansu province .
Technically demanding Technicians have been busily checking the readiness of the spacecraft , which will carry the crew into orbit on a mission lasting up to five days .
This flight will be more technically demanding than the last .
China highlighted its space successes during the Beijing Olympics
For the spacewalk , two crew members will go into the spacecraft 's vacuum module .
One yuhangyuan will carry out the spacewalk ; the other is there to monitor the activity and assist in case of an emergency .
Two types of spacesuits - one made in China , the other from Russia - will be carried up on the flight .
It is unclear why China has opted for two different types of spacesuit .
Spaceflight analyst Dr Morris Jones commented that China might want to test the suits against each other .
Alternatively , he said , it might not be ready or willing to fly a mission exclusively with its own suits .
The crew members , whose identities have not been released , have been training in a water tank to get used to weightlessness and to study procedures for the flight .
Bad vibrations
The Shenzhou spacecraft closely resembles the Russian Soyuz capsules , but is substantially larger .
Unlike the Soyuz , it has an orbital module that is equipped with its own propulsion , allowing autonomous flight .
Testing of the spacecraft and the Long - March II - F rocket which will loft it into orbit is now complete , a Chinese space official told Xinhua .
Engineers have reportedly made over 30 technical improvements to the new rocket .
" There were some rocket vibrations after it took off which sometimes made our astronauts experience physical discomfort , " Jin Muchun , the Long - March II - F's chief designer , told the state - owned television channel CCTV9 in July .
" So we have been trying to eliminate the vibrations by changing the frequency of the engine and the electric circuit of the rocket . "
According to reports , a small satellite will also be launched during the mission .
China launched an unmanned Moon probe last year about one month after rival Japan blasted its own lunar orbiter into space .
In July , Dr Michael Griffin , the head of the US space agency ( Nasa ) , told BBC News that China was capable of sending a manned mission to the Moon in the next decade , if it so wished .

What are these ?
The European Union  and Germany , in particular , with its strong ties to Russia  called on both sides to stand down and scheduled meetings to press their concerns .
At the United Nations , members of the Security Council met informally to discuss a possible response , but one Security Council diplomat said it remained uncertain whether much could be done .
“ Strategically , the Russians have been sending signals that they really wanted to flex their muscles , and they ’re upset about Kosovo , ” the diplomat said .
He was alluding to Russia ’s anger at the West for recognizing Kosovo ’s independence from Serbia .
Indeed , the decision by the United States and Europe to recognize Kosovo may well have paved the way for Russia ’s lightning - fast decision to send troops to back the separatists in South Ossetia .
During one meeting on Kosovo in Brussels this year , Mr. Lavrov , the foreign minister , warned Ms. Rice and European diplomats that if they recognized Kosovo , they would be setting a precedent for South Ossetia and other breakaway provinces .
For the Bush administration , the choice now becomes whether backing Georgia  which , more than any other former Soviet republic has allied with the United States  on the South Ossetia issue is worth alienating Russia at a time when getting Russia ’s help to rein in Iran ’s nuclear ambitions is at the top of the United States ’ foreign policy agenda .
One United Nations diplomat joked on Saturday that “ if someone went to the Russians and said , ‘ OK , Kosovo for Iran , ’ we ’d have a deal . ”
That might be hyperbole , but there is a growing feeling among some officials in the Bush administration that perhaps the United States cannot have it all , and may have to choose its priorities , particularly when it comes to Russia .
The Bush administration ’s strong support for Georgia  including the training of Georgia ’s military and arms support  came , in part , as a reward for its support of the United States in Iraq .
The United States has held Georgia up as a beacon of democracy in the former Soviet Union ; it was supposed to be an example to other former Soviet republics of the benefits of tilting to the West .

The Spanish parliament 's environment committee last week approved resolutions for chimpanzees , gorillas and orangutans to gain some statutory rights currently applicable only to humans .
It is thought to be the first time a national legislature has taken such action .
The resolutions , which passed with cross-party support and are expected to be approved as laws by the full parliament within a year , are based on the Great Ape Project , a framework designed by scientists and philosophers who believe that humans ' closest biological relatives deserve the right to life , liberty and protection from torture .
The laws will ban potentially harmful research , ape trading , profiting from apes , and using apes in performances .
Zoos could still legally hold apes , but living conditions must be “ optimal ” .

I think this was a pretty sweet video .
This is n't one of those things that the guy will expect to take to bloody Carnegie ... it 's a youtube video .
God knows , there are enough vids of some sad sap playing his accoustic , singing " piano man " of all fuggin things ( " piano man guitar " video results 1 - 20 of about 788 ) , let 's see more kooky stuff like this !
Me ?
I love guitar hero and rock band .
I 've spent countless hours playing w/ my friends or alone trying to get better .
Also , i've got about 20 years of piano under my belt , and around 10 of guitar .
Yeah , real instruments .
But i'm not gonna disparage those who choose to , you know , just have fun their own way , rather than conform w/ some supposed " ideal " method of performing music .
So , again .
Why the hate ?
Why not just enjoy a neat vid ?
Boxer Degale devours hungry Cuban to taste gold for Britain
James Degale survived a frantic late assault by Cuban Emilio Correa to claim Olympic middleweight gold at the Workers ' Stadium .
The 22 - year - old Londoner had eased into an 11 - 5 lead at the half - way stage but was lured into a street - fight by his experienced foe in the final minutes .
On target : James Degale lands a shot during his gold medal winning bout
Correa had reduced the deficit to just two points heading into a nail - biting final minutes but Degale hung on to score a thrilling 16 - 14 success .
Degale said : " All the boxing greats have won it - Muhammad Ali , Sugar Ray Leonard - and now that 's me .
I have won Olympic gold and made history , and it feels unbelievable .
" It 's hard to say no to a million pounds , but if they come with something sensible I could be a superstar in amateur boxing .
Just imagine winning another gold medal in 2012 in my home city .
Tactics : Degale avoids a right hook and winds up to counter
" To be the face of 2012 would be unbelievable .
I 'm going to have a glass of champagne and enjoy my gold medal then get back in the ring because that 's my life .
In four years ' time , there will never be anyone as good as me . "
Having dazzled his way to the Olympic final , Degale started in similar style and led 6 - 1 after the first round , including a two - point penalty for the Cuban , whom the Londoner later accused at the post - fight press conference , exhibiting the apparent evidence , of biting his chest .
Attack : Degale gets through with a jab
" He bit me , " insisted Degale .
" I was flowing nicely and boxing southpaw and I got into a 4 - 1 lead , then he got me in a little hold and bit my chest .
I could feel those long teeth through his gumshield . "
It was more of the same in the second , after which Degale led 9 - 4 , but as the Cuban , who had the support of the Chinese crowd , became more desperate , he succeeded in luring Degale into an unseemly brawl which often bore more resemblance to a wrestling match .
It was anything but the boring fight Degale had promised in his bid to claim Olympic gold .
The Cuban 's persistent big , crude swings cut his lead to 11 - 8 in a round which also saw the Londoner penalised two points for holding .
It set up a frantic climax with Correa pursuing Degale around the ring and the pair exchanging a series of shots that just about managed to maintain the slim lead for Degale , who sank to his knees in delight at the final bell .
" I felt cool in there but it was for Olympic gold and I wanted it to be over , " added Degale .
" It was disrespectful at the end with the crowd booing .
Those people did n't have a clue and it was n't right .
" In my fights I 've shown bits of what I can do but there 's probably 40 per cent left .
I did it the hard way .
When I saw the draw I thought it would be hard but I got better and better and I believed .
" In my first fights I did n't really get out of first gear , but tonight I just wanted to get it over and done with because of the pressure .
If it had been anything else , I could have relaxed a bit more . "
In control : Degale pegs back the Cuban
Now Degale will challenge the Amateur Boxing Association and UK Sport to involve private sponsorship and come up with the kind of package he needs to resist the lure of professionalism and look towards his dream of London .
" It 's only for the last four months I 've been on £ 1500 per month .
By the time I pay my car and my bills at home , I 'm left with nothing really , " said Degale .
" Now I 'm the gold medallist , they 're going to have to come up with something sensible . "
Victory was particularly sweet for head coach Terry Edwards , who , with David Price and Tony Jeffries also snaring bronze , has presided over a successful Games despite apparent attempts to discredit him back home .
" All the rubbish Terry has been getting at home is not nice , " added Degale .
" He 's like a dad to us and he does n't need that stuff in his life .
He 's produced three medals and we have n't had that in 60 years .
It 's pathetic . "
Edwards will return home next week to fight for his job but insists recent events have made him more determined than ever not to walk away and hopes Degale 's success will secure funding for an even greater medal push in 2012 .
" People around Britain will have been watching that and hopefully now the profile of the sport has been raised , " said Edwards .
" If we can keep that funding in place and secure more sponsorship , I believe in 2012 we can be the new Cuba .
" I do n't know what more they want from me .
One thing 's for certain , if I were to go forward for the next four years I would n't put up with the crap I 've had to put up with for the last four years , that is for sure . "

A hacker claims to have cracked the web site of Fox News commentator Bill O'Reilly and purloined a list of subscribers to the site , which includes their names , e-mail addresses , city and state , and the password they use for their registration to the site .
The attack was retaliation for comments that O'Reilly made on the air this week about web sites that published e-mails obtained from the Yahoo account of Alaska Governor Sarah Palin , according to a press release distributed by WikiLeaks late Friday .
The hacker sent WikiLeaks a screenshot of O'Reilly 's subscriber list as proof of the deed , which WikiLeaks has posted online .
This week on his Fox show , O'Reilly slammed web sites , such as WikiLeaks and Gawker , for posting screenshots of e-mails , family photos and a list of contacts taken from Palin 's private e-mail account .
" They 're trafficking in stolen merchandise , " O'Reilly said during one of his shows , calling for their prosecution .
He also referred to a site that published the screenshots as " despicable , slimy , scummy . "
In the video above , O'Reilly spoke with Amanda Carpenter , a reporter for Townhall.com who agreed with him and said that a web site that published such information was " complicit " in the hack of Palin 's e-mail account .
" They think it 's newsworthy , even though the information was absolutely , illegally obtained , " she said .
Neither O'Reilly nor Carpenter mentioned the First Amendment protection that media organizations , such as Fox News and Townhall.com , are generally afforded for publishing newsworthy information .
That segment was followed the next day by a segment with Fox News anchor , Megyn Kelly , a lawyer , who explained why the First Amendment would protect the sites .
( See video below . )
O'Reilly , disagreed with her , however .
" If your grandma sends you 50 bucks for your birthday and somebody steals the letter and gives it to somebody else and they take the 50 bucks , they 're going to get charged as well as this person who stole the letter , " he said .
Kelly explained that taking stolen money and publishing news were not the same .
" That 's crazy , " he said .
" No it 's not crazy , " Kelly replied .
" Because . . . what if somebody obtained a document illegally that proved some massive conspiracy among the presidential candidates and they leaked it to Fox News and we knew it was stolen .
You do n't think we 'd put it on the air ?
You 're darn right we would .
And it 's not illegal . "
https://www.youtube.com/w
WikiLeaks said in its press release that it had confirmed the authenticity of the list , but did n't mention how it did so .
Efforts by Threat Level to contact Fox News and some of the subscribers on the list to independently verify the authenticity of the list were unsuccessful .

While campaigning in New Mexico this afternoon , Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama continued to pummel John McCain on the economy , and as a new twist , mocked McCain ’s new found love for regulation .
“ When I was warning about the danger ahead on Wall Street months ago because of the lack of oversight , Senator McCain was telling the Wall Street Journal — and I quote — “ I ’m always for less regulation .
Except now , with the magnitude of the crisis apparent even to the Bush White House , John McCain wants to reverse course .
Now , all of a sudden , he ’s unleashed an angry tirade against all the insiders and lobbyists who ’ve supported him for twenty - six years – the same folks who run his campaign , ” Obama said .
The Democrat then launched into McCain ’s latest flip - flop , “ On Monday , he said the economy was fundamentally sound , and he was fundamentally wrong .
On Tuesday , he said the government should stand by and allow one of the nation ’s largest insurers to collapse , putting the well - being of millions of Americans at risk .
But by Wednesday , he changed his mind .
He said he would take on the ol ’ boy network , but he seemed to forget that he took seven of the biggest lobbyists in Washington from that network and put them in charge of your campaign .
John McCain can’t decide whether he ’s Barry Goldwater or Dennis Kucinich . ”

Obama repeated his message that McCain ca n’t run away from his record , “ You ca n’t just run away from your long - held views or your life - long record .
You ca n’t erase twenty - six years of support for the very policies and people who helped bring on this disaster with one week of rants . ”
Major props to Obama for working Dennis Kucinich into a speech , and he is correct in stating that McCain ca n’t hide from 26 year of anti-regulation votes .
One of the staples of his pitch to conservative audiences has been that he has always opposed regulation , but apparently neither his conviction nor his opposition was all that strong .
As soon as the focus of this election shifted to the economy , McCain starting stumbling and Obama regained his lead .
McCain is in real trouble here .
After the Palin buzz and the negative ad campaign have died down , people seem ready to talk about the issues , but we are finding out that John McCain is incapable of having that discussion .
Every move that McCain has made this week has been wrong .
The door is wide open for Obama to capitalize , so let ’s see if he can get the job done .

FBI agents executed a search warrant Sunday at the apartment of University of Tennessee student David Kernell in connection with the hack of Alaska Governor Sarah Palin 's private Yahoo account .
According to a witness , two FBI agents arrived at Kernell 's Knoxville apartment in The Commons student housing complex shortly after midnight on Sunday morning , interrupting a party .
Kernell and some of his friends reportedly fled when agents arrived , though the local TV station that reported the raid is a bit unclear about this detail .
Other reports suggest he may have simply been upstairs with friends when the agents came .
FBI agents asked partygoers who did not live in the apartment to wait outside while they photographed the residence .
Kernell 's three roommates have been subpoenaed to appear in court in Chattanooga this week , though no charges have been filed against Kernell or anyone else in relation to the Palin incident .
A grand jury is reportedly set to convene in Chattanooga on Tuesday .
Ashley Menner , a 19 - year - old sophomore at the University of Tennessee and a neighbor of Kernell 's at The Commons , told wired.com that 10 FBI agents first arrived to the complex in two SUV's on Friday afternoon around 4:30 or 5 pm and spoke with her and her roommates .
Kernell was n't at home at the time , and the agents asked to see Menner 's apartment " to see how it was laid out , " she said .
" It was very nonchalant .
They did n't make a fuss , " Menner said .
" They did n't want to stir anything up .
It 's a very personal issue , being who his father is . "
Menner said the agents looked at the computers in her apartment to see how they were set up .
During that time , she said , Kernell came home and saw the agents .
" He walked right by them and walked into his apartment , " she said .
" He looked frazzled and shaken . "
She did n't know if the agents spoke with Kernell but said they left after about an hour .
At least one of the roommates received a subpoena on Friday , according to Menner .
Then on Saturday night , a small party was being hosted in Kernell 's four - bedroom apartment , which Menner said he shares with two females and another male .
Between 20 and 25 guests were in the apartment when the FBI returned .
Menner saw only two agents posted outside Kernell 's apartment and does not know if Kernell was there and fled or if he was ever in the apartment for the party .
Menner said she knew Kernell only in passing and had been acquainted with him only since the school term began August 23 .
" He seems real pleasant , like a nice guy , " she said .
" But based on the blogs I 've read on the incident , I do n't think he 's very smart at all .
Especially having a father who is a state representative , doing something of that magnitude , it 's not a very good decision .
I do n't know what he was thinking . "
Justice Department spokeswoman Laura Sweeney confirmed to wired.com that there was " investigatory activity " over the weekend in Knoxville regarding the government 's inquiry into the hack of Palin 's e-mail account .
She said the department would only have further comment if and when it filed charges against any individual in relation to the case .
Kernell is the 20 - year - old son of Democratic Tennessee state representative Mike Kernell who , when reached by wired.com last week at his home in Memphis , declined to discuss the matter .
Kernell senior told wired.com at the time that he was aware of widespread speculation of his son's involvement but that he had not spoken to him about it out of concern he might have to testify in a criminal proceeding .
At the time of that conversation , Kernell said that authorities had not contacted him or his son , although a Tennessee newspaper erroneously reported that authorities had contacted his son .
A Nashville blogger who is friends with the elder Kernell wrote on Friday that Kernell drove to Knoxville to be with his son and that the two met with a lawyer Friday evening for dinner .
She also reported on Sunday that father and son were staying at a hotel in Knoxville , following the appearance by law enforcement agents at David Kernell 's apartment .
Palin's Yahoo account , gov.palin@yahoo.com , was infiltrated late Tuesday night by someone who used publicly available information about Palin ( her birthdate , zip code and information about where she met her husband ) to bypass Yahoo security measures and reset her password to " popcorn . "
The intruder posted the new password and screenshots of her e-mail inbox to a forum at 4 chan , leading other intruders to attempt to access her account as well .
On Thursday , a person claiming responsibility for the intrusion posted information to 4 chan purporting to describe how he accessed Palin 's account .
The post was made under the handle " rubico , " which bloggers quickly connected to an e-mail account , rubico10@yahoo.com , which they then connected to David Kernell .
Efforts to reach Kernell last week by phone were unsuccessful , although someone claiming to be Kernell did initially respond to an e-mail sent to the rubico10@yahoo.com address .
The person did not respond to follow - up e-mails sent to that address .
The IP address from which the communication originated resolved to Comcast and Knoxville , TN .
Portfolio.com ( Wired 's sister publication ) reports that the IP address that was used to access Palin's Yahoo account belongs to Pavlov Media , an ISP based in Illinois .
The ISP provides internet service to The Commons housing complex in Knoxville , TN , where Kernell lived .
Personnel at The Commons told wired.com Monday morning that Pavlov Media provides internet service to the student housing complex , and Comcast provides its cable service .
Pavlov Media declined to discuss the matter .
A University of Tennessee spokeswoman confirmed that Kernell is a sophomore in the college of arts and sciences with an undeclared major , but would not say anything more about Kernell .
Spokeswoman Amy Blakely added that the housing complex where Kernell reportedly lived is not affiliated with the university and provides housing to both students and non-students .
As reported here last week , Gabriel Ramuglia , owner of the internet proxy service Ctunnel.com , which Palin 's intruder used to access her account and obscure his IP address , was examining his logs for the FBI to trace the intruder 's IP address .
Ramuglia told Portfolio that the FBI asked him about only one IP address , which he declined to disclose but said he had matched the address to web activity " consistent with what websites the hacker was expected to have visited through ( the Ctunnel ) service . "
Mark Rasch , a former Justice Department computer crime prosector , told wired.com last week that he believed Palin 's hacker , when caught , would likely be charged with a misdemeanor under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and face little to no time in prison , rather than be charged with a felony .
More serious charges are possible , of course .

We were surprised to learn that one of the stars of Steve Carell 's Get Smart is actually a Swiss Army knife , albeit one whose talents are slightly more impressive than your own trusty multi-tool .
It 's got your scissors , saw , magnifying glass and can opener , but how about a flame thrower that shoots six feet ?
Or a crossbow with stow - away bolts ?
Or a blowgun with its own fold - out sight ?

We scored exclusive schematics of the knife itself , and caught up with prop-meister Tim Wiles to learn how the thing was made fully operational for the cameras .

There were also a dozen or so rubber versions for shots where the knife flies through the air or takes some other kind of a beating .
Wiles — whose prop mastery has been seen in everything from Magnolia to You Don't Mess With the Zohan , and whose inventory includes USPS - friendly sex dolls , magic remote controls , a diver stuck in a tree and a " crazy hair stimulator " for Jack Nicholson — was naturally excited to be on the Get Smart gig .
As you 'd expect , the script called for numerous gadgets :
• Dental floss detonator , explosive floss
• Tooth transmitters ( " We got fake teeth from a dental supply company , embedded microchips and hollowed them out to make them look like toothcaps , " says Wiles . )
• Bracelet receiver made from an existing Marc Jacobs watch , with a slide - out antenna and compartment for wireless bugs
• Smoking compacts
• Glowing coin transmitter
• Piano bomb with countdown timer
• Violin tuning peg laser for cutting holes in walls
• And of course , the Cone of Silence

But it was the knife that was the center of Wiles ' attention .
He got clearance from the companies who own the Swiss Army license ( Wenger and Victorinox ) to feature a souped - up version in the movie .
" Then we bought 50 or 60 big fat Swiss Army knives and gutted them — took them apart and built frames to house the mechanisms to do what we needed it to do . "
As you can see in the sketches above , the crossbow concept requires a little " suitcase " for the bolts , while the flamethrower makes sense only when the knife has its own propane tank , so Wiles had to add both , on either side .

When it came time to deploy the functional units for scenes , some trickery was still required .
For instance , the flamethrower did manage to shoot a jet of fire four to six feet , says Wiles , but it was assisted by a line to an actual propane tank that was hiding just off - camera and controlled by " the effects guy . "
The crossbow totally worked , but its bolts were rubber tipped .
Even though Carell appears in the stills below punctured with bolts , Wiles and the crew assumed the real ones probably would n't have done too much damage .
Nevertheless , on the day of shooting , the crossbow turned out to be all too powerful , and they had to " back off the tension " before someone lost an eye .

" Even though they were rubber harpoons , they still hurt if you got hit by them .
In that confined space [ an airplane bathroom ] , while we were shooting , they ricochet all over the place , " says Wiles .
It 's great to know that Hollywood is n't all CGI these days , and that actors are willing to put their lives ( or at least their eyes ) on the line for a solid visual gag .
Below , you can see the knife featured in its various configurations — and hopefully in the movie , which opens on Friday , June 20 , we 'll get to see the knife ( or knives ) fully in action .
Now , if they could just install an electric screwdriver , I 'd be sold .

Senator Ted Stevens ’s easy victory in Alaska ’s Republican primary on Tuesday sets him up for two more fights this fall that are likely to be much tougher : one in the general election and the other in the courtroom .
The senator received 63 percent of the primary vote against six challengers , even as he faces a trial in September on charges that he concealed $ 250,000 in home renovations and gifts provided by an oil services company , VECO .
If the trial goes forward on schedule , Mr. Stevens , who has been in the Senate for 40 years and is revered in Alaska for bringing home billions of dollars in federal spending , will be defending himself in court while he also tries to hold off a strong general election challenge from a popular and well - financed Democrat , Mayor Mark Begich of Anchorage .
Mr. Begich led the senator by double digits in some polls before the primary , and he has received strong support from national Democrats who hope to strengthen the party ’s Senate majority .
Yet Mr. Stevens , who has long asserted that he alone has the seniority and effectiveness to keep projects coming to Alaska , is not expected to go down easily .

Human Population
This page will only work with a graphical browser implementing Javascript 3.0 or higher .
It fairly accurately clocks the current population and reflects its growth using a second - order approximation of the exponential ; in addition , if you enter a date in any form Javascript will accept and hit the " Do this time " button , it will use its magic formula to estimate the population for any date from 1900 to 2100 , although the estimates become unreliable outside the range 1950 to 2050 .
Use the " Un / Freeze " button to " freeze " the clock at a certain time while it is ticking , or to resume it ticking with the present population after you have frozen it or asked for an estimate .
Those familiar with the earlier version will note that the range in which the new version gives reasonable estimates has increased considerably .
It is of some interest to note that this approximation predicts that the population will start decreasing before the end of the 21st century .
The raw data is from the U.S. Census Bureau , and is not uncontroversial .
For instance , the UN , with its data , considered 1999 October 12 to be the " day of six billion " , but the approximation here ( which I for one have more faith in ) puts it at 1999 June 18 or 19 ( depending on what time zone you 're in ) , nearly four months earlier .

An instant , no -fuss extradition in the best tradition of American vigilantism .
Just another working day for Batman and , presumably , just another feat of digital wizardry for the visual effects team .
Except for one thing : Christopher Nolan , director of The Dark Knight , wanted to do it for real .
Which is a funny thing to want when you 're making a lavish superhero sequel here in the heyday of the greenscreen .
And certainly not an easy thing to get , 88 stories above a juddering megacity on the other side of the world .
" They spent weeks in preproduction working out a way to hang the stuntman from one helicopter and have a second helicopter following him with the camera , " says Wally Pfister , the movie 's director of photography .
Two choppers and a stuntman on a string — all to make a comic - book hero seem as credible on film as Frank Serpico or The French Connection 's Popeye Doyle .
All to make a comic - book movie speak the cinematic language of crime thrillers .
And not a moment too soon .
While today 's action heroes routinely come dressed in shades of the giddy synthetic ( à la Spider - Man and Iron Man ) , movie fans have gorged on digital eye candy — and , perhaps fearing retinal diabetes , now they 're cutting back ( Speed Racer , anyone ? ) .
Still , gritty naturalism is no small leap for the spandex genre .
It 's a mood more identified with art noir and the prestige pic , the kind of cinema built to attract Oscars , not mass audiences .
The Dark Knight director Christopher Nolan .
Photo : Robert MaxwellNolan wants to clothe that grim aesthetic in a cape and cowl — and then project it onto an enormous wraparound screen .
He 's the first Hollywood director to shoot key sequences of a major feature in Imax , the giant - screen film format still known mainly for whopping nature documentaries .
For Nolan , reality beats the hell out of gee - whiz special effects .
But keeping it real does n't come cheap :
The $ 180 million flick is Warner Bros . ' biggest summer tent pole , and after Speed Racer 's flameout , its only box - office hope .
The studio should take heart .
Nolan has a cogent Theory of Applied Batmatics : Insist on reality — no effects , no tricks — up to the point where insisting on reality becomes unrealistic .
Then , in postproduction , make what is necessarily unreal as real as possible .
" Anything you notice as technology reminds you that you 're in a movie theater , " Nolan explains .
" Even if you 're trying to portray something fantastical and otherworldly , it 's always about trying to achieve invisible manipulation . "
Especially , he adds , with Batman , " the most real of all the superheroes , who has no superpowers . "
How " real " are we talking here ?
When Nolan unveiled a six - minute Knight prologue on Imax screens last December ( a twisty bank heist with a jarring Joker reveal ) , it was clear that his cinematic vision owes more to director Sidney Lumet than golden - age DC comics .
You can feel the tension of Lumet 's 1975 Dog Day Afternoon and Michael Mann 's 1995 drama , Heat .
Nolan had an ally in Pfister , his collaborator on every film since the 2000 sleeper hit Memento .
" When I was a kid , that bank heist scene in Dog Day Afternoon was real , " Pfister recalls .
" It was that whole time around The French Connection and Bullitt and The Seven - Ups .
That 's what Chris was going for .
Only we were shooting in Imax , this format where you 're used to seeing beautiful sunsets and helicopter shots of gazelles running across mountainsides .
Instead , we 've got machine - gun fire and Heath Ledger . "
Nolan 's use of Imax is the natural fulfillment of an experiment he launched with Batman Begins in 2005 .
That film depicted Batman 's dogged , bruising rise from angry rich kid to driven crime fighter , and it hinted at the consequences of embracing one 's inner demon , even in the service of good .
Begins ended with a warning : Batman has escalated the war .
His presence ensures the rise of equally quixotic , equally obsessed adversaries .
One of these leaves a calling card at murder scenes : a joker .
Batman promises the police he 'll look into it .
In The Dark Knight , he does , and it looks right back at him , with the leering , paint - smeared face of the late Heath Ledger .
Eight stories tall .
Cruel reality mashed up with the comic - book carnivalesque — unvarnished , without the comforting buffer of f/x .
In an Imax theater , your eyes can't wander off Nolan 's enveloping canvas and can't easily dismiss what they 're seeing as trickery .
Maybe that 's the most special effect of all .
The man who revived the Bat - franchise and saved it from nipple - suited frippery receives visitors in the Garage , his filmmaking sanctum .
It 's where he shot the first Imax test footage for Knight and began what his wife and producer , Emma Thomas , calls " the biggest home movie ever made . "
Technically , she 's right :
The Garage sits across from the couple 's large but unpretentious Hollywood manse , where Nolan and Thomas are raising four young children .

PicturesWhen I arrive , Nolan has just finished editing a Joker scene .
Ledger is frozen in a blur on three monitors .
The actor , who accidentally overdosed on prescription medications in January at age 28 , haunts The Dark Knight .
The full effect on the film of his shocking death has yet to be gauged , but ever since news of the tragedy hit the wires , there 's been reverent yet inescapably ghoulish chatter about a posthumous Oscar .
But all that is far from Nolan 's mind today .
Right now , it 's about the work in front of him .
" Ask Emma to look at the scene and make sure I did n't fuck it up , " he tells his editor , Lee Smith , in a gentle English accent that suggests , to Yank ears , that Everything Is Under Control .
As we step out into the toy - strewn , sun-striped courtyard separating Nolan 's house from his workshop , I nearly trip over a battered effigy of the Tumbler , the tanklike Batmobile unveiled in Batman Begins .
" At one point , that was remote control , " Nolan sniffs .
" Then it got left out in the rain . "
I detect a trace of disdain : A real Tumbler would n't fritz out after a little LA sprinkle .
Because these are n't toys , after all — not in Nolan 's world :
For the new movie , his designers built a full - size , working motorbike called the Batpod , which zips around on two fat spheroid wheels .
According to star Christian Bale , it 's a cruel mistress ; only one stuntman managed to stay in the saddle .
" If you ride it like a bike , you wo n't be riding it very long , " the actor says , speaking from painful experience .
But spills aside , Bale definitely caught Nolan 's naturalism bug :
When he heard that his stunt double , Buster Reeves , was prepping for an aerial shot atop the Sears Tower , he pulled rank .
" I said to Buster , ' No you 're not .
You get to do a lot of fantastic stunts .
You 're not taking that one away from me . ' "
" So we got an Imax shot of Christian Bale as Batman standing on top of the Sears Tower , " Pfister says .
" Here we are with our principal actor standing on the edge of one of the tallest buildings in the world .
I think a lot of people will assume that 's CGI . "
Perhaps , but when you see the shot ( featured in the first trailer ) , your eye instinctively detects something different , something thrilling and rare : photographic reality .
Settling for anything less , Nolan feared , would send the Batman franchise back into camp and mummery .
That 's why he transported his hero to the very real city of Hong Kong .
Unfortunately , the real world has its drawbacks .
" The Chinese government was a nightmare in terms of filming stuff , " Pfister sighs .
" They wanted to limit the amount of helicopter activity over the city . "
And Nolan needed helicopters .
He especially wanted to minimize digital meddling in those high - altitude Imax sequences .
His reasons were both aesthetic and practical : Imax film stock is enormous , roughly 10 times the size of 35 - mm celluloid , and it soaks up a vast amount of visual information .
Those dimensions are what make the image so rich and sharp , even spread over a screen the size of a blimp hangar .
While conventional films are digitized at 2 K resolution ( 2,000 pixels across ) , or 4 K at most , adding visual effects to Imax footage requires digitizing each frame at up to 8 K .
In other words , the difficulty and expense of doing f/x rise exponentially with the size of the negative .
But even superheroes and movie directors sometimes have to compromise :
In the end , Chinese authorities refused to budge , and the skyscraper jump was digitized .
( But the C - 130 preparing to snatch Batman into the sky ?
That 's real . )
" Sometimes you do end up replacing a filmed shot with visual effects , " Nolan says .
" And there 's kind of a see - I - told - you - so among the effects guys .
But if we had started out with that , it would n't have looked the same .
Because we photographed something , we have a benchmark standard to hold to , even if we change things .
Even the film 's CG shots are rooted in some kind of photographic reality . "
For instance , Nolan adds a layer of actual human - generated camera - operating motions to digital effects shots — kind of like deliberately scratching the negative .
He says it restores " the human element of choice : the little corrections , little imperfections .
Certain uncertainties . "
Certain uncertainties have always pocked Nolan 's relationship with the Bat - franchise .
Even in 2005 , after his revisionist reboot proved successful , the director was n't sure he was up for a sequel .
He was making The Prestige , an art - house thriller about rival magicians in 19th - century London ( which , significantly , pits technology against old - fashioned sleight of hand ) .
He was moving on .
But there was one small problem with leaving Batman behind :
He knew how he wanted it all to end .
He had something Godfather - ish in mind , a saga of dark doubles and transfiguration — big , dense , and novelistic .

It would involve not only Batman 's archnemesis , the Joker , but also Harvey Dent ( Thank You For Smoking 's Aaron Eckhart ) as a crusading Gotham City DA destined to become scarred , schizoid villain Two - Face .
Nominal allies , Wayne and Dent would vie for the affections of Wayne 's longtime love , assistant DA Rachel Dawes ( Maggie Gyllenhaal , who replaces Batman Begins ' Katie Holmes ) .
And Dent 's tragic transmogrification into criminal half - man would mirror Wayne 's disappearance into his Batman persona .
The director was n't interested in plumbing the murky origins of the Joker himself — the Clown Prince is more a Loki - like force of chaos .
" He 's like the shark in Jaws , " Nolan explains .
" The Joker cuts through the film , he 's incredibly important , but he 's not a guy with a backstory .
He 's a wild card . "
It was an ambitious tale , and Nolan needed a canvas to match , a format that could sweep fans off their feet .
Imax was his best bet .
Since the late 1960s , the Canadian company has specialized in large - format filmmaking and projection .
Its screens are the biggest on offer , and their vertiginous 1.43:1 aspect ratio is uniquely suited to tales set on dizzying rooftops .
" It 's like replicating that childhood experience of moviegoing , " Thomas says .
" It 's harder to be taken out of your own world as a grown - up .
You need an even bigger screen . "
Of course , most people will ultimately see Knight on ordinary multiplex screens .
The scenes shot in Imax — the bank heist and Hong Kong escape , all the aerial shots , a bang - up armored car chase , and the final confrontation with the Joker — will have to be adjusted to the usual 2.40:1 aspect ratio .
But because they 're compressed from the sumptuous Imax negative , those sequences will still retain a special visual richness .
Pfister admits that even in an Imax theater , many viewers , wowed by the sheer size , might miss the finer photographic distinctions .
But they 'll feel them .
" It 's more of a visceral thing , " he explains , adding that Nolan 's longer , calmer cuts are designed to let viewers scan the huge Imax screen for detail — a refreshing change after years of synapse - snapping action - movie flash - cuts .
" You can see something way off on the horizon , " Pfister says .
" You can see a little glint of light , a reflection in Batman 's eye .
You can't see it in a conventional theater .
And you definitely can't see it on a plasma screen at home . "
Which is good news for studios trying to lure viewers back to the box office .
Without a crane or David Copperfield , it 's impossible to pirate " the Imax experience " for private viewing .
It also bodes well for the Imax Corporation , which two years ago saw its stock plummet after an SEC inquiry into its accounting practices .
The company has since bounced back , signing deals with theater chains AMC and Regal to expand beyond its current network of 300 theaters in 40 countries .
On July 18 , Warner Bros. will roll out Knight on almost 100 of those screens and on some 4,000 traditional ones .
( The studio has shown plenty of blockbusters on Imax screens before , but those films were shot conventionally and later digitally adapted for the format . )
Of course , shooting on the biggest negative in town is n't easy .
The cameras , which Pfister 's crew had to lug up to rooftops and onto helicopters , weighed over 60 pounds each , and their bulk made them awkward to maneuver .
One crushed its mount .
" On a fast tilt - down , the camera just takes you with it , " Pfister says .
Add to that the fact that Imax film is more than three times as expensive as 35 - mm , that there 's only one lab in the world able to process it , and that the cameras have to be reloaded after three minutes of shooting .
" Chris said , ' It 's just like when we were kids and shooting on Super 8 ! ' "
Pfister recalls .
" You get a three - minute load , and then it takes five days to get your film back . ' "
Imax cameras are also considerably louder than traditional 35 - mm cameras , making it difficult to harvest the environmental , on - set sound Nolan prefers .
Movies and television shows often dub dialog after principal photography is over , since the sound recorded by the boom and body mics can prove unusable .
Nolan would rather fix it while everyone 's still on the set .
He hates to loop .
" I just think separating the voice from the face and the body is very tricky , " he explains .
It is , after all , blatantly unreal .
To the Max____Digital and 3 - D may be the future of cinema , but the Imax viewing experience still packs a punch .
70 - mm projection ( left ) vs. 2 - D Imax projection ( right )

The ker - pow ! of Imax rests on the simple rule that bigger and brighter is better .
And the negative used by Imax cameras is huge : 65 mm across , or about the width of an iPod .
The additional surface area allows more data to be recorded , resulting in lush , detailed , hi-def images that loom large onscreen .
( That hi-def effect is expensive , though : Imax film costs more than three times as much as regular film , and the cameras are gluttons with it , slurping up 6 feet of stock per second . )
Better still , in 2 - D Imax theaters , two xenon bulbs outshine the standard single projection light .
The result is a brighter image , with angelic whites that make the other colors pop .
And do n't forget the giant 76 - by 98 - foot screen — two billboards long and eight stories high .
Because it runs wall to wall and floor to ceiling , the image fills viewers ' peripheral vision , immersing them in the onscreen action .

So did the director get everything he needed from Ledger before his death ?
He says yes : Ledger nailed it in principal photography .
Thomas adds , " Everything you see onscreen is his performance . "
( In other words , there 'll be no clunky digital resurrection , aural or visual , no morbid echoes of Oliver Reed 's posthumous performance in Gladiator . )
Besides , Nolan does n't believe in bringing an actor back six months later and expecting him to re-create the nuances of a character , any more than he believes a computer can re-create the quality of human camera work on its own .
" Anything that 's even vaguely funny you just can't reproduce .
When there 's a hint of irony or comedy ...
Well , I do n't make comedies , per se , but " — he chuckles — " at least I think my films are funny .
Nobody else seems to think so , though . "

It 's a problem Nolan shares with Batman 's greasepainted nemesis — and perhaps a harbinger of marketing challenges to come .
Naturally , no one 's expected to laugh at the Joker 's pranks , but will audiences even be able to look at him ?
How will they react to these frightening final images of Ledger - the - actor ?
His death is , in a way , the ultimate case of reality intruding on fantasy .
Even before tragedy struck , Nolan was spooked by the character Ledger created .
" I remember Heath calling up while I was working on the script and talking about ventriloquist 's dummies , about having a voice that was high and low , and I 'm on the other end going , ' Uh ... yeah . '
It sounded insane , and not necessarily in the right way .
But when he performed it , I was like , ' OK , I see . ' "
Nolan could be describing The Dark Knight itself , this rough comic - book beast he 's conjured into our workaday world .
" I do n't know what this thing is , exactly , " he says , " but I know it 's what I wanted . "
He pauses .
" Be careful what you wish for ! "
He laughs again — perhaps a little nervously .
It 's the first , tiny hint I 've seen of a certain uncertainty .

Dobson ’s Focus on the Family still humiliated by ‘ Pray for Rain ’ video
Following up on an amusing story we ’ve been following , about a week ago , Stuart Shepard , who makes religious - right videos for James Dobson ’s Focus on the Family , devoted a segment to asking politically - conservative Christians to pray for rain on Aug. 28 , in order to disrupt Barack Obama ’s speech at the Democratic National Convention .
Shepard called for “ abundant rain , torrential rain … flood - advisory rain . ”
He adds , “ I ’m talking about umbrella - ai n ’t - gonna - help - you rain … swamp - the - intersections rain . ”
Explaining why he wants everyone to pray for rain , Shepard explains , without a hint of humor , “ I ’m still pro-life , and I ’m still in favor or marriage being between one man and one woman .
And I would like the next president who will select justices for the next Supreme Court to agree . ”
Soon after , some Colorado reporters picked up on this , and earlier this week , MSNBC ’s Keith Olbermann featured Shepard as the “ worst person in the world . ”
Focus , feeling a little humiliated , eventually backpedaled , said the video was intended to be “ humorous , ” and pulled the clip from its own site and video - sharing sites , including YouTube .
In a follow - up video , Shepard kinda sorta apologized .
People can reach their own conclusions about Shepard ’s sincerity .
In the meantime , Focus really does n’t want anyone to see the video it originally distributed widely .
My friends at Right Wing Watch report :
Despite their efforts to remove the video , someone else uploaded a copy of it to YouTube which quickly generated more than 100,000 views .
But now , Focus has gone after that version as well and gotten YouTube to remove it .
But try as they might , there are still several versions of the clip available on YouTube and now , News Blab 2008 , which first posted the copy of the FOF video to YouTube , has gone ahead and posted it again on their own website , saying Focus “ obviously [ does ] not understand Copyright ‘ Fair Use ’ when reporting a news story . ”
On top of that , Good As You also has a copy of it posted on their website .
With that in mind , here , again , is the video Focus seems anxious to hide :
But the personas that the two men chose to present in the debate indicated the difference in a profound way .
The truths of debates are these :
Emotional messages , which are variants on " how do I feel about this person ? " , are all that matter in presidential debates .
Issues discussions are significant mainly to the extent they shape these impressions .
For instance : a candidate 's view on the economy feeds the impression of whether he sympathizes with " people like me . "
Or views on foreign policy feed the impression of whether he would be " a leader we can trust . "
Barring a truly disastrous performance , each side 's partisans will think their candidate did well , and will be reinforced in the reasons for supporting the person they already like .
Thus John McCain supporters will think he sounded confident and masterful ; Obama supporters will think he kept presenting the big- picture perspective on national security and the economy .
Which means therefore :
The audience that matters is people who start out undecided or uncertain -- and finally are looking for emotional reassurance about who they can imagine as president for the next four years .
In general , such viewers are only now starting to pay serious attention to the campaign -- in contrast to people already committed to helping ( or stopping ) one of the candidates .
That is why the first debate is a unique " re-launch " opportunity for the candidates to present themselves to people who realize it 's time to make up their minds .
Everything John McCain did on stage last night was consistent with trying to score tactical points in those 90 minutes .
He belittled Obama with the repeated " he does n't understand "s ; he was explicitly insulting to him in saying at the end " I honestly do n't believe that Senator Obama has the knowledge or experience " for the job ( a line Joe Biden dare not use so bluntly on Sarah Palin ) ; and implicitly he was shockingly rude and dismissive in refusing ever to look Obama in the eye .
Points scored -- in the short term , to the cheers of those already on his side .
Obama would have pleased his base better if he had fought back more harshly in those 90 minutes -- cutting McCain off , delivering a similarly harsh closing judgment , using comparably hostile body language , and in general acting more like a combative House of Commons debater .
Those would have been effective tactics minute by minute .
But Obama either figured out , or instinctively understood , that the real battle was to make himself seem comfortable , reasonable , responsible , well - versed , and in all ways " safe " and non-outsiderish to the audience just making up its mind about him .
( And yes , of course , his being a young black man challenging an older white man complicated everything he did and said , which is why his most wittily aggressive debate performance was against another black man , Alan Keyes , in his 2004 Senate race . )
The evidence of the polls suggests that he achieved exactly this strategic goal .
He was the more " likeable , " the more knowledgeable , the more temperate , etc .
( Update : though from here on out he does n't have to say " John is right ... " anywhere near as often as he did last night . ) .
For years and years , Democrats have wondered how their candidates could " win " the debates on logical points -- that is , tactics -- but lose the larger struggle because these seemed too aggressive , supercilious , cold - blooded , or whatever .
To put it in tactical / strategic terms , Democrats have gotten used to winning battles and losing wars .
Last night , the Democratic candidate showed a far keener grasp of this distinction than did the Republican who accused him of not understanding it .
( CNN ) -- Rich Franklin used to spend his days teaching math to high school students .
Today , he spends his evenings in an octagon - shaped cage grounding and pounding fighters into submission in front of thousands of screaming fans .
Rich Franklin prepares right before his fight against Matt Hamill in UFC 88 .

" I do love teaching and working with the students , but I can't imagine sitting at home on a Friday night grading math tests or sitting in a faculty meeting , " he said at a news conference in Atlanta , Georgia .
Franklin is one of the new stars of a rapidly growing sport called Mixed Martial Arts .
Their fights are filling arenas and attracting large numbers of male television viewers between the ages of 18 and 49 , according to the Ultimate Fighting Championship , a pioneering brand in the sport .
Unlike boxing , MMA fighters use a hybrid of techniques from wrestling , kickboxing , Brazilian Jiu Jitsu , and more .
Franklin began fighting professionally while still working as a teacher in Cincinnati , Ohio .
He started playing football at a young age but did n't think he had the talent to play professionally , so he got into martial arts as a hobby after high school .
He trained through college , and on a dare , he entered an amateur fight and won .
After his fourth year of teaching , he decided to gamble his job security to fight professionally full time .
" I 'd rather be one of those guys who did and failed than wonder what could 've , should 've , would 've been when I was 50 , " he said .

Having left the classroom behind , Franklin has achieved success as a fighter in the Ultimate Fighting Championship .
He has held the Middleweight title , had commercial endorsements , and recently earned $ 100,000 with a victory at UFC 88 .
Mixed martial arts has a controversial past .
Critics view the sport as a bloody free - for - all akin to gratuitous Tough Man competitions , where average Joes with no formal training duke it out for prize money .
Rashad Evans , an undefeated UFC fighter , says that although the fights are full contact , it is not no -holds - barred brawling .
" I wish people were more educated about the sport to know that it is not a Tough Man competition , " he says .
Franklin views his fights as a physical chess match where fighters must know how to defend themselves against various fighting styles .
Fellow fighter Karo Parisyan , a judo specialist , agrees .
He explains , " There are so many ways to win that you have to be constantly thinking .
You make one mistake , and it's checkmate . "
In a recent bout , although Franklin 's face is bruised and bleeding , he waits patiently and releases a lightning - fast kick to his opponent 's rib cage .
The contact of his shin snaps like a bullwhip .
His challenger falls to the floor of the cage , visibly in agony , and Franklin adds another win to his record .
Immediately after inflicting a TKO , Franklin rushes over to his opponent .
He congratulates him and says , " Hats off to Matt , he fought a great fight . "
Nate Marquardt fell in love with the sport at a young age .
Today , at age 29 , he already has had 40 professional fights .
His fights , especially the losses , have taught him valuable lessons .
" After you lose , a champion gets better , and losing was a blessing in disguise for me , because it helped me recognize my mistakes , " he said .
Before his last fight , he had to drop 15 pounds , mostly water weight , from his already lean frame only days before the weigh - in .
He said it was n't easy , but he cut his intake of carbs and sodium , and he sat in a sauna , which did the trick .
Marquardt trains year round in pursuit of his dream to become the UFC's next Middleweight Champion .
His success has afforded him the luxury to do so .
He earned $ 56,000 from his last victory .
When he does n't have a fight coming up , he teaches at his gym in Aurora , Colorado , a couple of times a week .
He agrees that the lifestyle of a fighter gives him more flexibility to spend time with his immediate family than if he had a regular 9 - to - 5 job .
He works his training schedule around spending time with his wife and caring for his 8 - year - old daughter .
Marquardt may not have had his fighting opportunities if there had n't been a vast overhaul in the sport .
MMA was on the verge of extinction because of a political backlash in the late 1990s .
One notable critic , Republican presidential nominee John McCain , once called it the equivalent to " human cockfighting . "
Dana White , along with his partners Frank and Lorenzo Fertitta , purchased the fledgling Ultimate Fighting Championship for $ 2 million in 2001 .
White 's goal was to establish the UFC as the Super Bowl of the sport .
He helped legitimize it by establishing rules and promoting the fighters ' skills instead of showcasing the brutality .
Forbes estimates the company will make $ 250 million this year .
A UFC contract provides the potential for fighters to make a good living .
Forrest Griffin , the UFC's current Light Heavyweight champ , earned $ 250,000 for a recent win in a main event .
Sponsorships from sports drinks and apparel also help to supplement their income .
UFC fights have earned more money than concerts by such marquee artists as Elton John and Billy Joel , according to a UFC press kit .
At times , the organization says , they have had more viewers than Monday Night Football and NASCAR .
In Montreal , they brought in more than 21,000 people to an event , the largest live audience to witness MMA in North America to date .
Televising fights has increased the number of fans embracing the sport .
And at live events and autograph sessions , fans can mingle freely with their favorite fighters and take pictures with them .
" So many people are behind the sport now , and people are falling in love with it , so it 's a matter of time before it 's everywhere , " says fighter Uriah Faber .

The easy way to lose weight ?
Breakfast really could be the most important meal of the day when it comes to losing weight , claims a researcher .
Over several months , obese women who ate half their daily calories first thing fared better than those eating a much smaller amount .
US researcher Dr Daniela Jakubowicz told a San Francisco conference having a small breakfast could actually boost food cravings .
A UK expert said a big breakfast diet might simply be less boring .
It could be that it is simply easier for people on a higher - carbohydrate diet to comply with it over a longer period
Dr Alex Johnstone
Rowett Research Institute , Aberdeen Dr Jakubowicz , from Virginia Commonwealth University , has been recommending a hearty breakfast to her patients for 15 years .
She tested it against a low carbohydrate diet in a study of 96 obese and physically inactive women .
This diet involved 1,085 calories a day - the majority of these coming from protein and fat .
Breakfast here was the smallest meal of the day - just 290 calories , with just seven grams of carbohydrates .
Her " big breakfast " diet involved more calories - 1,240 - with a lower proportion of fat and more carbohydrates and protein .
Breakfast here was 610 calories , with 58 grams of carbohydrates , while lunch and dinner were 395 and 235 calories respectively .
Four months on , the low - carb dieters appeared to be doing better , losing an average of 28 pounds to the 23 shed on the " big breakfast " diet .
However , after eight months , the situation had reversed , with the low - carb dieters putting an average of 18 of those pounds back on , while the big breakfasters continued to lose weight , on average 16.5 pounds each .
They lost a fifth of their total body weight on average , compared with less than 5 % for the low - carb dieters .
Slower metabolism
Dr Jakubowicz reported that the big breakfasters said they felt less hungry , particularly in the mornings .
She said : " Most weight loss studies have determined that a very low carbohydrate diet is not a good method to reduce weight .
" It exacerbates the craving for carbohydrates and slows metabolism - as a result , after a short period of weight loss , there is a quick return to obesity . "
She said that the bigger breakfast helped by making people feel fuller during the day , and was healthier , because it allowed more fibre and fruit to be included .
Dr Alex Johnstone , from the Rowett Research Institute in Aberdeen , said that other studies had shown that while low - carb diets were a " good tool " to reduce weight quickly , they were not a " diet for life " .
She said that the regaining of lost weight by these dieters could be more a sign of the relative monotony of the two diets , rather than their ability to necessarily reduce cravings .
" It could be that it is simply easier for people on a higher - carbohydrate diet to comply with it over a longer period . "
A spokesman for the British Nutrition Foundation said there was evidence that a good - sized breakfast could help dieters .
She said : " Research shows that eating breakfast can actually help people control their weight .
" This is probably because when we do n't have breakfast we 're more likely to get hungry before lunch and snack on foods that are high in fat and sugar , such as biscuits , doughnuts or pastries . "

Obama will speak on the economy shortly .
Rob live - blogged McCain ’s “ Herbert Hoover ” speech earlier today .
McCain seems to have forgotten that he ’s been in Washington for 26 years .
And , he ’s also forgotten his involvement with the Keating 5 .
Instead , McCain ’s major speech on the economy was just an attack on Barack Obama .
And , McCain just kept repeating lies that have already been debunked .
NY Times :
Senator John McCain gave a few new details of his economic proposals at a speech here Friday morning , but the address seemed as much a political shot at Senator Barack Obama as a policy prescription .
Washington Post :
Republican presidential candidate John McCain offered few new details this morning on how he would respond to the crisis in the nation ’s financial markets , instead renewing his criticism of Democratic rival Barack Obama ’s ties to former heads of mortgage giants Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae .
The campaign yesterday had promised more information about McCain ’s economic plan .
But McCain , in a speech to a hastily assembled meeting of the local chamber of commerce , mostly repeated his call for a new government trust that would identify and help rescue failing financial institutions and a set of principles to guide future regulation and legislation .
No new details , but plenty of political attacks .
That ’s not exactly the kind of leadership that would calm the markets and instill confidence .
In the middle of the worst financial crisis since the Savings and Loan debacle , McCain ’s speech was just more of the same .
He really is just a nasty guy with no vision for the country .
The Large Hadron Collider slated to be fired up in September is n't likely to accidentally generate any Earth - devouring black holes .
That 's according two new reports , including a safety review by the European Organization for Nuclear Research ( CERN ) .
The world 's most powerful particle accelerator may crank out black holes , but they 'll be so tiny and vanish so quickly that we should n't worry .
I wonder if these reports will appease those who filed a lawsuit against CERN fearing that the machine might suck Earth into a parallel universe .
From Science
News :
… It is possible that the LHC , according to one theory , could be a veritable factory of mini - black holes – no larger than a thousandth of the diameter of a proton .
That theory proposes that gravity is weak , compared to the other forces in nature , because some of it leaks out into other , hidden dimensions folded up into sizes as small as 10 - 17 centimeters , a tiny fraction of the diameter of a hydrogen atom .
At the high energies and small scales probed by the LHC , gravity would become much stronger than it is in ordinary three - dimensional space .
Gravity could then cram enough matter together to form microscopic black holes as often as once a second .
However , such black holes , according to research first reported by Stephen Hawking in the 1970s , ought to rapidly radiate away their energy and evaporate in an instant , before doing any harm .
DNC to McCain : How You Like Privatization Now ?
Created : September 19 , 2008 16:58 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
The DNC is gleefully circulating an AP article that flags another obvious , but important , shortcoming of Sen.
John McCain ’s domestic platform when viewed under the harsh light of the market crisis .
The Democrats observe : “ In an AP article today , Glen Johnson highlights the difficulty John McCain is having trying to explain his long held position in support of George Bush ’s failed 2005 privatization of Social Security in the wake of this week ’s economic turmoil . ”
The article reports that McCain ’s privatization position now looks like bad policy and terrible politics :
McCain defends retirement accounts amid stock dive
Wall Street turmoil [ left McCain ] defending his support for privately investing Social Security money in the same markets that had tanked earlier in the week … .
A headline Friday in the Manchester , N.H. , Union Leader , the leading paper in that battleground state , underscored the political challenge .
“ Pension funds for workers take a hit , ” read a story about a roughly $ 500 million decline the past three months in the state ’s public pension fund .
McCain counters that he does not support full - bore “ privatization . ”
He has not exactly been pushing the issue at all , recently .
Social Security is unlikely to break through as a national campaign issue right now , either , but it could gain traction in swing states with large elderly populations .
The Republicans ’ old promises to shrink government and ‘ Let The Market Decide ’ just do n’t have the same ring .

ORLANDO , Fla . 
The art of flinging a yo - yo is almost unrecognizable to those who have not seen it done well in the past decade or so .
At the recent World Yo - Yo Contest here , it was immediately obvious that yesterday ’s forgotten up - and - down string toy is today ’s “ extreme sport you can carry in your pocket , ” the yo - yoer Andrew Arvesen said .
The seven championship disciplines  six more than when the annual contest began in 1992  have nothing to do with walking the dog or rocking the baby .
Some yo - yos are tied not to fingers but to counterweights like casino dice or rubber balls .
Some yo - yos are flung intentionally from their string and are recaptured by nothing more than friction and a magician ’s timing .
The competitions are frenetic three - minute routines filled with tricks performed too fast to make sense of them all .
The best bring the knowing fans to their feet , and will be seen and imitated by thousands , maybe millions , who watch the replays on the Internet .
If that is not enough to demonstrate just how much things have changed for the yo- yo , consider that a title contender from Singapore dislocated his knee during a preliminary round and was taken away in an ambulance .
I was asked to attend a Citizens Police School as part of our local police department 's community outreach program .
This program is held a couple times a year and lasts 12 weeks .
Although this sort of thing would n't normally interest me , given the large amount of bad press the police are getting across the country I decided to sign up in order to learn more , in effect , to do some research .
What I discovered left me with the strange urge to check if my passport was still valid .
This type of citizens police academy is held in many cities of all sizes across the US .
My particular city is in the Midwest and has a population approaching 300,000 with a police department of 650 officers .
The first thing I noticed about the event was the number of people that attended .
I expected few people to show up given that this is a minimum three hour once a week commitment for twelve consecutive weeks .
I was surprised at the final count of 56 people in this class .
In addition to the twelve weeks of classes , tours of the local jail and a federal prison are offered .
There is an airport tour , a tour of a local large manufacturer , and two eight hour " drive - alongs " with police .
When questioned about the reason for a tour of the local large equipment manufacturer , we were told it was because all of this company 's security personnel attended the citizens police academy and they offered a tour of their facility in return as they maintain an " excellent security protocol " .
Basically , the security personnel at the company were the model we were supposed to follow .
The beginning of the class consisted of each person having their picture taken , full face , straight on , in front of the American flag .
Each person then reviewed the information they provided for their background check , and then signed a statement that the info was correct .
I found this interesting because the application we each filled some days previously already required our signature .
Additional background checks are also required by each facility we chose to visit including the manufacturer mentioned above .
Added to that is yet another background check when a prospective citizen police officer signs up for the " ride along " with a patrol officer .
Food was then provided and it was quite a spread of high cholesterol , deep fried , salty snacks , fried chicken , pizza , chips etc .
I managed to find a bran muffin .
Later weekly snacks are provided by the alumni association of the citizen academy and the class attendees via sign up sheets .
A great deal of time was spent on figuring out who will bring what when .
Pictures were continually taken during all the evening 's presentations in candid fashion and at each and every weekly class or event .
Class began with the Chief of Police presenting his assistants and each of them in turn briefly discussed their areas of responsibility .
Each would teach a full three hour class on their areas in due course .
The second assistant chief assured us all that he and the Chief were Christians .
Then the Chief gave a Power Point presentation overview of the division of police and its accomplishments .
Suffice to say that if I do n't hear the words " honor " , " pride " , and " proud " ever again it 'll be fine with me .
Of the 56 people attending the class , approximately half were comprised of students of various law enforcement type majors in local colleges , security personnel of the large equipment manufacturer previously mentioned , and employees of a local company which sells police and security equipment on both a national and international basis .
The rest of the class was made up of mostly retired people , the majority of which were women .
To say the group is composed mostly of sycophants would be accurate and an understatement .
Each week we were asked to bring " gifts " or thank you cards to the recruits currently in training in the local real police academy because we shared their desks that they use during the day , each desk area having a name tag attached to allow us to write a card or leave a gift to the same person on a weekly basis .
We were also asked to bring gifts of candy or coffee to the police instructors conducting the individual classes .
I left one card the first week with a note to the effect of " measure twice and cut once " .
However , the amount of goodies offered up by the rest of the class participants put me to shame .
Some people regularly brought decoratively wrapped items .
The baskets of goodies proffered to the instructors were huge .
The purpose of the CPA ( Citizens Police Academy ) is clear , and was repeated throughout the course - we , the alumni of the CPA are to be the " eyes and ears " of the police in the community .
We are the " concerned citizens " and since the police cannot be everywhere at once , they need us to be aware of what is going on in the community .
Having completed the course and being now aware of police procedures and what is " of concern " to them , we are expected to help them in " observing " our local communities and essentially be the " friends " of the police .
It frightens me as to how seriously some of the people in that class will embrace such a role .
Here is a list of the classes : 1. Welcome / Orientation / Assistant Chiefs Welcome2 . Narcotics / Vice / Drug Dogs3 .
Internal affairs4 .
Traffic Accidents / DUI5 .
Crime Scene Investigation6 .
Driver Training7 .
Patrol / Building Search8 .
Robbery / 911 Center9 . Traffic Stops10 .
Swat Team Demonstration at Firing Range11 .
Use of ForceAttending the Citizen Police Academy course provides some insight into how police officers think and what they see themselves as being up against in the community , and it is n't very reassuring .
It is clear to me that the Police today have an very definite " us Vs them " mentality as regard the ordinary public .
Our instructor said that while police are citizens too , they are also " not citizens " .
He talked a lot about " potential " in the sense that the police see every citizen they come in contact with as having the " potential " to do harm to the police officer .
And thus everything they do when in contact with a citizen is for their own protection and safety and for the safety and protection of the citizen .
Each instructor made a point of discussing the constitutional rights of citizens , but the focus of his talk was on how citizens must conduct themselves in order to enjoy and preserve those rights and avoid legal complications .
Needless to say , the word " inalienable " was not used .
I am sorry to say , but after eleven classes , it was obvious that the purpose of these classes was to highlight how great the police are , how concerned they are and how they go the extra mile in every way to ensure they cause no undue discomfort to any citizen , do not violate anyone 's civil rights , and how unbelievably difficult their job is on a day to day basis .
We were told that a police officer is a very special individual who undergoes rigorous training as a recruit , ongoing professional development as an officer on the job , suffers a high degree of daily stress and is under constant scrutiny from immediate supervisors to the department chiefs , to the public , watchdog groups , to the Department of Justice .
Wow !
Why would anyone want to do such a job for $ 25 K a year ?
The answer that the course is designed to instill is that the police are " speshul " and do their dirty job for the love of others .
But the last night was the icing on the cake , and was to reveal another motivation completely .
The last class was entitled " Use of Force " .
Firstly we were informed that that particular class title would no longer be used in the CPA , or by the real local police academy .
From then on , the course would be called " Response to Resistance " .
A subtle ' switcheroo ' if I ever saw one .
It was explained to us over and over last night that the police do not " use force " , they merely " respond to your resistance " .
The instructor explained that there are two types of ways to respond to resistance .
The first method , which he claimed they do not use is called " total control " .
Total control was demonstrated by way of a " Cops " video clip from Las Vegas .
An officer was called to a scene on a public street where two young men were reportedly engaged in a fight .
When the officer arrived only one man remained .
The officer instructed the young man to take his hands out of his pockets , which by the way were n't in his pockets .
After asking the guy to take his hands out of his pockets three times , the dumbfounded fella stood there as the officer lunged forward and grabbed the young man by the throat with enough force that they both fell with velocity to the ground .
Again , this is an example of " total control " " response to resistance " , which is not used by our police , apparently .
Our police use the second method of responding to resistance known as " One Plus One " .
In other words , when " meeting resistance " , our police just step it up one notch , using only that response required to compel the citizen to comply .
And you guessed it , the preferred " One Plus One " response now in use by our local police is the Taser .
When questioned by a class member , our instructor said that if the citizen does not comply to the officer 's request to remove his hands from his pockets after three requests , it is acceptable to Taser the citizen , because this is the safest and most acceptable method in response to resistance .
Yes , you heard that right .
Currently , only about half of our local police have Tasers , our instructor informed us that Now for that icing I promised you .
On that last night , our instructor informed the class repeatedly , and with a great deal of conviction , that there have beenNo law suits won , and no deaths caused by the Taser .
He went on to explain that the Taser is the " safest response to resistance " , safe for the officer because it stops resistance instantly and safest for the citizen because recovery is also instantaneous , and the citizen complies with the officer 's requests having experienced the incredible pain of the Tasering .
Everyone 's happy !
We were showed a video clip from the makers of the Taser TX26 , showing how it is safer than a heart defibrillator as it uses .36 joules of electric shock and the current from the Taser is only 2 milliamperes ( .002 ) .
He kindly referred us to www.taser.com for further information ( objective information of course ! ) .
I have looked at the Taser site and it truly is something to see .
On their site Taser claims that their stun guns in no way cause heart attacks or interfere with a pacemaker should the person being Tasered have one .
This claim was dutifully repeated by our instructor .
As an interesting side note , a few months ago in Nicholasville , Kentucky a police officer chanced upon two men arguing in a parking lot , and to deal with the resistance that the two men were presenting to each other , he dutifully pulled out his Taser and shot one of the men in the stomach .
Unfortunately the officer had confused his pistol with his Taser and seriously wounded the man .
That 'll teach him for arguing in a parking lot I suppose .
For their part , Taser Corp were very happy because this was one more incident that they could refuse to recognise as a Taser - related injury .
Of course , one would think that a highly trained Taser - wielding officer would notice the difference in weight between a pistol and a taser , but then again , once that adrenalin starts flowing and those fine motor skills and perceptions fade away , resistance is not just futile , its everywhere !
I chose not to confront our instructor about his claim that Tasers have not caused any deaths , mainly because it would have fallen on deaf ears , or perhaps ears that could only hear the sweet sound of lavish parties thrown by Taser Corp for Police chiefs across the country .
My instructor appeared to be firmly convinced there were no deaths , ever , caused by a Taser .
So I left him to his fantasy world .
After completing the course , my humble opinion is that it is just as bad as we thought - that the police have long since ceased to be a truly community police force that ordinary citizens are no longer to be protected but seen as a potential threat - " disgruntled civilians " .
It is very clear that at the training level , Police officers are being encouraged to harbor an " Us vs Them " mentality towards criminals and civilians alike .
The line has been seriously blurred to the point of not really existing anymore .
All of this taken together strongly suggests that we are moving inexorably toward a police state .
That said , I do not doubt that many members of the police forces across the USA are well - intentioned law abiding , concerned and well balanced " citizens " doing an often thankless and tough job .
But I also think there are many that are the stress - filled " Christian " can - do - no - wrong " heroes " who are proudly doing the job of keeping us all safe from the current government - designated bad guys , the " terrorists " , but also , and most worryingly , They believe this is their duty because , somehow during their training , they have been programmed to see each of us as individual actors full of potential not for good , but to do harm to others or to the police .
The conscious acceptance of the idea that everyone is a potentially violent actor is a paramoralism of the highest degree as described by Polish psychologist Andrew Lobaczewski in his book Political Ponerology .
These men and women are being taught in an organized way to think differently about the very nature of other citizens and to see themselves as tasked with rooting out the latent criminal in every citizen .
The problem this poses for the citizenry is that we will increasingly be forced to consider and reconsider our every thought , word and gesture if we are to avoid falling foul of these increasingly zealous , and often dangerous policing policies and practices .
And the question remains : why ?
Who benefits and to what end ?
Last week I had a post about how McCain was trying to make it look like Obama was the antichrist .
Coincidentally , respected biblical scholars have uncovered dramatic evidence that it is McCain who is more likely to be the antichrist !
How ?
We believe that the End Times is near , based on the pattern of wars , earthquakes .
and other strange phenomena we ’ve been witnessing since the start of the New Millennium .
Given that it may be imminent , the person who controls Babylon must be the Antichrist .
Since McCain has said he wants to maintain US forces in Iraq ( the location of Babylon ) for 100 years , he in effect wants to control Babylon .
But wait , there ’s more !
According to the scholars , the antichrist is likely to be Romanian , so they were surprised that McCain ’s great - grandfather was actually not named John McCain , but John Mihai — and Mihai is a Romanian name .
What clinched it for us was that the name Mihai means ‘ who is like the Lord ’ .
As far as we ’re concerned , that was enough .
It means that McCain might easily pretend to be the Redeemer .
Finally , even McCain ’s likability is consistent with being the antichrist .
Many people think that the Antichrist will be a evil - seeming leader , but in fact the Bible tells us that he will be charming .
Irony just does n’t get any better than this .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Home foreclosures and the rate of homes entering foreclosure rose to record highs in the second quarter , the Mortgage Bankers Association said on Friday .

“ The national foreclosure numbers continue to be driven by the hardest - hit states continuing to get much worse , ” Jay Brinkmann , the association ’s chief economist and senior vice president for research and economics , said in a news release .
The increases in foreclosures in California and Florida overwhelmed improvements in states such as Texas , Massachusetts and Maryland , he said .
“ It is unsurprising that mortgage delinquencies picked up further in the second quarter , ” John Ryding , chief economist , and Conrad DeQuadros , senior economist , at RDQ Economics in New York , said in commentary .
“ However , the increase in delinquencies and foreclosures up to this point is most likely predominantly the product of poor underwriting standards .
Going forward , we have to overlay the weak economy and labor market picture as this more traditional driver of delinquencies will probably become more of a factor , ” they said .
For the quarter , a majority of the states saw relatively little change one way or the other , with California and Florida alone accounting for 39 percent of all of the foreclosures started in the second quarter and 73 percent of the increase in foreclosures between the first and second quarters , the MBA ’s Brinkmann said .
The seasonally adjusted foreclosure starts rate , the percentage of loans that entered the foreclosure process during the April - June quarter , was 1.19 percent , up from 0.99 percent in the first three months of 2008 and 0.65 percent in the second quarter of 2007 .
The percentage of loans in the foreclosure process at the end of the second quarter rose to 2.75 percent from 2.47 percent in the first quarter and 1.40 percent in the second quarter of 2007 .
The U.S. mortgage delinquency rate of 6.41 percent was the highest since at least 1979 , which was when the trade group began its current method of measuring failing home loans .
The rate rose from 6.35 percent in the first quarter and 5.12 percent in the second quarter of 2007 .
The increase in the overall delinquency rate was driven by increases in the number of loans 90 or more days past due , primarily in California and Florida .
The 30 - day delinquency percentage remains below levels seen as recently as 2002 , the MBA said in its National Delinquency Survey .
The second - quarter increase in overall seasonally adjusted delinquencies was comprised primarily of increases in delinquencies for prime loans , the MBA said .
The delinquency rate for prime loans in the second quarter was 3.93 percent , up from 3.71 percent in the first quarter and 2.73 percent in the second quarter of 2007 .
The delinquency rate for subprime loans , however , fell in the second quarter to 18.67 percent from 18.79 in the first quarter .
The delinquency rate increased from 14.82 percent in the second quarter of 2007 .
By loan type , the seasonally adjusted foreclosure starts rate for prime loans in the second quarter was 0.67 percent , up from 0.54 percent in the first quarter and 0.27 percent in the second quarter of 2007 .
The seasonally adjusted foreclosure starts rate for subprime loans in the second quarter was 4.70 percent , up from 4.06 percent in the first quarter and 2.72 percent in the second quarter of 2007 .
One of my friends has a bumper sticker on her car that reads , “ Thank you for not breeding . ”
Every time I read it , I feel a pang of guilt that I have two children .
I know that children in developed countries , especially Americans , use up for more resources than children around the world .
The statistics are staggering when comparing children ’s footprints across the globe , which causes many environmentalists to suggest that not having children may be the single most important thing you do for the environment .
As a mother of two , this is a hard pill to swallow , and I try to convince myself that my children will be part of the solution since they are raised with green family values .
According to Mother Jones , a developed world baby ’s carbon footprint is quite large :
Between 2000 and 2050 , the U.S. will add 114 million kids to its population .
Africa will add 1.2 billion — but their respective CO2 emissions will be the same .
One American child generates as much CO2 as 106 Haitian kids .
Zahara Jolie - Pitt will produce 45,000 lbs of CO2 yearly , compared with 221 lbs if she still lived in Ethiopia .
A typical baby goes through 3,800 disposable diapers in her first 2.5 years .
96 % of American babies wear disposable diapers .
In China , only 6 % do .
In India , 2 % .
China claims its one - child policy has prevented 400 million births — saving 1.5 billion tons of CO2 in 2004 alone .
China is often criticized for its one - child - policy as a restriction on personal freedom .
I am not a proponent of laws that dictate the demographics of a family , but I do think that through education , we can have a significant impact on helping families decide the right number of children for themselves and the environment .
I believe in educated choice .
I do have a few friends who have three or more children .
One friend was accosted by another mother as being environmentally irresponsible for having three children .
For many environmentalists , having children feels like a hypocritical action .
Angharad Penrhyn Jones said in the Guardian :
Eco activists spend their lives agonising over the planet ’s future – but that does n’t stop them having children .
We must n’t give up hope .
It is a personal decision whether or not to have children .
I believe it is possible to live by environmental ethics and have a child , obviously since I am a mother .
The amount of carbon left behind as individuals and families is the most important factor , whether we have children or not .
It is all about carbon emissions .
If you leave a very small family ’s carbon footprint , you are being eco-responsible and can still have children .
It is one reason why I live - off - the - grid and grow my food .
Just remember :
Tucked away on the Cayman Islands sits Ugland House , an unassuming , nondescript building of modest scale and size .
However , according to a recent report by the Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) , this five - story office building is home to more than 18,000 corporate entities , nearly half of which have U.S. ties .
In the past few years , the number of corporations flocking to places like the Cayman Islands to evade U.S. taxes has exploded .
One of these companies , former Halliburton subsidiary KBR , has used offshore tax havens ...
The DNS Vulnerability
Despite the best efforts of the security community , the details of a critical internet vulnerability discovered by Dan Kaminsky about six months ago have leaked .
Hackers are racing to produce exploit code , and network operators who have n’t already patched the hole are scrambling to catch up .
The whole mess is a good illustration of the problems with researching and disclosing flaws like this .
The details of the vulnerability are n’t important , but basically it ’s a form of DNS cache poisoning .
The DNS system is what translates domain names people understand , like www.schneier.com, to IP addresses computers understand : 204.11.246.1 .
There is a whole family of vulnerabilities where the DNS system on your computer is fooled into thinking that the IP address for www.badsite.com is really the IP address for www.goodsite.com — there ’s no way for you to tell the difference — and that allows the criminals at www.badsite.com to trick you into doing all sorts of things , like giving up your bank account details .
Kaminsky discovered a particularly nasty variant of this cache - poisoning attack .
Here ’s the way the timeline was supposed to work : Kaminsky discovered the vulnerability about six months ago , and quietly worked with vendors to patch it .
( There ’s a fairly straightforward fix , although the implementation nuances are complicated . )
Of course , this meant describing the vulnerability to them ; why would companies like Microsoft and Cisco believe him otherwise ?
On July 8 , he held a press conference to announce the vulnerability — but not the details — and reveal that a patch was available from a long list of vendors .
We would all have a month to patch , and Kaminsky would release details of the vulnerability at the BlackHat conference early next month .
Of course , the details leaked .
How is n’t important ; it could have leaked a zillion different ways .
Too many people knew about it for it to remain secret .
Others who knew the general idea were too smart not to speculate on the details .
I ’m kind of amazed the details remained secret for this long ; undoubtedly it had leaked into the underground community before the public leak two days ago .
So now everyone who back - burnered the problem is rushing to patch , while the hacker community is racing to produce working exploits .
What ’s the moral here ?
It ’s easy to condemn Kaminsky :
If he had shut up about the problem , we would n’t be in this mess .
But that ’s just wrong .
Kaminsky found the vulnerability by accident .
There ’s no reason to believe he was the first one to find it , and it ’s ridiculous to believe he would be the last .
Do n’t shoot the messenger .
The problem is with the DNS protocol ; it ’s insecure .
The real lesson is that the patch treadmill does n’t work , and it has n’t for years .
This cycle of finding security holes and rushing to patch them before the bad guys exploit those vulnerabilities is expensive , inefficient and incomplete .
We need to design security into our systems right from the beginning .
We need assurance .
We need security engineers involved in system design .
This process wo n’t prevent every vulnerability , but it ’s much more secure — and cheaper — than the patch treadmill we ’re all on now .
What a security engineer brings to the problem is a particular mindset .
He thinks about systems from a security perspective .
It ’s not that he discovers all possible attacks before the bad guys do ; it ’s more that he anticipates potential types of attacks , and defends against them even if he does n’t know their details .
I see this all the time in good cryptographic designs .
It ’s over - engineering based on intuition , but if the security engineer has good intuition , it generally works .
Kaminsky ’s vulnerability is a perfect example of this .
Years ago , cryptographer Daniel J. Bernstein looked at DNS security and decided that Source Port Randomization was a smart design choice .
That ’s exactly the work - around being rolled out now following Kaminsky ’s discovery .
Bernstein did n’t discover Kaminsky ’s attack ; instead , he saw a general class of attacks and realized that this enhancement could protect against them .
Consequently , the DNS program he wrote in 2000 , djbdns , does n’t need to be patched ; it ’s already immune to Kaminsky ’s attack .
That ’s what a good design looks like .
It ’s not just secure against known attacks ; it ’s also secure against unknown attacks .
We need more of this , not just on the internet but in voting machines , ID cards , transportation payment cards … everywhere .
Stop assuming that systems are secure unless demonstrated insecure ; start assuming that systems are insecure unless designed securely .

SHENANDOAH , Pennsylvania ( CNN ) --
By the time help arrived , Luis Ramirez lay convulsing in the middle of the street , foam running from his mouth .
Crystal Dillman displays the religious medal worn by her fiance , Luis Ramirez , who died from a beating .

Blows had struck the 25 - year - old illegal Mexican immigrant with such force that they left a clotted , bruised impression of Jesus Christ on the skin of his chest from the religious medal he wore .
His attackers were white teenagers , including star students and football players , witnesses told police .
After a night of drinking , the teens taunted the undocumented worker with racial epithets , pummeled him to the ground and then kicked him in the head , court documents charge .
He died in a hospital two days later .
It took almost two weeks for arrests to be made .
But on July 25 , Colin J. Walsh , 17 , and Brandon J. Piekarsky , 16 , were charged as adults with homicide and ethnic intimidation .
Derrick M. Donchak , 18 , was charged as an adult with aggravated assault and ethnic intimidation and an unnamed juvenile was also charged with assault .
The U.S. Department of Justice announced Wednesday that its civil rights division has opened a criminal investigation .
Defense attorneys for two of the teens say Ramirez responded to the name - calling with his own insults , which escalated the confrontation into a fight that got out of hand .
The words allegedly hurled at Ramirez , and the perceived sentiments behind them , led prosecutors to label his death a hate crime .
Without the ethnic intimidation charges , many in Shenandoah believe that the case would not be drawing attention to this depressed northeastern Pennsylvania coal town of 5,000 .
Residents question whether the attack was racially motivated or just an alcohol - fueled confrontation among kids .
See a gallery of the key players »
Ramirez had spent July 12 with friends Arielle and Victor Garcia in their home .
About 11 p.m. , he asked them to drive him and a 15 - year - old girl home , a probable cause affidavit says .
They got as far as a dusty park on Vine Street when Ramirez asked the couple to drop them off so they could walk .
What happened next depends on the narrator , but everyone seems to agree that the first comments were directed toward the girl and Ramirez .
" Is n't it a little late for you guys to be out ? " the boys said , according to court documents .
" Get your Mexican boyfriend out of here . "
Racial slurs followed , and Ramirez responded .
Punches were thrown , and Ramirez fell to the ground .
Then Ramirez used his cell phone to call Arielle and Victor Garcia for help .
The fight seemed to be over by the time the Garcias responded .
But in an instant , the taunts resumed .
It is unclear who threw the first insult .
Ramirez was knocked to the ground again and kicked in the head .
He went into convulsions , said Arielle Garcia , who witnessed the second part of the fight .
Garcia , 17 , told police she knew some of the assailants from school .
Watch Arielle Garcia 's eyewitness account »
By this time , Eileen Burke , a retired Philadelphia police officer , had stepped out of her home after hearing Arielle Garcia 's pleas to stop the beating .
Burke recalled hearing one final , ominous threat as the teens ran .
" They yelled , ' You effin bitch , tell your effin Mexican friends get the eff out of Shenandoah or you 're gonna be laying effin next to him , ' " she said .
Ramirez was taken off life support two days after the fight .
His body was flown back to his mother in Guanajuato , Mexico , with donations from parishioners from Annunciation Church in Shenandoah .
" There 's outrage among Anglos and Latinos over what happened , and I think that 's representative of the attitude here , " said the Rev. George Winne , who is in charge of Hispanic ministries at Annunciation .
Others in town pull over their cars at the sight of a stranger and recite a litany of attacks allegedly perpetrated by Latinos against Anglos .
They refuse to give their names but acknowledge that Ramirez did not deserve to die .
They say violence has been brewing between the races for some time .
Attorneys for two of the teens deny that Ramirez was targeted because of his race .
" Let 's call it what it was it was : a street fight , a chance encounter with a tragic outcome , " said Frederick Fanelli , who represents Piekarsky .
Fanelli said he plans to investigate whether Ramirez has a criminal background .
He also questions why the engaged father of three was walking on the street with the girl , and the nature of their relationship .
Ramirez 's fiancee says he was walking her younger sister home .
A lawyer for Walsh said he is equally skeptical about the ethnic intimidation charge .
" They called each other names .
The victim was calling them obscenities , vulgar names , and they said things back to him that would hurt him , " Roger Laguna said .
" It just means it was a foul - mouthed argument , not ethnic intimidation . "
Ramirez died just as things were falling into place for him and Crystal Dillman , 24 , the woman he planned to marry .
They met in Shenandoah in 2005 through the Garcias and had two children , Kiara and Eduardo , and Ramirez assumed the role of father to Dillman 's daughter from a previous relationship , Angelina .
By May , Ramirez had settled in Shenandoah , working two jobs after spending six months picking berries in Georgia .
" He worked hard so his kids would have more than he had growing up , " Dillman said .
" He talked a lot about how we take so much for granted here . "
His diamond - encrusted religious medal , which cost him $ 300 , now hangs over the fireplace in the three - story home on Main Street where Dillman and the children live .
" I just do n't understand how you can beat someone so badly when you do n't even know them , " Dillman said .
" People here are just ignorant .
They think life begins and ends in Shenandoah . "
Watch Dillman talk about her fears for the future »
A court affidavit identifies Walsh and Piekarsky as the teens who delivered the fatal blows :
Walsh punched Ramirez in the face and knocked him to the ground .
Piekarsky then is said to have kicked Ramirez in the head .
Michael Walsh is struggling to comprehend how his boy -- a straight - A student who juggled track , football and school -- could stand accused of killing another person when he should be starting his senior year in high school .
" It 's very stressing because you just do n't expect it .
If you had a child that 's constantly in trouble , you 'd say , hey , well , this is coming any day , " he said .
" Colin was a great kid and fell into a bad situation .
He never really gave me any trouble , " he added .
" I feel sorry for the families and anyone who cares about Mr. Ramirez . "
Watch Walsh describe his family 's ' nightmare ' »
" You would be proud to have any of these kids in your classroom , and any of them as your children , " said Fanelli , Piekarsky 's lawyer .
" To this point in their lives , they have done everything right . "
Besides his academic achievement , Piekarsky worked part - time at Sears and made the varsity football team as a sophomore .
He is a National Honors student .
His mother postponed her wedding to a Shenandoah police officer because of the incident .
Walsh and Piekarsky are being held in solitary confinement in an adult jail in nearby Pottsville .
They are awaiting a preliminary hearing .
Donchak was the team 's quarterback last year and graduated in May .
He planned to attend Bloomsburg University in the fall .
He is out on bail .
The racial spotlight falls on the region nearly a year after a federal court struck down proposed anti-immigration laws in nearby Hazleton .
City officials had passed a law to fine landlords and employers who dealt with illegal immigrants .
The city is appealing .
Although Schuylkill County is 96 percent white , Shenandoah has taken pride in its ethnic diversity .
European immigrants came to work anthracite mines in the late 19th century .
Pizza joints , German bakeries and Polish grocers on Main Street serve as reminders of that time .
The town hit hard times after World War II and saw its population tumble from 20,000 to about 5,000 , leaving about one in three homes vacant .
Latinos began to arrive about 20 years ago , heading to the fields and distribution centers that have become the new economic base .
Jose Calderon , a Puerto Rican who has lived in Shenandoah for two years , says he 's not fearful .
" These are the problems of the youth , " he said .
On Main Street , where people gather on benches in front of the remaining storefronts , some members of the Anglo community are also outraged .
" The young guys around here are racist because they think they 're so much better than everyone else , " said Jessica Lane , 18 , as her 2 - year - old son , Damien , squirmed in her lap .
Shenandoah officials now acknowledge a racial element of Ramirez 's death .
Regardless of perception of tension , many Latinos and Anglos have formed interracial relationships , like those of Dillman and Ramirez , and their friends the Garcias , who have a son .
Mixed couples and their children sat among other Latino couples at Annunciation Church 's Sunday Spanish - language Mass .
As the service began , a white woman approached Dillman and hugged her .
" I have such survivor 's guilt , " she confessed .
All About Hate Crimes • Racial Issues • Murder and Homicide
PRINCETON , NJ -- Gallup Poll Daily tracking from Wednesday through Friday finds Barack Obama maintaining his lead over John McCain among registered voters , by a 50 % to 44 % margin .
Obama has held at least a small margin over McCain in each of the last four daily reports , generally coincident with the start of the Wall Street financial meltdown that began to dominate the news on Monday this past week .
Separate Gallup consumer confidence tracking has shown that Americans ' views of the economy deteriorated as the week progressed , and that Americans also began to express increased personal worry about their own finances .
There is thus a reasonable inference that Obama 's gains may , in part , be related to the way in which the public viewed his and McCain 's response to the financial crisis .
Friday 's economic news was a bit more positive , with the announcement of a pending major U.S. government bailout for the country 's economy , and the second day of significant increases in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and other stock market indices .
It remains to be seen if this will affect Obama 's lead in the days ahead .
Obama 's current 50 % rating matches his 50 % record high reached just after the Democratic National Convention .
( That came in Gallup Poll Daily tracking from Aug. 30 - Sept. 1 . ) However , his current six percentage point advantage is not as large as the nine - point lead he held in late July and an eight - point lead after the Democratic National Convention in late August .
It is important to note that McCain recovered and moved ahead after each of these Obama high points , suggesting that it is certainly possible that McCain could recover in this situation as well .
Both candidates will be on stage at the University of Mississippi this coming Friday for the first of three presidential debates , and the public 's reactions to the candidates ' performances there could certainly have an impact on their election standing .

This is a guest post by Meg Hamill who works at an environmental non-profit called LandPaths in partnership with the Open Space District of Sonoma County California .
Australia , the world ’s 16th biggest polluter when it comes to carbon emissions , with five times more carbon pollution per capita than China , has come under criticism for setting carbon targets that are too low .
Australian climate adviser Ross Garnaut was appointed in 2007 by prime minister Kevin Rudd to examine the impacts of climate change on the Australian economy .
Currently Australia is working on their Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme under a ‘ cap - and - trade ’ model .
Last Friday Garnaut urged the Government to cut greenhouse gases by 10 % on 2000 levels by 2020 .
He set a price of $ 20.00 Australian ( $ 16.25 USD ) per ton in the first years of Australian carbon trading .
The ‘ cap - and - trade ’ approach being created in Australia , and currently being used in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme ( ETS ) , sets a maximum amount of emissions that companies can created in a given time period .
Each period , companies are given allowances equal to their total emissions during the period .
If their overall carbon emissions in one period are below their cap , then the company has allowances to sell .
If they are above their cap , they must buy allowances from companies that have exceeded their emissions reductions targets .
Each allowance is equal to one ton of Co2 emissions .
David John Karoly , a lead author for the Nobel Prize winning Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio that Garnaut “ appears to be putting the problem in the political too - hard basket , and taking a weak or easy option , leaving it to other countries and other generations to solve the problem . ”
Scientist Amanda Lynch , and fellow IPCC author with Karoly , told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio :
“ The primary problem with that kind of level is that it does n’t give sufficient signals to the market to restructure our ways of doing business in the fundamental ways we need to do right now . ”

Is ' Palin Effect ' already wearing thin ?

1 / 1 Back to Gallery
Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin blew onto the national political scene like a surprise hit movie - with an exciting script , a new landscape , a fresh face - that suddenly everyone wanted to see and talk about .
But now that the Republican vice presidential candidate has been seen and heard by millions - and parodied on " Saturday Night Live " before millions more - a question has been raised about the " Palin Effect . "
While GOP loyalists apparently still love the movie , is it starting to wear thin on the rest of America , particularly the legions of middle - of - the - road voters ?
" Is she a one - hit wonder ?
Unless she does something radically different from what she 's currently doing , yes , " Cal State Sacramento political communications Professor Barbara O'Connor said this week .
She said that in the 23 days since Palin was named the GOP vice presidential choice , her script has been a limited and increasingly predictable one .
" It 's fine to say she needed some time to get her footing ... but we 're well past that . "
Palin 's decision to postpone a two - day fundraising and campaign trip to California this week also might say as much about John McCain 's campaign troubles this week as it does about her own , insiders say .
Campaign officials said Palin will bolster her foreign policy credentials by appearing with McCain at the United Nations next week .
But the Alaska governor has been rescheduled to be almost exclusively at the side of McCain until the election - in part because she boosts the size of GOP activist crowds that the party 's presidential candidate can't attract .
Jon Fleischman , the Southern California vice chair of the state GOP , said Palin remains enormously popular with Republicans - and a huge plus for their presidential campaign message .
Strong with base
" She 's very strong with the base , " said Fleischman , publisher of the GOP Web site Flashreport.org , who said Palin is a fundraising magnet and a proven draw with many of the state 's conservative voters who might otherwise have sat out the election .
" She gets them excited . "
But a new Field Poll released this week underscored that while Palin has excited the GOP 's base in blue - leaning California , and helped McCain cut Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama 's lead to 16 points in the state , she has not advanced the ball for Republicans in winning over independent voters in the nation 's most populous state .
And those findings were mirrored in a New York Times poll this week that had Obama up over McCain by 5 points nationally - in part because Palin has not moved large numbers of independents to the GOP candidate 's camp .
Political insiders say the " Palin Effect " might be waning , in part because her tightly scripted political rallies have become too familiar .
She has delivered - more than 14 times to date - virtually the same speech she made to the Republican National Convention in St. Paul , Minn .
That speech always includes the claim , widely disputed by newspapers , editorial boards and independent fact - checking groups , that she said " thanks but no thanks " to the famed Bridge to Nowhere in Alaska .
Meanwhile , Palin has not allowed reporters to ask questions or appeared at a news conference to address a growing roster of questions about her views and her tenure as the chief executive of Alaska .
Those have included matters regarding the Troopergate scandal , her use of a private Yahoo e-mail account to do government business and her positions on key issues like stem cell research .
Just two interviews
In the weeks since being named , she has submitted to just two interviews - one a soft - focus session with GOP - friendly talk show host Sean Hannity - while just one other reporter has been able to get in a shouted question at a rally .
" At some point , that gets old , " O'Connor said .
" Without more and greater depths of knowledge , they 're not going to embrace her . "
But Dan Schnur , a longtime GOP strategist who now directs the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics at the University of Southern California , said that increasing numbers of voters on both sides are getting their information from media sources that reflect their ideologies ; Republican campaigns are well aware that party loyalists are inclined to distrust the mainstream media on such matters .
" At a time when more voters can get their information from ideologically tailored sources , it 's an even easier sell , " Schnur told the Miami Herald this week .
" Partisans on both sides have their favorite sources of information , and they get frustrated when the mainstream media does n't follow the same talking points . "
Still , " I think the luster is wearing off , " said Democratic strategist Garry South , who has advised former Democratic Gov. Gray Davis and former presidential candidate Al Gore .
He says that in the age of YouTube , voters are making decisions quickly about their impressions of a candidate .
And in the few days since she debuted , Palin so far has failed to deliver much more to voters than her big , impressive convention speech - a factor that has put her squarely in the sights of late - night comedians .
Pop culture 's impact
" One of the things that 's happened is that popular culture has come to inform politics .
I 'm convinced that one of the most damaging things to happen to Gore " was his skewering on " Saturday Night Live , " where he was ridiculed for his stiff demeanor , he said .
" That ( ' Saturday Night Live ' ) Tina Fey impression was more like Sarah Palin than Sarah Palin , " South said .
" Sometimes there 's a crystallizing effect , and people hear something and say , OK , I get it ... ' I see Russia from my house , ' " he said , referring to Fey 's impression jabbing Palin as lacking foreign policy and travel experience .
" I 'm not saying that ' Saturday Night Live ' decides the election , but those kinds of popular - culture incarnations do have an effect .
And I think this woman will ultimately be viewed as a lightweight . "
Not everyone agrees .
GOP strategist Sean Walsh said Palin is " still a rock star " who can only grow as a candidate and as a draw by appearing alongside McCain at events .
" You can't argue with the crowds and the excitement , " he said .
" Bush won the last election because they drilled down deep to the base - and to re-energize them allows McCain to go there too . "
They 're not going to lock up Rove , Former Bush aide insists David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Friday July 11 , 2008
Print This Email This Rep. Sanchez : Rove should be " held accountable for his complete disregard of the law " Karl Rove refused this week to testify before Congress about the politically - motivated prosecution of former Alabama Governor Don Siegelman .
A subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee has now voted overwhelmingly to reject Rove 's claim that as a former " close advisor to the president " he is " constitutionally immune " from having to testify .
MSNBC's Davis Shuster asked Rep. Linda Sanchez ( D - CA ) , chair of that subcommittee , what the Judiciary Committee will do next .
" The next step would be for the full committee to take up the contempt recommendation , " Sanchez stated , " which I 've been told by Chairman Conyers that he 's anxious to do , and from there it would go to the full House . "
She added that she " would like to see Karl Rove held accountable for his complete disregard of the law . "
In a letter sent to Rove 's lawyer a week ago , Conyers and Sanchez threatened that " a refusal to appear in violation of the subpoena could subject Mr. Rove to contempt proceedings , including statutory contempt under federal law and proceedings under the inherent contempt authority of the House of Representatives . "
" There is a jail in the US Capitol , " Shuster pointed out , " that has n't been used for some time , but you are saying , and the committee , some of your colleagues are saying tonight , you want Karl Rove in that jail if he continues to refuse the demands of this committee .
Is that what you 're saying ? "
Sanchez noted that " with some of the renovations that have gone on in the Capitol over the years , there really is n't an actual physical jail there , " but she insisted that " anybody who scoffs at the law and has committed an offense that is punishable by jail time should be put in jail . "
She believes there is a " very great probability " that the full House will vote to hold Rove in contempt .
Shuster then asked legal professer Jonathan Turley , " Are the Democrats really serious , taking this all the way ? "
" I think John Conyers could very well be serious , " Turley replied .
" The invocation of executive privilege by Rove in this matter really is ridiculous . "
" I think the White House knows once again that it has overextended an executive privilege claim and that it would not be sustained in a court of law , " Turley continued .
" No court has ever said what the White House seems to be suggesting .
...
It would be untenable .
We would never be able to have any check on the White House . "
Turley believes that the White House is simply " trying to run the clock out . "
When asked if Congress would go as far as trying to jail Rove , he answered , " I do n't think we 're going to get to that , " but he felt there is a real possibility of a vote for inherent contempt .
" Congress gave up the authority of inherent contempt under an agreement with the Justice Department that it would be an honest broker , that it would take these cases to the grand jury , " Turley explained .
" What Attorney Mukasey is doing right now I think is far beyond bounds .
He is refusing to let a grand jury see these cases .
...
So I think at this point that Congress has a right to say , ' Deal 's off . ' "
Shuster then turned to two other guests for comment .
Former Bush aide Brad Blakeman insisted that Rove is just following legal advice in refusing to testify and " the president 's privilege trumps what Congress wants to do . "
He suggested that when there 's a conflict between the executive and the legislative branches , " the remedy is to go to the courts . "
The Huffington Post 's Roy Sekoff replied that " Rove is thumbing his nose at the Constitution .
...
They think that they are above the law .
...
The Justice Department is refusing to take it to the grand jury . "
However , Sekoff doubts that the House will actually try to put Rove in jail .
" Nothing will happen , " he stated pessimistically .
" They 'll refer it to the Justice Department ... and the clock will run out . "
" It 's a tremendous abuse of their power , " Blakeman argued .
" They know that , and it 's exactly why they 're not going to execute on the contempt .
They 're not going to lock Karl Rove up .
...
They want Karl Rove as a political pawn before a major election to embarrass the president . "
" In United States vs. Nixon , they found that executive privilege is not absolute , " Sekoff retorted .
" It applies to military and diplomatic situations , not to a thing where Karl Rove is trying to build a permanent majority with political trickery . "

A Turkish computer hacker who was helping that country ’s media and national police investigate computer crimes was kidnapped and tortured by a notorious ATM hacker , according to a report from the Turkish press .
The victim , known online as " Kier , " had been leaking information to Turkish reporters about an underground figure called Cha0 , when he briefly disappeared .
He resurfaced in May , and described being abducted and beaten by Cha0 and his henchmen .
A photo of Kier stripped down to his underwear and seated in a chair surfaced on the online crime forum DarkMarket , according to a source there , who provided a copy of the photo .
Kier is seen holding a sign that reads in part : " I am rat .
I am pig .
I am reporter .
I am fucked by Cha0 . "
Kier disappeared again shortly after describing his ordeal to two reporters at Turkey ’s Haber 7 , according to the report .
In his last e-mail to the reporters , he claimed that Cha0 is protected by a relationship with Turkish officials .
" I always had a question mark on my mind on where Cha0 ’s men got the resources , " Kier wrote the reporters in Turkish .
" I found out firsthand when I had a weapon pointed at my head . "
Cha0 sent the kidnap photo to Haber 7 , but later denied any role on Kier ’s more recent disappearance .
Cha0 then vanished himself , and Haber 7 reports that he might be in police custody .
A well known figure in the credit card fraud underground , Cha0 markets a high - quality ATM skimmer and PIN pad that fraudsters can covertly affix to certain models of cash machines .
The skimmer records the magstripe data on a consumer ’s debit or credit card as they feed it into an ATM , while the PIN pad overlay stores the user ’s PIN .
The stolen magstripe data can later be encoded onto a blank card and used to make withdrawals from victim accounts .
Cha0 ’s banner ad on DarkMarket shows a cartoon man wading through a house full of cash .
" Is that you ? , " the text asks .
" Yes .
If you bought [ a ] skimmer and PIN pad from Cha0 . "
In April , Miami Beach police busted a ring of Bulgarian nationals who ’d allegedly been planting skimmers on area ATMs for two years .
The gang installed pin-hole cameras in the ceiling of the ATM to record the PIN numbers .
They allegedly used the stolen data to pull more than $ 160,000 from bank customer accounts in the span of just two weeks last February .
The Secret Service took over the Miami Beach case , and the four defendants were each released on a $ 100,000 cash and signature bond .
Three , including alleged ringleader Nikolai Hristov Arabov , jumped bail and went on the lam last month .
30 - year - old Raymundo Castaneda is suspected of having killed a man in December 2007 following a dispute over a soccer game .
Wanted by the fuzz in Charlotte over the murder , Castaneda was apprehended by police in Jacksonville on Friday , who tracked him down after he was spotted at a local Wal - Mart .
Spotted playing Guitar
Hero in the games section .
And playing it so damn hard he did n't even notice police first approaching , then surrounding him .
Jacksonville Sheriff 's Office spokesman Ken Jefferson :
A team of U.S. Marshals and JSO officers went in to get Castaneda , but he was n't paying all that much attention to them .
His focus was on this …
He was calm , cool and collected .
Playing a video game .
He did n't have a care in the world .

Reports claiming Castaneda only agreed to " come quietly " if the cops helped him beat the devil are unconfirmed .
Suspected Killer Caught Playing Air Guitar [ News 4 Jax , thanks Brett ! ]
I ’m not a fan of traffic enforcement cameras , especially as they 're implemented here in Ohio and other states .
There ’s just something that seems a bit off about turning a criminal infraction into a “ civil violation ” so that some company can issue , process , and offer even offer an administrative “ appeal procedure ” for these violations , all while getting a large cut of each one .
Of course , maybe I ’m just a bit too cynical about this .
After all , proponents say that cameras keep us safe and that the millions of dollars in extra revenue is just gravy .
Besides , computer systems do n’t lie and there are always trusted personnel issuing these violations to ensure that justice is served … right ?
At least , this certainly was the case for Thomas .
A traffic enforcement camera in Plettenberg Bay , South Africa snapped a picture of his Volkswagen Polo clearly traveling in excess of the posted 60 km/h limit ...
And after a careful review of the evidence , the Plettenberg Bay Traffic Department sent him a summons for this violation .
I Feel Your Pain !
This time I am focusing specifically on people who , like me , are office workers .
( Do n't worry business travelers , your article is next month . )
Business people who work in an office face numerous challenges with regards to eating right : the lure of the donut box , the ' machine O ' cr@p ' that lurks in the break room , and problems with accessibility to appliances or lack thereof , make this a frustrating position at best .
Since there are so many variables , I plan to break the article down like this :
I will be basing my recommendations on the following assumptions :
You have enough space , somewhere in your office area , to stock bars , protein packs , or even a tub or two of protein .
If not , you have the ability to bring these items from home every day .
You have access to water .
You wo n't get fired by some ill informed boss who thinks protein powder is a steroid ( do n't laugh , some people are morons ) .
And last but not least , you just do n't care about Mr. Nosey McBigbelly 's snide remarks about your healthy eating habits as he stuffs the last 6 donuts past his double chin , mumbling , " You know , all that protein stuff is bad for your kidneys . "
Eating Guidelines
We are not eating for pre-contest here , just trying to keep good nutrition and feed the muscles to help recover from workouts .
Maybe we want to add some lean mass or just lose a little body fat , but nothing radical here .
I am also guessing that most people are not lucky enough to be able to run home for lunch , especially with $ 4 / gallon gas prices .
You will need to eat multiple meals .
This helps to keep the metabolism ramped - up , as well as deliver the proper nutrients to the body to help it repair itself from the hard work you do in the gym .
Most people will be eating about 5 - 6 meals .
This would generally be :
Breakfast Mid-Morning Snack Lunch Mid-Afternoon Snack Dinner Pre-bedtime protein
I am assuming you are serious enough that you are already eating breakfast at home before you leave for work ; therefore , we will focus on the mid-morning snack , lunch , and mid-afternoon snack .
I am also assuming you will be stocking any pre-workout supplements or vitamins in the drawer or will be bringing them daily .
Full Access To Refrigerator , Ice And Water & A Microwave
You have it pretty easy compared to most people , but it still takes planning so you do n't get hungry and wind up with the ' honey bun from h*ll ' sitting on your desk at 9 AM , begging you to eat it .
The elusive mid-morning snack , what should it be ?
Well depends on your goals and your size .
Big guys can have a smaller version of a meal , ideally some brown rice , chicken or beef and some green veggies .
Lunch can be some potatoes , mixed veggies , and lean meat .
Late afternoon snack is dependent on when you lift .
A morning lifter should drop the starches and go with lean meat and veggies .
An evening lifter will want some complex carbs and lean meat at least 1.5 - 2 hours before lifting .
Smaller guys and ladies , you may have a problem with portion size on snacks here , so some yogurt with whey , a smaller version of the big guys ' snack , or a bar or shake will work .
Lunch should be a solid food meal with a small amount of starches , lean meat , and green veggies .
The afternoon snack is also dependent on lifting time .
So a morning lifter should avoid the starches , but an evening lifter could use some yogurt and whey with some granola mixed in for fuel .
Everyone who transports their meals should buy some plastic containers with separate compartments and cook up these snacks and lunches 2 days at a time ( or use the leftovers from last night 's healthy dinner ) ; stack them in the fridge at home , and grab them in the morning .
It is really easy ; it just takes some time to plan and cook ahead of time .
Remember the adage , " If you fail to plan , you plan to fail . "
It is easy to slack on preparation at night , only to fall victim to ' the machine O' cr@p . '
You can also bring you pre-workout drink powder and keep it in the drawer ; spend $ 1.29 on a funnel , and pour it into a water bottle or < shaker cup before heading to the gym .
No Refrigerator , But Still A Microwave And Ice Machine
You do n't have as many choices here , but clean eating is still doable if the upfront prep is done properly .
You can really use the same choices as above , but you need to spend a little money on a good cooler and cold packs .
It is preferable to buy a cooler large enough to fit 3 meals in , but if you only have enough room to pack the lunch meal with the cold packs , here are some good options for protein shakes for snacks .
These are good options because they all shake up well with no clumping and are rich enough to mix with just ice water .
( A shaker cup is needed — hey they are free with a decent sized order here so no whining ) :
Optimum Pro-Complex
Muscle Asylum Project Freak Fix Protein
Syntrax Nectar
A scoop or two of these with some low fat pretzels or raw veggies can definitely fill you up and provide you with a consistent flow of nutrients throughout the day .
Ice Machine Or Cold Water Fountain , But No Fridge Or Microwave
This is a more challenging situation , there are no hot foods for you unless you go out , which can be the diet killing stamp of death .
Sandwiches may be the best alternative for lunch , but beware of the meats you choose , some prepackaged lunch meats are so processed that there is no resemblance to the original profile of the meat 's nutritional values , deli meats can do , or better yet , leftover meat from your meals at home .
Try to use breads , low fat , lower carb , and made from UNBLEACHED wheat , and preferably whole grain .
Also use low fat , low sugar condiments and a healthy portion of crispy greens .
At my size ( 220 lbs ) I am looking for 40 - 50 grams of protein from each meal , so I need two sandwiches with 2 - 3 oz of turkey breast or other lean meat on each .
This meal will usually have the largest carb content of any meal of the day for me , due to the bread .
But it is still early in the day .
Good snacks are still usually shakes or bars .
A few more good water soluble proteins are :
Muscletech Nitrotech Hardcore
Optimum 100 % Whey Protein
Champion Pure Whey Protein Stack
Next Designer Whey Protein
SOL On Fridge , Microwave , Ice Machine , Maybe Even No Water Fountain
Your boss hates you , find a new job , your life sucks .
OK maybe not , but this is a difficult position to be in if you want to eat healthy .
But it can still be done .
Lunches are still sandwiches .
Snacks can still be shakes , but here 's the trick .
You need to take a shaker cup and fill it 1/6 - 1 / 4 of the way with water and put it in the freezer the night before .
This should melt a bit throughout the first couple of hours at work , but will still be a nice chunk of ice for that first morning shake .
Fill with water and protein and shake until mixed ; the chunk will mostly dissolve .
You can also fill it with ice cubes before you leave for work in the morning .
This leaves us with the late afternoon snack of a bar .
Now there are all kinds , and I have been fortunate enough to try MANY of them .
Since they have vastly different profiles , here is my profile breakdown and favorites with comments .
Higher protein , 20g or better , these usually have 250-400 calories , some sugars , and are very tasty :
Labrada Lean Body Gold Bar
Optimum Nutrition Lift Bar
Met -RX Protein Plus Bar
Chef Jay Protein Cookies
Labrada Rockin ' Roll Bar
Lower protein , 10 - 20g , less sugar , but still good energy , these are usually under 200 calories :
Apex Nutrition Fit Quick Energy Bar
Apex Fruit Fuel Bar
Optimum Protein Diet Bar
I know there are a lot of APEX Bars , but I found this company while searching for a bar my daughter would eat , with a profile that made my wife happy .
I tried one of their bars , and then tried more .
I have not found one of theirs that I did NOT like .
My wife and I keep an assortment of these in the cupboard .
Bars to avoid if dropping BF is your goal now , try to avoid bars with high levels of simple sugars .
I try to choose bars with less than 1 /2 of the carbs as sugar if I am trying to drop fat .
There are many other good ones , but since they may be especially suited to travel , I am saving them for the next article .
Situational Adjustments
What do I mean by this ?
I mean " What do you do if ... ? " :
You show up at a meeting and there are boxes of donuts and trays of pastries , all looking just too tasty .
If you are eating right most of the times , a donut or two should not kill you .
But if you are dropping BF , one donut sometimes leads to two or three .
Someone my size might be able to get away with a couple , but a smaller person might just have to smell 2 donuts and they start to gain the fat back .
In this case , show up with a bar and a bottle of water and just deal with it .
You have a " lunch meeting " and the " lunch " is the giant grease dripping pizzas from the greasiest pizza place in town .
Hmmm ...
Is it your cheat day ?
Then have one or two slices .
If not , be prepared with a healthy sandwich .
How do you know what it will be ?
Ask your administrative assistant who is setting it up , she will tell you .
Again , finally the healthy delis sandwiches have replaced the pizzas here .
Snack days ?
OMG what damage can this do to my waistline ?
Again , the boxes of donuts , trays of pastries , bags of cookies , and the odd assortment of unhealthy , but tempting , snacks permeate these days .
Having a healthy and tasty snack in the fridge or at your desk can help you walk past these .
I have to walk by them or I will get on the " sugar roller coaster " and feel crappy all day .
So what do you do when it 's YOUR TURN ?
Fruit baby , fresh fruit works great .
People love strawberries and grapes and orange slices , etc ...
People who bring this stuff to the office ALWAYS get a big ' thank you ' for it .
Birthday celebration cakes .
It took several years of requests to get the giant birthday cakes replaced with bagels and cream cheese .
While this is still not great , it is better than a sugar coma .
I do n't know about you , but that first donut for me gives me a sugar crash in 30 minutes , so I must keep eating them .
I avoid them for this reason alone .
What about the holiday plethora of junk food ?
Again , self restraint is the key .
You must take some personal responsibility here .
If you want it , have some , but not all of it .
But be prepared to avoid it , because there are no " I just had no other choice " comments allowed after reading this .
No cookie for you , go sit down now .
Pre-workout Supplements
I am adding these as many people workout after they spend the day at the office , and need their pre-workout boost " 30 minutes before hitting the gym " .
I will list the ones I have tried recently that mix quickly in cold water .
Using a small funnel opens this up to the full spectrum of ' tubs . '
Here 's what I like to use , they all mix quickly with little to no clumping , and taste good too :
Muscletech NaNO Vapor
Black China Labs Straight Jacked
SAN Fierce
IDS Muscle Volumizer
For those who prefer the tablets :
NO :
Muscle Asylum Project Altered State
Axis Labs NE2
German American Technologies Nitric Suspension
Creatine :
CEL nCREAse
Axis Labs Creatine Ethyl Ester
Combo Tabs :
CEL Edge NO
Goliath Labs Groloid
Morning Thermogenics
Morning thermogenics serve a few purposes :
Increasing the metabolic rate with some form of stimulant ; curbing the appetite ; adding some form of fat metabolizing agent , and keeping you from doing a mid-morning face - plant into the keyboard .
Thermogenics might make a 10 - 15 % difference if you are doing the other things right .
They WILL NOT make up for lack of consistency with the diet and exercise .
But when looking in the mirror , before heading to the pool , 10 - 15 % can seem like a huge difference in your eyes .
Which ones ?
There are soooo many .
Here are the ones I can personally recommend :
CEL N - Cinerate
Muscletech Hydroxycut Hardcore
PharmaGenX Ventilean LipoGels
Pre-Workout Energy
For those of you who workout after work and do n't use a pre-workout powder with caffeine , here are a few choices for good non-jittery energy :
Fusion Nutrition Fubar
Athletic Edge Nutrition Steel Edge
Sleep
I really think this is one of the most overlooked pieces of the bodybuilding puzzle .
You will not maximize growth without getting the proper amount of rest .
Many of us in office jobs are not able to " leave work AT work " and we may have some troubles drifting off at night .
I recently tried a new supplement for this .
This definitely helped me drift off quicker , with no morning " hangover effect . "
Better sleep = better recovery .
Without this necessary rest , you may be spinning your wheels in the gym .
Fusion Nutrition Shut Eye
Conclusion
I hope this has been helpful and informative .
As many of you already have , do n't hesitate to contact me with questions or suggestions for future articles .
This one is a direct result of numerous requests .
As always , supplements do not TAKE THE PLACE of proper nutrition and getting enough rest .
Just because you are trapped in an office does not mean you still cannot make good nutrition a priority .
By taking some time to plan your eating schedule and doing some upfront work , the office can be almost as good as home , less the TV and recliner chair of course .
Until next time , Lift Big 2 Get Big .

James Tauber of Pinax and Cloud27 James Tauber of Pinax and Cloud27
Pinax was a project conceived by James Tauber not to reinvent the wheel but to understand wheels better .
That 's how he puts it in his talk on the subject and what 's become of what that reinvention was originally called Hotclub and is now Pinax .
The project now provides glue and support for a vast number of what Django developers call " applications " and that allows a single developer to deploy a complete socially - focused web application that they control at every level .
Pinax takes advantage of what James Bennett , author of Practical Django Projects ( Ars review ) , calls the " killer feature " of the Django web framework — reusable applications — to build a complete project .
Many of the applications used in Pinax are derived from the community — Django developers often spin off small , reusable bits of their code base that can be plugged into anyone else 's projects .
The Pinax project aims to take and aggregate these applications which provide small bits of functionality : ratings , polls , user profiles , friend relationships , comments , blogs , micro-updates , projects , tagging , OpenID support , and about 30 others .
These can be mixed and matched together to create any number web applications a developer might want to create .
Tauber came to the idea of bringing together a large number of 3rd- party , community developed Django applications to build a larger project while building a series of community web sites ; first a personal wiki he called Leonardo , Quisition ( an online flash cards website ) , and finally a Harry Potter predictions site .
He began to realize that he was re-writing or re-using many of the same Django applications and began to envision convincing a team of volunteers to help flesh out and develop many of these applications to bolster the entire Django community .
However , Tauber had trouble getting people help to write or maintain those applications and conceived of creating a project that would require many of these peices ;
Tauber uses the following Antoine de Saint Exupéry quote :
If you want to build a ship , do n't drum up the men to gather wood , divide the work and give orders .
Instead , teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea .
The focus of his project then shifted to creating the Pinax project , hoping that a scaffolding for social networks built on these reusable applications which would get much more tender loving care under the goal of creating something larger than the sum of their parts .
This was Memorial Day 2008 and the project has been in high - gear ever since .
The project became so popular that the demonstration site set up to showcase the abilities of the platform became a popular social networking site in its own right ( over 1,000 users actively using it by July , 2008 ) .
The project members are spinning off this site into its own product called Cloud27 which launches today , and other individuals have used the project to launch their own sites : foodsel — a food and fitness tracking site , and Trailmapping — a trail mapping and logging website .
Tauber says that he hopes to convince many more developers looking to build these types of websites to use Pinax ( and Django ) rather than reinvent this particular wheel and is actively soliciting feedback to learn why or why not the platform fits their needs .
Home office design can be hard to pin down because it ’s a place that is meant to be officious yet ergonomic at the same time .
Of course you can have both , but blending these two aspects with respect to functionality can be pretty challenging .
This is where the furniture comes in .
Home office furniture offers a wide variety of selection – each according to style , user - friendliness , aesthetics and pragmatism .
From stylistic to simple and even modular , there are a number of furniture choices that you can make for your home office .
Let ’s take a look at some of these ideas , so you can make a better judgment of what kind of home office furniture you want for your own .
Stylistic
If you ’re going for a typical layout , then the executive desk is one of the major furniture objects that you ’ll be going for .
The trendy desk in this image is a great choice for when you want something stylish , yet still imposing and practical .
The lightly curvy legs , coupled with the simple tabletop give this desk a very modish aesthetic , which pairs quite well with the blue executive chair that it comes with .
If your home office interior design is more on the fashionable and expressive side , then this is the kind of furniture that you should go for .
All - around layouts
If you want to fully utilize the space of your home office because your work requires a lot of storage space and paper work , then this is the kind of furniture that you should opt for .
U - shaped layouts with in - built cabinets and shelves can provide an ample amount of room for all sorts of storage and stationary .
You can customize the design of these shelves according to the kind of aesthetic you ’re going for .
You can also control the size of each shelf so that it will easily accommodate your office files and other paraphernalia .
It ’s one of the most ergonomic home office furniture types that you can go for .
L - shaped layouts
L - shaped home office layouts are usually designed to fully utilize unusable corners , alcoves and crannies .
This kind of an office layout also calls for come customization .
Because most of the furniture is basically in - built , you can easily control the size of shelving , cabinets and drawers according to the kind of work you do .
You can easily maximize the work - surfaces if you ’re a designer , or you can increase the storage if you ’re an accountant .
This kind of office furniture usually works best in homes where the space is short , and instead of an entire home office , you only have a small alcove to work with .
Classy vintage
This is the infamous Jennifer Aniston home office .
The classy vintage look is highly inspiring and stylish .
The oversized furniture is the perfect accompaniment to the studious ambiance of the backdrop .
The huge desk with bent legs acts both in a decorative as well as a functional capacity , while the chair is definitely oversized to emphasize a position of power .
Feminine and empowering all at once , this kind of office furniture is perfect for those who wish to seem imposing and intimidating at once .
Modular choices
Modular home office furniture is another great idea for those who ’re on a budget , but want to have something stylish and pragmatic at the same time .
This office furniture set is very modish yet practical .
The desk has enough storage space to be handy , while the tall units that come with can be used for both decorative as well as functional purposes .
The whole thing is very lightweight , and would make your home office look spacious and delicate .
Moreover , you can easily adjust every part to suit your spatial layout to the fullest .
Ultra-Modern
For those who are inspired by the sleek austerity of modernism , this ultra-modern executive furniture set would be absolutely perfect .
The combination of chrome and slick wood creates a contrasting aesthetic that is complemented by the leather upholstery of the seats .
The whole set looks very officious and intimidating in a cool , elegant way .
The beauty of this kind of home office furniture would definitely be elevated ten - fold within a total contemporary style interior design .
Feature shelving
No home office would ever look complete without proper shelving and storage .
The feature shelving unit in this image is a great example of how you can feature your essentials while still hide some of the important stuff in style .
The whole unit is in - built and can easily be customized according to the size and dimensions of one ’s office space .
Chic and classy
Office chairs are one of the most underrated parts of selecting the furniture .
Most people tend to ignore it in lieu of the desk or cabinets .
However , this beautiful cream colored chair would be the perfect furnishing for a stylish home office .
It ’s plush , comfortable and highly trendy .
The tufted back , coupled with the beautiful upholstery makes for an interesting and intimidating combination .
It ’s the perfect chair to have in a stylish , effeminate home office .
These are some of the most interesting home office furniture designs that you can take inspiration from .
They range a gamut of different genres and categories , and you can select one according to the size of your space , or the kind of interior design you ’re going for .
“ People feel that there ’s something callous , something racially indifferent in saying , ‘ Wait a minute ; we ’ve come a long way , ’ ” said Ms. Thernstrom , a longtime critic of affirmative action who is a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute , a conservative research group .
“ But whether he wins or loses , for a black man to become a standard - bearer for one of the two major parties , it does say something , ” she said .
“ It says that the road we started down in 1965 with the Voting Rights Act has come to an end .
We do n’t need to talk about disfranchisement in the same way anymore . ”
The fortunes of black Americans have certainly improved since the civil rights struggle of the 1960s .
The number of educated , professional blacks has grown as poverty rates have declined .
About 17 percent of blacks held bachelor ’s degrees in 2004 , compared with 5 percent in 1970 , census data shows .
( About 30 percent of whites held bachelor ’s degrees that year . )
In 2005 , college - educated black women who worked full time earned more than their white female counterparts , census data shows .
But significant gaps between blacks and whites remain .
About a quarter of blacks lived below the poverty line in 2006 , compared with 8 percent of whites , census data shows .
The median income of blacks , $ 30,200 , is less than two - thirds that of whites , $ 48,800 .
And studies suggest that employers often favor white job seekers over black applicants , even when their educational backgrounds and work experiences are nearly identical .
Such disparities might explain the differences in opinion that remain between blacks and whites .
In a New York Times / CBS News poll released last month , 53 percent of whites said that blacks and whites had about an equal chance of getting ahead in society .
Only 30 percent of blacks agreed .
Blacks and whites were similarly divided over the state of race relations .
Fifty - five percent of whites said race relations were generally good , compared with 29 percent of blacks .
Nearly 60 percent of blacks said race relations were generally bad .
“ A few of my white friends have asked me , ‘ With Barack achieving all of this , will we be in a position where we can put race aside ? ’ ” said Representative Elijah E. Cummings , Democrat of Maryland , who is a co-chairman of Mr. Obama ’s campaign in that state .
Is climate change the single most threatening environmental crisis facing the world today ?
I do n’t know , but I ’ll tell you what I do know .
In today ’s parlance , and especially in government circles it seems ( witness the government of Ontario , Canada ’s new Add - it - up website ) that climate change is now interchangeable for environment .
And that is a mistake .
On the face of it , the website speaks to the “ Choices we make everyday affect our environment ” .
And the link on the side goes to “ Our Environment ” .
But , once you click , lo and behold , up pops “ what is climate change ? ” .
It ’s only once you start to drive down that you come across ONE link that is not about climate change , and that is about pesticide use .
Why am I being so critical ?
Is this not a good start ?
Sure , why not .
I applaud the effort behind the development of this site and its utility in listing tips and various government incentives for individuals ( obviously the second of limited use to those living outside of Ontario and of no use to those living outside of Canada ) .
What I am worried about , and perhaps so should you , is the willingness of government and media to conflate climate change and the environment .
While climate change dominates headlines , and perhaps has knock - on effects on many other environmental challenges , I question whether or not there are any linkages between solid - waste pollution , oil effluent pollution ( etc. ) and climate change .
However , by linking climate change and the environment in such a tight manner , the media , government , and as a result the general public are forgetting other important environmental challenges .
For example , species loss due to habitat degradation in the Amazon is probably of a more immediate threat than species loss due to climactic change .
Climate change is a challenge , and not one that should be undervalued .
I would just caution that it ’s not the only environmental challenge facing us , nor will it be the last .

Over the last couple days , every newspaper and network in America has disproven Sarah Palin ’s claim that she opposed the Bridge to Nowhere .
Yet just moments ago at a campaign rally in Lebanon , Ohio , she repeated her familiar refrain on the bridge , claiming she told the federal government , “ Thanks , but no thanks . ”
There appears to be no accountability here ; the McCain campaign will trot out Palin to repeat her talking points no matter how many times the press reports that Palin campaigned for governor as a supporter of the bridge and only opposed it when it became obvious the federal government was going to cancel its funding .
Today she went on to say , “ If our state wanted a bridge we would build it ourselves . ”
Palin seemed to be suggesting that she had no interest in federal support for infrastructure projects .
That , too , is not true .
As Kevin has noted , small towns in Alaska never sought federal earmarks until Palin pioneered the tactic , even using an Abramoff - connected lobbyist to get them .
And as governor , Palin continued the trend .
Today , states receive roughly $ 50 per person in earmark funds from the federal government .
Alaska gets a stunning $ 506 per person .
For fiscal year 2009 , Palin has submitted 31 earmark requests totaling $ 197 million .
According to the Seattle Times , that is “ more , per person , than any other state . ”
And , for what it ’s worth , there are a “ road to nowhere ” and a second bridge to nowhere that Palin is decidedly less upset about .
Let ’s be real .
The fact that Sarah Palin is not an anti-pork crusader has been reported .
Repeatedly .
Sarah Palin just seems to be the last to hear the news .
To McCain 's friends and supporters , the humor is a mark of his authenticity .
To his detractors , some of the jokes are offensive and out of touch with contemporary mores .
McCain 's humor often backfires
Ever hear that joke about waterboarding ?
How about the one about killing Iranians ?
And why is Chelsea Clinton so ugly ?
If you are n't familiar with those witty japes , then you 've missed out on John McCain 's lighter side .
Rooted in a time before there was political correctness , and before there was the " South Park " backlash against political correctness , McCain 's wisecracking persona is cutting at times , self - deprecating at others , and always amused by the political process swirling around him .
Even in his pursuit of the White House , the candidate has — sometimes to the dismay of his handlers — managed to keep his sense of humor .
Advertisement
As he campaigns through the densest media thicket in American history , it 's become clear that McCain has n't acquired the layer of polish that produced , for instance , Ronald Reagan 's gentle , oft - repeated jokes and Bill Clinton 's colorful , folksy yarns .
McCain 's humor , by contrast , makes him the political counterpart of the radio host Don Imus ( whom he has defended ) :
It 's sharp , unrehearsed and , at times , way , way over the line .
This cycle , he 's drawn winces , and worse , for everything from a joking reference to domestic violence to a now - notorious little ditty about bombing Iran .
Earlier in his political career , the Arizona press reported that he'd cracked a rape joke that would now probably end any politician 's career , a joke his aides then and now say he does n't recall making .
To McCain 's friends and supporters , the humor is a mark of his authenticity .
To his detractors , some of the jokes are offensive and out of touch with contemporary mores .
What 's undeniable , though , is that the humor , with its political risks and , to some , its charm , is intrinsic to John McCain .
He is a man of a certain generation , with a machismo forged from his experience as a Navy pilot and an aviator , a candidate who is more comfortable in his own skin than with a teleprompter .
" If you know the difference between a Navy and an Air Force pilot , you get some of this — he 's a Navy pilot , " said former Nebraska Sen.
Bob Kerrey .
" He has a healthy irreverence for the stuffy , politically correct , ' You ca n't say that , You ca n't say that . ' "
Irreverence in the abstract is one thing .
But McCain 's specific jokes can be harder for some to stomach .
Liberal bloggers have recently revived what is by far the most offensive of McCain 's reported jokes , one that his aides say he does n't recall telling , but which was reported in the Tucson Citizen , an Arizona paper , during his 1986 Senate campaign :
" Did you hear the one about the woman who is attacked on the street by a gorilla , beaten senseless , raped repeatedly and left to die ?
When she finally regains consciousness and tries to speak , her doctor leans over to hear her sigh contently and to feebly ask , ' Where is that marvelous ape ? ' "
His spokeswoman said at the time he did n't recall telling the joke , something his current spokesman , Brian Rogers , reiterated to Politico .
The president of the National Organization for Women , Kim Gandy , however , suggested that a series of McCain jokes about women , the rest uncontested by the campaign , suggest a serious lack of respect .
" Some people can't tell the difference between a joke that is really off color and one that is off - the - charts offensive , and clearly some of John McCain 's ' jokes ' fall into that category , " she said .
Outside the contested rape joke , the most notorious of McCain 's gags about women 's looks came in 1998 , when Chelsea Clinton was 18 .
" Why is Chelsea Clinton so ugly ? " he asked guests at a Senate Republican fundraiser .
" Because her father is Janet Reno . "
McCain 's other jokes do n't induce cringes quite as widespread , but Gandy said they were still likely to alienate women .
" The French remind me a little bit of an aging actress of the 1940s who is still trying to dine out on her looks but does n't have the face for it , " McCain told Fox News a few years ago .
And earlier this year , McCain responded to a question with the line , " And I stopped beating my wife just a couple of weeks ago , " provoking a round of tut - tutting for his reference to the old classic example of a leading question .
Women are far from his only target .
Another favorite has been the elderly .
He has recalled groveling for forgiveness when , during his 1986 campaign , he referred to a retirement community called " Leisure World " as " Seizure World . "
In 1999 , in the course of apologizing for his joke about Clinton — which he called " insensitive and stupid and cruel " — he recalled for reporters another bad joke : '' I said , ' The nice thing about Alzheimer 's is you get to hide your own Easter eggs . ' "
( Earlier in the 2008 campaign season , he reworked that joke to make himself the target . )
McCain has n't toned down the jokes , which often play better with the audiences at his town halls than when snipped out and recycled on YouTube , as was the case in an incident in which he — in jest — referred to a young man who asked about his age as " you little jerk , " before telling him , " You 're drafted . "
McCain 's political allies also sometimes feel the sting .
He has jokingly threatened staffers with waterboarding ( a practice he condemns as torture ) .
After former Texas Sen. Phil Gramm , a close McCain adviser , dismissed talk of a bad economy as mere psychology , McCain told reporters he planned to make Gramm — who had been seen as a prospective Treasury secretary — ambassador to Belarus .
McCain was also recently condemned by the government of Iran for suggesting that increasing U.S. cigarette sales to Iran could be " a way of killing 'em . "
" We condemn such jokes and believe them to be inappropriate for a U.S. presidential candidate , " said Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Ali Hosseini .
" It is most evident that jokes about genocide will not be tolerated by Iranians or Americans . "
Iranian criticism , though , is more or less a badge of honor for presidential candidates of both parties .
And McCain spokesman Brian Rogers said McCain 's humor is , more broadly , central to his appeal .
" He 's long said that he 's said and done things in the past that he regrets , " Rogers said .
" You 've just got to move on and be yourself — that 's what people want .
They want somebody who 's authentic , and this kind of stuff is a good example of McCain being McCain . "
( Rogers excluded the alleged rape joke from that characterization . )
But while voters say they want authenticity , McCain 's campaign may test how much of his raw humor Americans can take .
" The world has changed , " former Sen. Kerrey said .
" It 's a lot harder to tell jokes than it used to be . "

Bob Woodward ’s newest book “ the War within ” which he reveals in it how the Bush administration has administrated the war in Iraq and in it he talks about a US secret program to counter the Iraqi insrugency .
Woodward told CNN ’s Larry king , earlier this week , that he has obtained secret information on the workings of US military in Iraq that enabled the US forces to stem the tide of violence and al - Qaeda terrorism in Iraq .
Though it looks like it is a super secret as to what kind of program the US forces had developed to counter the military - style attacks in Iraq against its forces , but this supposed super secret is not quite that big of a secret after all .
It was reported in the US and British press as far back as 2003 that the US forces is using the Israeli Army tactics and Israeli advisers for training and consultations to counter the insurgency in Iraq .
In a 2003 article titled ” Israel trains US assassination squads in Iraq ” the British newspaper the Guardian Reported that ” The Israeli defense Force ( IDF ) has send urban warfare specialists to Fort Bragg in North Carolina , the home of US special forces , and according to two sources , Israeli military “ consultants ” have also visited Iraq ”
Israel has developed urban warfare tactics due its decades long occupation of Palestinian lands and its tight control over the population .
Israel has been killing off the leadership of Palestinian resistance and organizations leaders through its “ Arabaized units ” known as Dovdovan ” in Hebrew who operate by infiltrating and blending in with the local population as well as dress in Arab clothes and speak fluent Arabic in order to assassinate Palestinian leaders .
The Israeli tactics however are illegal under international law because the Israeli presence in the Palestinian territories is also illegal .
Moreover , Israel was successful in its assassination program in part due to its use of huge network =2 0 of spies and informants to pinpoint Palestinian members of organizations Israel deems terrorist and deals them a fatal blow .
Though Israel has mastered this technique but it is far from subduing the Palestinians and eradicating their resistance to its occupation .
Elaborating on the Israeli connection in Iraq , the Guardian reported “ This is basically an assassination program .
That is what is being conceptualized here .
This is a hunter killer team ” said a former senior US intelligence official .
Israeli presence in Iraq well documented in the press .
Israel maintains a well established relations with Kurds in northern Iraq and it has set up shop to operate its intelligence network with the Kurdish and Iraqi leaders to spy on Iran and the Iraqi leadership as it was widely reported by the New Yorker Magazine reporter Seymour Hersh .
Hersh was perhaps the first western journalist to report on the assignation teams set up in Iraq by the US military with the help of Israeli army personal in Iraq and in the US in a well known piece in the New Yorker magazine titled “ Moving Targets ” in December of 2003 .
This ‘ assassination teams ” strategy , almost an exact copy of Israel ’s assignation campaigns against Palestinians , was formulated during former defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld who through his under secretary of defense for Intelligence Stephen Cambone , has been deeply involved in developing the new special forces approach wrote Hersh in 2003 in the New Yorker .
Though it remains to be a well guarded secret as to how this program works but it appears to be working in reducing and in some cases stemming violence in vast regions of Iraq .
And if we take into consideration that this program has succeeded in its goals , for the time being , especially in combination of other factors such as the decision of young shia leader Muqtada Sadr to freeze his Mahdi Army military confrontation with the US and Iraqi forces , and the decision of the Sunni tribes in al - Anbar to abandon Al - Qiada who shot itself in the foot by adopting harsh tactics and inflaming the secretion passions with it indiscriminate suicide bombing campaigns against shia and Sunni populations centers .
Another key player in this secretive program is General William ” Jerry ” Boykin a controversial General with fanatical anti-Muslim hatred and who had made some inflammatory remarks against the religion of Islam and Muslims .
General Boykin remarked in 2003 to an evangelical group meeting about his experience in Somalia in the nineties that he worships the true God while his enemies , in Somalia , the Muslims =2 0worship “ False God ”
Boykin is a well know neocon whose world is black and white , a world raging with battles between good and evil as he sees it .
In June of 2003 , Boykin repeatedly equated the Muslim world with Satan in an interview with the Oregonian newspaper
He remarked : “ Satan wants to destroy this nation , he wants to destroy us as a nation , and he wants to destroy us as a Christian Army . ”

An Anonymous protester against the Co$ cult is in need of your help .
He is one of those IRL protesters - the people with masks on the street , part of the ' New Anonymous ' - that I have long dismissed and made snide remarks about on this site .
His name is Gregg , he has been fair gamed by the Co$ , and is currently entangled in legal proceedings started by the cult with the intent of ruining his life for daring to make a stand .
If the time has come for us to collectively say ' GO GO GO !' and help someone in need , the time is now .
I am expecting all of you to start scratching your heads right about this point .
After all I 've said here about how absurd ' New Anonymous ' is and why I think it is an epic failure , this calls for an explanation .
I stand by what I previously posted .
I also still think that although the first protest was a win , having protests each month while wearing masks and spouting relatively obscure internet memes on the street is n't going to do much in terms of helping people trapped in the cult or bringing down the cult .
Some things are better kept on the internet , and a lot of people who consider themselves part of ' New Anonymous ' ( the ' newfags ' , ' protestfags ' , ' moralfags ' , etc ) do n't seem to realize that using these memes IRL among the diversity of the general population only causes confusion and makes them a laughing stock .
More seriously , remember the Magoogate incident where Tory Magoo flipped out over the Thunderdome in Enturbulation and lots of BAWWWWWing and butthurt were to be had ?
I do lurk on Enturbulation to see what the ' protestfags ' are up to even while moderating a Chan on the next tab .
( You are allowed to have lulz at my expense after this revelation , of course . )
Side note for the ' New Anons ' :
That is what happens when you try to co-opt a culture ( sometimes without actually bothering to learn the true origins of the culture ) and try to deny those origins for PR purposes .
Does n't hiding parts of your movement that you think would seem undesirable to the general population remind you of Scientology ?
The irony !
tl ; dr version : I love the idea behind the Anonymous movement to death but I am not a fan of Project Chanology .
That is all .
Simple , to the point ... and without the drama .
Now that all of the above is out of the way and to make a long story short , I was contacted by a few Anons who alerted me to Gregg 's case .
As Rebecca at Skepchick was also notified , go over there and read her post about the case before reading on .
He needs your help because we are not going to let the cult get away with this .
The cult tried suppressing information on the internet , and the internet responded by leaking their secret documents all over the series of tubes .
Now , they are trying to suppress free speech - and we must not let them get away with it .
If the Old Anon tactics did it for the Scilons on the internet , New Anon could do it in real life , because nobody should be intimidated out of speaking their minds .
How would you feel if it was an atheist protest against religious bigotry when this happened ?
How would you react ?
Why should we shut the fuck up just because someone yells ' lawsuit ' ?
How could we let the false charges and obvious injustice in this case slide just like that ?
Has n't Mary the Scilon calling the FBI on me given you a glimpse of how low the Scilons are willing to sink ?
If you think that I am merely trolling by posting this , let me show you otherwise .
Here is a link to Enturbulation - something I have refused to do for a very long time although I have been asked by countless ' protestfags ' .
As much as the ' moralfaggotry ' , ' leaderfaggotry ' , and anti-lulz drama at Enturbulation pisses me off , as much as I realize that I could never fully agree with ' New Anonymous ' , for all the lulz I have had at the ' newfags ' , and as much as I think that Chanology should be left to die a natural death , the time has come for me to set my personal feelings aside to help a fellow human being who deserves all the help he can get .
I could never consider myself an Enturb supporter , but I do consider myself a humanist .
To help out : Gregg accepts PayPal at greggatghc [ a ] gmail [ dot ] com
At the very least , send him a supportive e-mail and let him know that there are those of us who care , and also to remind him that Anonymous is Legion he is not alone in this fight .
He mentioned that he also appreciates just hearing from people , and as I know a lot of readers of this blog are familiar with the Anon culture and know where he is coming from , please , send him some encouragement .
Also , do your best to spread the word .
Tell everyone you know .
Stumble it .
Digg it .
Repost this on your blog and submit your blog instead if you think that this is an act of self - promotion on my part .
Do whatever it takes to get the word out .
He deserves nothing less .
Remember , for the lulz and for great justice .
DO IT .

NASA ’s Phoenix Mars Lander has a fork - like conductivity probe on it ’s robotic arm , and results from the instrument are presenting a bit of a quandary for mission scientists .
The thermal and electroconductivity probe has sensed humidity rising and falling in the air the near the lander , but when stuck into the ground , its measurements so far indicate soil that is thoroughly and perplexingly dry .
“ If you have water vapor in the air , every surface exposed to that air will have water molecules adhere to it that are somewhat mobile , even at temperatures well below freezing , ” said Aaron Zent , lead scientist for the probe .
While Phoenix has other tools to find clues about whether water ice at the site has melted in the past , the conductivity probe is the main tool for checking for present - day soil moisture .
Preliminary results from the latest insertion of the probe ’s four needles into the ground , on Wednesday and Thursday , match results from the three similar insertions in the three months since landing .
“ All the measurements we ’ve made so far are consistent with extremely dry soil , ” Zent said .
“ There are no indications of thin films of moisture , and this is puzzling . ”
In below - freezing permafrost terrains on Earth , that thin layer of unfrozen water molecules on soil particles can grow thick enough to support microbial life .
One goal for building the conductivity probe and sending it to Mars has been to see whether the permafrost terrain of the Martian arctic has detectable thin films of unfrozen water on soil particles .
By gauging how electricity moves through the soil from one prong to another , the probe can detect films of water barely more than one molecule thick .
Three other sets of observations by Phoenix , in addition to the terrestrial permafrost analogy , give reasons for expecting to find thin - film moisture in the soil .
One is the conductivity probe ’s own measurements of relative humidity when the probe is held up in the air .
“ The relative humidity transitions from near zero to near 100 percent with every day - night cycle , which suggests there ’s a lot of moisture moving in and out of the soil , ” Zent said .
Another is Phoenix ’s confirmation of a hard layer containing water - ice about 5 centimeters ( 2 inches ) or so beneath the surface .
Also , handling the site ’s soil with the scoop on Phoenix ’s robotic arm and observing the disturbed soil show that it has clumping cohesiveness when first scooped up and that this cohesiveness decreases after the scooped soil sits exposed to air for a day or two .
One possible explanation for those observations could be thin - film moisture in the ground .
The Phoenix team is laying plans for a variation on the experiment of inserting the conductivity probe into the soil .
The four successful insertions so far have all been into an undisturbed soil surface .
The planned variation is to scoop away some soil first , so the inserted needles will reach closer to the subsurface ice layer .
“ There should be some amount of unfrozen water attached to the surface of soil particles above the ice , ” Zent said .
“ It may be too little to detect , but we have n’t finished looking yet . ”

Q I was an embarrassed and deserving recipient of a ticket on July 1 , the first day of the new hands - free cell phone law .
My phone rang and I picked it up – duh .
The courteous Redwood City police officer who pulled me over said it was $ 20 for a first - time violation .
He told me : “ Spread the word .
We will be enforcing this new law . ”
Um , yeah .
So I ’m spreading the word by writing you .
My copy of the ticket had no indication of how much to pay , and a clerk informed me that the total for my supposedly $ 20 ticket was really $ 92.50 !
I thought for sure I had misheard her , but she assured me the extra fees are for processing and other charges .
I paid , but sheesh .
What ’s the deal ?
Even more embarrassing : I had a hands - free device when I got the ticket – safely tucked in a drawer .
Double duh .
Wendy Ellis
Woodside
A Ouch , but I warned you .
The base fine is $ 20 , but fees , etc. , run the price up to nearly $ 100 for the first offense .
A second ticket will cost around $ 190 .
Q What is the breakdown on the total fees for violating the handheld cell phone law ?
My niece seems to think it ’s a flat $ 20 for the ticket , and I say its higher .
Donna Pantaleoni
Mountain View
A Here is the breakdown for a cell phone citation based on fees in Santa Clara County and in San Jose .
Fees vary slightly from county to county .
• Base fine : $ 20 .
• State penalty : $ 20 .
• State courthouse security fee : $ 20 .
• County penalty : $ 14 .
• County prior search fee : $ 10 .
• State court construction fund : $ 7 .
• State criminal penalty surcharge : $ 4 .
• Proposition 69 DNA sampling : $ 2 .
• Total cost : $ 97 .
Q The Highway 101 exit onto Woodside Road west is clogged practically all day , as there are no other alternative exits to take into Redwood City from 101 after Whipple .
So why ca n’t Walnut Street be an exit ?
The shopping center and hospital are right there .
What about Douglas Avenue a bit east of Woodside Road ?
That is a large neighborhood to not have on - ramps between 84 and Marsh .
Also , would n’t it relieve traffic if there were a bridge between Foster City and Redwood Shores ?
Foster City Boulevard could hook up with Shearwater Parkway , and people would n’t have to jump on 101 at one of its most congested points to go about three miles .
Joe Davis
Sunnyvale
A A redesign of the Woodside Road - 101 interchange is under way , but it ’s difficult to come up with a design that is affordable and wo n’t close a bunch of local roads that feed into this interchange .
This much I know :
No additional exits are being considered .
Q Did n’t someone write recently about an uneven area on Highway 87 near the Santa Clara Street exit ?
It ’s still there , and my car about falls apart every time I hit it .
I have even taken to driving on city streets to avoid it .
Help !

This is how .
Caltrans wo n’t have a grinder available until the middle of September because there is no budget .
A trench was laid across the road during construction and refilled with asphalt that has pushed up on one side , giving you a bumpy ride .
Q I got a grin out of a recent column about gas prices .
If Anita Goldwasser thinks that $ 3.99 for a gallon is cheap , she has been totally brainwashed by the oil companies .

A Judging by the number of comments I ’m getting about similar prices in Stockton , Tracy and other cities , a lot of drives agree with Anita : Anything under $ 4 seems cheap .
Q There ’s a solution to the GPS window mount problem : a friction mount .
It resembles a 7 - inch square bean bag , is weighted and has a sticky bottom .
A heavy plastic plate is riveted to the middle of the bag .
You attach the suction cup mount here , then place the whole thing on the dash .
It can be moved from car to car and is easily removed out of sight .
I got it at Fry ’s Electronics for less than $ 15 .
Tony Lum
A Gracias .
The problem is that thieves can make off with GPS devices if they see you have one attached to your windshield .
This may ease that problem .
Meanwhile , a bill appears headed to Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger ’s desk to make it legal to mount this device on your window .

Specifications of course include a VIA 1.6GHz C7 - M processor and VX800 M chipset , with a wealth of wireless modules including WiFi / Bluetooth , AGPS , WiMAX , EV - DO , HSDPA and WCDMA all possible .
The OpenBook weighs 1Kg and measures 240 x 175 x 36.2 mm with a 1024 x 600 pixel 8.9in screen , up to 2GB DDR2 RAM , a 2 MP camera , memory card reader and a 4 cell battery giving 3 hours battery life .
The VX800 M chipset is also new from VIA , and is the first to support both the C7 - M and their forthcoming Isaiah processor , perhaps suggesting future OpenBooks will get a speed bump .
The VX800 M also supports MPEG - 2 , MPEG - 4 , VC1 and DivX video decoding acceleration - however support for acceleration features on previous VIA chipsets has been weak , so we 'll cross our fingers and reserve judgement until we actually test a VX800 M based system .

As San Francisco 's juvenile justice system shielded young illegal immigrant felons from possible deportation , Mayor Gavin Newsom 's office gave grants totaling more than $ 650,000 to nonprofit agencies to provide the underage offenders with free services - everything from immigration attorneys to housing assistance to " arts and cultural affirmation activities , " city records show .
Newsom has said the city began its policy of not referring young immigrant offenders to federal authorities for deportation under previous mayors , and that he reversed the practice after he became aware of it this year .
However , in 2006 , the Mayor 's Office of Criminal Justice - a community outreach arm of Newsom 's office - created a grant program specifically designed to assist , rather than deport , " undocumented , unaccompanied and monolingual " immigrants who were in the custody of the city 's Juvenile Probation Department or on juvenile probation , according to city documents .
The city provided $ 467,000 to three nonprofit agencies under the grant program from mid-2006 and mid-2008 , records show , and another $ 200,000 was approved for two of the agencies for this budget year .
Newsom 's office created the program , in part , to deal with an influx of Central American youths being housed on drug charges at San Francisco 's juvenile hall , according to those familiar with the grant .
Crowding at juvenile hall had led to protests among youth advocate groups .
" A key goal of this project is to assist these individuals to successfully navigate the juvenile justice system and achieve stability within the community setting , " according to a 2006 invitation issued by Newsom 's office for agencies to bid for grant money .
The grant language said the youths " require extensive support " to overcome " multiple complex barriers " in the justice system .
Money for the effort came from the pot of discretionary funding that the mayor 's office receives each year as part of the city budget .
' Proud tradition '
The goal of the grant program , according to the request for bids , was to further the city 's " proud tradition as a haven for immigrants . "
In addition to immigration attorneys , Newsom 's office envisioned the program helping young felons obtain housing , food , clothing , educational and vocational training , English - language instruction , medical care and mental health assessments .
The program would also provide " spiritual , cultural enrichment and recreation activities . "
Joseph Russoniello , the U.S. attorney for the northern district of California and a critic of San Francisco 's past policy of not turning over undocumented juvenile immigrant felons for deportation , said the mayor 's office was funding programs that might be violating federal law .
" What it means to me , " he said , " is they took the concept of sanctuary , and they applied it in a way that it is as close to harboring as I 've ever seen . "
Federal law bars people from knowingly harboring undocumented immigrants .
Russoniello said the city grant program relied on young immigrant offenders staying in the juvenile justice system , away from federal authorities who might want to deport them .
" Then , they accommodate them by providing all these services to continue their unlawful status , " he said .
" The city , in this case , is using taxpayer dollars to basically endear itself to activist groups that need funding for their activities . "
When the program was created in 2006 , the head of the Mayor 's Office of Criminal Justice was Allen Nance .
He is now the No. 2 official in the Juvenile Probation Department , which is responsible for housing underage offenders and advising Juvenile Court justices on how their cases should be handled .
In an interview , Nance denied that providing services to juvenile illegal immigrant offenders was helping to shield them from deportation .
" That was simply not what the grant was , " he said .
He said some of the youths were victims of abuse , abandonment or neglect , were seeking legal status refuge in the United States and should be able to do that through the immigration courts .
That was the reason for providing them with legal help , he said .
Crime - fighting tool
Nance said the effort was also part of a " local action plan " to reduce juvenile crime .
" We needed to work to correct those problems involving juvenile delinquency , " he said .
" We needed to find ways to intervene early on . "
Nance said the idea was to help immigrant youths who could n't speak English , were n't living with parents and were committing crimes , to find " services to deal with the challenges they were facing . "
" All kids face , as adolescents , making bad decisions at times , " Nance said .
" The goal of the program was ... to correct any signs of delinquent behavior and afford youth an opportunity to continue to live a crime - free life , which is our expectation of any youth . "
Kevin Ryan , Russoniello 's predecessor at the U.S. attorney 's office and now the head of the Mayor 's Office of Criminal Justice , declined to respond to Russoniello 's suggestion that the city was violating federal law .
" I 'm taking a look at this , " he said , " and not going to comment on any particular accusation .
I 'm aware of the harboring statute .
I 'm just taking a look at it . "
' Top to bottom ' review
" If the law is not being followed , we will fix the problem , " said Nathan Ballard , Newsom 's spokesman , adding that the mayor has told Ryan to conduct a " top to bottom " review of the city 's sanctuary policies and practices .
Ryan said he will decide " whether we should change our practices going forward . "
The grant proposal was suggested by David Onek , then the second - in - command of the Mayor 's Office of Criminal Justice .
Newsom recently named him to the Police Commission .
From 1999 to 2002 , before joining the mayor 's office , Onek was a staff attorney for Legal Services for Children - one of the agencies that the mayor 's office later selected to receive grant money .
The nonprofit took in more than $ 164,000 in city money from 2006 to 2008 to help illegal immigrants in the juvenile justice system , city records show .
Onek declined to comment last week , noting that he no longer works for the mayor 's office .
Legal aid for migrant kids
Legal Services for Children advised a total of 52 youths in San Francisco 's juvenile justice system about their immigration status and legal rights , said the center 's executive director , Shannan Wilber .
Wilber said that of the 52 immigrants , 25 were ultimately provided immigration attorneys free of charge .
Of those , seven have obtained legal status in the United States , seven dropped out of the program and the immigration cases for 11 are still pending , she said .
Wilber said the offenders ' efforts to seek legal status in immigration court would be jeopardized if they were forced into detention hearings , where the burden is on them to show why they should not be deported .
She said the juveniles also need legal help in the immigration court system , because many of them have been brought to this country by drug traffickers they are reluctant to identify for fear of retaliation .
Another agency that received funding from the mayor 's office , Mission Neighborhood Centers , used the $ 150,000 it received from 2006 to 2008 for what it described as " case intervention " for immigrant felons being held at juvenile hall .
" These youth need assistance in housing , education , job placement and immigration status , " the group said in its grant statement .
It said it would locate eligible offenders through " street outreach " and work with the public defender 's office .
The staffer listed as the contact on the group 's grant application , Tracy Gallardo - Brown , now works as a community builder for the city 's Department of Children , Youth and Their Families .
She did not return calls seeking comment .
Santiago Ruiz , executive director of Mission Neighborhood Centers , said he expects an additional $ 100,000 from the Mayor 's Office of Community Investment , formerly the Office of Community Development , this year under the grant .
He said his group has been working to get high school equivalency diplomas for former gang members as well as immigrants .
" They are at - risk individuals - most likely they are recent immigrants , " Ruiz said .
" Whether they are here legally , we are not even supposed to ask .
The idea is not to discourage people immediately about their status . "
He said the agency does not help youths convicted of violent crimes .
" These are behavioral issues that are beyond our ability to provide services , " Ruiz said .
Another grant recipient , the Mission - based Instituto Familiar de la Raza , obtained $ 143,000 over two years and is due for another $ 100,000 this year .
The group 's director , Estela Garcia , did not return calls seeking comment .
Range of activities
According to its grant statement , the agency uses the money for a case management program for immigrant youths in the juvenile justice system to provide " a wide range of activities including informational workshops , assistance with accessing referrals to educational and vocational placement , immigration information and mental health services . "
" Youth receiving services have the opportunity to enroll into our arts and cultural affirmation activities , " the group said .
The grant program was not without controversy , even among other nonprofits .
When the mayor 's office started the effort , a coalition of 20 nonprofit agencies called the Juvenile Justice Providers Association filed a request with the mayor 's office to review the bidding process , said Jessica Hazard al - Tawqi , then the head of the coalition .
Al - Tawqi , who now works as a program officer for the Department of Children , Youth and Their Families , would not say what her concerns had been , other than they were not about the goals of the program .
" It was a lot of money , " she said , " for a lot of services . "
Newsom 's office has renewed the grant program for another year , but with a twist .
In June , the city awarded Mission Neighborhood Centers and Instituto Familiar de la Raza $ 100,000 each to continue the efforts they began in 2006 .
However , in the grant program 's title , Newsom 's office has removed the reference to " undocumented " immigrants .

Callpod ’s Amusing Dragon Specifications
Lee Phillips
A company called Callpod , Inc. is offering a handful of genuinely slick and useful accessories for your computer or cellphone .
One of these , the Dragon™ bluetooth headset , was recently praised by David Pogue in his New York Times technology column .
Of course , bluetooth headsets have been around for a while , but this one is distinguished by being very small , having extremely long battery life , and other features , including the ability to communicate as a walkie - talkie with others of its kind in nearby ears .
Looking around the page for enlightenment , I find “ In open areas , testing has showed [ sic ] that effective two - way communication was achieved in excess of 450 feet . ”
The context ( this is in the FAQ tab ) shows that they are again discussing walkie - talkie operation .
Well , 450 feet means an area of 636,000 square feet .
Surely the marketing people are being overly cautious .
No , I do n’t think that ’s it .
I think that they rounded up to 500 feet and squared it .
Do n’t you ?
The marketing people have missed an opportunity for much bigger numbers .
I ’m not talking about a paltry 636,000 .
What might happen if someone explained to them that two people , communicating with the aid of $ 100 devices inserted in their ears ( available in three styles , all out of stock ) are not limited to a two - dimensional surface ?
What if one of them is allowed to climb a hill ?
We ’re talking 524 million cubic feet here !
I need to get in to marketing .
Clearly , I can do much better than these guys .
Sarah Palin is likely to be our next Vice President of the United States … president , too if McCain kicks the bucket in office .

Characterized as “ cut , kill , dig and drill ” …
1. Sarah Palin is against classifying the polar bear as a threatened species .
2. Sarah Palin argues the Bush administration does n’t use the best science .
3. Sarah Palin does n’t agree with federal marine scientists who say under the Endangered Species act that the Cook Inlet beluga whale needs protection .
4. Sarah Palin does n’t have a problem with shooting wolves from the air to boost caribou and moose herds for hunters .
5. Sarah Palin is not convinced that global warming is the result of human activity .
6. Sarah Palin opposes increased protection of salmon streams from mining operations .
7. Sarah Palin is a hockey mom who can handle a gun , dress a moose and do commercial fishing .
8. Sarah Palin says those in the 48 States do n’t understand the North Country .
CA Rep Miller “ does n’t understand rural Alaska , does n’t comprehend wildlife management in the North , and does n’t appreciate the Tenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution that gives states the right to manage their own affairs , ” Palin said in a press release a year ago .
Let ’s see … who do we listen to ?
Someone who lives there or someone from CA who is far removed ?

A lot of people do n't know how easy it is to use setuptools to create shell scripts .
I did n't know how to use it properly until a couple of weeks ago ; since discovering how , I 've taken to repackaging all my Python scripts into an egg .
Here 's how I was doing it before .
I had modified PYTHONPATH to include ~ / lib / python , and PATH to include ~ / bin ; this is where I would put scripts and modules I 'd written .
Since my home directory is checked into my Subversion repository , I could access these new scripts on remote boxes by making a user and checking them out .
This works fine , except for a few things .
First , the scripts are n't usable by other users without their checking out my home directory .
Second , modifying paths can be tricky .
Third , it 's a hassle setting everything up .
Fourth , managing dependencies boils down to trusting that my home directory will be set up in the right way .
Finally , using environment variables limits the use of the scripts to my own environment .
Enter setuptools .
If I package my scripts up into eggs , I can install them as root and make them available to everyone , other users can install the egg in whatever way they see fit , and setuptools can handle all the dependencies and PYTHONPATH hackery for me .
Once I learned that setuptools will actually create shell scripts for me pointing at functions I specify and install them in the correct place on the system , I was totally sold .
This pattern was so useful for me that I even wrote and released a package making it easier .
Here 's how I do it .
Normally , I package related shell scripts together .
In this example , we 'll make an egg that installs a single shell script , which does nothing but return the titles of the HTML documents at the URLs passed in .
I assure you that I recognize the total lack of utility this script provides .
Create the egg structure .
I used to do this by hand until I discovered a utility that does it for me .
Install PasteScript :
$ sudo easy_install PasteScript
PasteScript provides the command paster , which , among other things , will create an empty egg for you to modify .
Make that egg now :
$ paster create -t basic_package TitleGetter
It 'll ask you a bunch of question that you can answer or not at your discretion .
You can always change them later , and unless you 're going to be releasing this to the world they 're unncessary .
At the end , you 'll have a directory with an egg structure inside !
Write the code .
Naturally , this is the part you 'll care about most once you 've got the process down .
For now , it 's irrelevant .
Here 's some code that gets a web page and pulls out a title :
import re , urllib2
pattern = re.compile ( r ' < title [ ^ <> ]*>(.*)</ title >' , re.I|re.S )
def print_titles ( * urls ) :
for url in urls :
html = urllib2.urlopen(url ).read ( )
match = pattern.search ( html )
if match :
title = match.groups ( ) [ 0 ]
else :
title = " ** Could not find a < title > **"
print url , ' \t ' , title
Inside your egg is a directory called " titlegetter " , and inside that is where you put your code .
Make a file in there called titles .py and paste the above code into it .
Test the code .
Normally , I write unit tests before writing the code , placing them in a tests directory inside the package .
That 's up to you .
Some people do n't write tests .
setuptools does allow you to run tests on an egg easily .
I use nosetests , which you can install with :
$ sudo easy_install nose
You can then run them by going to the egg 's top directory , where setup.py is , and running :
$ python setup.py nosetests
That 'll build the egg in place and run the tests .
Right now , though , we 'll just test it manually .
Install a development version of the egg :
$ sudo python setup.py develop
Now test your function :
$ python
>>> from titlegetter .
titles import print_titles
>>> print_titles ( ' http://www.google.com')
http://www.google.com
Google
Have setup.py create a shell script .
This is the key bit of utility setuptools provides .
Open up setup.py and find the entry_points definition .
Change it to look like this :
...
entry_points={
" console_scripts " : [
' gettitle = titlegetter.titles : print_titles '
]} ,
...
Now re-install the code with sudo python setup.py develop .
setuptools will create a script called gettitle and install it somewhere on your PATH ; that script will call titlegetter.titles.print_titles .
Try it out :
$ gettitle http://www.google.com
http://www.yahoo.com
$
Notice nothing is printed out .
Why not ?
Well , the script that setuptools creates does n't do any argument parsing or anything , it just calls the function with no arguments .
This makes sense , actually ; if you 're doing something fancy with args , you do n't want to have to override the setuptools mechanism .
On the other hand , for really simple scripts , you have to plop in a bunch of sys.argv parsing overhead .
Luckily , I wrote a decorator that handles this for you .
Add cliutils as a dependency by including the string in the install_requires definition in setup.py :
...
install_requires = [ ' cliutils ' ] ,
...
Then go down into titles .py and add the decorator :
...
from cliutils import cliargs
@cliargs
def print_titles ( * urls ) :
...
That decorator will parse the command line arguments into args and keyword args and pass the result into the decorated function .
Now that that 's done , re-install your development egg with sudo python setup.py develop .
You 'll see that cliutils is downloaded and installed .
Now try your script again :
$ gettitle http://www.google.com
http://www.yahoo.com
http://www.google.com
Google
http://www.yahoo.com
Yahoo !
And just like that , you 've got a portable command - line utility .
Check it in somewhere .
If you want to build an actual egg , you can just do the usual setuptools thing and run :
$ python setup.py bdist_egg
Which will build and egg and dump it in the dist directory .
So that 's that .
I have two or three eggs that I keep modifying and updating with new functions .
Ones that have the same dependencies or are generally related I put all in one egg , but organization is up to you .
That cliutils package has a few other good things in it ; read its documentation for more info .

It ’s widely known that John McCain has a very bad temper .
For the GOP , this is going to be a big problem between now and November .
According to Jonathan Martin , who closely monitors the GOP for the Politico , the general election campaign is already getting to McCain — and it ’s barely just begun .
Martin ’s article describes McCain ’s growing frustration with the media ( yes , the media which once fawned all over him ) and McCain ’s use of “ stinging attacks ” on Obama .
But , the best line appears under McCain ’s photo :
It ’s not clear that John McCain can contain his temper while battling both Barack Obama and the press .
Yes , the GOP has a big problem with its candidate .
This means only one thing :
The Republican attack machine is going to be in overdrive and get more ugly than ever .
As Jed reports , the smear attack against Obama have already started on McCain ’s website .
Now , this election should be about the important issues facing our nation .
It should be .
But , since every issue across the spectrum works against McCain and the Republicans , we better be prepared for a full - scale assault of lies and fear - mongering .
This time , we ’re prepared to fight back — hard .
There ’s plenty of material available on John McCain and his not so perfect past that most Americans do n’t know yet — but will .
( And , yes , that includes Cindy McCain , too . )
In the meantime , it does seem only a matter of time before the American people see for themselves just how nasty and unhinged McCain is .
He just ca n’t control himself .
Left Behind Authors Speak Out on McCain Ad ' The One ' Contact : Beverly Rykerd , 719-481-0537 , Beverly@rykerd.com CAROL STREAM , Ill. , Aug. 8 / Christian Newswire / -- John McCain 's campaign ad " The One " has generated a lot of buzz regarding the " Left Behind Series . "
Political commentators are comparing McCain 's portrayal of competitor Barack Obama with the blockbuster apocalyptic series ' depiction of the antichrist .
But even the series authors Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins do n't think Obama is the antichrist .
What may have been created as a farce has generated a firestorm of controversy on the internet .
LaHaye and Jenkins take a literal interpretation of prophecies found in the Book of Revelation .
They believe the antichrist will surface on the world stage at some point , but neither see Obama in that role .
" I 've gotten a lot of questions the last few weeks asking if Obama is the antichrist , " says novelist Jenkins .
" I tell everyone that I do n't think the antichrist will come out of politics , especially American politics . "
" I can see by the language he uses why people think he could be the antichrist , " adds LaHaye , " but from my reading of scripture , he does n't meet the criteria .
There is no indication in the Bible that the antichrist will be an American . "
Jenkins and LaHaye do n't take McCain 's commercial or the antichrist speculation over Obama too seriously .
Pundits have pointed out that there are similarities between the " Left Behind Series " character Nicolae Carpathia and Obama .
Other than some vocabulary and charisma , Carpathia , a young Romanian politician who eventually oversees a one - world government , and Obama do n't have much in common .
" If even the people who created the character Nicolae Carpathia do n't see the comparisons as warranted , then perhaps this is overblown , " says Jenkins .
" Left Behind " is a series of 16 apocalyptic novels ( 1995 - 2007 / Tyndale House Publishers ) using end time prophecies in Revelation as a framework .
All sixteen books reached the " New York Times " bestseller list with seven reaching the # 1 spot .
Overall more than 63 million copies have sold in the " Left Behind " product line .

THE WRONG OBAMA SUPPORTER TO F**K WITH !
Check out this Barack Obama supporter and an interviewer he did .
This interviewer picked the wrong one to prove his point that all people supporting Obama are emotional and illogical .
See it below .
Here is the recap from Obama supporter Derrick and he his background and his reasons for supporting Barack Obama .
Paulson is going to have to do much better if he wants to bail out his old friends on Wall Street .
The Bear Stearns CEO walked away with $ 61 million ( some failure there , huh ? ) , Merrill Lynch ’s top three are looking at a cool $ 200 million for the fire sale to Bank of America and now Lehman , the company that supposedly was on the rocks , now has a $ 2.5 BILLION bonus plan .
Looking at these numbers , most Americans would be living a dream so they would never imagine that ’s what some of the biggest failures are receiving for crashing the US economy .
If Paulson wants fast action , maybe he ought to start re-thinking about his plan because I ’m not hearing much pain out of Wall Street yet .
Millions and billions in bonuses tells me that they ’re still having fun and living well though maybe for an ex-Goldman guy like Paulson it ’s all chump change and he thinks we ’re all chumps .
Democrats said they understood the need for urgency but insisted that the measure needed to provide help for homeowners threatened with losing their homes , perhaps by changes in bankruptcy laws to allow for mortgages to be modified , and by capping pay and benefit packages for executives at the huge Wall Street firms that will be selling their bad debt to the government .
“ I do n’t want the American taxpayer to get this bad debt and then the guy ( whose company once held the bad loans ) gets millions of dollars on his way out the door , ” said House Financial Services Chairman Barney Frank , D - Mass .
Obama camp : Prosecute Simmons
Obama general counsel Bob Bauer today sent a second , sharper letter to the Justice Department , directly attacking the Dallas billionaire funding a harsh attack ad , Harold Simmons .
" We reiterate our request that the Department of Justice fulfill its commitment to take prompt action to investigate and to prosecute the American issues Project , and we further request that the Department of Justice investigate and prosecute Howard ( sic ) Simmons for a knowing and willful violation of the individual aggregate contribution limits , " he wrote .
He called the group 's activities " patently illegal . "
Bauer made the case that Simmons ' group fulfilling its a real nonprofit charter because it has n't spent any money on anything other than attacking Obama .
The American Issues Project released a statement responding to the letter .
" Having failed in its attempts to get our legal , factual and fully - supported ad off the air , Barack Obama 's campaign now wants to put our donors in prison for exercising their right to free speech , " said Ed Martin , the group 's president .
" These over - the - top bullying tactics are reminiscent of the kind of censorship one would see in a Stalinist dictatorship , with the only difference being that those guys generally had to wait until they were in power to throw people who disagreed with them into jail . "
The group said its ad would continue to air through the end of the Democratic National Convention .
Simmons has spent almost $ 3 million to air the ad , which can be seen on the group 's site .
A spokeswoman for the Justice Department , Laura Sweeney , had no comment on the second letter .
It 's worth noting that this is n't the first time Bauer has called for criminal investigations and prosecutions into the donors to independent groups critical of Obama , including one supporting John Edwards and another supporting Hillary Rodham Clinton .
His words did have the effect of scaring their donors and consultants , but have n't yet appeared to result in any prosecution .
Rick Hasen has some more thoughts on the law , suggesting that Simmons , at worst , will face fines after it 's too late to matter .

Pyrels is a tool for exploring and visualizing relationships between Python objects .
It does so by analysing and converting Python namespaces into GraphViz files in the DOT format .
That means it displays relationships like references between Python names and the objects they point to , as well as containment between Python container objects ( lists , tuples and dictionaries ) and the respective objects they contain .
At the moment pyrels is best used on Python data structures , but it is intended to develop it further so that it can also display other types of relationships like inheritance , module imports , etc .

MILAN ( Reuters ) - Andrea Pininfarina , head of the company which designs Ferraris , Fiats and the Ford Focus , died in a road crash in the early hours of Thursday near the Italian city of Turin , riding his Vespa scooter .
The Ferrari P4/5 , designed by Pininfarina , is displayed on media day at the Paris Mondial de l'Automobile in Paris in this September 29 , 2006 file photo .

Pininfarina , 51 , was chairman and chief executive of the company founded in 1930 .
He was the grandson of founder Battista “ Pinin ” Farina and his death prompted speculation that the entrance of new investors will speed up , sending its shares sharply higher .
Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi said in a statement Pininfarina was “ the representative of a dynasty that helped bring the story of ‘ made in Italy ’ to the world ” .
Fiat and Ferrari Chairman Luca Cordero di Montezemolo praised his business acumen .
“ Italy , Turin and the Fiat group have lost a business figure who knew how to follow and develop the work of his grandfather Pinin and his father Sergio , ” Montezemolo said in a statement .
The driver of the car , 78 - year - old Giuliano Salmi , was taken to hospital suffering from shock .
“ I did n’t see him , I was going slowly and I really did n’t see him , ” Salmi said , according to local news agency Ansa .
Andrea Pininfarina was born in Turin , the centre of Italy ’s car industry , on June 26 , 1957 and joined the family business in 1983 after gaining a degree in mechanical engineering .
He was married to Italian aristocrat Cristina Maddalena Pellion di Persano and they had three children .
ART AND DESIGN
Pininfarina SpA , which designed Ferraris such as the Dino and Testarossa , boasts of “ Experience , Creativity , Innovation ” on its Website www.pininfarina.com, where it says it is a company of “ art , design , innovation .
The cars of kings . ”
News of the chief executive ’s death prompted market speculation that its ownership -- currently in the hands of the family with a 55 percent stake -- could quickly change .
The shares jumped so high they had to be suspended in Milan for excessive gains and were indicated up over 13 percent pending a resumption of trade .
“ The market thinks that ownership change will speed up , ” said one trader .
The family had already planned to cut its stake to around 30 percent through a sale of shares , which the company hopes will raise 100 million euros ( $ 155 million ) to be used to develop a new electric car to be launched in 2009 .
French financier Vincent Bollore could take part , investing up to 30 million euros .
Other potential investors include the son of Ferrari ’s founder and Indian industrialist Ratan Tata .
Pininfarina agreed a deal with its creditor banks last week which temporarily exempted it from repayments on 600 million euros of debt while it restructures its finances .
It has tried to cut costs as the economic downturn hits car makers and narrowed its loss to 9.7 million euros in the first quarter , from 9.9 million in the same period a year ago .
TOKYO ( Reuters ) - The U.S. Navy said it had replaced the captain of a nuclear - powered aircraft carrier scheduled for a controversial berth in Japan after blaming him for a fire on board on the warship .

The United States has been trying to allay fears over the planned stationing of the George Washington in Japan , the only country to have suffered nuclear attacks .
Doubts about the ship ’s safety were renewed when a fire broke out on board in May , and the plan has sparked two demonstrations in recent weeks .
U.S. Naval Air Forces said in a statement it had fired commanding officer David C. Dykhoff and another officer over the incident and installed Captain J.R.
Haley as the ship ’s new commander .
A U.S. investigation determined that the likely cause of the fire , which blazed for 12 hours and seriously injured one sailor , was unauthorized smoking that ignited oil stored inappropriately , the statement said .
Rear Admiral James Kelly , the head of the U.S. Navy in Japan , and James Zumwalt , a senior U.S. Embassy official in Tokyo visited Japanese foreign ministry officials to explain the results of the investigation , the ministry said in a statement .
Japanese officials told their U.S. counterparts they were satisfied with the investigation , but wanted U.S. forces to continue to make efforts to prevent a recurrence .
Tokyo is also satisfied that the ship is safe , the foreign ministry said .
The George Washington is currently undergoing $ 70 million dollars of repairs in San Diego , which has delayed its arrival in Japan by several weeks .
It is now scheduled to depart the United States on August 21 and arrive in Yokosuka , 45 km ( 28 miles ) southwest of the heavily populated capital , in late September , the statement said .
Many Japanese are sensitive about the use of nuclear power by military forces .
The Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki came under nuclear attack from the United States at the end of World War Two in August 1945 .

President George W Bush has called on Congress to end a 27 - year ban on drilling for oil in US coastal waters , to reduce dependence on imports .
Mr Bush said existing restrictions on offshore drilling were " outdated and counter - productive " .
His move comes as US consumers are calling for action to tackle high oil prices that have pushed prices at the pump to more than $ 4 ( £ 2 ) a gallon .
US energy needs are set to be a key issue in November 's presidential poll .
This is the culmination of the failed Bush - Cheney energy policy of the last eight years
Kassie Siegel
Climate programme director at the Center for Biological Diversity Republican John McCain favours offshore oil drilling , whereas his Democratic rival , Barack Obama , opposes it .
In a news conference at the White House , Mr Bush told Congress there was " no excuse for delay " in lifting the ban .
" Families across the country are looking to Washington for a response , " he said .
Environmentalists have reacted with alarm to Mr Bush 's call , arguing that off - shore drilling would take at least a decade to have any effect on oil supply and would exacerbate climate change .
US dependence Since 1981 , a congressional moratorium has prohibited oil and gas drilling along the east and west coasts and in the eastern Gulf of Mexico , an area accounting for some 80 % of the US 's Outer Continental Shelf .
OFFSHORE OIL Estimated reserves :
18bn barrels of recoverable oil
77 trillion cubic feet of natural gas US annual energy usage :
7.6bn barrels of oil
21 trillion cubic feet of gas Source : US interior department Mr Bush 's father , George Bush , imposed a moratorium on coastal oil exploration in 1990 .
Since then offshore drilling and exploration have only been allowed in the Western and Central Gulf of Mexico regions plus parts of Alaska .
The federal bans were enacted in part to protect tourism and lessen the chance of oil spills washing on to beaches .
The Democrats , and some Republicans who represent coastal states , oppose ending the moratorium .
" We are in this situation because of our dependence on traditional petroleum - based oil , " said California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger , a Republican .
He advocated " new technologies and new fuel choices for consumers " instead .
Mr Bush , who has repeatedly pushed for an end to the ban , has accused Democrats of using their control of Congress to undermine attempts to boost domestic oil production .
The president also renewed his call on Wednesday for the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska to be opened up to drilling .
' Failed policy ' " It 's cynical to say that we can drill our way out of this mess , " Athan Manuel , director of lands protection for the Sierra Club , told Reuters news agency .
Activists fear for Arctic wildlife " The solution to $ 4 gas [ petrol ] is not off our coast . "
Kassie Siegel , climate programme director at the California - based Center for Biological Diversity , condemned the Bush offshore initiative .
" This is the culmination of the failed Bush - Cheney energy policy of the last eight years , " she told the BBC News website .
" It would do absolutely nothing for petrol prices because it would take at least a decade to produce any oil and even if the oil did flow , there would be the greenhouse gases from the additional fossil fuel development . "
She points out that the US government recently calculated there was a 33 - 51 % chance of a major spill in the lifetime of an offshore oil and gas lease in the Chukchi Sea off Alaska .
Such a spill , defined as a release of 1,000 barrels or more from a platform or pipeline , could affect bowhead whales , polar bears and other wildlife .
However , the government 's environmental impact statement concluded that " an area affected by such a spill relative to the size of the Chukchi Sea decreases the likelihood that the resources would be widely contacted by the spill " .
' Political posturing ' Senator McCain , the Republicans ' presumptive presidential candidate , is opposed to opening up Alaska and had previously backed the moratorium on drilling in coastal waters .
John McCain 's drilling U - turn suggests he grasps ... that this election will be won or lost on the price of a gallon of gas

But speaking in Houston on Tuesday , Mr McCain called for the ban to be lifted to help counter US dependence on foreign oil .
" We must take control over our own energy future and become once again the master of our fate , " he said .
Mr McCain said the US had enormous energy reserves and was acquiring methods of using them in clean and responsible ways .
Senator Obama dismissed Mr McCain 's call as " political posturing " .
" His decision to completely change his position and tell a group of Houston oil executives exactly what they wanted to hear today was the same Washington politics that has prevented us from achieving energy independence for decades , " Mr Obama said .
He called for conservation and the search for alternative green energy supplies .
Analysts say drilling for offshore oil and developing alternatives will both prove slow to reduce US dependence on imported oil .

Daily Show : Media ' simultaneously offended and aroused ' by ' race card ' David Edwards and Stephen C. Webster
Published : Tuesday August 5 , 2008
Print This Email This
In a Monday segment of The Daily Show , host Jon Stewart let the ' race genie ' out of the bottle as he mocked the media 's attempts to pick apart the so - called ' race card ' and how it is being ' played ' in the 2008 presidential election .
Mocking one pundit 's comment on ' phallic imagery ' in McCain 's ' celebrity ' smear ads against the Democratic candidate , Stewart joked that if elected , Sen. Barack Obama would ' teabag ' America with his ' giant , black balls , ' finally leading the host into a satirical cry of , " The giant , black balls of Obama are upon us ! "
And , in a biting comment on the media 's lust for controversy , Stewart added that televised anchors have seemingly perfected the art of being " simultaneously offended and aroused . "
Commenting on the McCain campaign 's television ad comparing Obama 's high - media status to the likes of Britney Spears and Paris Hilton , Stewart concluded that the Republican senator 's strategy had boiled down to one thing : sarcasm .
" Some see the juxtaposition of two white girls and a black man as racially charged , " says an ABC News voice over .
" Some do n't . "
Stewart , staring dryly into the camera , dismissed the remark , saying , " Put me down for do n't .
But apparently , the vague , un - disprovable group known as ' some , ' do ...
Correct me if I 'm mistaken , but that means Tracy Morgan 's appearance on The View was a step shy of ' Mandingo ' ...
For this thing to be racist , you 're gonna have to have more than just the two women . "
" There is an image , right there at the very beginning [ of the McCain ' celebrity ' ad ] , of the Leaning Tower of Pisa , and there is an image of the Washington Monument , " said an MSNBC commentator .
" ... You tell me , why those two phallic symbols are placed there , pow , right at the very beginning of that ad . "
" To scare us away from Barack Obama 's giant , marble penises , " cracked Stewart . " ... It 's in the ad because that 's where Barack Obama was speaking in front of .
I guess , by that token , we 'd have to find out what racist chose Obama 's podium . "
Transitioning to a photo of Obama on stage leaning toward two microphones , Stewart cried , " Right there !
Two black balls !
Two giant , black balls , right in front of his mouth !
Do n't you see the subtle message ?
Elect Obama , and he will teabag America with his giant , black balls !
Run , America !
The giant , black balls of Obama are upon us ! "
Moments later in the segment , Stewart offered a run-down of the media 's use of the term ' race card , ' Stewart quipped , " I believe the media has perfected the art of being simultaneously offended and sexually aroused ...
Perhaps the media is just stunned to see the race card played so close on the heels of all those other cards . "
In a video summary of all the different ' cards ' in a presidential election deck , commentators across televised news media called out the various stations .
The change card , the fear card , the populism card , the patriotism card , the women as victim card , the gender card , the class card and the Maliki card ...
" What is this , cribbage ? " asked an incredulous Stewart .
" What the hell 's going on ? " " But , now that its been raised , it 's hard to put the genie back in the bottle , " said an ABC News voiceover , referring to the matters of race in the campaign .
" Woah , really ? " laughed Stewart , gingerly holding an Arabian lantern .
" Well , there 's only one way to find out if that 's true . "
After a couple shines with his cuff , Daily Show correspondent Jason Jones wafted from its mouth in full genie garb .
" Hey race genie , " said Stewart with a scowl .
" Yes , " Jones replied .
" You get three wishes .
And do n't try to Jew it up to four . "
" What ? " asked Stewart .
" Race genie , generally the joke is that you Jew something down , you do n't Jew something up .
It 's ... "
" Hey ! " interrupted Jones .
" Do n't tell me my business .
I 've been a race genie for a long time .
You got that , Dr. Keikenstein ? "
As his final wish , Stewart wished the race genie would get back into his bottle .
" No ! No ! " yelled Jones .
" Why did n't I close that loophole ?
I 'm dumber than a Polack ! "

George Clooney denies advising Barack Obama
George Clooney is strongly denying reports that he has been phoning and texting Barack Obama with support and advice on presentational style and policy matters .
Hollywood heart - throb Clooney is known to have strong views on Middle East politics and is a strong supporter of the Democratic Party .
Sources claimed he is friendly with Presidential candidate Obama and has become an unofficial advisor .
One source said : ‘ A number of members of the Hollywood community , including Brad Pitt , Ben Affleck and Matt Damon , offered to help raise funds for Barack but it was with George that he struck up this amazing affinity .
Supporter : Oscar - winner George Clooney supports Barack Obama but says he would n't be dumb enough to offer advice
' George has been giving him advice on things such as presentation , public speaking and body language and he also text and emails him about policy , especially the Middle East . '
But Clooney has issued a strong statement in response to the claims :
" I have never texted or emailed Senator Obama .
And I 'll offer a million dollars to anyone who could prove otherwise .
' In fact , I 've only talked to the Senator once in the last year and a half .... on the phone .
I 've spent more time with Senator McCain ( he did my TV show ) then I have with Senator Obama .
' I would hope that my friend John McCain would join me in condemning this kind of politics .
Although I support Senator Obama
I would never be dumb enough to offer policy advice to either candidate .
They seem to be doing fine without me . "
A spokesman for Barack Obama also denied the story .
Clooney once famously declared he could never run for public office because he ’d ‘ slept with too many women , done too many drugs and been to too many parties ’ .
The Ocean ’s Eleven star is among many Hollywood figures to have endorsed Obama , including Barbra Streisand , Scarlett Johansson , Warren Beatty and Steven Spielberg .
One of Clooney ’s trusted acquaintances said : ‘ George is a master at crafting his own image and he is helping Obama to hone his image both domestically and abroad .
The star has never tried to hide his liberal views and last week announced he is making a £ 15 million film about the lawyer who defended Osama Bin Laden ’s former driver , Salim Hamdan , on terror charges .
" The big question is what the Russians are doing . "
Georgia repeated accusations yesterday that Russia was continuing to arm and finance the rebels .
" The military assistance rendered to the separatists ' criminal regime by the Russian Federation , in violation of all agreements , cannot be assessed in any other way than as another act of aggression against Georgia , " the Georgian foreign ministry said .
New for Tuesday August 26 2008 First up Today 's Tijuana Bible drop - off locations :
We decided to have a little fun and make today 's comic drop a bit easier on you 100 copies on DNC floor / 45 to Delegates
10 copies left at WaxTrax I
10 copies left at Kilgore Comics
10 copies left at WaxTrax II
all store copies at 13th st./ Washington ( more information ) Welcome to Denver , part two We 'll begin with a retraction :
What a difference a day makes .
I 'd like to now lightly flip - flop on my opinion of the protest participants down here in Denver .
( see yesterday 's jokes at their expense ) I no longer consider them live action roleplayers lacking a sense of imagination .
Or worse , no sense of humor .
I was just busting their balls because yesterday 's experience felt pretty half - inflated and bullshit .
However , after tonight I have to admit I respect the whole lot of them .
They came here to find something -- and say something .
And the truth occurred sometime around 8 p.m.
Emphasized earlier with a battering on a single unfortunate protester that included four cops pistol whipping his skull , and others battering him senseless with steel billyclubs .
This is what many here had arrived to find , and the sum of this police action amounts to one of the more violent and tense moments I 've witnessed .
About any messages such a blow - up can provide - or force for change , more on that below .
But this story begins on a funnier note .
Earlier today I had the great pleasure of reconnecting with a good friend who I have n't seen in over a decade -- activist and radio personality Jeff Bell -- and we were in his car driving to get some dinner .
We were discussing the massive police presence .
I mention I 'm still not understanding the justification for the heavy armor found on hundreds of the cops here .
Jeff is a boastful , large chested scottish guy , not unlike a bouncer or wrestler .
And out of nowhere he explains , " Ah , now , they 're wearing Second Chance armor , which prevents knife attacks ... with Standard Ballistic
Issue over the top which prevents bullets from pistols , but not rifles . "
" Well that settles that ! " I concede .
Just then Jeff sees four teens in McCain t- shirts on a street corner and yells out a vulgar heckle I can't even begin to repeat , but it makes the neccessary point and the kids run off frightened .
It 's good to be driving with him .
But our drive to dinner soon comes to an abrupt stop .
A line of cops are lined up at the intersection making all four lanes seem impassable .
There 's no clear detour so we both agree :
Let 's drive down the alley .
Little did we know we were about to drive down into the nerve center of the worst confrontation between police and protesters so far during this year 's DNC .
COUNTDOWN : About three minutes before seeing some guy get his head bashed in : Jeff and I still think we 're driving to get some food .
But getting to the end of the alley we find a cop , who yells at us , " OUT OF THE CAR " We park and get out of the car .
I look over to our right and see a growing mass of riot cops .
They 're still arriving in special carriers .
And over the cops , who are blocking a street , I can hear very clearly : chanting and a lot of noise .
Jeff and I are about twenty yards away .
" Well shit I have to see this better - hold off on food a minute ? " - we agree to split up a bit to meet up later , each of us now watching whatever is about to happen from our own chosen vantage points .
Like a dipshit , I run clear up to as far as I can get .
And it 's a honey of a spot .
Through the strange fortune that forced us to drive down the alley we 're , at the moment , the only press types there , and I can reach out and touch the cops - who incidentally are growling and idling like a highly wound - up machine about to go berzerk .
It 's getting much louder and more people are now arriving on bicycles and on foot with cameras , video , everything .
We are all reacting to the mass of police and this still unseen trapped body of protesters .
The sound in the voices is different today than yesterday .
There 's a more audible lift here , less posing .
They 're trying to get away from the cops .
I 'd learn later the group had been cornered in tightly by the riot police , with no exit in any direction .
The charge :
They 'd crossed the street from the oxymoronic permitted protest space , and onto a city street .
And this harmless gesture had become a heavy confrontation with the rule - enforcers , who you could tell really wanted to pound the fuck out of someone .
It 's at this moment that the ' early big moment ' happened .
Just to repeat : the cops were caging these kids in , tighter and tighter .
So a tall guy makes what seems to be a break for it .
And that 's where I happened to be in a good place for a very clear view .
Due to our alley detour I was standing about fifteen feet from what happened .
And it happened in such a quick blink of an eye that you 'd miss it if you sneezed .
My excuse for not having a photo is because just as I hit the shutter I swallowed in a gulp of pepper spray that misted through the air forcing me to recoil and lose the shot .
But I 'll happily go in a court of law to say I saw a guy with no weapons run at a bunch of police , immediately get shot with rubber bullets , and then receive what looked very much like a pistol whipping .
The sound of clattering metal billyclubs on the pavement , indicating missed shots , is something I do n't think I 'll ever forget either .
Later after the incident I spoke to another witness who confirmed my assessment , though he 's more graphic .
He was in the crowd : " Yeah I saw it right there .
The guy , he just , is tackled .
And the cop he turned his gun around and BAM BAM BAM , he just bashes this guy 's head like five times with the butt of his gun .
And then the horses show up and the cops on those , they get their shot with those metal canes .
It was just , it was fucked ... "
I should mention that I did n't see the horses , but then again there was a lot going on at the time and it seemed any aggressive act was done very quickly .
My eyes were also darting around at the time to avoid any cops , myself .
This was , I 'm thinking , the first opportunity all week for any cop to really ( I mean with feeling ) attack someone in front of other cops , and you could feel the pent - up release of it everywhere .
FINALLY , they must have all thought .
The whole crowd reacts , as well .
Horrored , screaming , chanting to ' let him go / let him go ' ...
Off to the side of the road I see the guy on the ground , bloodied up and coughing .
I do n't even think to take a photo .
Things had suddenly become extremely severe .
Next came the stormtroopers , running directly in my direction , and jesus what a ridiculous looking bunch of bastards .
This was the moment I finally reacted to how dangerous things were becoming and retreated to the other side of the street .
But it was n't without these fifty militarized police nearly colliding with me and a few others , and for one clumsy cop to drop a red cannister of gas on the cement .
Clank .
Quickly retreived , but with tension like this we 'll take comedy slapstick relief wherever we can find it .
It was here that - and I 'll post the photos soon - that all the hundreds of cops started to crouch down and put on heavy duty gas masks .
I was part of a very large crowd of onlookers now .
The cops informed us that we were about to be choked by gas and to leave immediately .
I wondered about the kids in the crowd .
Had they suddenly changed things to allow them to retreat ?
Do you gas a group you 're trapping ?
What 's the purpose of this ?
I had no answers because I still could n't see the crowd .
But one thing was certain , the cops were making sure this side of the barricade did n't ALSO become a confrontation , either .
They never gassed , instead using the tactic of it ' about to occur ' over and over with numerous repeated warnings to leave or be choked .
This makes a lot more sense to me , because you can only gas once but you can threaten for control perpetually .
I suddenly thought of my teases yesterday , namely the ones about the ninja masks and wished I had one on hand .
The fabric would have made a good filter .
Over here on this side , the only thing saving everyone was a collection of videocameras and an army of press badges .
But demands started to get more and more hostile that everyone move away , not watch , etc .
This would repeat more and more aggressively with us outside the caged in crowd .
Finally the cops started to threaten that our observance would be met with arrest if we set foot in designated areas , all the best viewing locations .
Holding rifles and billyclubs , they moved us farther and farther away from the conflict , leaving us only to hear the crowd and not see it .
And the sounds .
My .
The trapped crowd was swelling and reeling , letting out all forms of chants and noises .
The worst were the increasingly more frequent ones of horror .
A lot of kids were screaming and terrified in there - and I 'd see why - many barely looked sixteen once they were allowed to leave .
Finally , after the arrival of two tanks , hundreds more police , some snypers on the top of the Sheraton hotel , more gas masks , horses , cargo trucks , five helicopters -- the crowd was released .
And with them , the stories .
It 's difficult to know what is true and what is n't , but I can trust the faces .
You can tell when someone has experienced something truly shocking to their internal system .
They begin to purge out information like they 're just trying to make sense of it for themselves .
It was during a few conversations that I heard the most brutal stuff : " I saw this one cop - it was with a fifteen year old kid ....
They scream for everyone to get on the sidewalk .
This kid does what he 's told but the cop just still comes right at him with him billy club and WHAM , hits the kid horizontally ... fifteen years old ... right in the chest with the cane with something that looked like 80 or 90 % of the cop 's body weight .
This kid 's suddenly up against a wall and the cop continues to hit this kid eight or nine times . "
The somewhat humorous : " We could n't get out of there .
We were videomakers - on a permit from the city and the cops would n't let us leave .
We even screamed PLEASE LET US OUT - WE'RE DOCUMENTING "
And the concocted : " Man I saw three undercover cops today - wearing bandanas wrong - over their HEADS like BIKERS .
We confronted them , they did n't know anyone - wearing nikes !
But they were planning this .
They 've totally infiltrated . "
To finally : " Well a lot of the people tonight simply should not have been there .
They got into it way too early .
This is not a good first dance for anyone , man .
Not a good first dance at all . "
I 'm missing out on a lot of the violent details because they become redundant : excessive force that harms regardless of compliance .
I 'll post some of the better photos of the atmosphere later tomorrow , along with a postscript on freeing the passengers and the temporary comedy carnival .
But here , tonight , let me say something :
This was the first victory of the protesters in saying something of substance to the rest of the country .
It took a few sacrifices , but they managed the big one : they had gotten this terrifying oversized militarized force to react .
PHYSICALLY and ABUSIVELY .
And to do so without any use of the technology they were armed with .
The victory for these protesters was that even a cop covered in " Second Chance Armor " and " standard ballistic tops " along with helmets and other football gear - that , despite these protections , they choose to thuggishly pound the unarmed first and without thought .
Where , in any of these accounts of violence is there a sign that a cop could have been harmed , or even tested ?
In a suit designed to repel bullets and knives they 're worried about a slap or a shove ?
No , Despite the hundreds of physical restraint options available ON - HAND to these police officers they opted first and foremost for technology years old : billyclubs , horses , and fists .
It 's a huge embarrassment for Denver , and a huge victory for the protesters .
They finally managed a piece of valuable theater that speaks specifically to this modern day anxiety of too many cops , too much control .
It 's with some irony that this all occured near a monument to Denver freedom fighters from the 1800s , complete with a city - issued plaque celebrating their resistance to authority .
Leaving for the evening I would be gifted with a set of quotes that carried some good weight and value .
It happened walking down a street far off from the protesters , I was passing two cops in riot gear , talking back and forth in front of a barricade .
The first one , aping a protester says , " So she yells , ' who 's going to protect our first amendment rights ? ' "
And then , in a response that confuses almost like a zen proverb , the other cop offers : " EXACTLY .
Why do you think we have a job ? "

The troubles are deepening at electronics retailer Circuit City ( CC ) .
The company this morning posted revenue for its fiscal second quarter ended August 31 of $ 2.39 billion , well short of the Street consensus of $ 2.53 billion .
The company lost $ 239.2 million , or $ 1.45 a share in the quarter , including a $ 73 million asset impairment charge .
Circuit City notes that the loss before the charge was actually a little lower than expected .
But that 's irrelevant : the business clearly is getting into even deeper trouble .
In a statement , CFO Bruce Besanko noted that sales were below plan , with a " significant decline " in store traffic , reflecting " the worsened macroeconomic environment , competitive pressures and a weakened brand position . "
Circuit City noted that its cash position is down to $ 92.5 million , from $ 424.4 million a year earlier .
Comp store sales in the quarter were down a disastrous 13.3 % .
Also troubling is this : back in May , the company announced that it is exploring strategic alternatives .
But now it appears it may not have many to choose from .
" Given market conditions , it is prudent to focus internally on improving the company 's performance in order to operate as a standalone business , " the company said this morning .
Which basically suggests that there will be no rescue for Circuit City ; the company is going to have crawl out of its current hole on its own .
Meanwhile , the company gave the usual rundown on various product segments , and the news is not so good : Video : High - single digit comp stores decrease ; flat - panel TVs up by " a low single digit percentage .
Digital imaging products , camcorders and DVD hardware were down double digits .
IT products : Down double digits .
Sales of notebooks and desktop PCs were down double digits .
Audio : Down double digits .
Sales of mobile , portable audio and home audio products were down double digits .
Navigation products were down high single digits .
Entertainment : Down double digits , with low - single - digit decline in video gaming products , and double - digit declines for video and music software .
Circuit City today is down 14 cents , or 10.2 % , to $ 1.23 .
12 Greek Words You Should Know By Daniel Scocco
Along with Latin , Greek is probably the language that most influenced other languages around the world .
Many English words derive directly from Greek ones , and knowing their origin and meaning is important .
Below you will find 12 Greek words that are commonly used in our society .
The next time you hear someone saying “ Kudos to you , ” you will know where it comes from .
1. Acme
The highest point of a structure .
The peak or zenith of something .
One could say that Rome reached the acme of its power on 117 AD , under the rule of Trajan .
The acme of modular , factory - built , passively safe reactor design , however , is found in South Africa .
People there have been experimenting with so - called pebble - bed reactors for decades .
( The Economist )
2. Acropolis
Acro means edge or extremity , while polis means city .
Acropolis , therefore , refers to cities that were built with security purposes in mind .
The word Acropolis is commonly associated with Greece ’s capital Athens , although it can refer to any citadel , including Rome and Jerusalem .
The Beijing Olympics torch relay reached the ancient Acropolis in Athens on Saturday amid heavy police security and brief demonstrations by small groups of protesters .
( New York Times )
3. Agora
The Agora was an open market place , present in most cities of the ancient Greece .
Today the term can be used to express any type of open assembly or congregation .
The most characteristic feature of each settlement , regardless of its size , was a plaza — an open space that acted as a cemetery and may have been a marketplace .
It was also , the archaeologists suspect , a place of political assembly , just as the agora in an ancient Greek city was both marketplace and legislature .
( The Economist )
4. Anathema
Anathema is a noun and it means a formal ban , curse or excommunication .
It can also refer to someone or something extremely negative , disliked or damned .
Curiously enough , the original Greek meaning for this word was “ something offered to the gods . ”
Some thinkers argue that while collaboration may work for an online encyclopedia , it ’s anathema to original works of art or scholarship , both of which require a point of view and an authorial voice .
( USA Today )
5. Anemia
Anemia refers to a condition characterized by a qualitative or quantitative deficiency of the red blood cells ( or of the hemoglobin ) .
Over the years , however , the term started to appear in other contexts , referring to any deficiency that lies at the core of a system or organization .
In comments to the Dallas Morning News , Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher , the lone dissenter in last week ’s decision to keep the federal funds target at 2 % , said the U.S. faces “ a sustained period of anemia ” and that “ in the second half of this year we will broach zero growth . ”
Last week Fisher wanted higher rates , his fifth - straight dissent in favor of tighter policy .
( The Wall Street Journal )
6. Ethos
Translated literally from the Greek , ethos means “ accustomed place . ”
It refers to a disposition or characteristics peculiar to a specific person , culture or movement .
Synonyms include mentality , mindset and values .
Consumerism needs this infantilist ethos because it favors laxity and leisure over discipline and denial , values childish impetuosity and juvenile narcissism over adult order and enlightened self - interest , and prefers consumption - directed play to spontaneous recreation .
( Los Angeles Times )
7. Dogma
Dogma refers to the established belief or set of principles held by a religion , ideology or by any organization .
Dogmas are also authoritative and undisputed .
Outside of the religious context , therefore , the term tends to carry a negative connotation .
Notice that the plural is either dogmata or dogmas .
It ’s not a new type of web , it ’s just where the web has got to – it ’s also a terrific excuse for much chatter on the blogging circuit , and a huge amount of dogmatism .
( Financial Times )
8. Eureka
The exclamation Eureka is used to celebrate a discovery , and it can be translated to “ I have found ! ” .
It is attributed to the famous Greek mathematician Archimedes .
While taking a bath , he suddenly realized that the water displaced must be equal to the volume of the part of his body he had submerged .
He got so excited with the discovery that he left his home and started to run and shout “ Eureka ! ” through the streets of Syracuse .
Those eureka moments in the shower or on the bus when something suddenly starts to make sense only happen if you keep plugging away .
( The Guardian )
9. Genesis
Genesis means birth or origin .
There are many synonyms for this word , including beginning , onset , start , spring , dawn and commencement .
Genesis is also the name of the first book of the Bible .
And when Mr McCain headed to the safe shoals of policy wonkery , Mr Obama flayed his idea of calling for a commission to investigate the genesis of the financial crisis as the resort of politicians who do n’t know what else to do .
( The Economist )
10 . Phobia
Many people wrongly think that a phobia is a fear .
In reality it is more than that .
Phobia is an irrational and exaggerated fear of something .
The fear can be associated with certain activities , situations , things or people .
Poorer communities have a phobia of undercooked food .
Very advanced societies enjoy their fish and meat either raw or very close to it .
To the French their idea of cooking a steak is so perfunctory one might as well hack the thing off the cow and tuck in .
( Financial Times )
11 . Plethora
You have a plethora when you go beyond what is needed or appropriate .
It represents an excess or undesired abundance .
In California , for example , some neighborhoods have been blighted by the plethora of empty homes .
Joe Minnis , a real estate agent for Prudential California , knows foreclosed homes in San Bernardino that have been systematically stripped , trashed and tagged by gang members .
( Business Week )
12 . Kudos
Kudos means fame or glory , usually resulting from an important act or achievement .
It is interesting to notice that in Greek and in the Standard British English , Kudos is a singular noun .
Inside the United States , however , it is often used in a plural form ( e.g. , You deserve many kudos for this accomplishment ! )
They deserve the kudos because they could be deemed responsible for the marked improvement in the commercials during Super Bowl XL last night .

Smart grid technology lets utilities more efficiently manage electricity
The internet giant Google has teamed up with technology multinational General Electric to develop a " smart " electric power grid and promote clean energy .
Both companies want to make renewable energy more accessible and useful .
In a joint statement they said : " Our economic , environmental and security challenges require we use electricity more efficiently and generate it from cleaner sources . "
" Clean energy is eminently doable and solvable , " said GE ceo Jeff Immelt .
" This just makes good sense , " said Google CEO Eric Schmidt .
The plan was unveiled at Google 's Mountain View headquarters in California where the firm was holding its annual Zeitgeist , a conference bringing senior executives from around the world to discuss the pressing issues of the 21st century .
Both GE and Google said they would leverage their lobbying muscle in Washington to try and persuade politicians to push for major policy changes in energy .
The statement by the two firms said that " policy is a major impediment to building a 21st century electricity system . "
Mr Immelt said while his instinct is to keep government at arm 's length , in this case there is a vital role for politicians to play .
" There is no such thing as a perfect free market .
It is a market that needs a little catalyst from the government and then I think the entrepreneurial dollars will flow to that . "
Ecomagination During an interview session at the conference , Mr Schmidt quizzed Mr Immelt about GE 's decision to focus on clean technologies under an initiative dubbed " Ecomagination . "
GE is now one of the biggest players in the wind power industry and is involved in developing hybrid locomotives , water reuse solutions and photovoltaic cells .
The GE boss admitted to the audience that the company 's eco game plan did not meet with approval from many sectors of business when it was initially unveiled in 2005 .
Wind power is far ahead of other renewable energy sources for reliability " We had a lot of suspicious people around but we felt the time was right to attempt to do something like this . "
He said the move has paid off as sales of products and services in this area have grown from $ 4 - $ 5 bn ( £ 2.2- 2.7bn ) at its launch to $ 18bn a year .
Mr Immelt also boasted of his decision to buy Enron 's wind business out of bankruptcy in 2003 for $ 300 m and revealed that it now makes between $ 7 - $ 8 bn in revenues .
" I have done some bad business deals in my day , but this is n't one of them , " joked Mr Immelt .
Google is also involved in clean energy initiatives that include geothermal , solar and wind - generated electricity .
The search giant has maintained that the benefits of renewable electricity can not be fully realised without updating US power transmission lines into a " smart grid " that lets people track and control what types of power they use and when .
Both firms will push to modernise the electrical grid " This 21st century electricity system must combine advanced energy technology - a major GE focus - and cutting edge information technology - a major Google focus , " said the joint communiqué .
" We believe that by combining our efforts , along with other relevant businesses and industries , we can advance critical policy change in Washington and develop new technologies and services for consumers . "
GE and Google plan to work on technologies that will convert geothermal power into electricity as well as prepare the nation 's grid for plug - in vehicles .
Dan Reicher , director of climate change and energy initiatives at Google.org , the charitable arm of Google , said both businesses feel they can make a real difference .
" A smart grid is something we desperately need in this country and we humbly think we might have something to contribute . "

What are these ?
( NaturalNews ) Secretary of Agriculture Ed Schafer has rejected calls to ban downer cattle from the U.S. food supply .
Downer cattle are those too sick or injured to stand .
Because these cows are at a higher risk of carrying the fatal , incurable neurological disorder known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy , or mad cow disease , the USDA prohibited their slaughter in 2004 .
This regulation was relaxed in 2007 to allow the slaughter of any animal that collapses after an initial veterinary inspection , as long as it is re-examined and slaughtered separately .
The Humane Society of the United States has sued the FDA to close this loophole , and Sen. Herb Kohl of Wisconsin , chair of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee has also called for a complete ban on downer cows from the food supply .
In addition , Kohl has called for stiffer penalties for companies that violate the ban , and for the installation of 24 - hour surveillance cameras at meat processing plants .
The recent controversy over downed cows erupted after an undercover Humane Society employee videotaped workers at a Westland / Hallmark slaughterhouse hosing , shocking , dragging and even using forklifts to move downed cows into the kill area .
" These images exposed wholly unacceptable gaps in American meat inspection systems , " Kohl said .
" Despite the presence of five inspectors at the Westland / Hallmark plant , blatant violations had evidently occurred for some time ... I think we need a more foolproof system .
" Testifying before the appropriations subcommittee , Schafer said that he believes current rules on downed cows to be adequate .
" I do believe there are cases where downer animals can be approved by the veterinarian and put into the food supply , " Schafer said .
" They are not sick .
" According to USDA documents , cows with broken limbs , even those that appear otherwise healthy , are 50 times more likely to have mad cow disease than animals that can stand on their own .

A few months ago I wrote about Internet as a high - stakes game played by millions of people .
The Internet , you see , is an enormous , three - dimensional gaming surface .
This gameboard consists of billions of nodes ( web pages ) joined by trillions of connectors ( hyperlinks ) , fluctuating and evolving in real - time .
It helps if you visualize it as a physical thing , and to do that , we 'll need to put on our magic decoder glasses .
In the comments to that post , I said I was working on an Internet visualization tool or agent .
Today I 'd like to introduce that tool , code - named Inviz , short for " Internet Visualizer " .
It 's the piece of software responsible for the images you 're about to see .
They were generated entirely inside this tool , in a matter of a few minutes .
Get those magic decoder glasses ready .
Our first Internet snapshot is in black and white :
That 's a living , breathing picture of a small galaxy of web sites as they exist in the real world .
Each block in the above diagram is a single web page .
Each line is a single hyperlink ( or other association between two pages ) .
Everything you see can be manipulated , dragged and dropped , resized , queried for its properties and content .
If you double click a node , the tool traces the nodes hyperlinks and opens up another galaxy of nodes , and so forth .
As you can see , after just a few minutes of working with the tool , the relationships can get complex .
Because the Internet itself is complex , and all Invis really does is take a ( somewhat ) intelligent picture of that complexity .
Let 's zoom out for the bird 's - eye view , and tell Inviz to color - code sites according to the domain they belong to :
It 's a battleground , our Internet .
Can you guess which galaxies belong to Digg.com ?
Microsoft ?
Coding the Wheel ?
Or Jeff Atwood over at Coding Horror ?
Give up ?
Let 's zoom in ( Inviz supports zooming by any arbitrary scale factor ) and take a look .
Here 's the diagram at 500 % .
So , at least in this particular view , Inviz has chosen a red - white gradient fade for Digg.com .
The galaxy of red blips you saw in the 2nd picture ?
The Digg.com home page , and ( some of ) the pages it links to .
Light blue nodes ?
Various Microsoft sub -domains .
Dark blue nodes ?
Good old Jeff Atwood over at CH .
Black nodes ?
Sites we do n't care about .
Of course , colors , shapes , and connectors can all be customized by the user .
In fact , we can do away with the graphical view entirely , and boil the entire web down to a simple tree control .
This link hierarchy is the well - known factor behind Google 's PageRank .
And although not shown here , Inviz has an option allowing you to tweak the size , shape , color , or other aspects of a given element based on its incoming links , resulting in a sort of visual PageRank .
Now if I could only get access to the Google master index ...
Anyway , this diversion has been brought to you by ...
Inviz was implemented using C# and .NET 2.0+ exclusively .
It is a work in progress .
Inviz is not currently available for download or purchase .
That may change if there 's any interest .
If you 'd like to see a picture of your own website as seen through Inviz 's eyes , leave a comment .
It 's capable of some very strange visualizations , and even has some useful HTTP functionality under the hood .
Until next time .
Way back in September 2005 , not so long after Katrina hit New Orleans and Americans discovered just what the Bush administration was -- and was n't -- capable of , environmental activist and author Chip Ward wrote a piece for TomDispatch , " Left Behind , " on " Bush 's holy war on nature . "
In it he outlined just what that administration was , in fact , quite skilled at doing .
He wrote , in part :
" During their time in power , Bush 's officials have worked systematically and energetically to undo half a century of environmental law and policy based on hard - learned lessons about how to sustain healthy environments .
Strikingly , they have failed to protect the environment even when they could have done so without repercussions from special - interest campaign contributors .
Something more is going on . "
While the administration 's " holy war on nature " has certainly gotten some real attention , issue by issue , in the mainstream media , its totality , its enormity has seldom been fully assessed .
Now , John McCain has picked a vice presidential candidate who , as Ward , reminds us , is guaranteed to continue that same holy war -- in her case , with special fervor .
The media and Internet feeding frenzy on Sarah Palin has been well , frenzied beyond belief .
This piece , however , goes to the heart of what matters when it comes to the Alaskan governor .
Tom
It 's that last item , her willingness to put Creationism up against the teaching of evolutionary science in the classroom on a he - says - she - says basis , that 's far more revealing of just who our new Republican vice presidential candidate is than we generally assume .
It deserves the long , hard look that it has n't yet gotten .
Most Democrats and progressives tend to think of the teaching of Creationism as a mere sidebar item on their agenda of political do n't - likes , but it 's not .
Sarah Palin's bias towards Creationism is a window into her political soul and a measure of John McCain 's hypocrisy .
Oh , and -- not that this is very important to Americans or the planet -- she now thinks that global warming might possibly be human - made sorta though she did n't before , despite the fact that the state she governs is on the frontline of climate change .
And , of course , she 's a classic right - wing , fundamentalist Christian : against abortion -- check ; against same - sex marriage -- check ; against stem - cell research -- check ; favors teaching Creationism in public schools -- check .
Despite the media feeding frenzy , we still may be asking ourselves , " Just who exactly is Sarah Palin ? "
Mixed in with the Davy - Crockett - meets - SuperMom vignettes -- all those moose hunting , ice fishing , snowmobiling , baby - juggling , and hockey - momming moments -- we 've also learned that she does n't care much for her former brother - in - law and was n't afraid to use her office to go after his job as a state trooper ; that she was for the " bridge to nowhere " before she was against it ; that she 's against earmarks unless they benefit her constituents ; that she can deliver a snappy wisecracking speech , thinks banning books in libraries is okay , considers herself a pit bull with lipstick , and above all else , wants to drill the ever - lovin ' daylights out of every corner of her home state ( which John McCain 's handlers have somehow translated into being against Big Oil , since she insisted on a marginally bigger cut of the profits for Alaskans ) .
It 's possible that the public has been fooled into thinking of McCain as a " maverick " when it comes to his party 's abysmal record on the environment , but his selection of Palin as his running mate sends quite a different message .
In fact , he 's potentially put future generations on a " bridge to nowhere " ( or perhaps to the fourteenth century ) .
Whether we know it or not , we should now be duly warned :
The Palin nomination is the equivalent of launching a " surge strategy " in the Republican war on the environment .
The Republican Holy War on Nature ( Continued )
For the past eight years , the Bush administration 's assault on environmental quality has been so deliberate , destructive , and hostile that the usual explanations -- while not wrong -- are hardly adequate .
Yes , Republican animosity to government regulation is long - standing .
Yes , they believe in the power of an unrestricted marketplace to shape our collective behaviors .
And yes , they emphasize property rights over notions of the commons and have often been comfortable sacrificing wildlife , air , and water quality in the pursuit of profits .
In addition , despite recent claims , they are indeed the party of Big Oil .
But none of this quite explains the Bush administration 's shameful record on the environment .
In the final analysis , the only explanation that fits the nightmare of the last eight years is this :
It has been on a holy war against nature -- and the nomination of Sarah Palin is essentially an insurance policy taken out on its continuation .
The idea that the environment matters is ingrained in Americans , even those who do n't think of themselves as environmentally inclined .
Democrats and Republicans alike have learned the hard way that the decisions we make about what we allow into our air , water , and soil gets translated into our skin , blood , and bones .
We now sense that we all live downwind and downstream from one another , and that it is prudent to practice restraint and take precautions when making environmental decisions .
This unspoken consensus is one of the great accomplishments of the modern environmental movement .
The policies of the Bush regime have been shocking and shameful exactly because they fly in the face of these shared values and beliefs .
Only when we grasp that the narrow Republican base both Bush and McCain pander to no longer shares these basic values and beliefs , does their war on the natural world make sense .
If you believe that a look - alike God made the world for you to dominate and use , that you are among God 's chosen few , and that He will provide for you no matter what you do to your surroundings , then you are likely to see yourself as above the natural order .
If you believe that the world will be ending soon anyway , that you will be " raptured " while non-believers are " left behind " ( as fundamentalist Tim LeHay so vividly describes the process in his bestselling novels ) , then precaution and restraint are moot .
Remember , more than 60 % of the nation 's 60 million evangelicals believe that the Bible is literally true , every last word of it , and more than a third believe the end of the world will occur in their lifetime .
That 's why a pro-Creationist stand is no sideline issue , but the litmus test that reveals whether a politician shares the religious right 's ideology -- a literal interpretation of the Bible , a disparaging attitude towards science , belief in mankind 's unfettered dominion over the natural world , and a willingness to impose its religious doctrines on others .
Both of Sarah Palin 's churches -- the Wasilla Assembly of God where her faith was shaped as a child and the Wasilla Bible Church that she attends today -- believe in just such a literal interpretation of the Bible .
From Biblical study , Creationists have calculated that the Earth is only about 6,000 years old .
That this is contradicted by the fossil record matters little to those who also think Revelations is a reasonable guide to foreign policy in the twenty - first century .
Asked during her run for governor if Creationism should be taught in the public schools , Palin responded that the theory of evolution and Creationism should be taught side by side , and then " the students could debate " which is true .
Why Evolution Matters
When many Americans think " evolution , " they probably recall that illustration of an ape , then a Neanderthal , then a hairy caveman , and finally , a modern homo sapiens walking in a line and growing ever more upright as they proceed .
That illustration crudely highlights the aspect of evolutionary theory that pinches the nerves of Christian zealots who prefer a creation scenario like the one painted on the roof of the Sistine Chapel -- God tagging Man with life , finger to finger .
But the human common ancestry with primates is just a fraction of what evolutionary theory is all about .
Evolution is largely about connection and interaction -- the linear connection of one species evolving into another ( speciation ) , but also how species fill niches created by one another , how they interact , exchanging energy and information , how they compete as well as cooperate , and how all of them -- from microbial soils to migrating birds -- form dynamic communities that , in turn , are also woven together , web within web within web .
Pull one thread of that living tapestry and you tug at so many others , which is why precaution is so wise .
Evolutionary theory does not preclude God .
It uncovers the how of life , but leaves the why of it quite open .
Many devout Jews and Christians , even evangelicals , believe in evolution , just not Biblical literalists .
Evolutionary theory shapes and informs the ecological sciences that are the very basis for our environmental laws and policies .
The emerging , European - led global movement -- so far lacking U.S. participation -- that aims to deal with global climate chaos and restore the earth 's vital operating systems is premised on understandings gained through the evolutionary sciences .
Cast doubt on those sciences and you undermine the basis for changes that are urgently needed .
The Creationist campaign means to dumb - down and confuse our kids by pushing the evolutionary sciences off the educational stage .
America 's Taliban want to make room for Creationism 's dull sister , Intelligent Design , in order to undermine the emerging environmental consensus that is our best hope for a sustainable future .
According to that consensus , we humans are embedded in natural systems that are in crisis ; our well - being , even our survival , depends on the vitality of those systems .
Kiss the Polar Bear Goodbye
So how does all this translate into actual behavior ?
As governor , Sarah Palin recently sued the Interior Department to keep the polar bear -- the iconic symbol of her state -- from being listed as a threatened species under the provisions of the Endangered Species Act.
Additional protections , she argued , might inhibit oil and gas drilling and pipeline construction in the region .
The Endangered Species
Act is a favorite target of the religious right since they are convinced it elevates lowly creatures to , or above , the status of human beings .
They see " charismatic carnivores " and other protected species as the means used by conservationists to pursue broader protections for whole ecosystems .
And that 's true enough , in that " keystone species " like the polar bear regulate a wide network of relationships within a whole ecosystem .
Those bears , for example , keep a lid on seal populations that could otherwise devastate fish populations and skew the arctic food web .
Numerous animal and bird species depend on scavenging bear kills for food .
But without reference to ecological science , the role of a keystone species and the value of biodiversity itself are hard to appreciate .
Palin , of course , also wants to drill for oil in the ecologically fragile Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and has expressed her hope that she can convince McCain to abandon his opposition to it .
She is an active promoter of Alaska 's aerial hunting program where wolves and bears ( again , keystone species ) are shot from the air or chased until exhausted , after which the pilot lands the plane and a gunner can shoot them point blank .
She tried to raise the bounty on wolves to encourage more killing and strongly opposed a ballot initiative to end the aerial hunting program .
In the Lower 48 , we learned the hard way that eliminating top predators upsets a chain of relationships in their ecosystems .
No wolves in Yellowstone meant big , lazy herds of elk trashing streams , driving away beavers , and thus eliminating the wetlands that beavers create -- a cascade of unintended , harmful consequences .
That 's why naturalists are reintroducing wolves in parts of the West , and health is returning to the land with them .
Under Palin , Alaska is going to relive our old mistakes at a time when Alaskans -- and humanity -- can ill afford it .
The Carbon Queen
Even in Alaska , known oil reserves are dropping .
Nonetheless , Palin is determined above all else to keep the current flow of energy moving , explore and develop new oil fields , and ramp up natural gas and coal production .
She gave special permission to Chevron to triple the toxic waste it can pour into the waters of the Cook Inlet , despite scientific research concluding that the Beluga whale population there is endangered .
She has refused to pressure Exxon to pay - up for damages caused by the infamous Exxon - Valdez oil spill .
She has supported virtually every mining proposal that has landed on her desk , including one for a vast gold mine in the Bristol Bay watershed that would risk the world 's largest run of sockeye salmon .
She favors open - cast mining for coal in the pristine Brooks Range .
She has refused to enhance safety measures for trans -Pacific shipping along the Alaskan coast .
All that and she 's been governor for barely two years !
Her deplorable environmental record was such common knowledge that John McCain could n't have missed it , even if he napped through his vetting committee 's report .
So if the McCain / Palin ticket is elected , you should know what to expect .
Although John McCain may once have openly refused to subscribe to the beliefs of the Republican Party 's religious right , famously describing them as " agents of intolerance , " his selection of Sarah Palin is a message ( and not just to the Party 's fundamentalist right ) :
If you thought that he understands the need to kick our fossil - fuel addiction and address global warming , if you believed his promises to build a green economy , forget about it .
A McCain / Palin administration , just like the one before it , will continue -- and this is the best - case scenario -- to fiddle while the planet burns .
Driving Into the Future Without a Map
Ed Kalnins is Sarah Palin 's former pastor at the Wasilla Assembly of God Church which she attended for 26 years .
He sees powerful signs that the end of the world is drawing nigh and assured a London Times reporter that Biblical scripture specifically mentions shortages of oil and wars for its control .
When the end comes , he expects to be " raptured " with other righteous Christians and spared the suffering of those of us who will be left behind .
He believes the apocalyptic destruction of our planet will happen in his own lifetime ; in fact , that is exactly the future he hopes for .
He has urged his congregation to make ready a " refuge " for good Christians fleeing northward in " the Last Days . "
Although Kalnin 's orientation may seem -- to be polite -- extreme , it is typical enough of those who push a Creationist agenda .
And it 's a perspective Sarah Palin knows well , having spent a lifetime in Kalnin 's Pentecostal church , and even now , she is in no hurry to disown it .
We need environmental science in our schools more than ever .
An ecologically illiterate generation of students will be ill - prepared to meet our real , less than rapturous future .
They wo n't have a clue about what 's happening around them or how to deal with the damage we 've done .
They wo n't be able to create new technologies that mimic nature 's models for recycling waste and energy .
They will drive blindly into the future , burning fossil fuels , without a map they can read .
They may even let the Ed Kalnins of our world take the wheel .
The Evolution vs. Creationism debate appears to be an argument over the distant past .
But it 's actually about the future .
It 's about , in fact , who will define the cultural mindset that will generate that future .
Let us pray it is not defined by a pit bull with lipstick who thinks she is " tasked by God " to drill for oil .

As a grassroots activist , he led several successful campaigns to make polluters accountable .

U.S. Planning Big New Prison in Afghanistan
By ERIC SCHMITT and TIM GOLDEN
May 17 , 2008
Copyright 2008 The New York Times Company
WASHINGTON – The Pentagon is moving forward with plans to build a new , 40 - acre detention complex on the main American military base in Afghanistan , officials said , in a stark acknowledgment that the United States is likely to continue to hold prisoners overseas for years to come .
The proposed detention center would replace the cavernous , makeshift American prison on the Bagram military base north of Kabul , which is now typically packed with about 630 prisoners , compared with the 270 held at GuantÃ¡namo Bay , Cuba .
Until now , the Bush administration had signaled that it intended to scale back American involvement in detention operations in Afghanistan .
It had planned to transfer a large majority of the prisoners to Afghan custody , in an American - financed , high - security prison outside Kabul to be guarded by Afghan soldiers .
But American officials now concede that the new Afghan - run prison cannot absorb all the Afghans now detained by the United States , much less the waves of new prisoners from the escalating fight against Al Qaeda and the Taliban .
The proposal for a new American prison at Bagram underscores the daunting scope and persistence of the United States military ’s detention problem , at a time when Bush administration officials continue to say they want to close down the facility at GuantÃ¡namo Bay .
Military officials have long been aware of serious problems with the existing detention center in Afghanistan , the Bagram Theater Internment Facility .
After the prison was set up in early 2002 , it became a primary site for screening prisoners captured in the fighting .
Harsh interrogation methods and sleep deprivation were used widely , and two Afghan detainees died there in December 2002 , after being repeatedly struck by American soldiers .
Conditions and treatment have improved markedly since then , but hundreds of Afghans and other men are still held in wire - mesh pens surrounded by coils of razor wire .
There are only minimal areas for the prisoners to exercise , and kitchen , shower and bathroom space is also inadequate .
Faced with that , American officials said they wanted to replace the Bagram prison , a converted aircraft hangar that still holds some of the decrepit aircraft - repair machinery left by the Soviet troops who occupied the country in the 1980s .
In its place the United States will build what officials described as a more modern and humane detention center that would usually accommodate about 600 detainees – or as many as 1,100 in a surge – and cost more than $ 60 million .
“ Our existing theater internment facility is deteriorating , ”  said Sandra L. Hodgkinson , the senior Pentagon official for detention policy , in a telephone interview .
“ It was renovated to do a temporary mission .
There is a sense that this is the right time to build a new facility . ” 
American officials also acknowledged that there are serious health risks to detainees and American military personnel who work at the Bagram prison , because of their exposure to heavy metals from the aircraft - repair machinery and asbestos .
“ It ’s just not suitable , ”  another Pentagon official said .
“ At some point , you have to say , “ ˜That ’s it .
This place was not made to keep people there indefinitely . ’ “
That point came about six months ago .
It became clear to Pentagon officials that the original plan of releasing some Afghan prisoners outright and transferring other detainees to Afghan custody would not come close to emptying the existing detention center .
Although a special Afghan court has been established to prosecute detainees formerly held at Bagram and GuantÃ¡namo , American officials have been hesitant to turn over those prisoners they consider most dangerous .
In late February the head of detainee operations in Iraq , Maj. Gen. Douglas M. Stone , traveled to Bagram to assess conditions there .
In Iraq , General Stone has encouraged prison officials to build ties to tribal leaders , families and communities , said a Congressional official who has been briefed on the general ’s work .
As a result , American officials are giving Iraqi detainees job training and engaging them in religious discussions to help prepare them to re-enter Iraqi society .
About 8,000 detainees have been released in Iraq since last September .
Fewer than 1 percent of them have been returned to the prison , said Lt. Cmdr. K. C. Marshall , General Stone ’s spokesman .
The new detention center at Bagram will incorporate some of the lessons learned by the United States in Iraq .
Classrooms will be built for vocational training and religious discussion , and there will be more space for recreation and family visits , officials said .
After years of entreaties by the International Committee of the Red Cross , the United States recently began to allow relatives to speak with prisoners at Bagram through video hookups .
“ The driving factor behind this is to ensure that in all instances we are giving the highest standards of treatment and care , ”  said Ms. Hodgkinson , who has briefed Senate and House officials on the construction plans .
The Pentagon is planning to use $ 60 million in emergency construction funds this fiscal year to build a complex of 6 to 10 semi- permanent structures resembling Quonset huts , each the size of a football field , a Defense Department official said .
The structures will have more natural light , and each will have its own recreation area .
There will be a half - dozen other buildings for administration , medical care and other purposes , the official said .
The new Bagram compound is expected to be built away from the existing center of operations on the base , on the other side of a long airfield from the headquarters building that now sits almost directly adjacent to the detention center , one military official said .
It will have its own perimeter security wall , and its own perimeter security guards , a change that will increase the number of soldiers required to operate the detention center .
The military plans to request $ 24 million in fiscal year 2009 and $ 7.4 million in fiscal year 2010 to pay for educational programs , job training and other parts of what American officials call a reintegration plan .
After that , the Pentagon plans to pay about $ 7 million a year in training and operational costs .
There has been mixed support for the project on Capitol Hill .
Two prominent Senate Democrats , Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia and Tim Johnson of South Dakota , have been briefed on the new American - run prison , and have praised the decision to make conditions there more humane .
But the senators , in a May 15 letter to the deputy defense secretary , Gordon England , demanded that the Pentagon explain its long - term plans for detention in Afghanistan and consult the Afghan government on the project .
The population at Bagram began to swell after administration officials halted the flow of prisoners to GuantÃ¡namo in September 2004 , a cutoff that largely remains in effect .
At the same time , the population of detainees at Bagram also began to rise with the resurgence of the Taliban .
Military personnel who know both Bagram and GuantÃ¡namo describe the Afghan site , 40 miles north of Kabul , as far more spartan .
Bagram prisoners have fewer privileges , less ability to contest their detention and no access to lawyers .
Some detainees have been held without charge for more than five years , officials said .
As of April , about 10 juveniles were being held at Bagram , according to a recent American report to a United Nations committee .
STOCKHOLM ( Reuters ) - A 58 - year - old man suspected of keeping a woman locked up in a tiny cabin in southern Sweden for nine years has been ordered by a court to be held in custody , local media reported .
The man , who denied all charges , was suspected of having kept his common - law wife imprisoned since 1999 in a cabin measuring 15 square meters in a small community near the town of Eksjo .
The woman , who suffers from multiple sclerosis , weighed less than 40 kilos ( 88 pounds ) when she was admitted to hospital earlier this week , Swedish television channel SVT reported on its website .
A prosecutor told news agency TT there was no indication this was due to ill treatment , but rather to her illness .
The woman was reported to be in stable condition and the court remanded her partner in custody on Friday , ordering that he be given a psychiatric examination , TT reported .
In a further twist to the case , authorities have not been able to verify the identity of the 58 - year - old .
The identity he provided to the police was that of a man who was declared dead eight years ago , according to official records .
The man was brought in for questioning and later arrested on Wednesday after suspicions had been aroused when the woman was brought to hospital a few days earlier .

Awesome update - we started using recaptcha about a year ago on some of our sites .
But the need for it on some sites disappeared as there was little to no spam .
However , we will be using it in several projects going forward .
I 'm thrilled to see that it has grown so much .

Though Sarah Palin depicts herself as a pit bull fighting good - old - boy politics , in her years as mayor she and her friends received special benefits more typical of small - town politics as usual , an Associated Press investigation shows .
When Palin needed to sell her house during her last year as Wasilla mayor , she got the city to sign off on a special zoning exception — and did so without keeping a promise to remove a potential fire hazard .
She gladly accepted gifts from merchants : A free “ awesome facial ” she raved about in a thank - you note to a spa .

( UPDATE : A correction to the information below relating to the fictitious Martin Eisenstadt has been published here . )
Just a short quick update on this crucial Paris Hilton political business so that the half of the globe now in darkness can go to bed in peace and the light of wisdom .
And we can all get on with Friday come daylight .
Late word Thursday night -- not surprising but late nonetheless -- that the Hilton family is rather unhappy with the campaign of Sen.
John McCain for including its scion , P.H. , in its controversial and therefore successful political campaign ad somehow attempting to link two famous or infamous female celebrities ( Britney Spears is the other ) with a certain Democratic presidential nominee - to - be .
If you need a refresher , you can watch the new McCain ad below .
But watch quickly because the two young ladies who are famous for being famous appear only briefly .
As The Ticket noted previously , P.H. 's ma and pa , Kathleen and Richard Hilton , have donated the $ 2,300 maximum to the McCain operation .
But there 's a lot more Hiltons around apparently , including Gramps Hilton ( William B. ) , who is the vast hotel empire 's co-chair .
And according to Martin Eisenstadt 's blog , he 's been quite the generous donor to the tune of more than $ 50 Gs to Republican campaign operations .
Not only that , he reports , but members of the Blackstone Group , the private equity group that bought into Hilton Hotels last year , have also been generous GOP donors .
And Marty says they 've expressed themselves angrily to McCain representatives in recent hours .
Ever the political maverick , McCain will no doubt cite such commercial insults to benefactors as proof that he 's not beholden to rich corporate types .
So if you give money to his Republican campaign , you too can have your children and grandchildren linked to something as blatantly nefarious as a Democrat 's campaign to show himself as beloved by Europeans who can't vote here on Nov. 4 .
Take that !

You 've got to hand it to the US .
We 've got the smoothest propaganda in the world .
The Nazis and the Soviet were so heavy handed .
And the Third World ?
Mostly amateur hour .
" Where are you papers ? "
That was the line in Nazi Germany and you can still hear it in tyrannies around the world .
There , a policeman can stop you any time , any place and demand that you show your federally approved ID or you 'll be subject to instant arrest and imprisonment .
That 's not the reality here now , but it 's clearly where we 're headed .
Some states are fighting back .
A study in northern China indicates that genetically modified cotton , altered to express the insecticide
Bt , not only reduces pest populations among those crops , but also reduces pests among other nearby crops that have not been modified with Bt .
These findings could offer promising new ideas for controlling pests and maximizing crop yields in the future .
Bt is an insecticide derived from the spores and toxic crystals of the bacteria Bacillus thuringiensis , and has been sold commercially since 1960 .
It is considered non-toxic to humans , animals , fish , plants , micro-organisms , and most insects .
However , it is highly selective and lethal to caterpillars of moths and butterflies .
Bt is currently registered and marketed for use as an insecticide in more than 50 countries worldwide .
It does not contaminate groundwater because it degrades so rapidly .
Dr. Kong -Ming
Wu from the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences in Beijing and colleagues analyzed data from 1997 to 2007 about the agriculture of Bt cotton in six provinces in northern China , covering 38 million hectares of farmland cultivated by 10 million resource - poor farmers .
They compared that information with data on pest populations in the region , focusing on the cotton bollworm , a serious pest for Chinese farmers .
The researchers say their results show that populations of the cotton bollworm were dramatically reduced with the introduction of Bt cotton , especially during the period from 2002 to 2006 .
They considered the contribution of temperature and rainfall along with the introduction of the genetically modified cotton , and confirmed that Bt cotton was responsible for the long - term suppression of the pests in the cotton and a host of other un-modified crops after 10 years .
Dr. Wu and colleagues suggest that this may be because cotton is the main host for bollworm eggs , and reducing larval populations in the cotton consequently reduces the entire population and protects other crops .
The authors say that Bt technology gives China a new tool for pest control , and that all farmers in a Bt cotton - planting region will experience the benefits .
" In 1992 , cotton bollworms caused about a 30 percent loss in the cotton yield in northern China .
Because of the high costs for pest control then , many farmers refused to plant cotton , " said Dr. Wu in an email interview .
" This case study of Bt cotton implies that other Bt crops , such as Bt rice , may also have great potential for agricultural practices in China .
This success with
Bt cotton could push forward the commercial processes of genetically modified crops in China . "
Dr. Jian - Zhou Zhao , a co-author of the report , also highlights the health benefits of using Bt cotton .
" Poisoning from other insecticides , and even death , was a big problem for cotton farmers in the 1990's , " Zhou said .
" Most farmers did not have proper protective clothes while applying insecticides with small backpack sprayers .
This may be another reason that many farmers refused to plant cotton before
Bt was available -- it was too dangerous and scary . "
The use of Bt cotton and other genetically modified crops could provide a safer and more economical solution to pest control in many small farms around the world .
Dr. Wu and the team of researchers , however , acknowledge that a major challenge to the success of Bt cotton is the potential for insects to evolve resistance to the insecticide .
They insist that despite its considerable value , Bt cotton should still be considered only one component in the overall management of pests .

CHARLOTTE , N.C. —
Kelly had an epiphany in her car two years ago on a lunch break .
She thought about the lifestyles of other people in their early 30s , her age .
They went out .
They had kids .
They led full lives .
When she thought about her own life , she burst into tears .
Her life revolved around her bingeing schedule .
Kelly 's plan that day :
Go home after work at 2:30 , binge and purge until her husband got home .
Dinner with him .
Binge and purge again .
Kelly , then 30 , reached two conclusions in her car that day :
The eating disorder she had since she was 15 years old could kill her .
She was the only one who could stop it .
Eating disorders among women age 30 and older in the United States are increasing .
Some women , like Kelly of Charlotte , N.C. , have suffered from an eating disorder most of their lives .
For others , there 's a trigger , like a divorce or a parent 's death .
Many feel overwhelmed by aging and the pressure to look young .
The medical complications of eating disorders tend to worsen as women age , says Angela Redlak , a clinical psychologist at the Renfrew Center Foundation in Charlotte , where Kelly is treated .
They are more prone to develop osteoporosis , dental erosion , heart disease and arthritis .
The chronic pain of these conditions causes many middle - aged women — unlike teenagers and women in their 20s — to acknowledge they have an eating disorder and seek help .
Tormented adolescence
Growing up in upstate New York , Kelly says she was always about 40 pounds overweight .
Her mom told her she would buy her clothes if she lost weight .
When Kelly started to like boys , she noticed they were n't attracted to overweight girls .
She was 15 when she read a magazine article about anorexia and bulimia and decided that would be the easiest way to get thin .
As soon as school let out for summer break after Kelly 's sophomore year , she started dieting .
When she went back to school in the fall , she 'd lost 35 pounds .
She weighed 123 pounds , a normal weight for her 5 - foot , 5 - inch , small - boned frame .
In six months later , her weight had dropped to 95 pounds .
During treatment for anorexia , she met some girls with bulimia , so she started binging and purging , too .
When people told her she looked too skinny , she felt emboldened to get even skinnier .
Then Kelly 's two best girlfriends walked away from her .
Boys made vomiting noises when she passed by in the school hall .
Eventually the message got through and she gained weight .
When her longtime boyfriend died in an ATV accident , Kelly turned to drugs , then alcohol .
She stopped eating .
In a new relationship she tried hiding her disorder , but every once in a while he suspected something .
She would tell him to mind his own business .
" I was sick of that life , " she said .
" It was having no life . "
Still , they married and moved to Charlotte three years ago .
But Kelly 's eating disorder moved with her .
A while after Kelly 's lunch - break epiphany , she contacted the Renfrew Center in south Charlotte .
" Eating disorders are very deceptive by nature , " says Redlak , Renfrew 's clinical supervisor .
To help pull women out of their disorder , Renfrew uses traditional talk therapy , group therapy , couples and family therapy .
When Kelly started going to group therapy , she was with younger girls .
" I was like , ' Look at what happens .
Do you want it to follow you ? ' " she said .
" It held me back from doing many things . "
When Kelly was in her 20s , she wanted to be a state trooper .
Looking back , she thinks she would have pursued a career had she not suffered from an eating disorder .
Now she works at a delivery company .
Affecting more women
After a year of therapy , Kelly says she is finally discovering who she is .
" I realize I 'm worth more than what I was doing to myself , " she said .
It is common for women age 30 and older to take responsibility for their disorder , says Redlak .
Between 20 and 30 percent of Redlak 's patients are over 30 , and the number is growing .
The trend seems to be true across the country , says Cynthia Bulik , director of the eating disorders program at University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill .
Fifty percent of her patients are older than 30 , and that number is rising , she says .
Bulik says societal pressure for lifelong thinness is prompting many women to develop the disorders later in life .
It usually has a devastating effect on their families .
Women who are 30 and older are often more motivated than adolescents to get help , Redlak says .
But they do n't necessarily have better outcomes , especially if they 've had an eating disorder for many years .
When Kelly was 15 , she was dismissed by her dietitian and heard her doctor blame her mother for her eating disorder .
Kelly does n't blame anyone anymore .
She focuses on getting better .
NAWBO and WBEA members attending HP Women in Business event
When speaking at events , I get the best response from talking less and asking more … in other words , encouraging the audience to share their examples and ideas .
It ’s more interactive that way .
It ’s more interesting .
Everybody benefits from a wider set of experiences .
The event I attended this past Monday with a group of small - business owners in Houston , Texas was no exception .
At that event I asked those attending whether they were using various social media websites and online Web 2.0 tools .
For those who responded “ yes ” I would then ask “ what kind of results are you getting ? ”
In this post I ’d like to share with you some of what those business owners said about using social media in real life situations .
About the Event
The event , entitled Women in Business , was hosted by HP for the benefit of Houston members of NAWBO ( National Association of Women Business Owners ) and WBEA ( Women ’s Business Enterprise Alliance ) .
It is part of HP ’s outreach to women businesspeople and small business owners , to create a dialog to better understand the issues small businesses face .
While most of the attendees were women , I counted about a half dozen men , too , mainly co-owners or employees of women - owned businesses .
This is the second event in the HP Women in Business series that I ’ve attended — the other being in San Diego .
Each one has been nicely low key and characterized by a real desire to talk back and forth … and listen .
Consequently , asking questions and getting the attendees to share their thoughts seemed very much in keeping with the overall tone of this event .
Good Experiences
Some of the positive Web 2.0 experiences that the business owners shared included these :
Blogs and Forums —
One business owner reported getting new / return business from participating in several discussion forums and blogs .
Her business is a muscle therapy business .
Being a source of information — i.e. , sharing knowledge and answering questions on the forums and blogs — demonstrates value for clients and potential clients .

LinkedIn — Several business owners reported good results from LinkedIn.com .
One , a business coach , gets high quality business leads from Linked In , via making connections and being findable in Linked In .
She points out that the people using Linked In tend to be professionals and corporate people ( i.e. , those in a position to actually hire a service provider ) .
Her experience was a good recommendation for Linked In , especially if you are a professional service provider .

One business owner admitted to being something of a Twitter - holic , using Twitter.com regularly to make and reinforce connections and to spread word of mouth about her business .
However , she was decidedly in the minority .

Concerns
One of the other things I did at this event was encourage questions .
Often questions reveal concerns that business owners have with using social media .
So it ’s a good way to find out what ’s bothering or puzzling people .
Here were some of the main concerns expressed :
Lacking time to learn and use social media tools —
The biggest concern expressed over and over was , “ who has time for all this social media stuff ? ”
As several others in the audience pointed out , the best strategy was to pick one or two tools and focus on doing those well .
Another spoke about dividing up the effort , by having several employees sharing the updating responsibilities on the company blog .
( As an aside , it seems to me there ’s a great business opportunity for some company to provide contract help to perform social media activities . )

Feeling uncomfortable putting information online —
One business owner said she frequently received connection requests for LinkedIn but had not felt comfortable putting her information on the Web .
Another business owner in the audience assured her she would not suffer a lot of spam through Linked In , but could actually make valuable connections with other credible business people .

Questioning the ROI —
One business owner wondered aloud if anyone ever got real business from these social media tools .
If the audience responses and experiences demonstrate anything , they show you can if you pick the social media tool that fits your type of business best .
Linked
In seems very good for business service professionals , whereas forums may be better when dealing with consumers who are researching answers to questions they have about health or purchases .

Questioning the difference between a blog and a forum —
Several people were unclear of the distinction between a blog and a discussion forum .
Although there are a number of differences , the chief one I pointed out was that on a blog , the blog owner controlled the subject matter to initiate discussing ( even though readers contribute to the discussion ) .
With a forum , anyone can initiate a discussion topic .

Wondering how to get started with a blog —
Several people asked how and where to get started with a blog .
I recommended experimenting with setting up a free blog at Blogger.com or WordPress.com , to see if you like blogging on a regular basis .
An audience member recommended Blogger.com as the blogging platform she uses .
There was much much more , but this gives you an idea of the experiences and also the concerns of small business owners around social media .

Some Mistakes of Moses
1879
Contents
Preface
F OR many years I have regarded the Pentateuch simply as a record of a barbarous people , in which are found a great number of the ceremonies of savagery , many absurd and unjust laws , and thousands of ideas inconsistent with known and demonstrated facts .
To me it seemed almost a crime to teach that this record was written by inspired men ; that slavery , polygamy , wars of conquest and extermination were right , and that there was a time when men could win the approbation of infinite Intelligence , Justice , and Mercy , by violating maidens and by butchering babes .
To me it seemed more reasonable that savage men had made these laws ; and I endeavored in a lecture , entitled " Some Mistakes of Moses , " to point out some of the errors , contradictions , and impossibilities contained in the Pentateuch .
The lecture was never written and consequently never delivered twice the same .
On several occasions it was reported and published without consent , and without revision .
All these publications were grossly and glaringly incorrect .
As published , they have been answered several hundred times , and many of the clergy are still engaged in the great work .
To keep these reverend gentlemen from wasting their talents on the mistakes of reporters and printers , I concluded to publish the principal points in all my lectures on this subject .
And here , it may be proper for one to say , that arguments cannot be answered by personal abuse ; that there is no logic in slander , and that falsehood , in the long run , defeats itself , People who love their enemies should , at least , tell the truth about their friends .
Should it turn out that I am the worst man in the whole world , the story of the flood will remain just as improbable as before , and the contradictions of the Pentateuch will still demand an explanation .
There was a time when a falsehood , fulminated from the pulpit , smote like a sword ; but , the supply having greatly exceeded the demand , clerical misrepresentation has at last become almost an innocent amusement .
Remembering that only a few years ago men , women , and even children , were imprisoned , tortured and burned , for having expressed in an exceedingly mild and gentle way , the ideas entertained by me , I congratulate myself that calumny is now the pulpit 's last resort .
The old instruments of torture are kept only to gratify curiosity ; the chains are rusting away , and the demolition of time has allowed even the dungeons of the Inquisition to be visited by light .
The church , impotent and malicious , regrets , not the abuse , but the loss of her power , and seeks to hold by falsehood what she gained by cruelty and force , by fire and fear .
Christianity cannot live in peace with any other form of faith .
If that religion be true , there is but one savior , one inspired book , and but one little narrow grass - grown path that leads to heaven .
Such a religion is necessarily uncompromising , unreasoning , aggressive and insolent .
Christianity has held all other creeds and forms in infinite contempt , divided the world into enemies and friends , and verified the awful declaration of its founder -- a declaration that wet with blood the sword he came to bring , and made the horizon of a thousand years lurid with the fagots ' flames .
Too great praise challenges attention , and often brings to light a thousand faults that otherwise the general eye would never see .
Were we allowed to read the Bible as we do all other books , we would admire its beauties , treasure its worthy thoughts , and account for all its absurd , grotesque and cruel things , by saying that its authors lived in rude , barbaric times .
But we are told that it was written by inspired men ; that it contains the will of God ; that it is perfect , pure , and true in all its parts ; the source and standard of all moral and religious truth ; that it is the star and anchor of all human hope ; the only guide for man , the only torch in Nature 's night .
These claims are so at variance with every known recorded fact , so palpably absurd , that every free , unbiased soul is forced to raise the standard of revolt .
We read the pagan sacred books with profit and delight .
With myth and fable we are ever charmed , and find a pleasure in the endless repetition of the beautiful , poetic , and absurd .
We find , in all these records of the past , philosophies and dreams , and efforts stained with tears , of great and tender souls who tried to pierce the mystery of life and death , to answer the eternal questions of the Whence and Whither , and vainly sought to make , with bits of shattered glass , a mirror that would , in very truth , reflect the face and form of Nature 's perfect self .
These myths were born of hopes , and fears , and tears , and smiles , and they were touched and colored by all there is of joy and grief between the rosy dawn of birth , and death 's sad night .
They clothed even the stars with passion , and gave to gods the faults and frailties of the sons of men .
In them , the winds and waves were music , and all the lakes , and streams , and springs , -- the mountains .
woods and perfumed dells were haunted by a thousand fairy forms .
They thrilled the veins of Spring with tremulous desire ; made tawny Summer 's billowed breast the throne and home of love ; filled Autumn 's arms with sun-kissed grapes , and gathered sheaves ; and pictured Winter as a weak old king who felt , like Lear upon his withered face , Cordelia 's tears .
These myths , though false , are beautiful , and have for many ages and in countless ways , enriched the heart and kindled thought .
But if the world were taught that all these things are true and all inspired of God , and that eternal punishment will be the lot of him who dares deny or doubt , the sweetest myth of all the Fable World would lose its beauty , and become a scorned and hateful thing to every brave and thoughtful man .
Robert G. Ingersoll
Washington , D.C. ,
Oct. 7th , 1879 .
Some Mistakes of Moses .
He Who Endeavors to Control the Mind by Force
is a Tyrant , He Who Submits is a Slave .
I WANT to do what little I can to make my country truly free , to broaden the intellectual horizon of our people , to destroy the prejudices born of ignorance and fear , to do away with the blind worship of the ignoble past , with the idea that all the great and good are dead , that the living are totally depraved , that all pleasures are sins , that sighs and groans are alone pleasing to God , that thought is dangerous , that intellectual courage is a crime , that cowardice is a virtue , that a certain belief is necessary to secure salvation , that to carry a cross in this world will give us a palm in the next , and that we must allow some priest to be the pilot of our souls .
Until every soul is freely permitted to investigate every book , and creed , and dogma for itself , the world can not be free .
Mankind will be enslaved until there is mental grandeur enough to allow each man to have his thought and say .
This earth will be a paradise when men can , upon all these questions differ , and yet grasp each other 's hands as friends .
It is amazing to me that a difference of opinion upon subjects that we know nothing with certainty about , should make us hate , persecute , and despise each other .
Why a difference of opinion upon predestination , or the Trinity , should make people imprison and burn each other seems beyond the comprehension of man ; and yet in all countries where Christians have existed , they have destroyed each other to the exact extent of their power .
Why should a believer in God hate an atheist ?
Surely the atheist has not injured God , and surely he is human , capable of joy and pain , and entitled to all the rights of man .
Would it not be far better to treat this atheist , at least , as well as he treats us ?
Christians tell me that they love their enemies , and yet all I ask is -- not that they love their enemies , not that they love their friends even , but that they treat those who differ from them , with simple fairness .
We do not wish to be forgiven , but we wish Christians to so act that we will not have to forgive them .
If all will admit that all have an equal right to think , then the question is forever solved ; but as long as organized and powerful churches , pretending to hold the keys of heaven and hell , denounce every person as an outcast and criminal who thinks for himself and denies their authority , the world will be filled with hatred and suffering .
To hate man and worship God seems to be the sum of all the creeds .
That which has happened in most countries has happened in ours .
When a religion is founded , the educated , the powerful -- that is to say , the priests and nobles , tell the ignorant and superstitious -- that is to say , the people , that the religion of their country was given to their fathers by God himself ; that it is the only true religion ; that all others were conceived in falsehood and brought forth in fraud , and that all who believe in the true religion will be happy forever , while all others will burn in hell .
For the purpose of governing the people , that is to say , for the purpose of being supported by the people , the priests and nobles declare this religion to be sacred , and that whoever adds to , or takes away from it , will be burned here by man , and hereafter by God .
The result of this is , that the priests and nobles will not allow the people to change ; and when , after a time , the priests , having intellectually advanced , wish to take a step in the direction of progress , the people will not allow them to change .
At first , the rabble are enslaved by the priests , and afterwards the rabble become the masters .
One of the first things I wish to do , is to free the orthodox clergy .
I am a great friend of theirs , and in spite of all they may say against me , I am going to do them a great and lasting service .
Upon their necks are visible the marks of the collar , and upon their backs those of the lash .
They are not allowed to read and think for themselves .
They are taught like parrots , and the best are those who repeat , with the fewest mistakes , the sentences they have been taught .
They sit like owls upon some dead limb of the tree of knowledge , and hoot the same old hoots that have been hooted for eighteen hundred years .
Their congregations are not grand enough , nor sufficiently civilized , to be willing that the poor preachers shall think for themselves .
They are not employed for that purpose .
Investigation is regarded as a dangerous experiment , and the ministers are warned that none of that kind of work will be tolerated .
They are notified to stand by the old creed , and to avoid all original thought , as a moral pestilence .
Every minister is employed like an attorney -- either for plaintiff or defendant , -- and he is expected to be true to his client .
If he changes his mind , he is regarded as a deserter , and denounced , hated , and slandered accordingly .
Every orthodox clergyman agrees not to change .
He contracts not to find new facts , and makes a bargain that he will deny them if he does .
Such is the position of a Protestant minister in this nineteenth century .
His condition excites my pity ; and to better it , I am going to do what little I can .
Some of the clergy have the independence to break away , and the intellect to maintain themselves as free men , but the most are compelled to submit to the dictation of the orthodox , and the dead .
They are not employed to give their thoughts , but simply to repeat the ideas of others .
They are not expected to give even the doubts that may suggest themselves , but are required to walk in the narrow , verdureless path trodden by the ignorance of the past .
The forests and fields on either side are nothing to them .
They must not even look at the purple hills , nor pause to hear the babble of the brooks .
They must remain in the dusty road where the guide - boards are .
They must confine themselves to the " fall of man , " " the expulsion from the garden , " the " scheme of salvation , " the " second birth , " the atonement , the happiness of the redeemed , and the misery of the lost .
They must be careful not to express any new ideas upon these great questions .
It is much safer for them to quote from the works of the dead .
The more vividly they describe the sufferings of the unregenerate , of those who attended theaters and balls , and drank wine in summer gardens on the Sabbath - day , and laughed at priests , the better ministers they are supposed to be .
They must show that misery fits the good for heaven , while happiness prepares the bad for hell ; that the wicked get all their good things in this life , and the good all their evil ; that in this world God punishes the people he loves , and in the next , the ones he hates ; that happiness makes us bad here , but not in heaven ; that pain makes us good here , but not in hell .
No matter how absurd these things may appear to the carnal mind , they must be preached and they must be believed .
If they were reasonable , there would be no virtue in believing .
Even the publicans and sin ners believe reasonable things .
To believe without evidence , or in spite of it , is accounted as righteousness to the sincere and humble Christian .
The ministers are in duty bound to denounce all intellectual pride , and show that we are never quite so dear to God as when we admit that we are poor , corrupt and idiotic worms ; that we never should have been born ; that we ought to be damned without the least delay ; that we are so infamous that we like to enjoy ourselves ; that we love our wives and children better than our God ; that we are generous only because we are vile ; that we are honest from the meanest motives , and that sometimes we have fallen so low that we have had doubts about the inspiration of the Jewish Scriptures .
In short , they are expected to denounce all pleasant paths and rustling trees , to curse the grass and flowers , and glorify the dust and weeds .
They are expected to malign the wicked people in the green and happy fields , who sit and laugh beside the gurgling springs or climb the hills and wander as they will .
They are expected to point out the dangers of freedom , the safety of implicit obedience , and to show the wickedness of philosophy , the goodness of faith , the immorality of science and the purity of ignorance .
Now and then a few pious people discover some young man of a religious turn of mind and a consumptive habit of holy , not quite sickly enough to die , nor healthy enough to be wicked .
The idea occurs to them that he would make a good orthodox minister .
They take up a contribution , and send the young man to some theological school where he can be taught to repeat a creed and despise reason .
Should it turn out that the young man had some mind of his own , and , after graduating , should change his opinions and preach a different doctrine from that taught in the school , every man who contributed a dollar towards his education would feel that he had been robbed , and would denounce him as a dishonest and ungrateful wretch .
The pulpit should not be a pillory .
Congregations should allow the minister a little liberty .
They should , at least , permit him to tell the truth .
They have , in Massachusetts , at a place called Andover , a kind of minister factory , where each professor takes an oath once in five years -- that time being considered the life of an oath -- that he has not , during the last five years , and will not , during the next five years , intellectually advance .
There is probably no oath that they could easier keep .
Prob ably , since the foundation stone of that institution was laid there has not been a single case of perjury .
The old creed is still taught .
They still insist that God is infinitely wise , powerful and good , and that all men are totally depraved .
They insist that the best man God ever made , deserved to be damned the moment he was finished .
Andover puts its brand upon every minister it turns out , the same as Sheffield and Birmingham brand their wares , and all who see the brand know exactly what the minister believes , the books he has read , the arguments he relies on , and just what he intellectually is .
They know just what he can be depended on to preach , and that he will continue to shrink and shrivel , and grow solemnly stupid day by day until he reaches the Andover of the grave and becomes truly orthodox forever .
I have not singled out the Andover factory because it is worse than the others .
They are all about the same .
The professors , for the most part , are ministers who failed in the pulpit and were retired to the seminary on account of their deficiency in reason and their excess of faith .
As a rule , they know nothing of this world , and far less of the next ; but they have the power of stating the most absurd propositions with faces solemn an stupidity touched by fear .
Something should be done for the liberation of these men .
They should be allowed to grow -- to have sunlight and air .
They should no longer be chained and tied to confessions of faith , to mouldy books and musty creeds .
Thousands of ministers are anxious to give their honest thoughts .
The hands of wives and babes now stop their mouths .
They must have bread , and so the husbands and fathers are forced to preach a doctrine that they hold in scorn .
For the sake of shelter , food and clothes , they are obliged to defend the childish miracles of the past , and denounce the sublime discoveries of to - day .
They are compelled to attack all modern thought , to point out the dangers of science , the wickedness of investigation and the corrupting influence of logic .
It is for them to show that virtue rests upon ignorance and faith , while vice impudently feeds and fattens upon fact and demonstration .
It is a part of their business to malign and vilify the Voltaires , Humes , Paines , Humboldts , Tyndalls , Haeckels , Darwins , Spencers , and Drapers , and to bow with uncovered heads before the murderers , adulterers , and persecutors of the world .
They are , for the most part , engaged in poisoning the minds of the young , prejudicing children against science , teaching the astronomy and geology of the Bible , and inducing all to desert the sublime standard of reason .
These orthodox ministers do not add to the sum of knowledge .
They produce nothing .
They live upon alms .
They hate laughter and joy .
They officiate at weddings , sprinkle water upon babes , and utter meaningless words and barren promises above the dead .
They laugh at the agony of unbelievers , mock at their tears , and of their sorrows make a jest .
There are some noble exceptions .
Now and then a pulpit holds a brave and honest man .
Their congregations are willing that they should think -- willing that their ministers should have a little freedom .
As we become civilized , more and more liberty will be accorded to these men , until finally ministers will give their best and highest thoughts .
The congregations will finally get tired of hearing about the patriarchs and saints , the miracles and wonders , and will insist upon knowing something about the men and women of our day , and the accomplishments and discoveries of our time .
They will finally insist upon knowing how to escape the evils of this world instead of the next .
They will ask light upon the enigmas of this life .
They will wish to know what we shall do with our criminals instead of what God will do with his -- how we shall do away with beggary and want -- with crime and misery -- with prostitution , disease and famine , -- with tyranny in all its cruel forms -- with prisons and scaffolds , and how we shall reward the honest workers , and fill the world with happy homes !
These are the problems for the pulpits and congregations of an enlightened future .
If Science cannot finally answer these questions , it is a vain and worthless thing .
The clergy , however , will continue to answer them in the old way , until their congregations are good enough to set them free .
They will still talk about believing in the Lord Jesus Christ , as though that were the only remedy for all human ills .
They will still teach , that retrogression is the only path that leads to light ; that we must go back , that faith is the only sure guide , and that reason is a delusive glare , lighting only the road to eternal pain .
Until the clergy are free they cannot be intellectually honest .
We can never tell what they really believe until they know that they can safely speak .
They console themselves now by a secret resolution to be as liberal as they dare , with the hope that they can finally educate their congregations to the point of allowing them to think a little for themselves .
They hardly know what they ought to do .
The best part of their lives has been wasted in studying subjects of no possible value .
Most of them are married , have families , and know but one way of making their living .
Some of them say that if they do not preach these foolish dogmas , others will , and that they may through fear , after all , restrain mankind .
Besides , they hate publicly to admit that they are mistaken , that the whole thing is a delusion , that the " scheme of salvation " is absurd , and that the Bible is no better than some other books , and worse than most .
You can hardly expect a bishop to leave his palace , or the pope to vacate the Vatican .
As long as people want popes , plenty of hypocrites will be found to take the place .
And as long as labor fatigues , there will be found a good many men willing to preach once a week , if other folks will work and give them bread .
In other words , while the demand lasts , the supply will never fail .
If the people were a little more ignorant , astrology would flourish -- if a little more enlightened , religion would perish !
Free Schools .
I T is also my desire to free the schools .
When a professor in a college finds a fact , he should make it known , even if it is inconsistent with something Moses said .
Public opinion must not compel the professor to hide a fact , and , " like the base Indian , throw the pearl away . "
With the single exception of Cornell , there is not a college in the United States where truth has ever been a welcome guest .
The moment one of the teachers denies the inspiration of the Bible , he is discharged .
If he discovers a fact inconsistent with that book , so much the worse for the fact , and especially for the discoverer of the fact .
He must not corrupt the minds of his pupils with demonstrations .
He must beware of every truth that cannot , in some way be made to harmonize with the superstitions of the Jews .
Science has nothing in common with religion .
Facts and miracles never did , and never will agree .
They are not in the least related .
They are deadly foes .
What has religion to do with facts ?
Nothing .
Can there be Methodist mathematics , Catholic astronomy , Presbyterian geology , Baptist biology , or Episcopal botany ?
Why , then , should a sectarian college exist ?
Only that which somebody knows should be taught in our schools .
We should not collect taxes to pay people for guessing .
The common school is the bread of life for the people , and it should not be touched by the withering hand of superstition .
Our country will never be filled with great institutions of learning until there is an absolute divorce between Church and School .
As long as the mutilated records of a barbarous people are placed by priest and professor above the reason of mankind , we shall reap but little benefit from church or school .
Instead of dismissing professors for finding something out , let us rather discharge those who do not .
Let each teacher understand that investigation is not dangerous for him ; that his bread is safe , no matter how much truth he may discover , and that his salary will not be reduced , simply because he finds that the ancient Jews did not know the entire history of the world .
Besides , it is not fair to make the Catholic support a Protestant school , nor is it just to collect taxes from infidels and atheists to support schools in which any system of religion is taught .
The sciences are not sectarian .
People do not persecute each other on account of disagreements in mathematics .
Families are not divided about botany , and astronomy does not even tend to make a man hate his father and mother .
It is what people do not know , that they persecute each other about .
Science will bring , not a sword ' but peace .
Just as long as religion has control of the schools , science will be an outcast .
Let us free our institutions of learning .
Let us dedicate them to the science of eternal truth .
Let us tell every teacher to ascertain all the facts he can -- to give us light , to follow Nature , no matter where she leads ; to be infinitely true to himself and us ; to feel that he is without a chain , except the obligation to be honest ; that he is bound by no books , by no creed , neither by the sayings of the dead nor of the living ; that he is asked to look with his own eyes , to reason for himself without fear , to investigate in every possible direction , and to bring us the fruit of all his work .
At present , a good many men engaged in scientific pursuits , and who have signally failed in gaining recognition among their fellows , are endeavoring to make reputations among the churches by delivering weak and vapid lectures upon the " harmony of Genesis and Geology . "
Like all hypocrites , these men overstate the case to such a degree , and so turn and pervert facts and words that they succeed only in gaining the applause of other hypocrites like themselves .
Among the great scientists they are regarded as generals regard sutlers who trade with both armies .
Surely the time must come when the wealth of the world will not be wasted in the propagation of ignorant creeds and miraculous mistakes .
The time must come when churches and cathedrals will be dedicated to the use of man ; when minister and priest will deem the discoveries of the living of more importance than the errors of the dead ; when the truths of Nature will outrank the " sacred " falsehoods of the past , and when a single fact will outweigh all the miracles of Holy Writ .
Who can over estimate the progress of the world if all the money wasted in superstition could be used to enlighten , elevate and civilize mankind ?
When every church becomes a school , every cathedral a university , every clergyman a teacher , and all their hearers brave and honest thinkers , then , and not until then , will the dream of poet , patriot , philanthropist and philosopher , become a real and blessed truth .
The Politicians .
I WOULD like also to liberate the politician .
At present , the successful office - seeker is a good deal like the centre of the earth ; he weighs nothing himself but draws everything else to him .
There are so many societies , so many churches , so many isms , that it is almost impossible for an independent man to succeed in a political career .
Candidates are forced to pretend that they are Catholics with Protestant proclivities , or Christians with liberal tendencies , or temperance men who now and then take a glass of wine , or , that although not members of any church their wives are , and that they subscribe liberally to all .
The result of all this is that we reward hypocrisy and elect men entirely destitute of real principle ; and this will never change until the people become grand enough to allow each other to do their own thinking .
Our Government should be entirely and purely secular .
The religious views of a candidate should be kept entirely out of sight .
He should not be compelled to give his opinion as to the inspiration of the Bible , the propriety of infant baptism , or the immaculate conception .
All these things are private and personal .
He should be allowed to settle such things for himself and should he decide contrary to the law and will of God , let him settle the matter with God .
The people ought to be wise enough to select as their officers men who know something of political affairs , who comprehend the present greatness , and clearly perceive the future grandeur of our country .
If we were in a storm at sea , with deck wave - washed and masts strained and bent with storm , and it was necessary to reef the top sail , we certainly would not ask the brave sailor who volunteered to go aloft , what his opinion was on the five points of Calvinism .
Our Government has nothing to do with religion .
It is neither Christian nor pagan ; it is secular .
But as long as the people persist in voting for or against men on account of their religious views , just so long will hypocrisy hold place and power .
Just so long will the candidates crawl in the dust -- hide their opinions , flatter those with whom they differ , pretend to agree with those whom they despise ; and just so long will honest men be trampled under foot .
Churches are becoming political organizations .
Nearly every Catholic is a Democrat ; nearly every Methodist in the North is a Republican .
It probably will not be long until the churches will divide as sharply upon political , as upon theological questions ; and when that day comes , if there are not liberals enough to hold the balance of power , this Government will be destroyed .
The liberty of man is not safe in the hands of any church .
Wherever the Bible and sword are in partnership , man is a slave .
All laws for the purpose of making man worship God , are born of the same spirit that kindled the fires of the auto da fe , and lovingly built the dungeons of the Inquisition .
All laws defining and punishing blasphemy -- making it a crime to give your honest ideas about the Bible , or to laugh at the ignorance of the ancient Jews , or to enjoy yourself on the Sabbath , or to give your opinion of Jehovah , were passed by impudent bigots , and should be at once repealed by honest men .
An infinite God ought to be able to protect himself , without going in partnership with State Legislatures .
Certainly he ought not so to act that laws become necessary to keep him from being laughed at .
No one thinks of protecting Shakespeare from ridicule , by the threat of fine and imprisonment .
It strikes me that God might write a book that would not necessarily excite the laughter of his children .
In fact , I think it would be safe to say that a real God could produce a work that would excite the admiration of mankind .
Surely politicians could be better employed than in passing laws to protect the literary reputation of the Jewish God .
Man and Woman .
L ET us forget that we are Baptists , Methodists , Catholics , Presbyterians , or Freethinkers , and remember only that we are men and women .
After all , man and woman are the highest possible titles .
All other names belittle us , and show that we have , to a certain extent , given up our individuality , and have consented to wear the collar of authority -- that we are followers .
Throwing away these names , let us examine these questions not as partisans , but as human beings with hopes and fears in common .
We know that our opinions depend , to a great degree , upon our surroundings -- upon race , country , and education .
We are all the result of numberless conditions , and inherit vices and virtues , truths and prejudices .
If we had been born in England , surrounded by wealth and clothed with power , most of us would have been Episcopalians , and believed in church and state .
We should have insisted that the people needed a religion , and that not having intellect enough to provide one for themselves , it was our duty to make one for them , and then compel them to support it .
We should have believed it indecent to officiate in a pulpit without wearing a gown , and that prayers should be read from a book .
Had we belonged to the lower classes , we might have been dissenters and protested against the mummeries of the High Church .
Had we been born in Turkey , most of us would have been Mohammedans and believed in the inspiration of the Koran .
We should have believed that Mohammed actually visited heaven and became acquainted with an angel by the name of Gabriel , who was so broad between the eyes that it required three hundred days for a very smart camel to travel the distance .
If some man had denied this story we should probably have denounced him as a dangerous person , one who was endeavoring to undermine the foundations of society , and to destroy all distinction between virtue and vice .
We should have said to him , " What do you propose to give us in place of that angel ?
We can not afford to give up an angel of that size for nothing . "
We would have insisted that the best and wisest men believed the Koran .
We would have quoted from the works and letters of philosophers , generals and sultans , to show that the Koran was the best of books , and that Turkey was indebted to that book and to that alone for its greatness and prosperity .
We would have asked that man whether he knew more than all the great minds of his country , whether he was so much wiser than his fathers ?
We would have pointed out to him the fact that thousands had been consoled in the hour of death by passages from the Koran ; that they had died with glazed eyes brightened by visions of the heavenly harem , and gladly left this world of grief and tears .
We would have regarded Christians as the vilest of men , and on all occasions would have repeated " There is but one God , and Mohammed is his prophet ! "
So , if we had been born in India , we should in all probability have believed in the religion of that country .
We should have regarded the old records as true and sacred , and looked upon a wandering priest as better than the men from whom he begged , and by whose labor he lived .
We should have believed in a god with three heads instead of three gods with one head , as we do now .
Now and then some one says that the religion of his father and mother is good enough for him , and wonders why anybody should desire a better .
Surely we are not bound to follow our parents in religion any more than in politics , science or art .
China has been petrified by the worship of ancestors .
If our parents had been satisfied with the religion of theirs , we would be still less advanced than we are .
If we are , in any way , bound by the belief of our fathers , the doctrine will hold good back to the first people who had a religion ; and if this doctrine is true , we ought now to be believers in that first religion .
In other words , we would all be barbarians .
You can not show real respect to your parents by perpetuating their errors .
Good fathers and mothers wish their children to advance , to overcome obstacles which baffled them , and to correct the errors of their education .
If you wish to reflect credit upon your parents , accomplish more than they did , solve problems that they could not understand , and build better than they knew .
To sacrifice your manhood upon the grave of your father is an honor to neither .
Why should a son who has examined a subject , throw away his reason and adopt the views of his mother ?
Is not such a course dishonorable to both ?
We must remember that this " ancestor " argument is as old at least as the second generation of men , that it has served no purpose except to enslave mankind , and results mostly from the fact that acquiescence is easier than investigation .
This argument pushed to its logical conclusion , would prevent the advance of all people whose parents were not Freethinkers .
It is hard for many people to give up the religion in which they were born ; to admit that their fathers were utterly mistaken , and that the sacred records of their country are but collections of myths and fables .
But when we look for a moment at the world , we find that each nation has its " sacred records " -- its religion , and its ideas of worship .
Certainly all cannot be right ; and as it would require a life time to investigate the claims of these various systems , it is hardly fair to damn a man forever , simply because he happens to believe the wrong one .
All these religions were produced by barbarians .
Civilized nations have contented themselves with changing the religions of their barbaric ancestors , but they have made none .
Nearly all these religions are intensely selfish .
Each one was made by some con temptible little nation that regarded itself as of almost infinite importance , and looked upon the other nations as beneath the notice of their god .
In all these countries it was a crime to deny the sacred records , to laugh at the priests , to speak disrespectfully of the gods , to fail to divide your substance with the lazy hypocrites who managed your affairs in the next world upon condition that you would support them in this .
In the olden time these theological people who quartered themselves upon the honest and industrious , were called soothsayers , seers , charmers , prophets , enchanters , sorcerers , wizards , astrologers , and impostors , but now , they are known as clergymen .
We are no exception to the general rule , and consequently have our sacred books as well as the rest .
Of course , it is claimed by many of our people that our books are the only true ones , the only ones that the real God ever wrote , or had anything whatever to do with .
They insist that all other sacred books were written by hypocrites and impostors ; that the Jews were the only people that God ever had any personal intercourse with , and that all other prophets and seers were inspired only by impudence and mendacity .
True , it seems somewhat strange that God should have chosen a barbarous and unknown people who had little or nothing to do with the other nations of the earth , as his messengers to the rest of mankind .
It is not easy to account for an infinite God making people so low in the scale of intellect as to require a revelation .
Neither is it easy to perceive why , if a revelation was necessary for all , it was made only to a few .
Of course , I know that it is extremely wicked to suggest these thoughts , and that ignorance is the only armor that can effectually protect you from the wrath of God .
I am aware that investigators with all their genius , never find the road to heaven ; that those who look where they are going are sure to miss it , and that only those who voluntarily put out their eyes and implicitly depend upon blindness can surely keep the narrow path .
Whoever reads our sacred book is compelled to believe it or suffer forever the torments of the lost .
We are told that we have the privilege of examining it for ourselves ; but this privilege is only extended to us on the condition that we believe it whether it appears reasonable or not .
We may disagree with others as much as we please upon the meaning of all passages in the Bible , but we must not deny the truth of a single word .
We must believe that the book is inspired .
If we obey its every precept without believing in its inspiration we will be damned just as certainly as though we disobeyed its every word .
We have no right to weigh it in the scales of reason -- to test it by the laws of nature , or the facts of observation and experience .
To do this , we are told , is to put ourselves above the word of God , and sit in judgment on the works of our creator .
For my part , I cannot admit that belief is a voluntary thing .
It seems to me that evidence , even in spite of ourselves , will have its weight , and that whatever our wish may be , we are compelled to stand with fairness by the scales , and give the exact result .
It will not do to say that we reject the Bible because we are wicked .
Our wickedness must be ascertained not from our belief but from our acts .
I am told by the clergy that I ought not to attack the Bible ; that I am leading thousands to perdition and rendering certain the damnation of my own soul .
They have had the kindness to advise me that , if my object is to make converts , I am pursuing the wrong course .
They tell me to use gentler expressions , and more cunning words .
Do they really wish me to make more converts ?
If their advice is honest , they are traitors to their trust .
If their advice is not honest , then they are unfair with me .
Certainly they should wish me to pursue the course that will make the fewest converts , and yet they pretend to tell me how my influence could be increased .
It may be , that upon this principle John Bright advises America to adopt free trade , so that our country can become a successful rival of Great Britain .
Sometimes I think that even ministers are not entirely candid .
Notwithstanding the advice of the clergy , I have concluded to pursue my own course , to tell my honest thoughts , and to have my freedom in this world whatever my fate may be in the next .
The real oppressor , enslaver and corrupter of the people is the Bible .
That book is the chain that binds , the dungeon that holds the clergy .
That book spreads the pall of superstition over the colleges and schools .
That book puts out the eyes of science , and makes honest investigation a crime .
That book unmans the politician and degrades the people .
That book fills the world with bigotry , hypocrisy and fear .
It plays the same part in our country that has been played by " sacred records " in all the nations of the world .
A little while ago I saw one of the Bibles of the Middle Ages .
It was about two feet in length , and one and a half in width .
It had immense oaken covers , with hasps , and clasps , and hinges large enough almost for the doors of a penitentiary .
It was covered with pictures of winged angels and aureoled saints .
In my imagination I saw this book carried to the cathedral altar in solemn pomp -- heard the chant of robed and kneeling priests , felt the strange tremor of the organ 's peal ; saw the colored light streaming through windows stained and touched by blood and flame -- the swinging censer with its perfumed incense rising to the mighty roof , dim with height and rich with legend carved in stone , while on the walls was hung , written in light , and shade , and all the colors that can tell of joy and tears , the pictured history of the martyred Christ .
The people fell upon their knees .
The book was opened , and the priest read the messages from God to man .
To the multitude , the book itself was evidence enough that it was not the work of human hands .
How could those little marks and lines and dots contain , like tombs , the thoughts of men , and how could they , touched by a ray of light from human eyes , give up their dead ?
How could these characters span the vast chasm dividing the present from the past , and make it possible for the living still to hear the voices of the dead ?
The Pentateuch .
T HE first five books in our Bible are known as the Pentateuch .
For a long time it was supposed that Moses was the author , and among the ignorant the supposition still prevails .
As a matter of fact , it seems to be well settled that Moses had nothing to do with these books , and that they were not written until he had been dust and ashes for hundreds of years .
But , as all the churches still insist that he was the author , that he wrote even an account of his own death and burial , let us speak of him as though these books were in fact written by him .
As the Christians maintain that God was the real author , it makes but little difference whom he employed as his pen , or clerk .
Nearly all authors of sacred books have given an account of the creation of the universe , the origin of matter , and the destiny of the human race .
Nearly all have pointed out the obligation that man is under to his creator for having placed him upon the earth , and allowed him to live and suffer , and have taught that nothing short of the most abject worship could possibly compensate God for his trouble and labor suffered and done for the good of man .
They have nearly all insisted that we should thank God for all that is good in life but they have not all informed us as to whom we should hold responsible for the evils we endure .
Moses differed from most of the makers of sacred books by his failure to say anything of a future life , by failing to promise heaven , and to threaten hell .
Upon the subject of a future state , there is not one word in the Pentateuch .
Probably at that early day God did not deem it important to make a revelation as to the eternal destiny of man .
He seems to have thought that he could control the Jews , at least , by rewards and punishments in this world , and so he kept the frightful realities of eternal joy and torment a profound secret from the people of his choice .
He thought it far more important to tell the Jews their origin than to enlighten them as to their destiny .
We must remember that every tribe and nation has some way in which the more striking phenomena of nature are accounted for .
These accounts are handed down by tradition , changed by numberless narrators as intelligence increases , or to account for newly discovered facts , or for the purpose of satisfying the appetite for the marvelous .
The way in which a tribe or nation accounts for day and night , the change of seasons , the fall of snow and rain , the flight of birds , the origin of the rainbow , the peculiarities of animals , the dreams of sleep , the visions of the insane , the existence of earthquakes , volcanoes , storms , lightning and the thousand things that attract the attention and excite the wonder , fear or admiration of mankind , may be called the philosophy of that tribe or nation .
And as all phenomena are , by savage and barbaric man accounted for as the action of intelligent beings for the accomplishment of certain objects , and as these beings were supposed to have the power to assist or injure man , certain things were supposed necessary for man to do in order to gain the assistance , and avoid the anger of these gods .
Out of this belief grew certain ceremonies , and these ceremonies united with the belief , formed religion ; and consequently every religion has for its foundation a misconception of the cause of phenomena .
All worship is necessarily based upon the belief that some being exists who can , if he will , change the natural order of events .
The savage prays to a stone that he calls a god , while the Christian prays to a god that he calls a spirit , and the prayers of both are equally useful .
The savage and the Christian put behind the Universe an intelligent cause , and this cause whether represented by one god or many , has been , in all ages , the object of all worship .
To carry a fetich , to utter a prayer , to count beads , to abstain from food , to sacrifice a lamb , a child or an enemy , are simply different ways by which the accomplishment of the same object is sought , and are all the offspring of the same error .
Many systems of religion must have existed many ages before the art of writing was discovered , and must have passed through many changes before the stories , miracles , histories , prophecies and mistakes became fixed and petrified in written words .
After that , change was possible only by giving new meanings to old words , a process rendered necessary by the continual acquisition of facts somewhat inconsistent with a literal interpretation of the " sacred records . "
In this way an honest faith often prolongs its life by dishonest methods ; and in this way the Christians of to - day are trying to harmonize the Mosaic account of creation with the theories and discoveries of modern science .
Admitting that Moses was the author of the Pentateuch , or that he gave to the Jews a religion , the question arises as to where he obtained his information .
We are told by the theologians that he received his knowledge from God , and that every word he wrote was and is the exact truth .
It is admitted at the same time that he was an adopted son of Pharaoh 's daughter , and enjoyed the rank and privilege of a prince .
Under such circumstances , he must have been well acquainted with the literature , philosophy and religion of the Egyptians , and must have known what they believed and taught as to the creation of the world .
Now , if the account of the origin of this earth as given by Moses is substantially like that given by the Egyptians , then we must conclude that he learned it from them .
Should we imagine that he was divinely inspired because he gave to the Jews what the Egyptians had given him ?
The Egyptian priests taught first , that a god created the " original matter " leaving it in a state of chaos ; second , that a god molded it into from ; third , that the breath of a god moved upon the face of the deep ; fourth , that a god created simply by saying " Let it be ; " fifth , that a god created light before the sun existed .
Nothing can be clearer than that Moses received from the Egyptians the principal parts of his narrative , making such changes and additions as were necessary to satisfy the peculiar superstitions of his own people .
If some man at the present day should assert that he had received from God the theories of evolution , the survival of the fittest , and the law of heredity , and we should afterwards find that he was not only an Englishman , but had lived in the family of Charles Darwin , we certainly would account for his having these theories in a natural way .
So , if Darwin himself should pretend that he was inspired , and had obtained his peculiar theories from God , we should probably reply that his grandfather suggested the same ideas , and that Lamarck published substantially the same theories the same year that Mr. Darwin was born .
Now , if we have sufficient courage , we will , by the same course of reasoning , account for the story of creation found in the Bible .
We will say that it contains the belief of Moses , and that he received his information from the Egyptians , and not from God .
If we take the account as the absolute truth and use it for the purpose of determining the value of modern thought , scientific advancement becomes impossible .
And even if the account of the creation as given by Moses should turn out to be true , and should be so admitted by all the scientific world , the claim that he was inspired would still be without the least particle of proof .
We would be forced to admit that he knew more than we had supposed .
It certainly is no proof that a man is inspired simply because he is right .
No one pretends that Shakespeare was inspired , and yet all the writers of the books of the Old Testament put together , could not have produced Hamlet .
Why should we , looking upon some rough and awkward thing , or god in stone , say that it must have been produced by some inspired sculptor , and with the same breath pronounce the Venus de Milo to be the work of man ?
Why should we , looking at some ancient daub of angel , saint or virgin , say its painter must have been assisted by a god ?
Let us account for all we see by the facts we know .
If there are things for which we cannot account , let us wait for light .
To account for anything by supernatural agencies is , in fact to say that we do not know .
Theology is not what we know about God , but what we do not know about Nature .
In order to increase our respect for the Bible , it became necessary for the priests to exalt and extol that book , and at the same time to decry and belittle the reasoning powers of man .
The whole power of the pulpit has been used for hundreds of years to destroy the confidence of man in himself -- to induce him to distrust his own powers of thought , to believe that he was wholly unable to decide any question for himself and that all human virtue consists in faith and obedience .
The church has said , " Believe , and obey !
If you reason , you will become an unbeliever , and unbelievers will be lost .
If you disobey , you will do so through vain pride and curiosity , and will , like Adam and Eve , be thrust from Paradise forever .
For my part I care nothing for what the church says , except in so far as it accords with my reason ; and the Bible is nothing to me , only in so far as it agrees with what I think or know .
All books should be examined in the same spirit , and truth should be welcomed and falsehood exposed , no matter in what volume they may be found .
Let us in this spirit examine the Pentateuch ; and if anything appears unreasonable , contradictory or absurd , let us have the honesty and courage to admit it .
Certainly no good can result either from deceiving ourselves or others .
Many millions have implicitly believed this book , and have just as implicitly believed that polygamy was sanctioned by God .
Millions have regarded this book as the foundation of all human progress , and at the same time looked upon slavery as a divine institution .
Millions have declared this book to have been infinitely holy , and to prove that they were right , have imprisoned , robbed and burned their fellow - men .
The inspiration of this hook has been established by famine , sword and fire , by dungeon , chain and whip , by dagger and by rack , by force and fear and fraud , and generations have been frightened by threats of hell , and bribed with promises of heaven .
Let us examine a portion of this book , not in the darkness of our fear , but in the light of reason .
And first , let us examine the account given of the creation of this world , commenced , according to the Bible , on Monday morning about five thousand eight hundred and eighty - three years ago .
Monday .
M OSES commences his story by telling us that in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth .
If this means anything , it means that God produced , caused to exist , called into being , the heaven and the earth .
It will not do to say that he formed the heaven and the earth of previously existing matter .
Moses conveys , and intended to convey the idea that the matter of which the heaven and the earth are composed , was created .
It is impossible for me to conceive of something being created from nothing .
Nothing , regarded in the light of a raw material , is a decided failure .
I can not conceive of matter apart from force .
Neither is it possible to think of force disconnected with matter .
You can not imagine matter going back to absolute nothing .
Neither can you imagine nothing being changed into something .
You may be eternally damned if you do not say that you can conceive these things , but you cannot conceive them .
Such is the constitution of the human mind that it cannot even think of a commencement or an end of matter , or force .
If God created the universe , there was a time when he commenced to create .
Back of that commencement there must have been an eternity .
In that eternity what was this God doing ?
He certainly did not think .
There was nothing to think about .
He did not remember .
Nothing had ever happened .
What did he do ?
Can you imagine anything more absurd than an infinite intelligence in infinite nothing wasting an eternity ?
I do not pretend to tell how all these things really are ; but I do insist that a statement that cannot possibly be comprehended by any human being , and that appears utterly impossible , repugnant to every fact of experience , and contrary to everything that we really know , must be rejected by every honest man .
We can conceive of eternity , because we cannot conceive of a cessation of time .
We can conceive of infinite space because we cannot conceive of so much matter that our imagination will not stand upon the farthest star , and see infinite space beyond .
In other words , we cannot conceive of a cessation of time ; therefore eternity is a necessity of the mind .
Eternity sustains the same relation to time that space does to matter .
In the time of Moses , it was perfectly safe for him to write an account of the creation of the world .
He had simply to put in form the crude notions of the people .
At that time , no other Jew could have written a better account .
Upon that subject he felt at liberty to give his imagination full play .
There was no one who could authoritatively contradict anything he might say .
lt was substantially the same story that had been imprinted in curious characters upon the clay records of Babylon , the gigantic monuments , of Egypt , and the gloomy temples of India .
In those days there was an almost infinite difference between the educated and ignorant .
The people were controlled almost entirely by signs and wonders .
By the lever of fear , priests moved the world .
The sacred records were made and kept , and altered by them .
The people could not read , and looked upon one who could , as almost a god .
In our day it is hard to conceive of the influence of an educated class in a barbarous age .
It was only necessary to produce the " sacred record , " and ignorance fell upon its face .
The people were taught that the record was inspired , and therefore true .
They were not taught that it was true , and therefore inspired .
After all , the real question is not whether the Bible is inspired , but whether it is true .
If it is true , it does not need to be inspired .
If it is true , it makes no difference whether it was written by a man or a god .
The multiplication table is just as useful , just as true as though God had arranged the figures himself .
If the Bible is really true , the claim of inspiration need not be urged ; and if it is not true , its inspiration can hardly be established .
As a matter of fact , the truth does not need to be inspired .
Nothing needs inspiration except a falsehood or a mistake .
Where truth ends , where probability stops , inspiration begins .
A fact never went into partnership with a miracle .
Truth does not need the assistance of miracle .
A fact will fit every other fact in the Universe , because it is the product of all other facts .
A lie will fit nothing except another lie made for the express purpose of fitting it .
Alter a while the man gets tired of lying , and then the last lie will not fit the next fact , and then there is an opportunity to use a miracle .
Just at that point , it is necessary to have a little inspiration .
It seems to me that reason is the highest attribute of man , and that if there can be any communication from God to man , it must be addressed to his reason .
It does not seem possible that in order to understand a message from God it is absolutely essential to throw our reason away .
How could God make known his will to any being destitute of reason ?
How can any man accept as a revelation from God that which is unreasonable to him ?
God can not make a revelation to another man for me .
He must make it to me , and until he convinces my reason that it is true , I can not receive it .
The statement that in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth , I can not accept .
It is contrary to my reason , and I can not believe it .
It appears reasonable to me that force has existed from eternity .
Force cannot , as it appears to me , exist apart from matter .
Force , in its nature , is forever active , and without matter it could not act and so I think matter must have existed forever .
To conceive of matter without force , or of force without matter , or of a time when neither existed , or of a being who existed for an eternity without either , and who out of nothing created both , is to me utterly impossible .
I may be damned on this account , but I can not help it .
In my judgment , Moses was mistaken .
It will not do to say that Moses merely intended to tell what God did , in making the heavens and the earth out of matter then in existence .
He distinctly states that in the beginning God created them .
If this account is true , we must believe that God , existing in infinite space surrounded by eternal nothing , naught and void , created , produced , called into being , willed into existence this universe of countless stars .
The next thing we are told by this inspired gentleman is that God created light , and proceeded to divide it from the darkness .
Certainly , the person who wrote this believed that darkness was a thing , an entity , a material that could get mixed and tangled up with light , and that these entities , light and darkness , had to be separated .
In his imagination he probably saw God throwing pieces and chunks of darkness on one side , and rays and beams of light on the other .
It is hard for a man who has been born but once to understand these things .
For my part , I cannot understand how light can be separated from darkness .
I had always supposed that darkness was simply the absence of light , and that under no circumstances could it be necessary to take the darkness away from the light .
It is certain , however , that Moses believed darkness to be a form of matter , because I find that in another place he speaks of a darkness that could be felt .
They used to have on exhibition at Rome a bottle of the darkness that overspread Egypt .
You cannot divide light from darkness any more than you can divide heat from cold .
Cold is an absence of heat , and darkness is an absence of light .
I suppose that we have no conception of absolute cold .
We know only degrees of heat .
Twenty degrees below zero is just twenty degrees warmer than forty degrees below zero .
Neither cold nor darkness are entities , and these words express simply either the absolute or partial absence of heat or light .
I cannot conceive how light can be divided from darkness , but I can conceive how a barbarian several thousand years ago , writing upon a subject about which he knew nothing , could make a mistake .
The creator of light could not have written in this way .
If such a being exists , he must have known the nature of that " mode of motion " that paints the earth on every eye , and clothes in garments seven - hued this universe of worlds .
Tuesday .
W E are next informed by Moses that " God said let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters and let it divide the waters from the waters ; " and that " God made the firmament , and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament . "
What did the writer mean by the word firmament ?
Theologians now tell us that he meant an " expanse . "
This will not do .
How could an expanse divide the waters from the waters , so that waters above the expanse would not fall into and mingle with the waters below the expanse ?
The truth is that Moses regarded the firmament as a solid affair .
It was where God lived , and where water was kept .
It was for this reason that they used to pray for rain .
They supposed that some angel could with a lever raise a gate and let out the quantity of moisture desired .
It was with the water from this firmament that the world was drowned when the windows of heaven were opened .
It was in this firmament that the sons of God lived -- the sons who " saw the daughters of men that they were fair and took them wives of all which they chose . "
The issue of such marriages were giants , and " the same became mighty men which were of old , men of renown . "
Nothing is clearer than that Moses regarded the firmament as a vast material division that separated the waters of the world , and upon whose floor God lived , surrounded by his sons .
In no other way could he account for rain .
Where did the water come from ?
He knew nothing about the laws of evaporation .
He did not know that the sun wooed with amorous kisses the waves of the sea , and that they , clad in glorified mist rising to meet their lover , were , by disappointment , changed to tears and fell as rain .
The idea that the firmament was the abode of the Deity must have been in the mind of Moses when he related the dream of Jacob .
" And he dreamed , and behold , a ladder set upon the earth and the top of it reached to heaven ; and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it ; and behold the Lord stood above it and said , I am the Lord God . "
So , when the people were building the tower of Babel " the Lord came down to see the city , and the tower which the children of men builded .
And the Lord said , Behold the people is one , and they have all one language ; and this they begin to do ; and nothing will be restrained from them which they imagined to do .
Go to , let us go down and confound their language that they may not understand one another 's speech . "
The man who wrote that absurd account must have believed that God lived above the earth , in the firmament .
The same idea was in the mind of the Psalmist when he said that God " bowed the heavens and came down . "
Of course , God could easily remove any person bodily to heaven , as it was but a little way above the earth .
" Enoch walked with God " and he was not , for God took him . "
The accounts in the Bible of the ascension of Elijah , Christ and St. Paul were born of the belief that the firmament was the dwelling - place of God .
It probably never occurred to these writers that if the firmament was seven or eight miles away , Enoch and the rest would have been frozen perfectly stiff long before the journey could have been completed .
Possibly Elijah might have made the voyage , as he was carried to heaven in a chariot of fire " by a whirlwind . "
The truth is , that Moses was mistaken , and upon that mistake the Christians located their heaven and their hell .
The telescope destroyed the firmament , did away with the heaven of the New Testament , rendered the ascension of our Lord and the assumption of his Mother infinitely absurd , crumbled to chaos the gates and palaces of the New Jerusalem , and in their places gave to man a wilderness of worlds .
Wednesday .
W E are next informed by the historian of creation , that after God had finished making the firmament and had succeeded in dividing the waters by means of an " expanse " he proceeded " to gather the waters on the earth together in seas , so that the dry land might appear . "
Certainly the writer of this did not have any conception of the real form of the earth .
He could not have known anything of the attraction of gravitation .
He must have regarded the earth as flat and supposed that it required considerable force and power to induce the water to leave the mountains and collect in the valleys .
Just as soon as the water was forced to run down hill , the dry land appeared , and the grass began to grow , and the mantles of green were thrown over the shoulders of the hills , and the trees laughed into bud and blossom , and the branches were laden with fruit .
And all this happened before a ray had left the quiver of the sun , before a glittering beam had thrilled the bosom of a flower , and before the Dawn with trembling hands had drawn aside the curtains of the East and welcomed to her arms the eager god of Day .
It does not seem to me that grass and trees could grow and ripen into seed and fruit without the sun .
According to the account , this all happened on the third day .
Now , if , as the Christians say , Moses did not mean by the word day a period of twenty - four hours , but an immense and almost measureless space of time , and as God did not , according to this view make any animals until the fifth day , that is , not for millions of years after he made the grass and trees , for what purpose did he cause the trees to bear fruit ?
Moses says that God said on the third day , " Let the earth bring forth grass , the herb yielding seed , and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind , whose seed is in itself upon the earth ; and it was so .
And the earth brought forth grass and herb yielding seed after his kind , and the tree yielding fruit whose seed was in itself after his kind ; and God saw that it was good , and the evening and the morning were the third day . "
There was nothing to eat this fruit ; not an insect with painted wings sought the honey of the flowers ; not a single living , breathing thing upon the earth , plenty of grass , a great variety of herbs , an abundance of fruit , but not a mouth in all the world .
If Moses is right , this state of things lasted only two days ; but if the modern theologians are correct , it continued for millions of ages .
It is now well known that the organic history of the earth can be properly divided into five epochs -- the Primordial , Primary , Secondary , Tertiary , and Quaternary .
Each of these epochs is characterized by animal and vegetable life peculiar to itself .
In the First will be found Algæ and Skull - less Vertebrates , in the Second , Ferns and Fishes , in the Third , Pine Forests and Reptiles , in the Fourth , Foliaceous Forests and Mammals , and in the Fifth , Man . "
How much more reasonable this is than the idea that the earth was covered with grass , and herbs , and trees loaded with fruit for millions of years before an animal existed .
There is , in nature , an even balance forever kept between the total amounts of animal and vegetable life .
" In her wonderful economy she must form and bountifully nourish her vegetable progeny -- twin - brother life to her , with that of animals .
The perfect balance between plant existences and animal existences must always be maintained , while matter courses through the eternal circle , becoming each in turn .
If an animal be resolved into its ultimate constituents in a period according to the surrounding circumstances , say , of four hours , of four months , of four years , or even of four thousand years , -- for it is impossible to deny that there may be instances of all these periods during which the process has continued -- those elements which assume the gaseous form mingle at once with the atmosphere and are taken up from it without delay by the ever - open mouths of vegetable life .
By a thousand pores in every leaf the carbonic acid which renders the atmosphere unfit for animal life is absorbed , the carbon being separated , and assimilated to form the vegetable fibre , which , as wood , makes and furnishes our houses and ships , is burned for our warmth , or is stored up under pressure for coal .
All this carbon has played its part , and many parts in its time , as animal existences from monad up to man .
Our mahogany of to - day has been many negroes in its turn , and before the African existed , was integral portions of many a generation of extinct species . "
It seems reasonable to suppose that certain kinds of vegetation and certain kinds of animals should exist together , and that as the character of the vegetation changed , a corresponding change would take place in the animal world .
It may be that I am led to these conclusions by " total depravity " or that I lack the necessary humility of spirit to satisfactorily harmonize Haeckel and Moses ; or that I am carried by pride , blinded by reason , given over to hardness of heart that I might be damned , but I never can believe that the earth was covered with leaves , and buds , and flowers , and fruits before the sun with glittering spear had driven back the hosts of Night .
Thursday .
A FTER the world was covered with vegetation , it occurred to Moses that it was about time to make a sun and moon ; and so we are told that on the fourth day God said , " Let there be light in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night ; and let them be for signs and for seasons , and for days and years ; and let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth ; and it was so .
And God made two great lights ; the greater light to rule the day , and the lesser light to rule the night ; he made the stars also . "
Can we believe that the inspired writer had any idea of the size of the sun ?
Draw a circle five inches in diameter , and by its side thrust a pin through the paper .
The hole made by the pin will sustain about the same relation to the circle that the earth does to the sun .
Did he know that the sun was eight hundred and sixty thousand miles in diameter ; that it was enveloped in an ocean of fire thousands of miles in depth , hotter even than the Christian 's hell .
Over which sweep tempests of flame moving at the rate of one hundred miles a second , compared with which the wildest storm that ever wrecked the forests of this world was but a calm ?
Did he know that the sun every moment of time throws out as much heat as could be generated by the combustion of millions upon millions of tons of coal ?
Did he know that the volume of the earth is less than one - millionth of that of the sun ?
Did he know of the one hundred and four planets belonging to our solar system , all children of the sun ?
Did he know of Jupiter eighty - five thousand miles in diameter , hundreds of times as large as our earth , turning on his axis at the rate of twenty - five thousand miles an hour accompanied by four moons , making the tour of his orbit in fifty years , a distance of three thousand million miles ?
Did he know anything about Saturn , his rings and his eight moons ?
Did he have the faintest idea that all these planets were once a part of the sun ; that the vast luminary was once thousands of millions of miles in diameter ; that Neptune , Uranus , Saturn , Jupiter and Mars were all born before our earth , and that by no possibility could this world have existed three days , nor three periods , nor three " good whiles " before its source , the sun ?
Moses supposed the sun to be about three or four feet in diameter and the moon about half that size .
Compared with the earth they were but simple specks .
This idea seems to have been shared by all the " inspired " men .
We find in the book of Joshua that the sun stood still , and the moon stayed until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies .
" So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven , and hasted not to go down about a whole day . "
We are told that the sacred writer wrote in common speech as we do when we talk about the rising and setting of the sun , and that all he intended to say was that the earth ceased to turn on its axis for about a whole day . "
My own opinion is that General Joshua knew no more about the motions of the earth than he did about mercy and justice .
If he had known that the earth turned upon its axis at the rate of a thousand miles an hour , and swept in its course about the sun at the rate of sixty - eight thousand miles an hour , he would have doubled the hailstones , spoken of in the same chapter , that the Lord cast down from heaven , and allowed the sun and moon to rise and set in the usual way .
It is impossible to conceive of a more absurd story than this about the stopping of the sun and moon , and yet nothing so excites the malice of the orthodox preacher as to call its truth in question .
Some endeavor to account for the phenomenon by natural causes , while others attempt to show that God could , by the refraction of light have made the sun visible although actually shining on the opposite side of the earth .
The last hypothesis has been seriously urged by ministers within the last few months .
The Rev. Henry M. Morey of South Bend , Indiana , says " that the phenomenon was simply optical .
The rotary motion of the earth was not disturbed , but the light of the sun was prolonged by the same laws of refraction and reflection by which the sun now appears to be above the horizon when it is really below .
The medium through which the sun 's rays passed may have been miraculously influenced so as to have caused the sun to linger above the horizon long after its usual time for disappearance .
"
This is the latest and ripest product of Christian scholarship upon this question no doubt , but still it is not entirely satisfactory to me .
According to the sacred account the sun did not linger , merely , above the horizon .
but stood still " in the midst of heaven for about a whole day , " that is to say , for about twelve hours .
If the air was miraculously changed , so that it would refract the rays of the sun while the earth turned over as usual for " about a whole day , " then , at the end of that time the sun must have been visible in the east , that is , it must by that time have been the next morning .
According to this , that most wonderful day must have been at least thirty - six hours in length .
We have first , the twelve hours of natural light , then twelve hours of " refracted and reflected " light .
By that time it would again be morning , and the sun would shine for twelve hours more in the natural way , making thirty - six hours in all .
If the Rev. Morey would depend a little less on " refraction " and a little more on " reflection " he would conclude that the whole story is simply a barbaric myth and fable .
It hardly seems reasonable that God , if there is one , would either stop the globe , change the constitution of the atmosphere or the nature of light simply to afford Joshua an opportunity to kill people on that day when he could just as easily have waited until the next morning .
It certainly cannot be very gratifying to God for us to believe such childish things .
It has been demonstrated that force is eternal ; that it is forever active , and eludes destruction by change of form .
Motion is a form of force , and all arrested motion changes instantly to heat .
The earth turns upon its axis at about one thousand miles an hour .
Let it be stopped and a force beyond our imagination is changed to heat .
It has been calculated that to stop the world would produce as much heat as the burning of a solid piece of coal three times the size of the earth .
And yet we are asked to believe that this was done in order that one barbarian might defeat another .
Such stories never would have been written , had not the belief been general that the heavenly bodies were as nothing compared with the earth .
The view of Moses was acquiesced in by the Jewish people and by the Christian world for thousands of years .
It is supposed that Moses lived about fifteen hundred years before Christ , and although he was " inspired , " and obtained his information directly from God , he did not know as much about our solar system as the Chinese did a thousand years before he was born .
" The Emperor Chwenhio adopted as an epoch , a conjunction of the planets Mercury , Mars , Jupiter and Saturn , which has been shown by M. Bailly to have occurred no less than 2449 years before Christ . "
The ancient Chinese knew not only the motions of the planets , but they could calculate eclipses .
" In the reign of the Emperor Chow - Kang , the chief astronomers , Ho and Hi were condemned to death for neglecting to announce a solar eclipse which took place 2169 B.C. , a clear proof that the prediction of eclipses was a part of the duty of the imperial astronomers . "
Is it not strange that a Chinaman should find out by his own exertions more about the material universe than Moses could when assisted by its Creator ?
About eight hundred years after God gave Moses the principal facts about the creation of the " heaven and the earth " he performed another miracle far more wonderful than stopping the world .
On this occasion he not only stopped the earth , but actually caused it to turn the other way .
A Jewish king was sick , and God , in order to convince him that he would ultimately recover , offered to make the shadow on the dial go forward , or backward ten degrees .
The king thought it was too easy a thing to make the shadow go forward , and asked that it be turned back .
Thereupon , " Isaiah the prophet cried unto the Lord , and he brought the shadow ten degrees backward by which it had gone down in the dial of Ahaz . "
I hardly see how this miracle could be accounted for even by " refraction " and " reflection . "
It seems , from the account , that this stupendous miracle was performed after the king had been cured .
The account of the shadow going backward is given in the eleventh verse of the twentieth chapter of Second Kings , while the cure is given in the seventh verse of the same chapter .
" And Isaiah said , Take a lump of figs .
And they took and laid it on the boil , and he recovered . "
Stopping the world and causing it to turn back ten degrees after that , seems to have been , as the boil was already cured by the figs , a useless display of power .
The easiest way to account for all these wonders is to say that the " inspired " writers were mistaken .
In this way a fearful burden is lifted from the credulity of man , and he is left free to believe the evidences of his own senses , and the demonstrations of science .
In this way he can emancipate himself from the slavery of superstition , the control of the barbaric dead , and the despotism of the church .
Only about a hundred years ago , Buffon , the naturalist , was compelled by the faculty of theology of Paris to publicly renounce fourteen " errors " in his work on Natural History because they were at variance with the Mosaic account of creation .
The Pentateuch is still the scientific standard of the church , and ignorant priests , armed with that , pronounce sentence upon the vast accomplishments of modern thought .
" He Made The Stars Also . "
M OSES came very near forgetting about the stars and only gave five words to all the hosts of heaven .
Can it be possible that he knew anything about the stars beyond the mere fact that he saw them shining above him ?
Did he know that the nearest star , the one we ought to be best acquainted with , is twenty - one billion of miles away , and that it is a sun shining by its own light ?
Did he know of the next , that is thirty - seven billion miles distant ?
Is it possible that he was acquainted with Sirius , a sun two thousand six hundred and eighty - eight times larger than our own , surrounded by a system of heavenly bodies , several of which are already known , and distant from us eighty - two billion miles ?
Did he know that the Polar star that tells the mariner his course and guided slaves to liberty and joy , is distant from this little world two hundred and ninety - two billion miles , and that Capella wheels and shines one hundred and thirty - three billion miles beyond ?
Did he know that it would require about seventy - two years for light to reach us from this star ?
Did he know that light travels one hundred and eighty - five thousand miles a second ?
Did he know that some stars are so far away in the infinite abysses that five millions of years are required for their light to reach this globe ?
If this is true , and if as the Bible tells us , the stars were made after the earth , then this world has been wheeling in its orbit for at least five million years .
It may be replied that it was not the intention of God to teach geology and astronomy .
Then why did he say anything upon these subjects ?
and if he did say anything , why did he not give the fact ?
According to the sacred records God created , on the first day , the heaven and the earth , " moved upon the face of the waters , " and made the light .
On the second day he made the firmament or the " expanse " and divided the waters .
On the third day he gathered the waters into seas , let the dry land appear and caused the earth to bring forth grass , herbs and fruit trees , and on the fourth day he made the sun , moon and stars and set them in the firmament of heaven to give light upon the earth .
This division of labor is very striking .
The work of the other days is as nothing when compared with that of the fourth .
Is it possible that it required the same time and labor to make the grass , herbs and fruit trees , that it did to fill with countless constellations the infinite expanse of space ?
Friday .
W E are then told that on the next day " God said , Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creatures that hath life , and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven .
And God created great whales and every living creature which the waters brought forth abundantly , after their kind , and every winged fowl after his kind , and God saw that it was good .
And God blessed them , saying , Be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters in the seas , and let fowl multiply in the earth . "
Is it true that while the dry land was covered with grass , and herbs , and trees bearing fruit , the ocean was absolutely devoid of life , and so remained for millions of years ?
If Moses meant twenty - four hours by the word day , then it would make but little difference on which of the six days animals were made ; but if the word day was used to express millions of ages during which life was slowly evolved from monad up to man , then the account becomes infinitely absurd , puerile and foolish .
There is not a scientist of high standing who will say that in his judgment the earth was covered with fruit - bearing trees before the moners , the ancestors it may be of the human race , felt in Laurentian seas the first faint throb of life .
Nor is there one who will declare that there was a single spire of grass before the sun had poured upon the world his flood of gold .
Why should men in the name of religion try to harmonize the contradictions that exist between Nature and a book ?
Why should philosophers be denounced for placing more reliance upon what they know than upon what they have been told ?
If there is a God , it is reasonably certain that he made the world , but it is by no means certain that he is the author of the Bible .
Why then should we not place greater confidence in Nature than in a book ?
And even if this God made not only the world but the book besides , it does not follow that the book is the best part of creation , and the only part that we will be eternally punished for denying .
It seems to me that it is quite as important to know something of the solar system , something of the physical history of this globe , as it is to know the adventures of Jonah or the diet of Ezekiel .
For my part , I would infinitely prefer to know all the results of scientific investigation , than to be inspired as Moses was .
Supposing the Bible to be true ; why is it any worse or more wicked for Freethinkers to deny it , than for priests to deny the doctrine of evolution , or the dynamic theory of heat ?
Why should we be damned for laughing at Samson and his foxes , while others , holding the Nebular Hypothesis in utter contempt , go straight to heaven ?
It seems to me that a belief in the great truths of science are fully as essential to salvation , as the creed of any church .
We are taught that a man may be perfectly acceptable to God even if he denies the rotundity of the earth , the Copernican system , the three laws of Kepler , the indestructibility of matter and the attraction of gravitation .
And we are also taught that a man may be right upon all these questions , and yet , for failing to believe in the " scheme of salvation , " be eternally lost .
Saturday .
O N this , the last day of creation , God said : -- " Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind , cattle and creeping thing and beast of the earth after his kind ; and it was so .
And God made the beast of the earth after his kind , and cattle after their kind , and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind ; and God saw that it was good . "
Now , is it true that the seas were filled with fish , the sky with fowls , and the earth covered with grass , and herbs , and fruit bearing trees , millions of ages before there was a creeping thing in existence ?
Must we admit that plants and animals were the result of the fiat of some incomprehensible intelligence independent of the operation of what are known as natural causes ?
Why is a miracle any more necessary to account for yesterday than for to - day or for to - morrow ?
If there is an infinite Power , nothing can be more certain than that this Power works in accordance with what we call law , that is , by and through natural causes .
If anything can be found without a pedigree of natural antecedents , it will then be time enough to talk about the fiat of creation .
There must have been a time when plants and animals did not exist upon this globe .
The question , and the only question is , whether they were naturally produced .
If the account given by Moses is true , then the vegetable and animal existences are the result of certain special fiats of creation entirely independent of the operation of natural causes .
This is so grossly improbable , so at variance with the experience and observation of mankind , that it cannot be adopted without abandoning forever the basis of scientific thought and action .
It may be urged that we do not understand the sacred record correctly .
To this it may be replied that for thousands of years the account of the creation has , by the Jewish and Christian world , been regarded as literally true .
If it was inspired , of course God must have known just how it would be understood , and consequently must have intended that it should be understood just as he knew it would be .
One man writing to another , may mean one thing , and yet be understood as meaning something else .
Now , if the writer knew that he would be misunderstood , and also knew that he could use other words that would convey his real meaning , but did not , we would say that he used words on purpose to mislead , and was not an honest man .
If a being of infinite wisdom wrote the Bible , or caused it to be written , he must have known exactly how his words would be interpreted by all the world , and he must have intended to convey the very meaning that was conveyed .
He must have known that by reading that book , man would form erroneous views as to the shape , antiquity , and size of this world ; that he would be misled as to the time and order of creation ; that he would have the most childish and contemptible views of the creator ; that the " sacred word " would be used to support slavery and polygamy ; that it would build dungeons for the good , and light fagots to consume the brave , and therefore he must have intended that these results should follow .
He also must have known that thousands and millions of men and women never could believe his Bible , and that the number of unbelievers would increase in the exact ratio of civilization , and therefore , he must have intended that result .
Let us understand this .
An honest finite being uses the best words , in his judgment , to convey his meaning .
This is the best he can do , because he cannot certainly know the exact effect of his words on others .
But an infinite being must know not only the real meaning of the words , but the exact meaning they will convey to every reader and hearer .
He must know every meaning that they are capable of conveying to every mind .
He must also know what explanations must be made to prevent misconception .
If an infinite being cannot , in making a revelation to man , use such words that every person to whom a revelation is essential will understand distinctly what that revelation is , then a revelation from God through the instrumentality of language is impossible , or it is not essential that all should understand it correctly .
It may be urged that millions have not the capacity to understand a revelation , although expressed in the plainest words .
To this it seems a sufficient reply to ask , why a being of infinite power should create men so devoid of intelligence , that he cannot by any means make known to them his will ?
We are told that it is exceedingly plain , and that a wayfaring man , though a fool , need not err therein .
This statement is refuted by the religious history of the Christian world .
Every sect is a certificate that God has not plainly revealed his will to man .
To each reader the Bible conveys a different meaning .
About the meaning of this book , called a revelation , there have been ages of war , and centuries of sword and flame .
If written by an infinite God , he must have known that these results must follow ; and thus knowing , he must be responsible for all .
Is it not infinitely more reasonable to say that this book is the work of man , that it is filled with mingled truth and error , with mistakes and facts , and reflects , too faithfully perhaps , the " very form and pressure of its time " ?
If there are mistakes in the Bible , certainly they were made by man .
If there is anything contrary to nature , it was written by man .
If there is anything immoral , cruel , heartless or infamous , it certainly was never written by a being worthy of the adoration of mankind .
WHEN I think back to my job - hunting days , my methods seem as quaint as comparing a Victrola to an iPod .
First , there was no Internet .
I perused trade journals for job possibilities .
I painstakingly typed my résumé on a typewriter ( electric ) and had to retype — and retype and retype — when I made a mistake .
I cut and pasted my newspaper clips , which I needed to send along with the résumé , onto letter - size paper , which was like trying to put together a jigsaw puzzle with a few pieces missing .
Then , because self - service copying was in its infancy , I had copies of my clips made .
Then , I stuffed them into manila envelopes and took them to the post office to mail .
I followed up with telephone calls , because , of course , there was no e-mail .
In fact , voice mail also barely existed .
( I ’m not that ancient .
We ’re talking less than three decades ago . )
So either I never got past the switchboard or I was shunted off to a bored secretary , who I ’m sure never bothered writing down my message .
A bizarre campaign against grammatical incorrectness has landed two young Americans in deep trouble .
The pair , Jeff Deck and Benjamin Herson , who have roamed across America using marker pens and Tipp - Ex to correct bad spelling and grammar on less - than - literate signs , went a little too far when they amended a historic , hand - painted noticeboard at Grand Canyon National Park .
They were arrested , given probation , ordered to pay a $ 3,035 ( £ 1,640 ) repair bill , and banned from all US national parks .
The two are the somewhat nit-picking brains behind the Typo Eradication Advancement League ( Teal ) , a sort of provisional wing of the Plain English Campaign .
In March , it launched an Outreach Mission to correct grocers ' apostrophes and spelling faux pas – coast to coast .
Armed with only Tipp - Ex , chalk , and permanent markers , Messrs Deck and Herson travelled nearly 12,000 miles in 73 days , and identified 423 instances of signage marred by mistakes in spelling , punctuation and grammar .
They made 231 corrections .
In Texas a firm called Wings announced it was " Now acepting application " .
There was a sign for " Dillettante " chocolate ; posters referring to " recepies " ; " cake 's " and " birthday candell's " ; signs that had the word " priveleges " ; and a lot of " your " rather than " you 're " .
An eatery in New York offered " chicken parmasan " salad , and a grocery , traditionally the home of the misused apostrophe , which called itself a " grocerry " .
They found menu boards advertising " today special 's " and " capacino " .
A sign that warned " pedestrians use walks not roads " ; a T - shirt shop missing the dash between the " T " and the " shirt " ; an Army - Navy store offering a " hellicopter " helmet and a bullet " bandoleer " , and a " Sweedish " berry drink .
Mr Deck identified the correct use of the apostrophe to be America 's greatest grammatical blindspot .

A star of local spelling bees as a child , Mr Deck set up Teal after attending his five - year reunion at Dartmouth College .
He said : " I was speaking with some of my classmates who were becoming doctors and lawyers , and other people who could have an impact on the world and I started to wonder how I might be able to do that ... fixing typos was what I came up with ...
I 've always been aware of typos wherever I go [ and ] I figured that it was a national problem " .
Soon Mr Deck had founded Teal , complete with a website , blog and a typo correction kit .
The tour began on 5 March from Mr Deck 's town of Somerville , Massachusetts , and led the pair through more than 20 states correcting public signs and " other venues where innocent eyes may be befouled by the vile stains on the delicate fabric of our language , " according to the Teal website , jeffdeck.com .
Asked if it had all been worthwhile , he said : " Certainly !
There are a lot more people out there now carrying Sharpies [ a brand of marker pen ] around with them . "
And Mr Deck and chums are collecting a fan base .
One Ruth M Newton , for instance , wrote to the Teal blog : " Bless your heart for reassuring me that I am not the only spelling and punctuation nut left in North America . "
At the Grand Canyon National Park , the men had found a 60 - year - old sign with a misplaced apostrophe and a missing comma .
They duly whipped out Tipp - Ex and pen , and made the corrections .
They then spotted that " immense " was spelled as " emense " .
They were shocked , but stayed their hands .
Mr Deck later wrote : " I was reluctant to disfigure the sign any further ....
Still , I shall be haunted by that perversity , " emense " in my train - whistle - blighted dreams . "
Despite their self - control , arrest and swift retribution followed .
A sticking point in talks has been how to verify North Korea 's disarmament North Korea says it has stopped disabling its nuclear facilities , accusing the US of reneging on a six - party disarmament deal .
Work was suspended on 14 August , a foreign ministry spokesman told the state news agency KCNA .
North Korea says it took the step because the US failed to remove it from a list of state sponsors of terrorism .
But the US says it wants to agree more stringent verification processes before it does so .
North Korea finally submitted a long - delayed account of its nuclear facilities to the six - party talks in June - and was expecting to be removed from the US list of terrorism sponsors in return .
But that move has been delayed amid wrangling among the six parties - North and South Korea , the US , China , Russia and Japan - over how to verify the North 's declaration .
The North has also threatened to restore facilities at its main Yongbyon plant - where the main cooling tower was spectacularly demolished in late June in a symbol of Pyongyang 's commitment to disarmament .
The submission by North Korea of a nuclear dossier was seen by the Bush administration as one of its success stories in foreign policy , says the BBC 's diplomatic correspondent Jonathan Marcus .
The question now is whether this latest spat is just another hiccup in relations or represents a serious blow to progress .
With only months to go until a new team takes office in Washington , Pyongyang may be looking to the next administration for a better deal , our correspondent says .
' Action for action '
" As the US side failed to keep its own side of the agreement , we cannot but take the following measures under the principle of action for action , " the foreign ministry spokesman told the KCNA , according to AFP news agency .
Q&A : N Korea nuclear deal Timeline : N Korea stand - off " First , we 've decided to stop the denuclearisation process that has been under way in accordance with the 3 October agreement .
This measure already took effect on 14 August and relevant parties have already [ been ] informed .
" Second , we will consider restoring the Yongbyon facilities to their original state in accordance with strong demands from our relevant agencies . "
US State Department spokesman Sean McCormack , travelling with Secretary Condoleezza Rice in Jerusalem , said he had no immediate comment on the KCNA report , according to Reuters news agency .
Analysts say that , in addition to the delay removing it from the US terrorism list , the North has been angered by recent military drills jointly undertaken by US and South Korean forces .

McCain says if you care about the economy , do n’t vote for him
September 17 , 2008 by twitterpaters
by twit
via the Washington Post blog The Trail by way of Ken Layne , back in January 2008 , McCain made it clear that if voters are concerned about the economy , he can understand why they wo n’t vote for him :
When asked how he would respond to the fact that voters are now increasingly focused on the nation ’s economy , McCain said he had no interest in changing his own policy priorities .
“ Even if the economy is the , quote , number one issue , the real issue will remain America ’s security , ” he said .
“ If it ’s not the most important issue in the minds of many voters , America ’s security will remain the number one issue with me .
And if they choose to say , ‘ Look , I do not need this guy because he ’s not as good on home loan mortgages , ’ or whatever it is , I understand that .
I will accept that verdict .
I am running because of the transcendent challenge of the twenty - first century , which is radical Islamic extremism , as you know . ”
From the Associated Press on September 16 , 2008 , McCain makes it clear that he will say anything he believes that voters want to hear , even if he is directly contradicting himself :
McCain declared Monday that “ the fundamentals of our economy are strong , ” a phrase he has used before .
After Democrats pounced , he backtracked and declared the economy to be in a crisis and said “ fundamentals are threatened . ”
From the Washington Post on September 16 , 2008 , McCain ’s campaign admits that they have NO PLAN AT ALL for responding to the current economic crisis , and they do n’t see a need for developing one :
McCain offered his own TV ad promising to “ reform Wall Street ” and pass “ new rules for fairness and honesty , ” adding : “ I wo n’t tolerate a system that puts you and your family at risk .
Your savings , your jobs . . .
I ’ll keep them safe , ” the ad says .
He did not describe how he would bring greater transparency to the process .
His senior policy adviser , Douglas Holtz - Eakin , told reporters earlier in the day that there was no need for McCain to be specific right now .
“ There ’s no magic solutions , and I do n’t think it ’s imperative at this moment to write down what the plan should be , ” he said .
“ The real issue here is a leadership issue . ”
It is true , it is a leadership issue .
And John McCain is offering no leadership at all .
via TPM , this video rounds up clips from John McCain ’s recent appearances on various news shows :
In the interest of fairness , it seems important to note that Barack Obama has a detailed plan to address the economy that includes the following :
First , if you can borrow from the government , you should be subject to government oversight and supervision .
Secretary Paulson admitted this in his remarks yesterday .
The Federal Reserve should have basic supervisory authority over any institution to which it may make credit available as a lender of last resort .
When the Fed steps in , it is providing lenders an insurance policy underwritten by the American taxpayer .
In return , taxpayers have every right to expect that these institutions are not taking excessive risks .
The nature of regulation should depend on the degree and extent of the Fed ’s exposure .
But at the very least , these new regulations should include liquidity and capital requirements .
Second , there needs to be general reform of the requirements to which all regulated financial institutions are subjected .
Capital requirements should be strengthened , particularly for complex financial instruments like some of the mortgage securities that led to our current crisis .
We must develop and rigorously manage liquidity risk .
We must investigate rating agencies and potential conflicts of interest with the people they are rating .
And transparency requirements must demand full disclosure by financial institutions to shareholders and counterparties .
As we reform our regulatory system at home , we must work with international arrangements like the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision , the International Accounting Standards Board , and the Financial Stability Forum to address the same problems abroad .
The goal must be ensuring that financial institutions around the world are subject to similar rules of the road – both to make the system stable , and to keep our financial institutions competitive .
Third , we need to streamline a framework of overlapping and competing regulatory agencies .
Reshuffling bureaucracies should not be an end in itself .
But the large , complex institutions that dominate the financial landscape do not fit into categories created decades ago .
Different institutions compete in multiple markets – our regulatory system should not pretend otherwise .
A streamlined system will provide better oversight , and be less costly for regulated institutions .
Fourth , we need to regulate institutions for what they do , not what they are .
Over the last few years , commercial banks and thrift institutions were subject to guidelines on subprime mortgages that did not apply to mortgage brokers and companies .
It makes no sense for the Fed to tighten mortgage guidelines for banks when two - thirds of subprime mortgages do n’t originate from banks .
This regulatory framework has failed to protect homeowners , and it is now clear that it made no sense for our financial system .
When it comes to protecting the American people , it should make no difference what kind of institution they are dealing with .
Fifth , we must remain vigilant and crack down on trading activity that crosses the line to market manipulation .
Reports have circulated in recent days that some traders may have intentionally spread rumors that Bear Stearns was in financial distress while making market bets against the company .
The SEC should investigate and punish this kind of market manipulation , and report its conclusions to Congress .
Sixth , we need a process that identifies systemic risks to the financial system .
Too often , we deal with threats to the financial system that were n’t anticipated by regulators .
That ’s why we should create a financial market oversight commission , which would meet regularly and provide advice to the President , Congress , and regulators on the state of our financial markets and the risks that face them .
These expert views could help anticipate risks before they erupt into a crisis .
This outline of his plan is from a speech Obama gave on March 27 , 2008 .
A Photoshopped picture of Sarah Palin has been doing the rounds for the past few days ; it shows her in a stars and stripes bikini toting a rifle - patriotism , hunting and cheesecake all combined in one image .
Two minutes of Googling reveals that the rifle has been identified by gun nuts in Republican chatrooms as a Crossman pump pellet gun .
Soft porn for rednecks .
Expect to see it pinned to the wall in every gas station in Texas and tacked to the dashboard of every long - haul truck .
But this cartoon - like depiction of her smothers what we need to understand about why Palin appeals to American voters and why American elections have been so deadlocked for the past decade , as if there were two Americas , doomed to lived on the same landmass under the same government , like hopelessly incompatible spouses .
A new novel , American Wife by Curtis Sittenfeld , published in the US this week , tells a fictionalised and thinly veiled story of Laura Bush , from small - town girl in the 1950s midwest to school librarian to Republican bride to President 's wife .
What you learn from the novel is that , like it or not , the American heartland is not so much a political ideology but an actual place with people living in it .
Small - town Americans have values and a lot of those values are good ones : neighbourliness , family life , a knowledge of the land and what grows in it .
The other America they see on TV seems without ethics - crime , violence , drug addiction , pornography and prostitution - and they do n't want any part of it .
So clear is the divide between big-city and small - town America that one American friend said to me : " These whitebread Republicans are like children - someone has to tell them what to do and what to think , they 're incapable of independent ideas . "
The conviction by the left that the right is stupid is one of the defining and least attractive characteristics of contemporary politics .
Assuming that anyone who disagrees with you is too dim to get your point is not itself a particularly brainy way to win others over to the essential correctness of your views .
But it is true that to small - town Republicans the world is not a complicated place , because they have seen so little of it .
I asked a sophisticated and well - travelled Republican why he voted the way he did .
He described growing up " dirt poor " in a small town in Northern California where joining the military was your sole ticket out ; where the people in his family who depended on welfare stayed where they were and the ones who worked their fingers to the bone managed to make a better life for themselves .
For him , joining the army led directly to an education .
In fact , it led all the way to Princeton .
But how , I asked him , baffled , could someone as intelligent as he is believe that George W Bush was anything but a cretin ?
Because , he explained , people in small towns do n't like or trust intellectuals , particularly ones who appear to be sneering at them for their supposed stupidity .
They admire a plain - speaking man ; it's what they know and what they are used to .
They always assumed Bush was a regular guy who could keep his thoughts concise .
So America is stuck .
Two countries , mutually irreconcilable , who never meet each other and do n't want to , either .
Who distrust each other at best , despise each other at worst .
And who have absolutely no understanding of the other .
Reading Sittenfeld 's thinly disguised account of Laura Bush and her upbringing , it was possible to see that the modest lives of her midwestern characters both had dignity and made sense .
But I only have to meet them in a novel , which I can snap shut as soon as I 've finished it .
Were I an East Coast Democrat , which is the only kind of American I can ever imagine being , I would have no objection to small - town Republicans - to their church - going and their hunting rifles and their flag - decked porches and their meatloaf with gravy , and their lemon chiffon cake .
I could admire their intimacy with the wide prairie and the vast sky .
The problem is that when they 're running the whole country , they want to take away abortion rights , drill for oil in Alaska ( a Palin policy ) , ignore climate change , and start unwinnable wars .
With the small - town Republican mindset in charge , the rest of America and the rest of the world is forced to live by small - town values , which are n't much help when you 're trying to decide what , if anything , can be done about Iranian nuclear ambitions or more humbly , workplace date rape .
Can America survive another photo - finish election which the Republicans win , or will it be out and out war between the red and the blue states ?
Perhaps only small - town America itself can prevent it , such as the dental nurse who asked how the mother of five kids , one with Down 's syndrome , could hold down a full - time job , one step from running the United States .
Sarah Palin , bad mom .
That might finish her .

Philippe Petit went to New York for the first time in January 1974 .
The twin towers of the World Trade Center would be formally dedicated on 4 April : but even then they were not fully complete or occupied .
When he sneaked into the north tower for the first time , the buildings were still under construction .
He rode elevators and ran up staircases to evade security guards .
It took him an hour to get to the roof .
The next day he returned with his friend Jim Moore , a photographer , and took the same route to the 110th floor .
Philippe explained what he had in mind .
He showed Jim the drop .
Jim just went white .
' You 're insane , ' he whispered .
Philippe returned to Paris and , ignoring the advice of his friends , began to make preparations for his third ' coup ' .
He read everything he could find about the towers and compiled a file of information .
In April , he was back in New York again .
He made money with his street juggling - nobody in Manhattan had ever seen anything like it - and began sneaking into the towers every day .
He roamed through the buildings for hours , dodging guards , taking photographs and making sketches , noting access routes , security patrol routes , equipment clearances .
He obtained numerical security codes ; hired a surveyor 's measuring wheel to determine the distance between the buildings ; rented a helicopter to photograph them from above .
He found that on windy days , the turbulence on the roof of the towers made it impossible even to stand up without holding on to something ; and that the buildings swayed in a strong wind : enough to snap a steel cable tensioned between the towers .
And he discovered the police station in the basement .
' Notre Dame and Sydney - that was nothing .
Notre Dame does n't have a police station , it is not 1,000 or so feet high .
It was a public structure , very easy to access .
And Sydney Harbour Bridge was half - and - half : a bridge , in the middle of the night .
The World Trade Center was the end of the world .
Electronic devices , police dogs .
It was l'attaque de la banque .
Bank robbery , you know ? '
Back in Europe again , he persuaded his friend Francis Brunn to put up the money to help finance the ' coup ' .
He had a scale model of the Trade Center built : it filled his little room at rue Laplace .
He sought detailed advice on rigging the wire and cavalettis from Papa Rudy .
He decamped to his parents ' country estate at Vary , and began practising in earnest .
Finally , in May , he returned to New York one last time .
He planned one date after another for the walk - and abandoned one attempt at the last minute - until fixing on 7 August 1974 .
What did you think your chances of success were ?
' Zero .
Under zero .
It was impossible .
And the walk was not even to think of .
I 'm trying to sneak inside the biggest , most surveilled , protected building in the world .
I was a kid from the street and I thought : maybe I could have two crews coming at more or less the same time and then putting a ton of equipment across and then guylining it and then tightening it - without being caught by all the cops and the guards ?
And you 're asking me did I think about the walk ?
Of course not .
The walk was a stupid , ridiculous objective .
And maybe when I did think about the walk , it was nothing .
I am a wire - walker .
I can walk any time , anywhere - I 'm indestructible .
So the walk was never a subject .
Really , the tough part was the bank robbery .
Getting out alive ?
Pfft !
I was not interested in that .'
As I approach the edge of the building , a bunch of arms reach out to assist me in taking the last step .
Hey !
I do n't need help !
I have n't finished my show !
I come about .
Behind me , the arms pull back .
I rendezvous with the long wire and perform the ' torero walk ' , gliding my feet , holding the pole away from my body , head high .
Near the end of the crossing , another voracious group of arms tries to grab me .
An octopus !
Smiling at the monster , I stop short of its reach and make another U - turn .
Next crossing - I 'm absolutely no longer afraid of the wire , it is getting shorter as I stroll back and forth .
Next crossing , I present the ' promenade ' , balancing the pole on my shoulder like a pitchfork , one arm dangling , as if returning to the farmhouse after a long day 's work in the field .
Someone is calling me ...
Each new crossing begets a new walk , punctuated by fragile equilibriums , by genuflections , by salutes .
Again , I sit down ; again , I lie down .
By chance , and for the first time , my eyes focus on the octopus at the end of the wire .
It is made of several uniformed men .
Those men are angry .
How do you stop a wire - walker ?
On the afternoon of 6 August 1974 , Philippe and six accomplices set off for the World Trade Center in an unmarked van .
With forged ID passes and dressed as delivery men , they had arranged one team to deliver all the packing cases of heavy equipment .
The 60 m cable , the machine to tension it and Philippe 's 8 m balancing pole disassembled into sections were to go to a friend working in an office on the 82nd floor of the south tower .
But they arrived on moving day : several major corporations were moving into their new offices .
So Philippe and his team managed to ride freight elevators all the way to the 104th floor .
The inside man then escorted two others , disguised as businessmen , up the north tower .
It was only 4.30 in the afternoon .
Both teams had to remain hidden until nightfall before they could begin the rigging .
Over in Germany , at the Circus Sarrasani , Francis Brunn 's wife Sasha became convinced Philippe was about to kill himself .
She decided she must stop him .
She called the police in New York to warn them to look out for strange activity on the roof of the Twin Towers .
She tried World Trade Center security , and the Port Authority police .
She called again and again .
But she could n't get through .
On the 110th floor of the south tower , Philippe and his friend Jean - François spent more than five hours motionless , concealed under a tarpaulin - sitting on an 8in wide I - beam over a three - storey drop .
Off - duty construction workers had decided to hold an impromptu party on the roof .
Then , still evading security guards , and with a line fired by bow - and - arrow by his friend Jean - Louis from the north tower , the two teams spent the whole night rigging .
The first construction workers would arrive for work on the roof at 7 am .
By dawn , they still had n't managed to tighten the cable .
At 6.45 , Philippe was still desperately trying to overcome difficulties with the cavalettis .
One of his accomplices had simply given up helping .
At the last possible moment , as the freight elevator was on its way up to the 104th floor with the first shift of workers , the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center were firmly linked for the first and only time in their existence .
Philippe Petit finally began his walk .
Suddenly the shouting hurled at me reaches my ears , because this time , the words are in French .
It is Jean - François , terrified by the threats of the police - they say they 're going to loosen the tension on the wire , they say they 're going to send a helicopter to snatch me from mid-air - who has agreed to translate their latest message : ' Stop right now or we 'll take you out ! '
For a second I despise Jean - François , but then I understand : he believes them .
Fascinated by a sudden wave of silence , I retreat into an endless balance on one leg , searching for the immobility that no wire - walker can ever find on a wire .
Today , maybe , with the help of such a prodigious height , I ...
But I have trespassed long enough into these forbidden regions ; the gods might lose patience .
I offer my farewell to the New York sky : by running on the wire that shakes with allegresse , thus bringing down the curtain on the most splendid performance ever offered by a street - juggler / vagabond / high - wire artist .
' Look !
He 's dancing , he 's running ! ' scream my friends below , applauding my exit .
They argue over the number of crossings : ' He crossed six times ! '
' No , eight ! '
' He was on the wire 45 minutes ! '
' No , an hour ! '
I , a bird gliding back and forth between the canyon 's rims , did not count the voyages .
I land on the roof of the south tower .
The octopus grabs me violently .
The World Trade Center walk immediately made Philippe Petit one of the most famous men in America .
His picture appeared on the front page of newspapers across the country .
The next day , Richard Nixon became the first president in US history to resign from office .
Before leaving Washington by helicopter , Nixon met the press on the White House lawn for one last time .
' I wish , ' he said , ' I had the publicity that Frenchman had . '
The phone rang with one offer after another .
There was a multimillion - dollar film deal from MGM .
There was a book proposal : How To Walk The Wire in Your Back Yard in Five Days .
There were beer endorsements ; wine commercials ; Burger King offered him $ 100,000 to dress up as a Whopper and wire - walk across 8th Avenue to open a new franchise .
Someone even wanted him to make a record , based on what he had said to the press after his arrest : ' When I see two oranges , I juggle ; when I see two towers , I walk . '
He turned them all down .
' I could have become a millionaire within days .
A stupid book would have been made , a stupid film , stupid T - shirts , stupid little dolls climbing on the tower like King Kong would have been made .
I did n't say no in principle , I said no because I looked at the people and heard their words and everything was wrong .
There was a different language , it was a different point of view .
It was not me .
And I can not be not me .
I 'm not honourable and courageous in my way of seeing life - I just cannot help it .'
But he did accept a permanent pass to the Observation Deck of the World Trade Center and , finally , joined the circus - as the headline act in the Ringling Brothers ' original Greatest Show on Earth .
It did not go well .
He still did n't fit in to the world of the circus .
He had his first and only fall - during a practice walk , from 45 ft up .
He broke several ribs and suffered internal injuries .
But as he was rehearsing , he insists it does n't count .
' It was practice .
And practice is a very different field .
Wire - walking in performance is one thing - I never fell , of course .
If I had , I would n't be here talking about it . '
He settled in New York , and gathered a constellation of famous friends and admirers - Werner Herzog , Paul Auster , Mikhail Baryshnikov , Milos Forman , Robin Williams , Al Pacino , Sting .
The actress Debra Winger once told him she has had it written into the contract of every film she has made that she must include a visual tribute to Petit somewhere in her performance .
He 's written several books about his exploits , and a treatise on wire - walking based on the notes he made as a teenager : Funambule .
In 1980 , he was made artist - in - residence at the Cathedral of St John the Divine .
He has had rooms , and a practice wire , there , ever since .
Up in the little room on the rue Laplace , Philippe and I stand in our places - there is no room to move - and he shows me around .
He proudly points out objects here , space - saving innovations there , the meticulously filed boxes of his writings ; obsessively filed notes on past walks and future projects .
He explains how he illegally installed running water and electricity .
How he and Jean - Louis stole the heavy ceramic sink from a factory back in 1968 .
He tells me how , a few years ago , he excavated a recess in the ancient wall for a tiny fridge .
He taped pieces of foam over his mallet and chisel , to muffle the blows , to prevent his neighbours being alerted .
He listened at the wall with a stethoscope to find when they were out .
It took him months .
' A grain of sand at a time , ' he says .
' I am a specialist in a grain of sand at a time . '
When he had finished , he found that working in the cramped space under the sink for so long meant that he could no longer stand properly .
He could n't walk the wire for a year .
This is the first time Philippe Petit has returned to Paris since 2000 .
It 's his greatest absence for a long time .
He says he just has n't been able to afford the air fare .
He has brought packets of soup with him from New York so he would n't be tempted to eat in restaurants every night .
Lately , he has n't worked as much as he would like .
Some years , he 's done six walks in a year .
In others , none at all .
He can only do a maximum of two or three ' big ' walks a year , and they take a lot of preparation .
' It costs money .
And it 's complex .
It 's not in two days , you know .
So it 's easier to hire Marcel Marceau .
He comes , he puts on his white , and he does his thing for 20 minutes .
So it 's a pain in the ass , a wire - walker .
But it 's an art that 's rarely seen , the way I do it is unique , it has some value . '
When he does work , he earns a lot of money .
But he is n't good with it .
Mostly , it goes on paying back the friends who support him when he has none .
' I 'm very good at spending money , ' he says .
Some of it , he spends on wine .
There are a dozen bottles here , caked in years of dust - including a 1961 Bordeaux ( ' The best year of the century ' ) and a £ 2,000 bottle of Château d'Yquem .
' But somehow I 'm very bad at growing money .
And I do n't care ... I know how to live with nothing . '
And later : ' It 's the most impossible profession in the world .
I am the most stupid man , to have become a wire - walker .
But again , I did n't choose it .
It chose me .
So here I am - a prisoner of something I love . '
When he could n't walk , he used to do street juggling to raise money .
But he has n't done it in a while .
The cities have changed , he says .
People do n't seem to have the time any more .
They live in their own worlds of Walkmans , TV and the internet .
At his house near Woodstock , he has spent the past 10 years building a barn , using only 18th - century tools .
And he worked on his book about his World Trade Center walk , To Reach The Clouds , for years - he interviewed all his friends , kept fastidious notes .
He does n't have a television , so on 11 September he had a phone call from a friend up the hill : his towers were being destroyed .
He rushed to a neighbour 's house and watched it happen , live .
Philippe Petit says he is never afraid when he is actually on the wire .
But he always tastes a tang of fear around it .
And often , after he has completed a walk , when he is on the ground , with the crew and the mayor and a glass of champagne , he will look up and be filled with terror by what he has just done .
At 53 , he says he is stronger on the wire than ever .
' It 's so easy to walk on the wire .
I will stop walking when I cannot walk on the earth .
If I have a cane and I barely can walk on the earth . '
He had hoped that the publication of To Reach The Clouds in America would help him find a backer for the greatest work so far , the Canyon Walk : ' Canyon Walk is a masterpiece for me .
And Canyon Walk is an immense , worldwide event like walking on the moon for the first time .
It will make me so well known all over the world that my life would completely change . '
But so far , it has n't .
Instead , he 's developed a script for a film .
He knows exactly how it will open .
He and his old friend Francis Brunn , who turned 80 last year , will be sitting together on the Observation Deck of the World Trade Center .
They will look out into the void : the unfathomable void .
And Francis will tell Philippe he can hardly believe that he ever did the walk all those years ago .
' You know ? '
Philippe will say .
' I can not believe it either . '

After a gap of 3.5 years , I ’ve finally updated the ‘ A Byte of Python ’ book .
The interesting news is that it is updated for the upcoming Python 3.0 language making it probably the first book to be released for Python 3.0 .
The book is now a wiki too at www.swaroopch.com/notes/Python which means you can contribute too !
The book and wiki are now under the Creative Commons Attribution - Share Alike 3.0 Unported license .
The Non-Commercial clause present in the previous edition of the book has been removed .
It was becoming a hurdle for translators as well as people who wanted to use the book for genuinely good activities , so I decided it to drop the clause .
Since it is a wiki , volunteers can directly create their translations on the wiki .
This eliminates the need to learn DocBook XML and its tools which had become a hindrance for many translators , and I ’m glad to see this already bearing fruit with Eirik Vågeskar starting off a Norwegian translation at www.swaroopch.com/notes/Python_nb-no:Forord.
I will soon be making a printed version of the book available as I have had many requests for this .
So back to the main question :
Why an update after nearly 4 years ?
Two reasons .
First , because of foss.in.
I dedicate this new release to the foss .
in community for their spirit and enthusiasm over the years which have rubbed off on me and kept me working on the update of the book .
Second ,
Over the past few years , the readers ’ reactions have been simply splendid :
Neil ( bigdealne il - at - yahoo - dot - com ) said :
“ ( I ) got an if else to work and I can follow your tutorial , which I have never been able to do no matter who wrote the thing !
you ’re a genius Swaroop ! ”
Gao shuai ( ejwjvh-at-126- dot - com ) took the effort taken to write an email to me in English :
dear swaroop :
I am a chinese student .
My name is gao shuai , ” gao ” is my family name .
Although your book is easy to understand , but my english is bad , so what I read is the chinese edition .
I have made some programs now .
It is interesting .
I like it very much .
I emailed back and he replied :
Mr Swaroop :
I am exciting to read your back .
_( Editor ’s note : I think he means ‘ reply ’ ) _
Tt is the first time that I talk to foreigner though the internet .
I saw that you have your own mail ab .
I think You ’re a great man .
Thanks for your back !(*^_^*)
regards ,
gaoshuai
The interesting part is that this student somewhere in China was being benefited by this book and he “ talked to a foreigner through the internet for the first time ” and that person was me .
It was truly humbling .
People are even putting ads for it , and I had no clue about it until I chanced upon it myself :
If that was n’t enough , I found out that there are 8 - 9 university courses officially using the book , including Harvard and other institutions .
And apparently even NASA is using the book in their Jet Propulsion Laboratory .
Users have suggested that it should replace the official tutorial but I really would n’t go as far as that :)
Recently , I had sent a sneak peek for the book ’s group of readers and within a day , I had the first 10 $ donation by Horst JENS .
I remembered seeing that name somewhere , so I searched my emails and found this :
On Mar 4 , 2007 :
“ Hello Swaroop , i teach a class of ( 3 ) Children how to program in Python .
Just want to thank you because without your ‘ a byte of python ’ ( that i read one year ago ) i would maybe never have begun to code in python and consequently would never leaved my old job to become a Python teacher . ”
A person in Vienna , Austria changed his career from a sys - admin job which he did n’t like , to teaching children about programming , a job he loves .
Wow !
Again , this is so humbling .
I could have never imagined that a small book can make such a difference .
The point is that I ’m grateful for all these people writing to me and sharing their delight and stories .
The book is still alive and kicking thanks to all these people .
Happy programming !
BOSTON ( MarketWatch ) -- Morgan Stanley is considering a merger with Wachovia Corp .
or another bank as one of the last two big brokerage firms tries to halt a swoon in its stock price , the New York Times reported late Wednesday .
Morgan Stanley MS , - 2.35 % Chief Executive John Mack got a phone call Wednesday from Wachovia WB , - 3.74 % expressing interest in the Wall Street firm , the newspaper said , citing unnamed people familiar with the situation .
Morgan Stanley is considering other options as well , the paper added , noting that other banks have also expressed interest in the firm .
It said the talks are preliminary and no deal may emerge .
Shares of Morgan Stanley slumped 24 % on Wednesday .
The firm reported better - than - expected earnings late Tuesday , but the stock lost ground amid speculation the company may be forced to hunt for a suitor .
Morgan Stanley did n't immediately return a call for comment Wednesday morning on the merger speculation .
Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs GS , - 1.14 % are the last two large independent brokers .
Bear Stearns collapsed earlier this year , Lehman Brothers LEH , has filed for bankruptcy and Merrill Lynch MER , +27.69 % has been bought by Bank of America Corp.
BAC , - 1.32 % .
The market meltdown has raised questions about the viability of stand - alone brokers not backed by a large commercial bank .
See previous story .
" What we are seeing is unprecedented in terms of turmoil in the financial - services industry , " said Morgan Stanley Chief Financial Officer Colm Kelleher during Tuesday 's conference call .
" Management indicated that it does not need to combine with a bank and that it has taken actions to strengthen its balance sheet , such as improve its liquidity , " Deutsche Bank analyst Mike Mayo wrote in a research note commenting on Morgan 's results .
Morgan Stanley shares are off roughly 40 % so far this week .
Financial stocks were in the red Wednesday as investors digested the government rescue of insurance giant American International Group Inc. AIG , - 1.23 % .
Investors are growing increasingly worried about brokers ' access to funding in the current environment , and the companies have been trying to scale back their balance sheets .
Bear Stearns ' demise was driven by too much leverage and its trading partners backing away from away it .
Wall Street CEOs have complained about short sellers ganging up on them , and in recent weeks rumors alone have been enough to generate wild swings in the stocks .
Goldman
Sachs earlier this week said its third - quarter profit fell 70 % from a year earlier .
CFO David Viniar saying it has no plans to merge or buy a bank or securities firm to expand its funding sources .
See earlier coverage .
Goldman Sachs shares were also under pressure Wednesday and closed off 14 % .
It is down almost 30 % for the week .
" A few months ago we cited a view -- which we continue to hold -- that Goldman would combine with a commercial bank if the Fed gains legal authority and chooses to regulate brokers in the similar manner as banks , " wrote Fox - Pitt Kelton analyst David Trone in a report to clients Wednesday .
The cost of insuring Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs debt spiked Wednesday , reflecting investor uneasiness over the problems gripping the financial sector .
Nervous banks have stopped lending to each other or have raised the rates sharply despite central banks around the world pumping liquidity into the financial system .
See full story on WSJ.com .
In another sign of the widespread anxiety , the Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday unveiled new rules designed to curtail " naked " short selling , which some claim has helped drive financial stocks lower .

September 17 , 2008  --
It is one of the ironies of the subprime mortgage crisis that while millions of people stand to lose their homes because they can no longer afford to pay their mortgage , the people at the top of the financial institutions that wrote the loans or packaged the risky debt on Wall Street are still tucking themselves in at night , safe and sound inside some very ritzy real estate .
On Monday Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy , and late Tuesday night AIG , the largest insurance firm in the world , was essentially taken over by the federal government in an effort , the government explained , to stave off further disruption to the economy .

Thousands of employees are prepping their resumes and many more people are left to contemplate their dwindling nest eggs .
But for the companies ' executives , men who months ago were given multi-million dollar bonuses despite peering the devastation on the horizon , there is little to worry about .
When Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy on Monday , the company left about 25,000 workers worldwide in the lurch , wondering where their next paycheck will come from .
CEO Richard Fuld , on the other hand , can contemplate his next move from a lavish home in Greenwich , Conn .
The multi-million dollar manse has 20 rooms and includes an indoor squash court .
Fuld and his wife regularly make the ArtNews list of Top Collectors for their interest in " works on paper , especially postwar art . "
And Fuld has some pretty powerful friends .
He managed to get no less a luminary than Bill Clinton to give the commencement address at Middlebury College last year .
Fuld 's son was graduating .
Fuld has been with Lehman Brothers for 39 years , acting as CEO for 15 .
And like most CEOs , he could count on a healthy compensation package .
According to Forbes Magazine , Fuld ranked number No. 11 in CEO compensation , raking in $ 354 million dollars over five years , with an annual compensation including salary and stocks believed to be hovering in the $ 63 million dollar range .
And that 's not an unusual payout , according to Dave Schmidt of James F. Reda and Associates , an executive pay consulting firm .
" Salary is generally under a million , something like $ 750,000 , and then there are long - term incentives like stock and stock options that are paid out in the form of bonuses , " said Schmidt .
Of course there are often other incentives built into a CEO 's contract too , like a car and driver , travel on the company jet , security , legal fees , financial planning , even tax preparation -- all on the company dime .
Wealthy Compensation for Financial Executives
Annual compensation in the multi-million dollar - range enabled Fuld to call more than one swanky address home .
In addition to the Greenwich estate , the Fulds own an apartment at 640 Park Avenue -- one of Manhattan 's most prestigious buildings .
A real estate listing boasts that a similar full - floor apartment has five working fireplaces , parquet de Versailles floors , six staff rooms , a library and " ample closets . "

James Cayne , former chief executive of the now - defunct investment banking firm Bear Stearns , who regularly showed up on Forbes ' list of the 400 Richest Americans , recently purchased two adjacent apartments at the Plaza with to - die - for views of Central Park and a price tag in the neighborhood of $ 27 million dollars .
Under Cayne 's leadership , the company came within hours of failing , until JP Morgan Chase agreed to pay $ 10 a share for the struggling company with the help of about $ 30 billion in federal credit .
Cayne promptly sold all of his stock and netted a reported $ 60 million .
It remains to be seen what sort of compensation package Robert Willumstad , CEO of AIG , the world 's largest insurance company , will get now .
On Tuesday , the Fed promised to back loans to the teetering company to the tune of $ 85 billion , in exchange for 80 percent of its stock .
Willumstad owns homes on Park Ave in Manhattan ; on Long Island , N.Y. ; and in Vermont .
According to BusinessWeek , in July his minimum cash bonus for 2008 was set at $ 4 million and his target bonus was set at $ 8 million .
" I think people are supposed to take away from this that something is incredibly wrong with the system .
Sometimes there seems to be incredible reward for failure , " said Kevin Murphy , a professor of finance at USC's Marshall School .
Murphy is an expert in executive compensation and said that over the last 15 years or so , compensation in the financial services sector has skyrocketed .
Take Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
CEOs Remain Rich Despite Taxpayer Bailout and Job Losses
Taxpayers are now footing the bill for a bailout of these mortgage and insurance giants and employees of these companies may lose their jobs , and have lost millions in their stock ownership plans .
Shares of Fannie Mae are now trading at about 48 cents , down from a high over the past year of just over $ 70 .
Still , last year , according to Equilar , an executive compensation research firm , CEO Daniel Mudd received about $ 14 million in total compensation
And despite his companies ' financial woes , Mudd beds down in a 22 - room Washington mansion that includes a wine cellar , a home theater , a fountain and landscaped gardens .
In 2006 , Freddie Mac's CFO , Anthony Piszel , bought a reported $ 3.6 million , five - bedroom , 8 - bath Colonial in Great Falls , Va. , that is situated on five acres " with a lake , a floating staircase and two kitchens . "
Freddie Mac 's shares are hovering around 25 cents a share .
Despite steering their companies into financial disaster , the CEOs of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac stand to make even more money up to a reported $ 25 million in so - called golden parachute packages .
( The Federal Finance Housing Agency just said that it will block such payments , but that may not be the end of the story -- " I would be shocked if the CEOs do n't sue to get those payments , " said Murphy . )
The issue of executive compensation and the lavish lifestyle that often accompanies it become more of an issue during an economic downturn , according to Kevin Murphy .
" People pay very little attention to executive pay …
It was n't until the markets started dropping and these guys exercised their options that everybody sat up and took notice .
People tend to be very forgiving of compensation when it's tied to performance but when the performance is n't there … "

BRUSSELS ( Reuters ) -
The clock is ticking for Iran to respond to an offer by major powers on its nuclear program , but European diplomats say they are ready to wait a few more days beyond Saturday ’s informal deadline for an answer .
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad listens to a question from a journalist during a news conference in Tehran , May 13 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Raheb Homavandi
Major powers asked Iran on July 19 to respond within two weeks to their offer to hold off on imposing more U.N. sanctions if Tehran would freeze any expansion of its nuclear work .
Iran has dismissed the idea of having a deadline to reply .
EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana -- who leads nuclear talks with Iran for the six major powers -- will not be looking at his watch or declare Iran has missed the deadline if it does not reply by Saturday , EU diplomats said , but the West wants a reply in the next week .
“ One should not focus too much on Saturday , ” one EU official said , speaking on condition of anonymity .
“ If it ’s not Saturday but next week , we ’ll not make a big fuss about it .
What matters is to get a clear answer quickly , in the very coming days . ”
An EU diplomat said : “ We are continuing our double approach of dialogue and pressure .
If dialogue does not work , we could continue with additional pressure ... at the U.N. or EU level . ”
The sources were not authorized to speak publicly about the delicate diplomacy .
The West accuses Iran of seeking to develop nuclear weapons under cover of a civilian power program .
Iran , the world ’s fourth largest oil producer , says its uranium enrichment drive is purely aimed at generating electricity .
FREEZE-FOR-FREEZE
The United Nations has already imposed three rounds of sanctions on Iran .
The stand - off goes back to the revelation in 2002 by an exiled opposition group of the existence of a uranium enrichment facility and heavy water plant in the country .
Iran ’s highest authority , Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , said on Wednesday , ahead of the deadline , that the country would press ahead on its nuclear path .
The freeze - for - freeze offer by the United States , Russia , China , France , Britain and Germany is aimed at getting preliminary talks started .
Formal negotiations on the nuclear , trade and other incentives will not start before Iran suspends uranium enrichment , which has both civilian and military uses .
Iran has rejected suspension in the past and has given no indication so far that it is ready for a freeze .
Solana and Iran ’s chief nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili are unlikely to meet soon but could talk by telephone in the next few days to discuss Tehran ’s answer , another EU diplomat said .
“ We ’ve learned to be patient , ” the diplomat said .
The existing political and economic sanctions target Iran ’s state banks and include visa bans on officials and measures against companies seen as linked to the nuclear program .
Diplomats say new U.N. sanctions on Iran are unlikely before September and possibly not this year , although Western states may take tougher measures of their own .
EU ambassadors agreed this week to a robust interpretation of the April U.N. sanctions resolution , instructing financial institutions to exercise “ restraint ” on export credits and allowing European navies to inspect all Iran - bound cargoes .
The move will be finally approved next week , whatever Iran ’s answer to the latest offer for talks , EU diplomats said .
There has been increasing speculation that either the United States or Israel could attack Iran ’s nuclear facilities , though both have said force should be a last resort .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama said he is likely to back a $ 700 billion financial rescue package hammered out by Congress and the White House .
“ My inclination is to support it , ” Obama told CBS ’s Face the Nation .
“ We have to remember how we got here .
Not so much to allocate blame , but to understand the choices that will face the next president . ”
Obama , an Illinois senator , said he would be reviewing the legislation over the next day to make sure that provisions he sought were included .
The Democratic candidate said in a statement earlier that the deal reached after marathon talks appeared to meet some principles he had set out during the negotiations .
Those included oversight of the bailout program by an independent board and the ability of taxpayers recoup some of the money .
Sometimes the most amazing abilities of the human brain are revealed exactly when things go wrong with it .
Take , for example , savants - people who have mental abilities that could only be characterized as superhuman ( like having photographic memory , playing music perfectly after hearing it just once , or doing complex mathematical calculations in one 's head ) but otherwise severely disabled in every day cognitive functions and social interaction .
Does the human brain have latent savant - like abilities ?
Does our higher cognitive functions somehow block these abilities , and why ?
And can we have savant - like abilities without the accompanying autism and / or developmental disabilities ?
One intriguing study by Dr. Allan Snyder of the Centre for the Mind suggested that temporarily impairing the left fronto - temporal lobe in healthy subjects by low - frequency magnetic pulses could result in savant - like mental abilities ( see , for example : article in New York Times " Savant for a Day " )
Most savants are born with their abilities ( and unfortunately , their developmental disorders ) , but not all : severe brain injuries can , in very rare instances , cause savant - like abilities to surface ( see , for example : The Case of the " Sudden " Savant ) .
One noted savant ( Daniel Tammet , see below ) is a highly functioning autistic savant who can perform amazing mental feats but does not have significant developmental disabilities .
There are a few savants in the world ( called " prodigious savants " ) whose abilities are so exceptional that they would 've been classified as phenomenal with or without cognitive disabilities .
Let 's take a look at 10 savants with superhuman mental skills :
1. Kim Peek , the Real Rain Man
Even though you 've never heard of Kim Peek , chances are you 've heard the movie Rain Man .
Kim was the inspiration for the character played by Dustin Hoffman in the movie .
Kim Peek was born with severe brain damage .
His childhood doctor told Kim 's father to put him in an institution and forget about the boy .
Kim 's severe developmental disabilities , according to the doctor , would not let him walk let alone learn .
Kim 's father disregarded the doctor 's advice .
Till this day , Kim struggles with ordinary motor skills and has difficulty walking .
He is severely disabled , cannot button his shirt and tests well below average on a general IQ test .
But what Kim can do is astounding : he has read some 12,000 books and remembers everything about them .
" Kimputer , " as he is lovingly known to many , reads two pages at once - his left eye reads the left page , and his right eye reads the right page .
It takes him about 3 seconds to read through two pages - and he remember everything on 'em .
Kim can recall facts and trivia from 15 subject areas from history to geography to sports .
Tell him a date , and Kim can tell you what day of the week it is .
He also remembers every music he has ever heard .
Since the movie Rain Man came out , Kim and his father have been traveling across the country for appearances .
The interaction turns out to be beneficial for him , as he becomes less shy and more confident .

2. Leslie Lemke
[ You Tube clip ]
Leslie Lemke did n't have a great start in life .
He was born with severe birth defects that required doctors to remove his eyes .
His own mother gave him up for adoption , and a nurse named May Lemke ( who at the time was 52 and was raising 5 children of her own ) adopted him when he was six months old .
As a young child , Leslie had to be force - fed to teach him how to swallow .
He could not stand until he was 12 .
At 15 , Leslie finally learned how to walk ( May had to strap his fragile body to hers to teach him , step by step , how to walk ) .
At 16 years of age , Leslie Lemke bloomed .
In the middle of one night , May woke up to find Leslie playing Tchaikovsky 's Piano Concerto No. 1 . Leslie , who has no classical music training , was playing the piece flawlessly after hearing it just once earlier on the television .
From then on , Leslie began playing all styles of music from ragtime to classical .
Like the Tchaikovsky piece , he only has to hear the music once in order to play it again perfectly .
He became famous after being portrayed in national television shows .
Before his health started to deteriorate , Leslie gave many concerts around the world .

3. Alonzo Clemons
As a toddler , Alonzo suffered a head injury in an accident that changed his life .
He can't feed himself or tie his shoelaces , but he can sculpt .
And boy , can he sculpt : after seeing only a fleeting image of an animal on a TV screen , Alonzo could sculpt a perfect 3D figure of it , correct in each and every detail right down to the muscle fibers .

4. Gottfried Mind : Cat's Raphael
Gottfried Mind 's cats ( For more , check out Art Prints on Demand )
Gottfried Mind was one of the earliest savants in history .
In 1776 , the eight - year - old Gottfried was placed in an art academy , where his teachers noted that he was " very weak , incapable of hard work , full of talent for drawing , a strange creature , full of artist - caprices , along with a certain roguishness . "
One day , Gottfried 's mentor , a painter named Sigmund Hendenberger , was drawing a cat when Gottfried exclaimed " That is no cat ! "
The teacher asked whether he could do better and sent the child to a corner to draw .
The cat that Gottfried drew was so lifelike that since then he became known as the Cat's Raphael :
In the course of his narrow , indoors life , he had worked himself into an almost paternal relation with domestic animals , especially with cats .
While he sat painting , a cat might generally be seen sitting on his back or on his shoulder ; many times he kept , for hours , the most awkward postures , that he might not disturb it .
Frequently there was a second cat sitting by him on the table , watching how the work went on ; sometimes a kitten or two lay in his lap under the table .
Frogs ( in bottle ) floated beside his easel ; and with all these creatures he kept up a most playful , loving style of conversation ; though , often enough , any human beings about him , or such even as came to see him , were growled or grunted at in no social fashion .

5. Gilles Tréhin
Gilles Tréhin lives part - time in the city of Urville , in an island off the Côte d'Azur , between Cannes and St. Tropez .
Never heard of it ?
That 's because Urville exists only in his mind .
Since he was 5 , Gilles taught himself to draw three dimensional objects .
By 12 , he started building a city he called " Urville " ( after Dumont d'Urville , a French scientific base in the Antarctic ) .
At first he used LEGO , but shortly thereafter , he realized that he could expand his imaginary city much easier with drawings .
Abbaye Sainte Marguerite des Tégartines , in Urville
Urville is n't just an idle idea - Gilles has 250 detailed drawings , complete " history " of the founding the the city , and has even published a book detailing it ( Sneak peak at Google Books )
Visit Urville at Gilles ' official website here : http://urvillecity.free.fr/index.Urville-ENG.htm
6. Jedediah Buxton
Jedediah Buxton , born in Derbyshire , England , in 1707 , could n't write .
By all accounts , he has no knowledge of science or history or anything else for that matter except for numbers .
Jedediah , as it turned out , was one of the world 's earliest mental calculators and savants .
Everything was numbers to Jedediah - in fact , he associated everything he saw or experienced with numbers .
He measured the area of the village he was born in simply by walking around it .
When he saw a dance , his whole attention was to count the number of steps of the dancers .
At a play , Jedediah was consumed with counting the number of words uttered by the actors .
The mental feat of Jedediah Buxton was tested by the Royal Society in 1754 - his mathematical brain was able to calculate numbers up to 39 figures .
7. Orlando Serrell
Orlando Serrell was n't born autistic - indeed , his savant skills only came about after a brain injury .
In 1979 , then ten - year - old Orlando was playing baseball when the ball struck him hard on the left side of his head .
He fell to the ground but eventually got up to continue playing .
For a while , Orlando had headaches .
When they went away , he realized he had new abilities : he could perform complex calendar calculations and remember the weather every day from the day of the accident .
From Orlando's official website :
What makes Orlando Serrell so unique is that he may indeed hold the key that unlocks the genius in us all .
Orlando Serrell did not possess any special skills until he was struck in the head by a baseball when he was 10 .
And his extraordinary gifts seem to be his only side effect .
Could this mean once a key hemisphere in the brain is stimulated , we can all attain the level of genius Orlando posses and beyond ?
Only time and research will tell .
Until then we will do well to keep our eyes on Orlando and learn what we can from his experience .
8. Stephen Wiltshire , the Human Camera
As a young child , Stephen Wiltshire was a mute - he was diagnosed as autistic and was sent to a school for special needs children .
There , he discovered a passion for drawing - first of animals , then London buses , then buildings and the city 's landmarks .
Throughout his childhood , Stephen communicated through his drawings .
Slowly , aided by his teachers , he learned to speak by the age of nine ( his first word was " paper . " )
Stephen has a particularly striking talent : he can draw an accurate and detailed landscape of a city after seeing it just once !
He drew a 10 meter ( ~33 ft ) long panorama of Tokyo following a short helicopter ride .

9. Ellen Boudreaux
Like Leslie Lemke , Ellen Boudreaux is a blind autistic savant with exceptional musical abilities .
She can play music perfectly after hearing it just once , and has a such a huge repertoire of songs in her head that a newspaper reporter once tried to " stump Ellen " by requesting that she played some obscure songs - and failed .
Ellen knew them all .
Ellen has two other savant skills that are unusual .
First , despite her blindness , she is able to walk around without ever running into things .
As she walks , Ellen makes little chirping sounds that seems to act like a human sonar ( See also our post on Ben Underwood , a blind teen who uses echolocation to " see " ) .
Second , Ellen has an extremely precise digital clock ticking in her mind .
To help overcome her fear of the telephone , Ellen 's mom coaxed her to listen to the automatic time recording ( the " time lady " ) when she was 8 .
From then on , Ellen knows the exact hour and minute , any time of the day without ever having seen a clock nor have the concept of the passing of time explained to her .

10 . Daniel Tammet : Brainman
YouTube Clip : Daniel Tammet - The Boy With the Incredible Brain [ 1/5 ]
At first glance , you wo n't be able to tell that Daniel Tammet is anything but normal .
Daniel , 29 , is a highly functioning autistic savant with exceptional mathematical and language abilities .
Daniel first became famous when he recited from memory Pi to 22,514 decimal places ( on 3/14 , the International Pi Day , of course ) to raise funds for the National Society for Epilepsy .
Numbers , according to Daniel , are special to him .
He has a rare form of synesthesia and sees each integers up to 10,000 as having their own unique shapes , color , texture and feel .
He can " see " the result of a math calculation , and he can " sense " whether a number is prime .
Daniel has since drawn what pi looks like : a rolling landscape full of different shapes and colors .
Daniel speaks 11 languages , one of which is Icelandic .
In 2007 , Channel Five documentary challenged him to learn the language in a week .
Seven days later , Daniel was successfully interviewed on Icelandic television ( in Icelandic , of course ! ) .
When he was four years old , Daniel had bouts of epilepsy that , along with his autism , seemed to have brought about his savant abilities .
Though he appears normal , Daniel contends that he actually had to will himself to learn how to talk to and behave around people :
As he describes in his newly published memoir , “ Born on a Blue Day : Inside the Extraordinary Mind of an Autistic Savant ” ( Free Press ) , he has willed himself to learn what to do .
Offer a visitor a drink ; look her in the eye ; do n’t stand in someone else ’s space .
These are all conscious decisions .
Recently , some friends warned him that in his eagerness to make eye contact , he tended to stare too intently .
“ It ’s like being on a tightrope , ” he said .
“ If you try too hard , you ’ll come off .
But you have to try . ” ( Source )
There is a big difference between Daniel Tammet and all the other prodigious savants in the world : Daniel can tell you how he does it and that makes him invaluable to scientists trying to understand the savant syndrome :
Professor Allan Snyder , from the Centre for the Mind at the Australian National University in Canberra , explains why Tammet is of particular , and international , scientific interest .
" Savants ca n't usually tell us how they do what they do , " says Snyder .
" It just comes to them .
Daniel can .
He describes what he sees in his head .
That 's why he 's exciting .
He could be the Rosetta Stone . " ( Source )

Abstract :
We propose a ( limited ) solution to the problem of constructing stream values defined by recursive equations that do not respect the guardedness condition .
The guardedness condition is imposed on definitions of corecursive functions in Coq , AGDA , and other higher - order proof assistants .
In this paper , we concentrate in particular on those non-guarded equations where recursive calls appear under functions .
We use a correspondence between streams and functions over natural numbers to show that some classes of non-guarded definitions can be modelled through the encoding as structural recursive functions .
In practice , this work extends the class of stream values that can be defined in a constructive type theory - based theorem prover with inductive and coinductive types , structural recursion and guarded corecursion
Nearly half of India ’s population  about 456 million people  live on less than $ 1.25 a day , according to World Bank figures released last week .
But as any well - briefed luxury goods executive or private banker knows , India also has a fast - growing wealthy class and emerging middle class that make it one of the world ’s most attractive new places to sell high - end products .
The juxtaposition between poverty and growing wealth presents an unsavory dilemma for luxury goods makers jumping into India :
How does one sell something like a $ 1,000 handbag in a country where most people will never amass that sum of money in their lives , and many are starving ?
The answer is not clear cut , though Vogue ’s approach may not be the way to go .
Marketers need to “ create brand awareness ” in India , said Claudia D’Arpizio , a partner with the consulting firm Bain & Company , who is based in Milan .
She recommended the approach that some consumer brand companies took in China , opening big flagship stores and trying new forms of advertising like television .
Image A man modeled a Burberry umbrella in Vogue that costs about $ 200 .
Some 456 million Indians live on less than $ 1.25 a day .
As India ’s population becomes more affluent , successful luxury goods manufacturers will “ create aspirations , ” Ms. D’Arpizio said , and people will buy their products to show their pride in their prosperity .
On the other hand , she said , would not be prudent for marketers to open luxury stores on “ streets where people are struggling for survival . ”
Brands like Gucci , Jimmy Choo and Hermès have been bunking in high - end hotels or banding together in new superluxury malls , where guards are often stationed at the doors to keep the destitute outside .
One new mall coming to south Delhi , the gold - leafed and marbled Emporio , even features a spa and a members club , developers say .
For now , the Indian middle and upper class  and the companies that aim to cater to it  are just getting used to having new money , said V. Sunil , creative director for advertising agency Weiden & Kennedy in India , which opened its first office here last September .
“ No one thinks they need to do something deeper for the public , ” like address India ’s social ills , he said .
SACRAMENTO -- Barack Obama took plenty of ridicule from John McCain 's campaign earlier this month for suggesting that motorists inflate their tires properly to get better mileage in the face of skyrocketing gas prices .
McCain ’s aides handed out tire pressure gauges , mockingly labeled as Obama ’s energy policy .
But guess what advice emanated today from California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger -- a McCain ally and fellow Republican -- in launching a campaign to help Americans cut down on their gasoline usage ?
“ Here are some additional simple things that I will recommend , like proper tire pressure or avoiding rapid starts and stops , ” Schwarzenegger said , speaking via satellite in Denver to spearhead the EcoDriving USA program , along with Colorado Gov. Bill Ritter , a Democrat , and the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers .
McCain ultimately acknowledged that checking tire pressure was useful , and his campaign subsequently dropped the subject .
Schwarzenegger spokesman Matt David said his boss had offered the tire tip before Obama did .
David e-mailed a quote from the governor from April 2007 , and a news account from this June reporting that Schwarzenegger had made the suggestion during an appearance at a global warming conference in Florida .
In his remarks today , Schwarzenegger echoed what he recently said at the Florida event -- that while “ politicians ” are talking about increasing offshore drilling and use of nuclear power , anyone who says those measures will bring gas prices down soon is “ blowing smoke . ”
McCain is pushing both drilling and nuclear power , and Obama recently changed his position and endorsed limited drilling .
Schwarzenegger , who may play a prominent role next month at the GOP national convention , where McCain is to be nominated for president , also said : “ The politicians in Washington are n’t going to save us .
They ’re too busy squabbling .... instead of listening to those who need our help . ”
Schwarzenegger 's spokesman said he was not criticizing any “ politician ” in particular .
And what of the derision of “ politicians ” from the former bodybuilder and movie star twice elected the governor of California ?
“ The governor is a public servant , ” David said .
“ He does not consider himself a career politician . ”

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
The number of troubled U.S. banks rose 30 percent to 117 in the second quarter , the highest level in five years , and a top regulator warned that conditions will worsen as the housing slump and credit crisis continues to pound profitability .
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp ( FDIC ) Chairman Sheila Bair said on Tuesday she expects more banks to join the agency ’s watchlist of problem banks , which tallies institutions with financial , operational or managerial weaknesses that threaten their financial viability .
“ We do n’t think the credit cycle has bottomed out yet , ” Bair told a quarterly news conference , adding that U.S. banks will not return to high levels of earnings anytime soon .
“ We expect that banks and thrifts will keep building up reserves for the next several quarters , ” Bair said .
The news initially pulled down financial shares before markets closed higher on the back of a surge in energy shares .
Nine U.S. banks have failed so far this year , including mortgage IndyMac Bancorp Inc IDMC.PK , which has drained the FDIC's Deposit Insurance Fund used to repay insured deposits at failed banks .
In a bid to replenish the $ 45.2 billion fund , Bair said the FDIC will consider a plan in October to raise the premium rates banks pay into the fund , a move that will further squeeze the industry .
The agency also plans to charge banks that engage in risky lending practices significantly higher premiums than other U.S. banks , Bair said , to encourage safer business practices .
Charlie Peabody , a bank analyst at Portales Partners in New York , said such a weighted tax could hurt already troubled banks past the point of recovery .
“ The tax will fall most heavily on the weakest , so the conclusion is , the weak are going to get weaker and the strong will be able to take advantage of the weak , ” he said .
An auction sign is displayed in front of a home in Stockton , California February 2 , 2008 .
Stockton posted one foreclosure for every 31 households in the third quarter of 2007 , the highest foreclosure rate among the 100 largest U.S. metropolitan areas in that period , according to real estate data company RealtyTrac .

SHRINKING EARNINGS
The FDIC said the sector ’s earnings fell 86 percent from a year earlier to $ 5 billion in the second quarter , mainly due to a fourfold rise in provisions for bad loans to $ 50.2 billion .
With the exception of the fourth quarter of 2007 , industry profits were the lowest since the fourth quarter of 1991 .
“ The numbers are alarming , but we are coming off of an incredibly low base of problem institutions and failures , ” said Mike Stevens , senior vice president for regulatory policy at the Conference of State Bank Supervisors .
“ This is nowhere near what we had seen during prior periods of weakness .
Are we done ?
I do n’t think anyone would predict that .
We have a ways to go . ”
The FDIC said the combined assets of the 117 problem banks increased to $ 78 billion , from $ 26 billion in assets at 90 banks in the first quarter .
Bair has said that historically 13 percent of banks on the watchlist fail .
The latest figure included $ 32 billion of assets from IndyMac , which became the third - largest U.S. bank failure in July .
FDIC examiners closely monitor the watchlist but do not publicly release the names on it .
Bair said 98 percent of the 8,500 U.S. banks continue to be well - capitalized .
She also noted that the banking sector 's exposure to mortgage giants Fannie Mae FNM.N and Freddie Mac's FRE.
N preferred securities is " not problematic " but said some smaller institutions ' exposures could cause them greater stress .
“ With $ 8.6 trillion in deposits , banks have plenty of resources to continue meeting the lending needs in their communities , ” said James Chessen , chief economist for the American Bankers Association .
The FDIC said it continues to see stress in the commercial real estate market , especially in construction and development areas .
The agency said the majority of new banks on the problem list have landed there because of major exposures in commercial real estate , whereas before the problem banks were distressed by residential products .
Delinquent loans -- those more than 90 days past due -- jumped by almost 20 percent during the quarter to $ 162.9 billion , the FDIC said .
( See < ID : nN26308013 > for details . )
SHRINKING SAFETY NET
The FDIC ’s Deposit Insurance Fund fell 14 percent in the second quarter due to IndyMac and other bank failures .
IndyMac is now expected to cost the fund $ 8.9 billion , topping the agency ’s prior estimates of $ 4 billion to $ 8 billion , the FDIC said .
( See < IDn : N26378608 > for more details )
Diane Ellis , the FDIC ’s associate director of financial - risk management , said the agency is consulting with industry about the best approach to replenish the fund .
“ Any time that you are going to go through a credit cycle , you are going to be in a situation where you are going to have to start charging for insurance , ” said Peter Kovalski , bank analyst and portfolio manager at Alpine Woods Investments .
“ It will be another cross for banks to bear , but it wo n’t be the straw that breaks their banks . ”

The boy , 3 , who got fed up with trying to pick up a teddy bear in the arcade machine ... and crawled inside instead
They say the fun's in the taking part .
But someone forgot to explain that to Christopher Air .
And when his mother Elaine took the three - year - old to the games arcade on the family 's holiday in Skegness , he just wanted to get his hands on the winnings .
For a while , he had been playing happily on the crane machine , trying to pick up a teddy bear with its mechanical arm .
But he was n't having any success .
Trapped : Little Christopher was stuck in the machine for one and a half hours
And as Mrs Air went to change a £ 20 note so he could try again , Christopher took matters into his own hands .
Rather like a scene in the film Toy Story , he spotted the flap on the machine , from where the prizes are delivered , and squeezed inside .
Mrs Air said : ' My back was only turned for a minute .
When I looked around , Christopher was inside .
' He 's good at solving problems .
He obviously saw getting the teddy bear as a problem and getting inside the machine as the answer . '
For Christopher , at last united with the bear , it was the perfect solution ... in the short term at least .
Reunited : Christopher Air with Winnie and parents Peter , 33 , and Elaine , 33
But it proved more difficult to get out , than in - especially as the arcade owner could n't locate the keys .
Mrs Air , 33 , of Grangetown , Sunderland , added : ' Initially , Christopher was laughing .
But then a crowd started to gather and he got upset and started crying . '
After 30 minutes , he was released - and is sure to have learned his lesson .
But , misguided as it was , his ingenuity paid off - the arcade owner gave him the bear to cheer him up .
The toddler is now back at home with Winnie .
Mrs Air added : ' If you mention what happened , he just laughs and he puts a little guilty look on his face .
' You can see he ’s a bit embarrassed about it but he ’s none the worse for what happened . '

I ’m sure you all disagree , so let me hear it …
By Barry Hussein ( Mr Impossible & The Serge also contibuted to portions of this article ) DENVER -
As Barrack Obama ’s throngs of gyrating bikini - clad supporters are just coming to terms with his formal renunciation of his decision Thursday to select his wife of eighteen years Michelle Obama as vice - presidential running mate , a new shocker is shock - rocking this seaside mountain villa .
Denver high school senior Ignatious Woo , 11 , set off a firestorm early Saturday when he posted on his blog hillaryhotrodhamclinton.com that “ if you add the names of mr. barack obama and his new running mate mr. biden together , they spell osama bin laden . ”
Woo , who has attracted much attention for his whistling and catcalling during the speech of Ms. Clinton at the Democratic convention is fond of puzzles and claims his uncle “ invented sudoku ” .
Cemented Republican presidential nominee John McCain beamed with mischief when asked to comment on Woo ’s spelling skills .
“ The little bugger , ” he laughed .
McCain generally calls children , and all humans under 60 , “ little buggers ” according to his campaign spokesperson Margret Haime .
“ It ’s a term of affection , and has origins in Irish , Belgian and Norwegian folklore , ” she added .
Mr. Obama ’s camp has predictably , been not as admiring of the young Woo .
“ He ’s eleven , ok ?
Eleven , ” barked Team Obama pointman Dale Jaffe .
“ And I think it ’s clear that when we get to the stage when eleven - year - olds are starting to decide who loses and who gets ahead in American politics , we ’re in big trouble . ”
Make sense ?
ACCRA ( Reuters ) - Logging of a Ghanaian forest submerged 40 years ago by a hydroelectric dam could point to an underwater timber bonanza worth billions of dollars in tropical countries , a senior Ghanaian official said on Monday .
Exploiting submerged rot - resistant hardwoods such as ebony , wawa or odum trees in Lake Volta , the largest man-made lake in Africa , can also slow deforestation on land and curb emissions of greenhouse gases linked to burning of forests .
“ Logging will start in October , ” Robert Bamfo , head of Climate Change at the government ’s Forestry Commission , told Reuters on the sidelines of a U.N. August 21 - 27 climate conference in Accra .
“ This will reduce the pressure on our forests . ”
“ The project aims to harvest 14 million cubic meters ( 494.4 million cu ft ) of timber worth about $ 4 billion , ” he said .
Logging will be led by a privately owned Canadian company , CSR Developments , which says it aims to invest $ 100 million in Ghana .
Cutting equipment can be mounted on barges , guided by sonars to grab trees below water .
“ There are very similar circumstances in numerous countries around the world including Ivory Coast , Cameroon , Brazil , Surinam , Malaysia and others , ” Bamfo said of forgotten forests swamped by hydroelectric dams .
“ The potential is there -- they are awaiting to see the outcome of the Ghana project , ” he said .
He told the conference there were estimates that there were “ 5 million hectares ( 12.36 million acres ) of salvageable submerged timber in the hydroelectric reservoirs in the tropics with the potential to supplement global demand for timber . ”
“ The trees are still strong , ” Bamfo said , even though they had been under water since construction of the Akosombo Dam in the 1960s .
Harvesting would cost more than on land but was still commercial because of the value of the timber .
BOAT COLLISIONS
In some shallower parts of the lake , covering an area of 850,000 hectares ( 2.1 million acres ) , thousands of trunks jut several meters out of the water .
The lake is 90 meters ( 300 ft ) deep at its deepest with a mean depth of 19 meters .
“ Boat collisions with submerged tree stumps cause many fatalities every year , ” Bamfo said .
In the 1960s , no one saw a need to fell the trees as the lake rose .
“ Maybe at the time we thought we had enough timber in our forest estates to sustain us .
Now , because of the decline , we need to diversify . ”
Ghana is being deforested at a rate of about 1.9 percent a year .
The U.N. conference is looking at ways to slow deforestation , blamed by U.N. surveys for emitting almost 20 percent of greenhouse gases from human activities .
Trees soak up carbon dioxide as they grow and release it when burnt or when they rot .

With the explosion of interest in real - world use of functional programming , DEFUN is aimed squarely at practitioners : developers and technical managers who are using functional programming , or who are considering doing so .
Attendees will learn how to achieve maximum benefit using functional programming from experienced practitioners , both from industry and academia .
Talks provide concrete advice on how to tackle specific problems using functional programmings .
Tutorials are forums for collaborative learning and hands - on practice of functional programming and function - programming techniques .
Whereas the talks are pure presentations ( with short Q&As ) , the tutorials are partly presentations , and partly " bring - your - laptop " sessions , where the tutorial presenter arranges practice problems for the participants to work on , and looks over the participants ' shoulders .
Thus , the developer tracks are complementary to ICFP itself ( which is for researchers ) .
They are anchored by CUFP , the Haskell Symposium , and the Erlang workshop .
Together , these events constitute a conference for developers that will promote participation by the growing community of professional users of functional programming technology .
DEFUN will have several tracks with the following types of presentations :
SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - Gannett Co Inc plans to eliminate 1,000 positions from its local newspapers around the U.S. because of declining advertising and circulation revenue , and may cut more if those conditions persist .
A Detroit Free Press newspaper box is seen in downtown Detroit , August 3 , 2005 .

The largest U.S. newspaper publisher said the cuts equal about 3 percent of the positions in its Community Publishing unit , according to a memo obtained by Reuters on Thursday .
The unit accounts for the vast majority of the company ’s newspapers , except for USA Today .
About 600 people probably will be laid off as part of the cuts , the memo said .
The remaining cuts will come from retirements , resignations and other vacancies that will go unfilled .
Gannett , which is based in McLean , Virginia , sent the undated memo to publishers of its more than 80 community newspapers , asking them to notify employees by August 15 .
The company , which publishes USA Today , is the latest U.S. newspaper publisher to slash headcount because of falling advertising and circulation revenue .
McClatchy Co , The New York Times Co , The Washington Post Co and Tribune Co all have cut their employee rolls , either through buyouts or layoffs .
U.S. newspaper publishers have been battered by a steep fall in classified advertising revenue brought on by wider economic woes spurred by the housing crisis as well as a steady migration of readers seeking free news on the Internet .
At Gannett , publishers are getting a reduced payroll dollar amount that they must meet based on the unit ’s financial performance and previous reductions , and have several options to reach their targets such as leaving open vacant positions , normal resignations and retirements , and layoffs .
“ We would prefer no more reductions , but ... we must keep expenses in line with revenue , ” the memo said .
“ If advertising and circulation revenues continue to decline , further payroll reductions may be necessary . ”
At the Gannett - owned Courier - Journal in Louisville , Kentucky , Publisher Arnold Garson told employees that 15 of them will lose their jobs , and added that the company does not see the revenue declines easing any time soon , according to an article posted on the paper ’s website .
Gannett publishes newspapers in more than 30 states , including The Arizona Republic , The Green Bay Press - Gazette in Wisconsin , The Honolulu Advertiser in Hawaii and The Courier - Post in southern New Jersey .
Gannett shares rose $ 1.56 , or 8 percent , to $ 20.82 on the New York Stock Exchange .
Many other newspaper shares rose as well on Thursday .
According to the bill , parents can choose to perform the procedure on behalf of a small child .
However difficulties may arise in cases where one parent opposes the circumcision .
Officials hope to bring the bill before Parliament as early as this year .
In Finland circumcisions are carried out for religious purposes by members of the Jewish , Muslim and Tartar communities .
Estimates are that currently about 100 operations are performed annually .
Police Investigate Two Circumcision Cases
Currently the law on male circumcision is somewhat hazy .
Information about circumcisions is passed on to police for further investigation .
Police enquiries have put an end to some attempts to carry out circumcisions , since the procedure is treated as serious abuse .
In 2006 , the Turku district court convicted a Muslim mother for circumcising her son , however she was not sentenced .
The Court of Appeal subsequently ruled that the mother was not guilty of abuse .
The case is now being considered in the Finnish Supreme Court .
Helsinki police are currently investigating two cases in which male circumcisions were performed by Muslim and Jewish families .
Both operations were performed by persons brought into Finland by the families , and who were not medical professionals .
Police say that complications arose following the procedures and the babies had to be hospitalised .
The cases will be reviewed by the prosecutor during the autumn .
But he said the problem was " far more extensive " than that because police were " well aware " that millions of dollars were going to other countries as part of the same fraud process .
Detective Superintendent
Hay said NSW was the biggest victim group " by a mile " .
He said police struggled to get a handle on the issue because many incidents went unreported .

MashUp Blog :
Are you a victim of a Nigerian scam ?
---------------------------------------------------
Nigerian scams , also known as 419 frauds , are typically conducted via email and centre on the target being persuaded to advance significant sums of money in the hope of realising a much larger windfall some time in the future .
There are many variations .
In one version , the scammer poses as a government worker who has embezzled millions of dollars and offers victims a percentage if they help retrieve the money by providing a relatively small amount for bribes or other fees .
The victims believe they are investing to make a large profit but , after receiving the money , the scammer disappears or , for the most gullible of victims , continues to ask for more advances .
Some Nigerian fraudsters go as far as setting up fake profiles on dating sites using pictures of attractive men and women .
They string along potential targets for months before organising to meet them , but first ask for money to , for instance , help pay for a plane ticket .
Queensland Police recently contacted 139 people who had sent money to Nigeria and found 135 were fraud victims .
Some romance scam victims lost $ 35,000 , while businesses who fell prey to Nigerian investment scams - such as the construction of a fictitious oil pipeline - lost up to $ 5 million .
" I get phone calls very regularly from concerned relatives saying , ' Look , I think my mother or my father is a victim of a scam , they wo n't listen to us .
Could you please contact them and explore this situation for me ? ' " Detective Superintendent
Hay said .
But to the amazement of police , when victims are informed of the fraud they often continue sending money to the scammers out of sheer pride or embarrassment .
" Here they have this dream that their life is going to turn around , all their money problems are finished and they 'll be able to have a future ... and we 're smashing it against a brick wall .
We 're saying , ' Sorry , you 're a victim and the hundreds of thousands of dollars that you 've parted with has been lost , ' " Detective Superintendent Hay said .
A 2006 study by research firm Chatham House found Nigerian scams cost the British economy £ 150 million a year .
But the cost to society goes beyond just losing money , police say .
Some victims had attempted suicide while others saw their marriages end and their businesses go bankrupt .
Award - winning poet Anne Fairbairn - the only granddaughter of Australia 's fourth Prime Minister , Sir George Reid - has fallen prey to a different version of the Nigerian scam .
She is a perfect example of the type of person targeted by internet fraudsters .
See her story here .
To understand the scope of the Nigerian fraud problem and co-ordinate a response , Victorian Police teamed up with the University of Melbourne to investigate 1400 Victorians who had transferred money to Nigeria recently .
The results of the survey will be published this year .
Victoria Police Detective Acting Inspector Paul Weller and Detective Superintendent
Hay both said most victims were educated professionals and self - funded retirees .
" Many elderly people cannot financially recover once they have been defrauded , " Detective Acting Inspector Weller said .
Queensland Police was the first Australian law enforcement agency to put Nigerian scammers on the agenda .
Late last year it brought law enforcement officials , governments and affected industries from around the world together for the National Nigerian Fraud Symposium .
In October it will hold the National Advance Fee Fraud Symposium in Brisbane to build on strategies developed at last year 's conference .
NSW Police did not respond to requests for comment on this story , while the Australian Federal Police , which houses the Australian High Tech Crime Centre , referred queries to state police .
Last week , lawyers Davenport Lyons who are currently threatening hundreds of BitTorrent users with legal action , tasted victory in Central London County Court with wins in cases against four file - sharers .
Fortunately , these ' victories ' mean little , as Davenport chose not to go after people who defend themselves , instead picking on people they knew would n't even come to court .
To those in the BitTorrent community , the name Davenport Lyons will be familiar .
The London - based lawyers are responsible for a barrage of threatening letters sent to hundreds of alleged file sharers .
They want people who they accuse of uploading Dream Pinball 3D , Colin McRae Dirt and Call of Juarez to comply with their demands , which means accepting that the highly - suspect evidence provided by anti-piracy tracking company Logistep is actually correct , promising never to share files again and then paying several hundred pounds to Davenport Lyons to call off the legal action .
Several individuals accused by Davenport in the Dream Pinball 3D case have access to some formidable resources and are actually relishing the opportunity of having their day in court .
However , as we recently reported , Davenport Lyons like to carefully pick their prey – they simply cannot afford to lose a case due to faulty evidence .
TorrentFreak is in contact with many people who are accused by Davenport of uploading , and it ’s becoming apparent that people who dig in their heels – who refuse to be intimidated and refuse to be bullied – are mysteriously left alone and not taken to court .
But before we get carried away , here ’s some sobering news .
Last Friday , seemingly against all the odds and proving our previous articles completely wrong , Davenport Lyons achieved court victories against four file - sharers it accused of unauthorized distribution of Topware ’s Dream Pinball 3D .
David Gore , a partner at Davenport Lyons said : “ Copyright owners spend millions of pounds developing copyright works for sale to the public for their enjoyment and yet many think it is acceptable to obtain the work illegally and for free by procuring a copy on a peer - to - peer network . ”
The four were hit with fines of Â£ 750 each – to be paid within a week – along with Â £ 2000 costs .
Ouch .
Surely these historic victories would now open the flood gates to enable the lawyers and anti-pirates to absolutely hammer the hundreds of people who also stand accused ?
Well , not quite , no .
Not even close .
The victories claimed by Davenport Lyons at Central London County Court on behalf of publisher Topware were all achieved by way of so - called ‘ default judgment ’ .
In basic terms , this means that as the individuals accused did n’t bother to turn up at court or even answer court documents , the court had no alternative than to hand victory to Davenport Lyons and Topware .
The remaining several hundred people accused of file - sharing by Davenport Lyons will be heartened to know that the company only has the confidence to go after people it knows will not turn up at court , assuring them of victory .
Loading up its metaphorical gun and getting ready to fire more legal bullets into a small barrel of defenseless fish , Davenport says it has more of these cases lined up to ‘ win ’ later on this week , while everyone else stands around yawning wondering when they ’ll pick on someone who will actually fight back .
If you are one of the four who lost their case last Friday or have been served with court documents to appear in the future , please get in touch via the contact page , we want to speak with you .

Iron Man star Robert Downey Jr. will not be jumping from Marvel to D.C. anytime soon .
In an interview with MovieHole . net to promote Tropic Thunder , the dashing actor fearlessly tore the ass off The Dark Knight and the comic empire behind it .
" Did n't get it , " he said , " still ca n't tell you what happened in the movie , what happened to the character and in the end they need him to be a bad guy .
I 'm like , ' I get it .
This is so high brow and so fucking smart , I clearly need a college education to understand this movie . '
You know what ?
Fuck DC comics .
That 's all I have to say and that 's where I 'm really coming from . "
Downey also explained , " My whole thing is that that I saw The Dark Knight .
I feel like I 'm dumb because I feel like I do n't get how many things that are so smart .
It 's like a Ferrari engine of storytelling and script writing and I 'm like , ' That 's not my idea of what I want to see in a movie . '
I loved The Prestige but did n't understand The Dark Knight . "
And do n't bother warning him about possible reprisals for such loose talk .
" You know , you 're never too old to burn your bridges because I believe I have offended everyone .
I think I 've got a couple more .
' I 'll burn that bridge when I come to it ' is my favourite phrase I 've ever coined . " [ via OhNoTheyDidn't ]
Last year was the first installment of this argentinian Smalltalk conference .
Now , a group is preparing the 2008 version .
This is the site ( Seaside based ) and annoucement :
Smalltalks 2008 – 2nd Argentinian Smalltalk Conference
This year ’s conference will take place on the 13th , 14th and 15th of November on the Universidad Abierta Interamericana , Av. Montes de Oca 745 , Buenos Aires , Argentina .
Like the 2007 conference , the registration will be free of charge .
This year we are willing to offer new activities .
For this reason we open the calls for : Talks
The conference will have two tracks , one on Scientific Research and other on Software Development for Industries .
Programming Contest
This year we will host a programming contest , encompassing all Smalltalks dialects .
Keynotes Guest lectures by outstanding personalities .
Hands on Tutorial sessions .
There is a call for papers ( PDF version ) , about topics :
Aspects , Aspect Languages and Applications .
Ambient Intelligence , Ubiquitous / Pervasive Computing and Embedded Systems .
Compilation Technology , Optimization , Virtual Machines .
Educational Material .
Language Engineering , Extensions .
Model Driven Engineering / Development .
Meta-Modeling .
Programming in the Large , Design , Architectures and Components .
Programming Environments , Browsers , User Interfaces , UI Frameworks .
Reasoning About Code ( Analyses , Refactoring , Type Inference , Metrics ) .
Reflection and Meta-programming .
Team management .
Testing , Extreme Programming / Practices .
Web Services , Internet Applications , Event - driven Programming .
Experience Reports .
Interesting , this year they are extending the scope of the research and educational track to include other dynamic languages , not only Smalltalk .
They have an impressive Program Committee :
Federico Balaguer ( LIFIA , Universidad Nacional de La Plata , Argentina )
Tulio Ballari ( UTN , Buenos Aires , Argentina )
Alexandre Bergel ( INRIA , Lille , France )
Gilad Bracha ( Cadence Design Systems , USA )
Johan Brichau ( Université Catholique de Louvain , Belgium )
Cecilia Challiol ( LIFIA , Universidad Nacional de La Plata , Argentina )
Marcus Denker ( SCG , University of Bern , Switzerland )
Fernando Dodino ( UTN , Buenos Aires , Argentina )
Stéphane Ducasse ( INRIA , Lille , France )
Alejandra Garrido ( LIFIA , Universidad Nacional de La Plata , Argentina )
Tudor Girba ( SCG , University of Bern , Switzerland )
Orla Greevy ( SCG , University of Bern , Switzerland )
Julián Grigera ( LIFIA , Universidad Nacional de La Plata , Argentina )
Andy Kellens ( PROG , Vrije Universiteit Brussels , Belgium )
Kim Mens ( Université Catholique de Louvain , Belgium )
Guillermo Adrián Molina ( ESSI Projects , Spain )
Damien Pollet ( INRIA , Lille , France )
David Röthlisberger ( SCG , University of Bern , Switzerland )
Daniel Solmirano ( UTN , Buenos Aires , Argentina )
Tom Van Cutsem ( PROG , Vrije Universeit Brussels , Belgium )
Roel Wuyts ( IMEC , Belgium )
Smalltalk is a technology that , in my opinion , failed to crossing the chasm .
At late 80s , early 90s , the community was divided in many diverging dialects and commercial implementations .
But it has impetus and loyalty members , as was proved last year , here , in Argentina , with the success of the last year conference .
I hope Smalltalk could integrate with other technologies , like .NET and Java , in order to gain more momentum and acceptance .
See , as an example , F# adoption in scientific community : the access to a popular class framework is a key feature in today mainstream .
Insisting in one world , one language attitude is not an option , nowadays .
I celebrate , then , the open of the above call for papers to other dynamic languages .

The free ice will need to be monitored in case it becomes a hazard to shipping A large chunk of an Arctic ice shelf has broken free of the northern Canadian coast , scientists say .
Nearly 20 sq km ( eight sq miles ) of ice from the Ward Hunt shelf has split away from Ellesmere Island , according to satellite pictures .
It is thought to be the biggest piece of ice shed in the region since 60 sq km of the nearby Ayles Ice Shelf broke away in 2005 .
Scientists say further splitting could occur during the Arctic summer melt .
The polar north is once again experiencing a rapid ice retreat this year , although many scientists doubt the record minimum extent of 4.13 million sq km ( 1.59 million sq miles ) of sea-ice seen in 2007 will be beaten .
Nonetheless , dramatic changes are occurring in the region , affecting the ice both in the open ocean and the ice which is attached to the coast .
Researchers had predicted that the Ward Hunt Ice Shelf ( WHIS ) was likely to experience a major calving event of this nature .
The satellite images from last week show ice breaking away in two major segments - their area totalling 20 sq km - together with some smaller fragments .
The one take - home message for me here is that these ice shelves are n't re-generating
Dr Derek Mueller , Trent University Scientists travelling with the Canadian armed forces visited the area recently and found major new fractures in the ice that stretched for more than 16 km ( 10 miles ) .
Ellesmere Island was once bounded by one giant ice shelf that covered almost 10,000 sq km ( 3,500 sq miles ) .
Now this expanse of ice has retreated into a string of five , much smaller , individual shelves , which together cover just under 1,000 sq km ( 400 sq miles ) .
At 440 sq km ( 170 sq miles ) in size and 40 m ( 130 ft ) thick , the WHIS is the largest of the remnant shelves .
Scientists have been studying the Canadian feature because of what it can tell them about Arctic history .
Radiocarbon dating of driftwood trapped behind the shelf in Disraeli Fjord shows the shelf itself has been in place for at least 3,000 years .
Researchers believe the mechanism which has maintained its stability - fresh water coming out of Disraeli Fjord and freezing under the shelf - may have been disturbed .
If that is the case , the rest of the WHIS may disappear quite rapidly , researchers say .

The current warming being experienced in the Arctic means the conditions needed to rebuild the shelves simply does not exist .
" The one take - home message for me here is that these ice shelves are n't re-generating , " explained Dr Derek Mueller , from Trent University , Ontario .
" There were , for some period of time , incipient ice shelves reforming in the form of sea-ice that just remained fast to the land for many decades ; and those pieces of ice have broken up in the last eight years or so , " he told BBC News .
" Those aborted attempts at re-growth suggest to me that the conditions are not right either to maintain or re-grow these ice shelves . "
Loss of ice in the Arctic , and in particular the extensive sea-ice , has global implications .
The " white parasol " at the top of the planet reflects energy from the Sun straight back out into space , helping to cool the Earth .
Further loss of Arctic ice will see radiation absorbed by darker seawater and snow - free land , potentially warming the Earth 's climate at an even faster rate than current observational data indicates .
As with the Ayles breakout in 2005 , the authorities will have to track the Ward Hunt ice carefully .
Its size means it could be a hazard to shipping and offshore development in the region .

Two U.S. Navy ships , including a guided missile destroyer USS McFaul , and a U.S. Coast Guard cutter are getting underway to transport humanitarian assistance supplies to Georgia , U.S. European Command ( EUCOM ) said on August 21 .
It said USS McFaul ( DDG 74 ) departed from Souda Bay , Crete , on Wednesday and the cutter Dallas ( WHEC 716 ) will depart later this week .
McFaul and Dallas are scheduled to transit into the Black Sea and arrive in Georgia within a week , according to the U.S. European Command .
The announcement comes after it was reported that Turkey gave its go - ahead to sail through its straits into the Black Sea .
“ The ships will transport thousands of blankets , hygiene items , baby food and infant supplies to save lives and alleviate human suffering , ” U.S. European Command said .
The Associated Press reported quoting unnamed U.S. official in Turkey that USS Mount Whitney would be among those three vessels expected to arrive in Georgia .
Anatoly Nogovitsin , deputy chief of the general staff of the Russian armed forces , said at a news conference in Moscow on August 21 , that the Russia ’s Black Sea fleet continued “ providing security regime for maritime in the eastern part of the Black Sea . ”
“ There is no need to further reinforce it [ the fleet ] , ” he added .
Meanwhile , a team of U.S. European Command , led by Army Brig .
Gen. John Miller , is already in Tbilisi “ to assess the current humanitarian situation and make recommendations on continued humanitarian support to senior military leadership . ”
“ The EUCOM team will conduct a deliberate and focused assessment , encompassing variables such as transportation , infrastructure , manpower and many other life support considerations , ” the U.S. European Command said .
And on August 21 , the head of the U.S. European Command , Gen. John Craddock , who is also NATO 's supreme allied commander for Europe , also arrived in Tbilisi .
( CNN ) -- Sen. Barack Obama has widened his lead over Sen. John McCain , according to CNN 's latest " poll of polls . "
Sen. Barack Obama leads Sen. John McCain by 3 percentage points , according to CNN's " poll of polls . "
The senator from Illinois is ahead of McCain in national polls by 3 percentage points , 47 percent to 44 percent .
Obama was up by 2 points in the poll of polls released earlier Thursday .
McCain led in national polls last week , but by the weekend , the candidates were tied .
Obama recaptured the lead for the first time in 10 days Wednesday .
The latest poll of polls consists of four surveys : CBS / The New York Times ( September 12 - 16 ) , Gallup ( September 15 - 17 ) , Diageo / Hotline ( September 14 - 16 ) and American Research Group ( September 13 - 15 ) .
It does not have a sampling error .
The economic crisis has given Obama and his running mate , Sen. Joe Biden , the opportunity to go on the offensive .
Most Americans see Obama as more capable than McCain when it comes to the economy , polls indicate .
The two campaigns have traded shots all week , most recently over the government takeover of insurance giant American International Group Inc .
At a campaign event Thursday in Cedar Rapids , Iowa , McCain said he did n't want the government to have to take over the company but called the action necessary .
iReport.com : Share your stories from the campaign trail
" When AIG was bailed out , I did n't like it , but I understood it needed to be done to protect hard - working Americans with insurance policies and annuities , " he said .
" Sen. Obama did n't take a position .
On the biggest issue of the day , he did n't know what to think .
He may not realize it , but you do n't get to vote ' present ' as president of the United States . "
The senator from Arizona also accused Obama of seeing the economic crisis as a " political opportunity . "
Obama 's campaign responded by accusing McCain of flip - flopping on the issue because he said he opposed the bailout this week .
" Barack Obama does not second - guess the Fed 's decision to take unprecedented action to prevent the failure of one of the largest insurance companies in the world from creating an even larger crisis , and he believes it must protect families who count on insurance , " campaign spokesman Bill Burton said .
Watch how Obama has been going after McCain »
Biden continued to slam McCain for his economic plan and lack of support for financial and health care regulation , calling the Republican 's answers for the struggling economy " the ultimate ' Bridge to Nowhere . ' "
" He is totally out of touch with the problems of average people , " Biden said in Canton , Ohio .
" If you look at John McCain 's answers for the economy , and we 're in such desperate shape , " Biden continued , " [ they 're ] the ultimate Bridge to Nowhere .
It 's nowhere .
It takes you nowhere . "
Following a week of playing defense , McCain toughened his tone at his Iowa event Thursday .
Watch McCain campaign in Iowa »
" Sen . Obama has never made the kind of tough reform we need today .
His idea of reform is what his party leaders in Congress order him to do , " he said .
" I know how to make the change that Sen. Obama and this Congress is afraid of .
" My opponent sees an economic crisis as a political opportunity instead of a time to lead .
Sen .
Obama is n't change ; he 's part of the problem with Washington . "
Watch McCain get tough on Obama »
Democrats pounced on McCain 's comments that if he were president , he would fire Securities and Exchange Chairman Christopher Cox .
Speaking after a bipartisan meeting Thursday evening with congressional and financial leaders about the financial meltdown , Cox said , " Right now with so much at stake for our country there 's no time political slamming .
This is the time and the opportunity for leadership . "
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D - Nevada , said that although he was not going to vouch for Cox , " This is very typical McCain - style politics .
Go after the first person you can to divert attention from your failures . "
During Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin 's remarks in Iowa , she lashed out at Biden , who earlier Thursday tied paying taxes to patriotism .
In an interview with ABC News , Biden was asked whether people making more than $ 250,000 would pay more in taxes under Obama 's economic plan .
" You got it .
It 's time to be patriotic , " he said .
" Time to jump in .
Time to be part of the deal .
Time to help get America out of the rut . "
Palin shot back , " To them , raising taxes -- and Joe Biden said it again today -- raising taxes is about patriotism .
To the rest of America , that 's not patriotism .
Raising taxes is about killing jobs and hurting small businesses and making things worse . "
Watch Palin speak out against her opponents »
McCain and Palin were drowned out by anti-war protesters for a few moments during the Iowa event .
Palin kept speaking throughout the disruption , but her remarks were nearly unintelligible to much of the audience inside the airplane hangar where the rally was held .
About five minutes into Palin 's speech , four female students from the University of Iowa Feminist Majority and the University of Iowa Anti-War Alliance held up a cloth banner and began a loud anti-war chant in the middle of the crowd .
Other members of the audience shouted them down with chants of " USA ! USA ! " and " Sarah ! Sarah ! "
It was several minutes before the women were escorted from the venue .
CNN 's Peter Hamby contributed to this report .

' Polar bear ' beaten with sack of money at RNC protest Nick Langewis and David Edwards
Published : Wednesday September 3 , 2008
Print This Email This A " polar bear " collapsed on a St. Paul , Minnesota sidewalk , to be symbolically " finished off " by a man wielding a sack of money as a weapon during a protest outside the Texas delegation 's hotel as part of Wednesday 's Republican National Convention counter - festivities .
" Less jobs , more wars ! " the demonstrators , masked and costumed , chanted as fake currency , corporate logos and the cardboard faces of such figures as Alaska Governor Palin and Senator McCain pranced around the scene .
Palin , Senator McCain's Vice Presidential pick , has reportedly embraced a study funded in part by oil giant ExxonMobil and the American Petroleum Institute which sought to downplay the effects of climate change on " observed patterns in polar bear population ecology . "
Palin recently sued the Bush Administration , calling it " too accepting " of USGS data linking detrimental effects on the world 's polar bears , a fifth of which are estimated to live in Palin 's home state of Alaska , to global warming .
The August 4 lawsuit says that designating polar bears as an endangered species would " have a significant adverse impact on Alaska , " saying that the move would " deter activities such as commercial fisheries , oil and gas exploration and development , transportation and tourism . "

Bill Strickland can tell you when his life began :
It was a Wednesday afternoon in September 1963 .
advertisement
advertisement
And he can tell you how it began :
It started with a lump of clay .
Strickland , then a 16 - year - old black kid , was bored by school and hemmed in by life in a decaying Pittsburgh neighborhood .
He wanted a way out , but he did n’t have a clue about how to find it – until that Wednesday afternoon , when he went wandering through the hallways of his high school .
It ’s a moment etched so clearly in his memory that , 35 years later , he can still recall the quality of the sunlight streaming in through the school windows .
That ’s the day he came face to face with hope .
Looking through an open classroom door , Strickland saw something he ’d never seen before : a rotating mound of clay being shaped into a vessel by a man absorbed in his work .
“ If ever in life there is a clairvoyant experience , I had one that day , ” says Strickland , now 51 .
“ I saw a radiant and hopeful image of how the world ought to be .
It opened up a portal for me that suggested that there might be a whole range of possibilities and experiences that I had not explored .
It was night and day – literally .
I saw a line and I thought :
This is dark , and this is light .
And I need to go where the light is . ”
So Strickland walked into the sunlit classroom , introduced himself to ceramics teacher Frank Ross , the man at the potter ’s wheel , and said , “ I ’d like to learn whatever that is . ”
With Ross as his mentor for nearly 20 years , Strickland not only found the way out – one that led to college – he also found the way in : the path that lets one person make all the difference in the world .
He mastered the art of social entrepreneurship , applying his potter ’s hands to reshape the business of social change .
As a result , the people who now work with him and come to his programs at the Manchester Craftsmen ’s Guild ( MCG ) and at the Bidwell Training Center Inc. ( BTC ) – his Pittsburgh - based organizations for urban change – will tell you that the day Bill Strickland walked into that ceramics classroom was the day that he began reinventing this country ’s approach to social entrepreneurship .

For nearly three decades , Strickland has worked at his craft back in the same Pittsburgh neighborhood he grew up in – creating a model for turning people with dead - end lives into productive workers .
And it ’s working .
In the Manchester neighborhood of Pittsburgh ’s North Side , Strickland has forged a series of programs to bring new life to the community .
At one end of the lifeline is the MCG , which aims to rescue at - risk school kids by using the arts to teach them life skills .
At the other end is the BTC , an innovative partnership with local companies to train displaced adults for real work in real jobs .
Since their inception , the two programs have each grown into more than $ 3 million - a- year operations , with a combined staff of 110 people .
Strickland serves as president and CEO , the linchpin that holds all of the parts together .
And there ’s more .
Like any true entrepreneur , Strickland has filled the space between the two programs with other ventures : a jazz concert hall and an innovative Grammy Award - winning record label .
Next year , he plans to roll out the Denali Initiative – a national three - year effort funded by the Kaufmann Foundation to teach nonprofit leaders how to think like entrepreneurs .
The source of it all is Strickland ’s single flash of insight on that long - ago Wednesday afternoon .
“ You start with the perception that the world is an unlimited opportunity , ” Strickland says .
“ Then the question becomes , ‘ How are we going to rebuild the planet ? ' ”
The question may seem presumptuous , but plenty of people think that Strickland not only has the right to ask it , but that he has also discovered some of the answers .
Although he is n’t dealing in big numbers – his combined programs reach about 400 kids and 475 adults each year – Strickland is dealing in success :
For the past five years , 75 % to 80 % of the high - risk high - school kids who ’ve come to his after - school arts program have gone on to college .
At the same time , 78 % of the adults who graduate from his vocational program find jobs .
Just as impressive as the numbers are Strickland ’s supporters and believers .
There ’s George Bush , who named Strickland to a six - year term on the board of the National Endowment for the Arts .
And there ’s Hillary Rodham Clinton , who visited Strickland ’s center – and then invited Strickland to visit the White House .

There ’s the Harvard Business School – which hailed Strickland as a “ social entrepreneur . ”
And there ’s the Harvard Graduate School of Education – which invited him to share with its students his lessons on teaching .
There ’s San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown and jazz musician Herbie Hancock , who teamed up with Strickland to replicate his Pittsburgh program in San Francisco – an undertaking that Strickland hopes will be the first of 100 “ franchises ” that he plans to set up nationwide over the next 30 years .
And there ’s the MacArthur Foundation , which awarded Strickland a $ 295,000 “ genius ” grant in 1996 .
Not bad for a man who , 30 years ago , set out to learn how to throw a pot .
“ This is my clay ” Bill Strickland ’s story starts in the 1950s , when the Manchester community he grew up in was filled with neat row houses and green trees .
People in the neighborhood could find good jobs nearby in thriving small businesses and at prosperous industrial firms such as Allis - Chalmers , Steel City Electric , and Midland - Ross Corp .
The neighborhood was culturally rich , a melting pot of roughly 40,000 people .
But in the early 1960s , hard times caused many local businesses to shrink or shut down .
The character of the community began to change .
And Strickland , a teenager , felt his world narrowing .
“ I ’d watched my neighborhood go from a healthy community to a ghetto .
I needed to find a way out , ” he says .
“ But there were n’t many examples of successful people in my community who could serve as role models . ”
And then came that day in high school when Strickland discovered Frank Ross , ceramics , and the possibility that the world might have something more to offer .
advertisement
“ Mr. Ross brought a kind of gutsy quality to public education that said , ‘ Look , there ’s nothing wrong with you .
There ’s a lot wrong with the circumstances that you find yourself in . ' ”
Strickland says .
“ He said , ‘ You have the talent and the resources to take control of your life and to do something more than you ’ve done up to this point . ’
And I believed him . ”
After that first encounter , Strickland devoted his remaining two years in high school to learning everything that Ross could teach him .
When he graduated in 1965 , Strickland went on to the University of Pittsburgh , entering on probation because he ’d neglected his high school academics in favor of ceramics .
But he quickly proved himself , landing on the dean ’s list by the end of his first year – and winding up on the university ’s board of trustees 32 years later .
Even as his world expanded during college , Strickland remained bound to the old neighborhood .
Then , in 1968 , when the social upheaval and rioting that were rocking the nation reached Manchester , Strickland decided it was time for him to do something to bring hope back to the streets .
While still in college , he opened the Manchester Craftsmen ’s Guild , an after - school program to teach neighborhood children the same pottery skills that had originally motivated him .
A local Episcopalian church donated space for the program in the basement of a row house .
After college , Strickland continued his work with MCG , building a staff of volunteers , and earning a name for himself as a local activist .
He ran the program on an annual budget of less than $ 50,000 , cobbling together funds from small grants , and from contributions by community leaders who had begun to support his work .
Three years later , a second piece of Strickland ’s program fell into place :
He was asked to take over the Bidwell Training Center , a three - year - old neighborhood vocational - training program .
Like MCG , BTC had been started in response to the 1968 riots .
But the Presbyterian church that had administered the program had run afoul of the Internal Revenue Service for failing to pay withholding taxes .
The options :
Shut down the program – or find somebody to take it over and rebuild it .
Strickland was the ideal candidate – and he accepted the challenge .
The way he saw it , BTC offered him an opportunity to play out his ideas on a larger stage .
On the surface , however , it was an unlikely marriage of programs : arts and kids on the one hand , vocational training and adults on the other .
But to Strickland , combining the programs meant he could approach community rebuilding from two directions : by saving troubled kids and getting them on to college ; and by reclaiming adults who ’d been discarded and giving them the opportunity to make a second start in life .

For the next decade , Strickland worked at both programs , quietly forming his own vision of social change , and attracting people to his cause .
By 1983 , Strickland was ready to take a new leap , ratcheting up both programs to have more impact and more presence .
The move was equal parts vision and audacity : With $ 112 in the bank , he launched a fund - raising drive to construct an $ 8 million building on the site of an abandoned industrial park .
What might have been a futile gesture turned into a natural expansion .
For years , Strickland had nurtured relationships with business and community leaders ; now that work paid off .
In three years , he raised enough money from foundations , corporations , and government sources to build a showplace , a center for social innovation that would allow him to demonstrate exactly how his ideas worked – and what they could do .
Designed by a pupil of Frank Lloyd Wright , the 62,000 - square - foot , honey - colored brick building houses Strickland ’s vision of a thriving community - learning center .
Each day , struggling high schoolers and adult vocational students enter a stunning building of arches and circles designed to allow the sun to pour through – the way Strickland remembers the light in Ross ’s ceramics studio .
“ The worst thing about being poor is what it does to your spirit , ” says Strickland , “ not just your wallet .
I wanted to build something that would give the people who come here a vision of what life could be , to create an environment that says that life is good . ”
Strickland ’s done that – and more .
He ’s brought all of his talents as an artist to bear to create a template for social change .
“ The planet ’s changing , ” says Strickland .
“ The whole culture , the language , the relationships – it ’s all new .
The millennium is defining a different kind of artist , a different kind of entrepreneur , a different kind of leader than we ’ve known before .
This is my clay . ”
“ Entrepreneurs and artists are interchangeable ” It ’s a typical classroom : Computers are lined along one wall , a few dozen institutional chairs with attached desktops are gathered in the center of the room .
A bunch of ninth - grade students crack jokes or ask questions as they consider a fable about a cat and a fox .
But there is something just a bit , well , odd in this learning situation .
First , there are the questions :
One teenage boy asks , “ Are we allowed to sew today ? ”
And there are the materials : strips of papier - mache , bits of fabric , and pieces of string scattered everywhere .
advertisement
The subject is a fable .
But the teaching method is pure Manchester Craftsmen ’s Guild .
These students – most of them considered “ at risk ” by the public school that has sent them here – are making puppets of the two lead characters in the fable .
They ’ve made papier - mache heads and bodies , and now they ’re sewing small costumes by hand .
Their work is the hands - on , creative phase of a lesson that began one month earlier .
The Puppet Project , as it ’s called , started with a discussion of folktales , focusing on the way that stories can teach morals .
The students watched a video of Pinocchio and discussed the story ’s lessons .
Next they wrote a folktale of their own , with a clearly defined moral .
Then they studied the fable of the cat and the fox .
And now they ’re learning to approach the fable as an artistic endeavor – a hands - on , problem - solving exercise of constructing puppets that they will then use to stage the fable as a play .
This is Bill Strickland ’s take on the art of learning .
It ’s got little to do with tradition , plenty to do with education , and everything to do with art .
For three hours a day , these students come from nearby David B. Oliver High School – Strickland ’s alma mater – to study at MCG .
The medium is art – the teaching staff uses photography , ceramics , painting , and drawing to convey academic subjects .
The message is life .
This part of Strickland ’s program , called the Arts Collaborative , costs $ 500,000 a year , an operating budget that is funded by local foundations .
Like MCG ’s after - school arts program , it builds on mentoring relationships that create educational learning and individual self - knowledge .
Unlike that project , which runs as a voluntary arts - education drop - in center , attendance at the Arts Collaborative initiative counts for part of an accredited school day for participating kids from Oliver High School .
So far , it ’s working – and working more effectively than Oliver High School .
The numbers tell the story : According to an independent consultant ’s analysis of the program ’s first two years , students in the Arts Collaborative missed far fewer days of class than did their peers at Oliver High School .
And their grade - point averages were better – by a half - point for ninth graders and three - quarters of a point for tenth graders .
The use of art to change students ’ attitudes is at the heart of Strickland ’s vision of education .
The goal is not to produce artists .
It ’s to find an individually tailored approach to learning that will redirect troubled young people , and get them into college and on to productive lives .
But Strickland does see a connection between the creativity instilled by a love of the arts , and the skills needed for business success in the new economy .

“ Artists are by nature entrepreneurs , they ’re just not called that , ” Strickland says .
“ They have the ability to visualize something that does n’t exist , to look at a canvas and see a painting .
Entrepreneurs do that .
That ’s what makes them different from businesspeople .
Businesspeople are essentially administrators .
Entrepreneurs are by definition visionaries .
Entrepreneurs and artists are interchangeable in many ways .
The hip companies know that . ”
“ There has got to be a deal here ”
It ’s 4:15 on a foggy , drizzly April afternoon , and inside one of the amphitheater - style classrooms at the Harvard Business School , the subject is Bill Strickland .
There are 145 students in the room – leaders of nonprofit organizations from across America and Europe .
They ’re here as part of an Executive Education seminar hosted by the school ’s Initiative for Social Enterprise .
Most of the people in this room have just had their first exposure to Strickland :
They have finished reading a 22 - page case study ; set in 1993 , the case lays out the situation that Strickland and his twin programs faced at that time .
Under the gentle prodding of visiting professor John Vogel , the nonprofit leaders voice their opinions of Strickland and his work : “ It ’s one of the most moving case studies I ’ve ever read , ” offers one .
“ He consistently challenged the community to help itself , ” says another .
“ It ’s a customer - focused organization , ” comments a third .
But they remain divided on the big question raised in the case study :
Where should Strickland focus his next efforts ?
Should he concentrate on fund - raising for BTC , which at the time had a dicey record of getting money from the state government ?
Should he expand his operation into a real - estate development project ?
Should his for - profit food - services company – a spin - off of BTC ’s culinary training program – make a bid to manage the employee cafeteria at the newly expanded Pittsburgh International Airport ?
Or should he try to franchise his programs in other cities ?
The choices that Strickland faced back in 1993 prompt a heated debate among the students .
Everyone has an opinion about which strategic move Strickland should make , but no clear consensus emerges in the room .
One thing is clear : Nobody – absolutely nobody – thinks that it makes sense for Strickland to pursue all four options simultaneously .
advertisement
When the debate ends , Strickland stands up .
In his usual , understated way , he announces , “ I ’ve got some pictures to show you of what I do for a living . ”
And then he proceeds to blow everyone in the room away :
As Strickland runs through his slide show , it becomes clear that what he did back in 1993 was , in fact , to pursue all four of the case - study options .
Simultaneously .
Yes , he concentrated on fund - raising : Through relationships built with Pennsylvania statehouse politicians , Strickland secured a permanent place for BTC as a line item in the state budget , guaranteeing funds of $ 3.5 million a year .
Yes , he pursued the real - estate development option :
He just broke ground on a new project – a 60,000 - square - foot office building that will sit across from the existing facility .
Part of the space will be used to accommodate expanded training programs for BTC .
But the new building will also turn Strickland into a commercial landlord : UPMC Health Systems at the University of Pittsburgh has committed to leasing 30,000 square feet of office space .
As for the bid on the employee cafeteria at the airport , yes , his food - services company made a bid and got the contract .
No , it did n’t work out .
But he ’s continued to build the food services company – which has revenues of about $ 1.5 million – and this year expects it to show its first profit .
What ’s more , Strickland is now aiming for a food - services contract with Pennsylvania ’s turnpike authority , a deal worth roughly $ 250 million a year .
And franchising ?
Yes , that ’s going forward as well .
In fact , Strickland reports , he has just teamed up with San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown and musician Herbie Hancock to build a project in a poor neighborhood on the shores of the San Francisco Bay .
If all goes according to plan , the San Francisco program will be up and running in three years .
Strickland winds up his comments by turning the spotlight back onto his peers in the room .
“ If this country has a future , ” he says , “ it ’s because of you guys .
Because of your ability to form visions and to form partnerships .
I believe that we can change the United States of America in my lifetime , and I ’m not out of my mind .
We ’ve got to change the way this country sees itself . ”

The crowd goes wild .
Strickland gets a standing ovation and is soon surrounded by people who want to exchange business cards , learn more , come to visit , change the world .
They are believers .
Later , Strickland turns the tables , and offers his views on the challenges facing nonprofits .
“ Nonprofits have to recognize that they ’re businesses , not just causes , ” he says .
“ There ’s a way to combine the very best of the not - for - profit , philanthropic world with the very best of the for - profit , enterprising world .
This hybrid is the wave of the future for both profit and nonprofit companies . ”
It ’s a message that Strickland repeats over and over again on his travels , which keep him on the road as many as 12 days a month .
It ’s a message that is winning over the toughest , most bottom - line - oriented businesspeople , people who are interested in concrete results , not wishful thinking .
Strickland won over Peter Benzing , 69 , a decade ago .
Benzing had retired as a vice president at Bayer Corp. – the U.S. subsidiary , headquartered in Pittsburgh , of the giant German chemical - pharmaceutical conglomerate – but he had stayed active with the company .
When he met Strickland , Benzing ’s biggest concern was the need for an educated local workforce that could meet Bayer ’s needs .
Benzing recalls his meeting with Strickland .
Thirty minutes into the session , Benzing asked whether Strickland could train chemical technicians .
“ Bill said , ‘ I do n’t have the slightest idea about how to train somebody for that , but if you ’d be willing to help , maybe we could do that at Bidwell too , ' ” Benzing says .
It was a classic Strickland response , going straight to the core of his market - oriented operating philosophy : I ’ve got poor people who want to learn how to work .
You ca n’t find people who ’ve been trained to do the jobs you ’ve got .
Let ’s do it together .
Benzing was so impressed that he immediately went back to Bayer , got the company to contact other chemical companies nearby , and wound up with a business consortium that partnered with Strickland to create a one - year - long curriculum to train chemical lab technicians .
It ’s a tough program – many students drop out because of the demanding work .
But in 12 months , it turns out trained workers who can compete with college graduates for jobs .
More than 100 students have finished BTC ’s program ; of those , 81 % have found jobs in a field where the annual minimum starting salary is between $ 20,000 and $ 25,000 .

Companies have found there ’s another reason why it ’s good business to do business with Strickland :
It makes them look good .
Case in point : the creation of a Grammy Award - winning jazz record label , another Strickland innovation that happened almost by accident .
When Strickland brought MCG and BTC under one roof in 1986 , he made sure that the blueprint included a 350 - seat jazz concert hall .
His rationale ?
He loves jazz .
But Strickland knew nothing about booking concerts , so he hired someone who did : jazz musician and promoter Marty Ashby , 37 .
Under Ashby ’s direction , MCG quickly gained a reputation as a great venue for live music .
Although the musicians were just coming to play another gig , they inevitably left impressed by Strickland ’s community .
“ He ’s like a Dr. King , ” says singer Joe Williams , 79 , whose award - winning career has spanned more than 50 years , and who has performed at MCG three times .
“ I ’ve watched Bill ’s project grow to become an integral part of the community .
And when I say community , I mean the community of the United States . ”
Strickland ’s team made sure that each live concert was recorded on state - of - the - art equipment , videotaped , and archived .
But it was n’t until 1994 , when Strickland and Ashby were at Bayer for discussions about BTC ’s training program , that the idea of a record label began to take shape .
While touring the company , Strickland asked about one machine in the plant , and was told that it was for making compact discs .
Bayer , it turned out , is a leading producer of polycarbonate , the plastic from which CDs are made .
“ Bill said , ‘ You ’ve got the CDs .
We ’ve got the music .
There has got to be a deal here , ' ” recalls Ashby .
Bayer liked the idea so much that it helped broker an extraordinary relationship .
Using Bayer ’s contacts with Sony , Benzing helped put together a classic Strickland - style hybrid , combining the for - profit and nonprofit worlds .
What ultimately emerged was a five - record deal , with taped live performances provided by MCG ; plastic provided by Bayer ; pressing done by Sony Disc Manufacturing ; and jewel boxes , liner - note production , and printing donated by three other companies .
Under the deal , proceeds from the sale of the first 25,000 units of each record go directly to MCG .
It was an inspired move .
In 1997 , the first record of the deal – the Count Basie Orchestra with the New York Voices – won a Grammy for best performance by a large jazz ensemble .
A second release , by Paquito D’Rivera and the United Nations Orchestra , is in the stores and selling briskly , and a third , by Brazilian artist Ivan Lins , has just been released .

As for Bayer and Sony , explains Benzing , the corporations benefit by having their names attached to a socially responsible project .
“ It ’s a big deal when a large company works with an inner-city organization , ” he says .
“ It ’s good news , and it fits into Bayer ’s philosophy of working with the communities in which we ’re located . ”
“ Welcome to the conversation ” There ’s one other thing about the break - the - mold way that Bill Strickland does business :
It ’s about the payoff .
No , Strickland is n’t in this for the money .
But he ’s also not into being a starving artist .
Strickland is looking for something in - between , like his hybrid model of social entrepreneurship .
In fact , he ’s striving for the one thing that he thinks is missing in the world today : balance .
A balance of resources , equity , and opportunity – a socially responsible mind - set that asks the haves in this country , How much is enough ?
For Strickland , $ 125,000 a year is enough – that ’s his combined salary for running MCG and BTC .
A house in the neighborhood he grew up in , a 1998 Volvo station wagon , a savings account to pay for his daughter ’s college education , and a closet full of impeccable suits and pressed shirts – for Strickland , these things are enough .
“ I do n’t need the money , ” he says .
“ It ’s not my thing .
Do n’t get me wrong – I do like money .
But I do n’t know that it ’s ecologically appropriate to hoard millions and millions of dollars .
We do n’t need to have so much wealth concentrated in so few hands .
Our culture needs to recognize that having $ 20 million in the bank is not an absolute requirement for being happy .
We have got to be more attuned to the idea that the life experience has its own value . ”
Strickland speaks with a moral authority that rings true with one particularly unlikely group : young business - school students .
After having spent tens of thousands of dollars on a postgraduate education that presumably has them primed for a high - paying job in a high - flying company , business - school grads are probably the least likely group of people to find the nonprofit world attractive .
But they are , in fact , drawn to it – or at least to Strickland ’s version of it .
And that fact alone may be one of the most important indicators that Strickland ’s hybrid approach to business and philanthropy has a future beyond Pittsburgh .
At business schools across the country , Strickland finds that each time he lectures , more students are ready to enlist in the cause .

“ At the end of the lecture , students are lined up wanting to work for me , ” Strickland says .
“ It ’s startling .
I have students coming up with tears in their eyes , saying , ‘ You are doing what I want to do with my life . ’
I say , ‘ I thought you were in business school because you wanted to run Xerox . ’
And they say , ‘ We ’re here because we wanted to find an opportunity where life could make some sense .
You make sense . ’
Then I tell them , ‘ We ’re going to take all this genius , all your enthusiasm , and see the world as a set of possibilities .
This is a new game , and I ’m one of the guys who ’s right in the middle of it .
Welcome to the conversation . ' ”
