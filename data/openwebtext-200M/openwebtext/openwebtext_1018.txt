What happens when a persistent world does n't stick around quite as long as planned ?
Players and game - makers throw an end - of - the - world party .
On July 31 , Sony Online Entertainment will pull the plug on The Matrix Online .
Until then , any former player with an account in good standing will be able to log in and play for free .
In what is now becoming a tradition for failing MMOs , the game 's administrators are already amping up the number of enemies in the game .
Massively 's Colin Brennan reports sightings of " ashes falling from the sky " as well as waves of " zombies , agents , angels and demons " descending upon the game 's virtual populace to wreak havoc .
The Matrix Online launched in 2005 , several years after the series ' two disappointing sequels bowed .
It was slowed down by problems with publishers : Sega had it first , and Ubisoft almost took it but backed away , handing the reins over to SOE .
It did n't review well : Wired.com 's Lore Sjöberg called it " unpleasant " , for one .
It never came close to capturing the MMO mind - share monopolized by World of Warcraft .

A revolution that will see solid state drives ( SSDs ) sweep away a large percentage of conventional hard drives in servers and enterprise storage devices is about to begin .
Solid state drives are poised to sweep away a large percentage of conventional hard drives in servers and enterprise storage devices .
The onslaught of solid state drives in the consumer gadget market place has already become unstoppable , with manufacturers ditching spinning hard disks in everything from iPods to removable storage media to netbooks as fast as they can .
What happens in the consumer market usually makes it to business devices a year or so later , which puts the server market directly in the firing line .
The reason SSDs will begin to take over is that they offer some outstanding benefits to server administrators .
Many of these stem from the fact that an SSD has no moving parts , unlike a conventional hard drive , which has rapidly spinning platters and complex moving read / write heads .
Because it is solid state , an SSD is not prone to mechanical failure and is thus more reliable and able to withstand extreme shocks , vibrations and wide variations in temperature .
This also means it uses far less power ( perhaps 0.05 W when idle and 2.4W when in use compared to 4.5W when idle and 6 W when in use for a conventional hard drive , ) and generates much less heat that then has to be dissipated .
But perhaps the biggest benefit of an SSD is the very rapid random read access speed it can offer .
Accessing a given piece of data on a spinning hard disk involves moving a read head to a particular location and waiting for the right part of the disk to spin under the read head .
These mechanical maneuvers take time , and the exact amount of time depends on the relative locations of the read heads and the data on the disk when a read request comes in .
Typical read access times are of the order of 5 - 10 ms .
By contrast , an SSD can access any given piece of data very rapidly , no matter where it is stored .
Access times are constant ( even when the disk has been idle for some time , as there is no " spin - up " time ) and are of the order of 0.075 ms  some 100 times faster than a hard drive .
And fragmentation has no effect because access time is independent of the physical location of data .
As an indication of the performance increase you might expect by replacing a hard drive with an SSD , a quick test using a $ 99 32 GB Crucial Internal 2.5 " Solid State Drive reduced the time required to boot Ubuntu 8.04 to 18 seconds on a test system , compared to the 32 seconds required to boot the operating system using a fast SATA II hard drive on the same system .
( This is not intended to be a rigorous test but goes some way to illustrating the significant improvements in read times that an SSD can offer . )
The high read speeds that SSDs offer make them very attractive for use with certain applications such as web servers and some databases where high performance is key and I/O is a bottleneck .
The drawback is their price : an OCZ Vertex 250 Gb SSD will set you back around $ 750 , about 10 times the price of a conventional Seagate Barracuda drive with the same capacity .
But as prices fall ( which they are currently doing at a rate of about 60 % per year ) it will make financial sense to use SSDs in an increasingly large number of servers running speed - critical applications .
And if prices continue to fall at the current rate then it has been predicted , SSDs will start to make high performance Fibre Channel ( FC ) drives in storage arrays obsolete within three years .
While SSDs offer superior access times to conventional drives , when it comes to writing data it 's a whole different story .
Writing is a slower process on an SSD than a hard drive , and thanks to a phenomenon known as " write amplification " this is exacerbated .
Essentially , an SSD writes a whole block of data at once , so to write 4 kb of data it may be necessary to read an entire block of 256 kb or more of data from the SSD into memory , add the new 4 kb to the existing data , and then rewrite the 256 kb block back to the SSD .
Advances in SSD technology are making write amplification and write speeds in general less of a problem than has been the case , but writing to an SSD is currently significantly slower than writing to a hard drive .
There 's one more very big potential problem with SSDs , and that is to do with the limited amount of times individual memory cells can be written to .
Depending on the quality of the memory cells , this may be as little as 10,000 writes , or as many as 1 million or more .
To an extent this problem is mitigated by a technique called wear leveling , which ensures that all parts of the SSD are used equally frequently , rather than burning out parts of it from over - use while other parts are never used .
Typically an SSD will have a wear leveling efficiency of about 3 percent  meaning that there is a 3 percent differential between the most and least used blocks .
Still , that begs a very difficult question :
How long will an SSD last before it is worn out and unusable ?
The answer to this depends on how it is used , which in turn depends on the types of applications or data that it stores .
Because of wear leveling , the size of an SSD also has a part to play in dictating how long it lasts .
That 's because for a given amount of data stored and usage pattern , the bigger the SSD the longer it will take before all the individual memory cells are worn out  simply because there are more of them to wear out .
So while it 's not possible to say in precise terms how long an SSD will last , it 's likely that for read - intensive applications , an SSD of appropriate capacity will not wear out for many years  almost certainly longer than a conventional hard drive that would prudently need to be replaced after just two to three years .
( As an aside , many people recommend avoiding journaling file system such as Ext3 with SSDs , on the grounds that the extra write activity caused by the journaling could wear out the memory excessively quickly .
But some recent quantitative research suggests that the impact of a journaling file system on SSD longevity is actually quite small :
In most cases it results in no more than an additional 4 percent to 12 percent of data being written to the drive . )
How practical is it to install an SSD in place of a conventional spinning hard drive ?
All popular SSDs come with a SATA interface and power connector , so in terms of connection it 's simply a matter of unplugging and removing an existing SATA drive and replacing it with the SSD .
Most SSDs have a 2.5 " form factor rather than the 3.5 " form factor found in conventional drives , so you 'll probably need an adapter kit to mount an SSD in a 3.5 " drive bay .
These can be picked up for about $ 5 .
SSD prices are dropping rapidly , so by holding off purchasing you will undoubtedly save yourself some money .
But for sever applications that are read - intensive , where hard disk I/O is the bottleneck , and where high - performance is key , moving to SSD storage today could give you a significant performance boost right now at a reasonable cost , without any significant change to the rest of your infrastructure .
And as prices continue to drop , they 'll be an increasing number of servers for which the speed and power advantages of an SSD make them preferable to old - fashioned spinning magnetic media .

This report uses the Health Insurance Policy Simulation Model ( HIPSM ) to quantify the intermediate and longer - term implications if Americas health care system is not significantly overhauled .
Under a range of economic scenarios , the analysis shows an increasing strain on business owners and their employees over the next decade if reform is not enacted .
There would be a dramatic decline in the number of people insured through employers , and millions more could become uninsured .
There would be large growth in Medicaid / CHIP enrollment and spending , and increased spending on uncompensated health care .
Middle - income working families would be the most affected .

OTTAWA – The federal government hopes to open formal negotiations within months toward a free - trade deal with the European Union .
International Trade Minister Stockwell Day announced the news Thursday as both sides published a list of 15 discussion topics to guide negotiations .
The federal cabinet will now prepare instructions for Canadian negotiators to take into their meetings with European counterparts .
The topics include broad themes such as customs procedures , sanitary issues , barriers to trade , government procurement , intellectual property , and sustainable development .
" This agreement puts us in a position to launch comprehensive negotiations as early as possible , " Day said in a press release .
" As our second - largest trading partner , the Canada - EU relationship holds great potential .
During times of economic uncertainty , it is even more important for Canadians to seek out new trade and investment opportunities abroad . "
The announcement comes almost five months after a Canada - EU Quebec City summit in which the sides agreed to prepare a range of discussion topics .
Canada and the EU had $ 109.4 billion in two - way trade in 2007 .
Canada has a trade deficit with Europe – $ 36.1 billion in merchandise exports and $ 54 billion in imports – and a trade deal would likely increase that gap .
Ottawa projects that a trade deal with Europe would see Canada 's economy grow by $ 12 billion .
Canadian imports from the EU are projected to go up 24.3 per cent – or about $ 27.5 billion – while exports would be expected to increase by 20.6 per cent , or $ 13.9 billion .
By way of comparison , Canada 's trade with Europe represents less than a quarter of its total trade with the United States , and is roughly triple its trade with China .
Last week , I participated in a screenwriting panel with many estimable writers at which the topic of idiotic studio notes came up .
Robin Swicord said something that reframed the issue in a very helpful way :
You have to remember that as the screenwriter , you ’re the only person in the room who has actually seen the movie .
You ’ve seen the locations in your head .
You ’ve heard the music .
So everyone else is trying to catch up with you , and you need to help them .
I ’m paraphrasing a bit — none of this was recorded .
But it ’s such a smart observation that I did n’t want it to slip by undocumented .
Most of my job as a screenwriter is helping other people see the movie in my head .
Obviously , the screenplay is a lot of that , but all the conversations that go along with it are often just as important .
An Interview With Atul Gawande
Atul Gawande 's New Yorker article comparing the medical systems of El Paso and McAllen , Tex. , has been a definitional piece in the health reform conversation .
President Obama has repeatedly invoked it .
Senators have talked about it .
The media have embraced it .
I spoke to Gawande this afternoon about the fallout from his article , the problem of revenue - driven medicine , and whether a public plan would make a difference .
He called from Jordan , where he 's helping the World Health Organization implement better surgical protocols to reduce post - operation deaths .
That made me feel very lazy in comparison .
A lightly edited transcript of our discussion follows .
You 've gotten some pushback on your article about McAllen , Texas .
Today , in fact , some doctors from the area held a press conference rebutting your claims , and you published a blog post re-rebutting theirs .
What have you found to be the most convincing counterarguments against your piece ?
The three lines of criticism were ones I anticipated or even talked about .
The idea that these people in McAllen are unhealthier .
The idea that it 's all malpractice .
The one point I did n't get into was the snowbirds [ retirees from colder areas who winter in Texas ] , but they 're not in the spending calculations anyway because Medicare counts them in their home area .
The criticisms I 'd been hearing and seeing but that had n't been going away was pointing out that McAllen is the poorest county in the country .
They 'd say you could n't compare it to Mayo .
But I did n't .
El Paso , which I did compare it to , was the sixth poorest in the United States .
They 're very closely similar in poverty , in immigration , in physician supply , in rates of disease , and so forth .
That brings up another point .
Putting aside the difference between El Paso and McAllen , both are going to have higher costs because their people are poorer .
This gets to the whole question of social determinants of health : the fact that you 're sicker if you have less income , or education .
Do we give that enough attention ?
I think the really interesting thing is that even beyond the baseline amount of poorer health associated with lower incomes , there 's this whole body of powerful literature showing that levels of inequality are even more highly correlated with poor health .
So a place like Texas has poverty , yes , but also huge inequity of income .
States with similar poverty but less inequity of income have much better health profiles .
I 've actually had this on my list to write about .
I do n't completely understand what it is about inequality that drives that .
For instance , there 's something protective about rural areas , where there 's less inequality , so if you take rural areas and urban areas with similar levels of poverty , the rural areas will be healthier .
And people say these areas are more socially cohesive and that 's what does it .
But how does that make cancer rates lower ?
One thing that really struck me about your piece was that you focused much more on the question of care providers than insurance providers .
The political conversation tends to do the opposite .
Want to talk a bit about that distinction ?
I had a hard time connecting the dots .
My vantage point on the world is the operating room where I see my patients .
And trying to think about whether a public option would change anything did n't connect .
I order more than $ 50,000 worth of health care in a day .
Would a public or private option change that ?
People say that the most expensive piece of medical equipment is the doctor 's pen .
It 's not that we make all the money .
It 's that we order all the money .
We 're hoping that Medicare versus Aetna will be more effective at making me do my operations differently ?
I do n't get that .
Neither one has been very effective thus far .
Do you think much that we 're hearing in the political conversation is responsive to the issues you pointed out ?
Part of the difficulty is that it 's very hard .
But you can learn from good hospitals .
They do peer review , for instance , and that changes what doctors do in their offices .
They blunt the financial incentives in various ways that we have n't studied at all .
It 's kind of ridiculous that there have n't been very many people putting feet on the ground and studying what the positive deviants are doing .
There are hundreds of examples out there .
They 're not just the Mayo Clinic and not just Grand Junction .
Go to Portland , Oregon ; Temple , Texas ; Pensacola , Florida .
These are places that are doing something differently .
But getting there requires a change in local medical cultures and rebuilding local medical systems .
All medicine is local just as all politics is local .
But let 's create a cadre of researchers who go into these communities and figure out what 's going on and spread the word .
The Washington debate -- there are smart reasons to think about including a public option in the mix , but we have not been thinking hard enough about how we control costs and make a better system .
I think it 's achievable in about 10 to15 years , and maybe even faster .
I can tell you three things that will transform McAllen overnight .
But CBO does n't score them .
So what are the three ?
First , they spend more than $ 3,500 per Medicare beneficiary on home visits .
El Paso is around $ 800 .
McAllen is spending more than half what many communities spend on their entire health care expenditures .
The doctors there have to disinvest from these home health agencies and come to agreement on when those visits are worth using .
At the end of life , McAllen spends $ 22 per person on hospice but more than $ 3,000 on ambulance rides .
In a place like Portland it will be more than $ 400 on hospice and around $ 500 on ambulances .
Increasing use of hospice , offering that as an option and working as a community on how to manage end of life , would be a smart move .
Work on basic cardiac prevention like getting people statin drugs .
Most studies have shown you 'll lower the cardiovascular disease rate by 25 percent and lower the number of procedures ordered .
This was done in by Kaiser of Northern California , and they became the first community I 've ever heard of where heart disease stopped being the leading cause of death .
If you took those three things and worked on them for a year , you could go from $ 15,000 per person per year to less than $ 10,000 .
You brought up medical cultures .
And those are hard to change .
It 's hard to legislate norms .
But how do they develop it ?
How does one city end up with a culture with totally different incentives than another ?
It 's not just about incentives .
The interesting thing to me is not that McAllen is different from elsewhere .
it 's that El Paso is different than McAllen .
They have the incentives to go in that direction !
My hypothesis is that communities have local anchor institutions that foster values and norms that make the medical system successful .
My sense is that in McAllen it was about a few institutions striking out in different ways that set the norm for what others did .
in the early 90s , McAllen was the same cost as El Paso .
Three years later , they jumped into the top 10 or 20 and never really left .
The first thing to really leap in price was home health care and it happened , it seems , because a few home health agencies came on the scene and began offering doctors something serious for their involvement : extra salaries as medical directors who do n't really do much .
McAllen is also on the leading edge of for - profit innovations .
They were early with a specialty hearts center , for instance , and cardiovascular operation rates began climbing .
Then you had physician - owned imaging centers and physician - owned surgery centers and everything began going up a lot .
What I 've observed -- and we really need some real data behind in it -- but in those places with organized systems of care , with lower cost and higher quality , they 've had to find some way to blunt the incentives of quantity over quality , or , more bluntly , revenues over patients ' needs .
Some of them have done it by moving doctors to salaries , like Mayo or Kaiser .
But others , like Grand Junction , do n't salary .
They have fee - for - service .
But they have medical groups that make sure that people who see more Medicaid or uninsured patients are n't penalized , and they remove a physician 's privilege to practice at the hospital if they do n't participate in a strong peer review system .
And there are , to be sure , salary hospitals where you see very poor quality of care and people leave at three .
But if you are in a fee for service system you have to have a structure around it that helps physicians resist the incentives of revenue - driven medicine .
One thing you sound like you 're saying but that is n't often said clearly is that profits matter .
Incentives matter .
Doctors are not entirely altruistic and solely concerned with patient care .
And even if the influence of these incentives is only subtle ...
It may not be conscious , but it 's not subtle !
It 's things like whether you decide to take phone calls from patients and instead bring them to your office because you 're paid for office visits but not phone calls .
When you have a referral whether you worry about losing the referral business if you do n't do what the referrer expected you to do .
Most of us really do work hard to avoid that conflict .
The vast majority of doctors really do try to take the money out of their minds .
But to provide the best possible care requires using resources in a way that keeps you viable but improves the quality of care .
An example is electronic medical records system .
They 've been proven to reduce errors and enhance communication and improve care , but they do n't pay .
You lose revenue getting that system into place .
In another system of incentives , your incentive is to figure out how to get that system going with your colleagues and make that possible .
I think I said somewhere towards the end of the piece that to reduce waste and improve quality means organizing ourselves in ways that would sacrifice revenues .
And that makes it hard .
You were around in 1994 working for Rep. Jim Cooper , and then in the White House .
Do you see any important similarities between now and then ?
Any important differences ?
The big question is what has really changed since 1992 that means anything for reform ?
Two things that matter on the political side and then a couple on the medical side .
The big things on the political side is that we 've stretched the economy and our budget much thinner with the damage from health care costs .
The sense that both people in business and citizens have is that we 're really in danger here .
That 's not something people felt as palpably in 1993 .
I think that sense of danger has concentrated attention .
On the medical side , there is a much greater sense of dissatisfaction in our work lives .
We 're working incredibly hard to make the system work for our patients .
But it does n't work very well for them or us .
Some of that is the march of science .
The increase in coordination and complexity makes it impossible to do this stuff out of your office .
We 're not in a system that 's well equipped to make this a satisfying way to spend your time .
But at the same time , we are in this moment when we 're reinventing medicine .
Because of my experience with the World Health Organization , I 'm in a lot of countries .
And they 're experiencing much the same thing .
The underlying force here is not the politics but the science .
We have 13,000 diagnoses for people .
13,000 ways the human body can fail .
We can treat a lot of it .
But it 's not like penicillin .
It 's complex stuff .
Pathology labs and dozens of medications and treatments .
Our health system was built for a 20th century science .
I can keep giving you numbers if you want .
I love numbers .
Okay .
There are also more than 6,000 drugs and 4,000 types of operations and procedures .
That 's what a hospital has to be able to manage and a doctor 's office has to manage .
Our system in my hometown struggles with how to manage that .
We 're trying to reform a system to be prepared for the 21st century of medicine and we 'll be struggling for answers for awhile .
That sounds like more than a single human can handle .
Does that mean we 're going towards more electronic medicine .
Will it be your doctor feeding your symptoms into Google ?
I think the extreme complexity of medicine has become more than an individual clinician can handle .
But not more than teams of clinicians can handle .
And part of what 's such a marvel about a place like a Mayo or places like it is that they 've been able to get teams of doctors work with nurses and nutritionists to work together .
I 'm sitting here in Jordan showing nurses and surgeons and anesthesiologists from Yemen and Pakistan how to take a 90 - second check before an operation to make sure they have the antibiotics and the blood and they 've all agreed on what the operation is .
We do n't know how to do that culturally in surgery .
We 're doing dress rehearsals on how to talk to each other .
It 's hilarious .
But when we do it , we not only lower costs , we lower the death rate 40 percent and the complication rate 30 percent .
And that 's why I think the answers will be there .

DUBLIN ( Reuters ) -
The annual crowning of a goat as king of Ireland at one of the country ’s oldest fairs is in doubt after organizers said the heir to the throne may be stopped from traveling to the festival .
Traditionally a male goat is caught in the mountains of Kerry in southern Ireland and paraded through the town of Killorglin where he reigns for the three days of Puck Fair , a centuries - old festival of drinking , music and dancing .
Locals may have to desperately trek the nearby hills after this year ’s chosen animal from the Northern Ireland town of Ballycastle could only get a four - day license for the trip south of the border .
“ It takes at least a day to bring a goat from Ballycastle to Killorglan and the goat is on the stand for three days .
It ’s not possible to do that within the four days , ” Puck Fair chairman Declan Mangan told state radio station RTE .
“ The people in Ballycastle are looking for another goat who would be able to come for an extended trip to Kerry .
In the meantime we have to look around the mountains here just incase . ”
Mangan said time is already running out for the local goat catcher to find a replacement for the fair which always falls on August 10 - 12 , despite having origins that are not totally known .
“ Our problem is if we do n’t get a goat from the north pretty quick , our goat catch Frank Joy will have to go out onto the mountains and usually he is out for two or three weeks looking for a suitable goat , ” Mangan said .
However the panic could be good news for one lucky goat .
“ If you are a goat here in the mountains of Kerry , you could well end up being the King Of Ireland for the three days of Puck , ” Mangan added .
Astronomers have discovered new tidal debris stripped away from colliding galaxies .
New debris images are of special interest since they show the full history of galaxy collisions and resultant starburst activities , which are important in ' growing ' galaxies in the early Universe .
In this study , new tidal debris were found with 8.2 - meter Subaru telescope on Mauna Kea , Hawaii , which is operated by the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan .
The international team took extremely deep exposures of archetypal colliding galaxies , including " the Antennae " galaxies in constellation Corvus ( 65 million light years away from us ) , " Arp 220 " in constellation Serpens ( 250 million light years ) and " Mrk 231 " in constellation Big Dipper ( 590 million light years ) , and 10 additional objects .
Often seen in public media and textbooks , these galaxies are well - known galaxy collisions .
The research will be being presented at the 214th annual American Astronomical Society meeting in Pasadena , California by Drs. Jin Koda at Stony Brook University , Long Island , New York ; Nick Scoville of California Institute of Technology ; Yoshiaki Taniguchi of Ehime University , Ehime , Japan ; and , the COSMOS survey team .
" We did not expect such enormous debris fields around these famous objects , " says Dr. Koda , Assistant Professor of Astronomy at Stony Brook University .
" For instance , the Antennae – the name came from its resemblance of insect ‘ antennae ’ – was discovered early in 18th century by William Herschel , and has been observed repeatedly since then . "
Colliding galaxies eventually merge , and become a single galaxy .
When the orbit and rotation synchronize , galaxies merge quickly .
New tidal tails therefore indicate the quick merging , which could be the trigger of starburst activities in Ultra Luminous Infrared Galaxy ( ULIRG ) .
Further studies and detailed comparison with theoretical model may reveal the process of galaxy formation and starbursts activities in the early Universe .
" Arp 220 is the most famous ULIRG , " says Dr. Taniguchi , who is Professor of Ehime University in Japan .
" ULIRGs are very likely the dominant mode of cosmic star formation in the early Universe , and Arp 220 is the key object to understand starburst activities in ULIRGs . "
" The new images allow us to fully chart the orbital paths of the colliding galaxies before they merge , thus turning back the clock on each merging system , " says Dr. Scoville , the Francis L. Moseley professor of astronomy at Caltech .
" This is equivalent to finally being able to trace the skid marks on the road when investigating a car wreck . "
According to Dr. Koda , the extent of the debris had not been seen in earlier imaging of these famous objects .
" Subaru ’s sensitive wide - field camera was necessary to detect and properly analyze this faint , huge , debris , " he said .
" In fact , most debris are extended a few times bigger than our own Galaxy .
We were ambitious to look for unknown debris , but even we were surprised to see the extent of debris in many already famous objects . "
Galactic collisions are one of the most critical processes in galaxy formation and evolution in the early Universe .
However , not all galactic collisions end up such large tidal debris .
‘ The orbit and rotation of colliding galaxies are the keys , " says Dr. Koda .
" Theory predicts that large debris are produced only when the orbit and galactic rotation synchronize each other .
New tidal debris are of significant importance since they put significant constrains on the orbit and history of the galactic collisions . "
How did piranhas — the legendary freshwater fish with the razor bite — get their telltale teeth ?
Researchers from Argentina , the United States and Venezuela have uncovered the jawbone of a striking transitional fossil that sheds light on this question .
Named Megapiranha paranensis , this previously unknown fossil fish bridges the evolutionary gap between flesh - eating piranhas and their plant - eating cousins .
Present - day piranhas have a single row of triangular teeth , like the blade on a saw , explained the researchers .
But their closest relatives — a group of fishes commonly known as pacus — have two rows of square teeth , presumably for crushing fruits and seeds .
" In modern piranhas the teeth are arranged in a single file , " said Wasila Dahdul , a visiting scientist at the National Evolutionary Synthesis Center in North Carolina .
" But in the relatives of piranhas — which tend to be herbivorous fishes — the teeth are in two rows , " said Dahdul .
Megapiranha shows an intermediate pattern : it 's teeth are arranged in a zig - zag row .
This suggests that the two rows in pacus were compressed to form a single row in piranhas .
" It almost looks like the teeth are migrating from the second row into the first row , " said John Lundberg , curator at the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia and a co-author of the study .
If this is so , Megapiranha may be an intermediate step in the long process that produced the piranha 's distinctive bite .
To find out where Megapiranha falls in the evolutionary tree for these fishes , Dahdul examined hundreds of specimens of modern piranhas and their relatives .
" What 's cool about this group of fish is their teeth have really distinctive features .
A single tooth can tell you a lot about what species it is and what other fishes they 're related to , " said Dahdul .
Her phylogenetic analysis confirms their hunch — Megapiranha seems to fit between piranhas and pacus in the fish family tree .
The Megapiranha fossil was originally collected in a riverside cliff in northeastern Argentina in the early 1900s , but remained unstudied until paleontologist Alberto Cione of Argentina 's La Plata Museum rediscovered the startling specimen — an upper jaw with three unusually large and pointed teeth — in the 1980s in a museum drawer .
Cione 's find suggests that Megapiranha lived between 8 - 10 million years ago in a South American river system known as the Paraná .
But you would n't want to meet one today .
If the jawbone of this fossil is any indication , Megapiranha was a big fish .
By comparing the teeth and jaw to the same bones in present - day species , the researchers estimate that Megapiranha was up to 1 meter ( 3 feet ) in length .
That 's at least four times as long as modern piranhas .
Although no one is sure what Megapiranha ate , it probably had a diverse diet , said Cione .
Other riddles remain , however .
" Piranhas have six teeth , but Megapiranha had seven , " said Dahdul .
" So what happened to the seventh tooth ? "
" One of the teeth may have been lost , " said Lundberg .
" Or two of the original seven may have fused together over evolutionary time .
It 's an unanswered question .
Maybe someday we 'll find out . "

DAMN , this one really rocks !

( Newser ) – Scientists are trying to figure out why many male baboons enter into platonic friendships with single moms , the BBC reports .
Researchers probing relationships within baboon tribes found that the friendships , which did not appear to involve sex in about half the instances , helped mother and offspring dodge the unwanted attentions of other male baboons — but offered no apparent benefits to the male baboon in the " friend zone . "
" We found direct evidence that friendships provided a social benefit to mothers and infants , " said one primatologist .
" We really do n't know what these guys got out of the friendship , other than maybe spending time with a mum and a new baby and having other females seeing this . "

At some point I realized the futility of it all and so I blew past the artificial " 100 " barrier and poll question ( Ali edged Pete Seeger , but I needed to get Catlett and Ellison in there , too . ) and added over 40 figures from the original ... bringing the final count to over 111 figures .
I 've finally completed the 18 " x 24 " poster version of the Obama " For The Ages " artwork that originally ran on the cover of The Nation magazine .
Here it is ...
Thanks so much for all of your suggestions .
The comments many of you left made me revisit those who were left out of the original artwork ... and also made me aware of many more ( Dunbar !... Frances Ellen Watkins Harper ! ) .
I 've done my best to correct some glaring omissions .... although there will obviously be many more ...
I want to reiterate that this only a small representative sample of the literally thousands who deserve to be on the podium witnessing history .
There 's nothing wrong with more debates about who should and should n't be there .
There is no mathematical scale ... just opinions and
subjective decisions .
Well - known figures ( like Ali ) stand next to equally important but lesser - known ones ( like Septima Clark ) .
... and that 's the beauty of this exercise .
I hope this artwork will foster greater curiosity about how we got to a place in our history where an African - American could raise his hand and be sworn in as the 44th President of the United States .
That amazing moment was made possible by so many who did so much .
Some spent their entire lives toiling in anonymity for a more just world .... others were the focus of an indelible moment ... all played some part in the struggle for civil rights and most played a part in leading to Barack Obama ... and it continues today with the situation in Tibet and Iran ...
Somewhere in North Korea , someone is in prison for standing up to that brutal regime .
Someone anonymous who took a courageous stand .
We celebrate those that came before and keep working for those that come after .
I also want to express my gratitude for your patience .... and I hope the artwork is worth the wait .
Details on ordering copies can be found on my website :

... feel free to help spread the word ... I really appreciate it .
... and yeah ...
I guess I probably did break my own little world record for tagging ... ha ha ...
Cheers !
Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has “ given new meaning to the phrase ‘ pay for play , ’ ” said Elliot Olshansky in the New York Daily News .
Patrizia D’Addario , a prostitute who made news last month for saying Berlusconi , 72 , paid her $ 1,400 to attend a party at his official residence , just made news again , alleging that the prime minister offered her a European Parliament seat in lieu of payment for sleeping with him .
D’Addario ’s audiotape of their rendezvous is the first “ smoking gun ” in the string of Berlusconi sex scandals , said Tobias Jones in The Irish Independent .
But while in “ any normal country ” Berlusconi would be politically “ dead and buried ” after photos surfaced of “ orgiastic parties at his Sardinian villa , ” along with credible accusations that he slept with an 18 - year - old , “ Italy is no normal country . ”
If anything , playing Casanova just adds to his popularity .
Berlusconi ’s admittedly “ irrefutable ” defense — “ I ’m no saint ” — may fly in Italy , said Britain ’s The Guardian in an editorial , but other countries — especially in Europe , where Italy is a “ major player ” — should be “ less forgiving ” of his “ rotten government . ”
The “ real scandal ” is n’t sex with call girls , but that Berlusconi — who directly or indirectly controls almost all Italian media — has “ suppressed ” the story inside Italy .
For a while I have been fascinated by the research about happiness .
Some of my favorite research is from Sonja Lyumbomirsky , psychology professor at University of California Riverside .
( She ’s great at listing really small things you can do to impact your happiness . )
And from Dan Gilbert 's Hedonic Psychology Lab at Harvard .
( I follow PhD students from that lab like other people follow favorite quarterbacks . )
But something I 've noticed in the last year is that most of our happiness is actually dependent on our self - discipline .
For example , we are happier if we exercise , but the barriers to getting to the gym are so high that it takes a lot more than missives from the Hedonic Psychology Lab to get us there .
Also , Roy Baumeister , professor of psychology at Florida State University , has studied self - esteem for decades , and finds that when it comes to success , self - discipline is much more important than self - esteem .
So I have started tracking my own self - discipline rather than my happiness .
And I think that the process is making me happier , because I am teaching myself how to bounce back quickly when my self - discipline falls apart .
Here 's what I 've learned :
Self - discipline is about small things paving the way for very big things .
My favorite piece of research from all the happiness research I 've read is that self - discipline snowballs .
That is , if you can work hard to have self - discipline in one , small area , you create self - discipline almost effortlessly in other areas .
The most famous study about this phenomena is from Baumeister , who found that students who walked with a book on their head to fix their posture ended up eating better , studying harder , and sleeping more .
Without even noticing they were making those changes .
( One of the more recent things to come from the Hedonic Psychology Lab is an iPhone application by Matthew Killingsworth that lets you add your own happiness data to the lab 's research .
Ironically , the data entry for this application requires a level of self - discipline that will surely qualify as the type that snowballs into other areas of your life and increases your level of happiness .
So maybe we should all participate . )
The key to self - discipline is finding an easy re-entry point .
I used to tell myself that if I would just get back on my daily workout schedule , the rest of my self - disciplined life would fall back into place .
This is true .
But it 's too hard .
When everything has fallen apart for me in the self - discipline arena it usually looks like this : I am eating poorly , behind in answering emails , and I 'm biting my nails .
Then I start hiding from people because I feel too discombobulated to connect .
Fixing any one of those problems is big for me .
So I go to something easier : push - ups in the morning , noon and night .
I do it on the floor — any floor — and it takes 30 seconds because I only do five so that I wo n't dread doing them .
The act of doing the push - ups is like wearing a book on my head .
It restarts my self - discipline after just a few days .
You need to give up perfectionism in order to get anywhere .
Perfection is the enemy of self - discipline .
If you are aiming for perfection , you are never going to get yourself to do what you need to do .
No one is perfect , and if you tell yourself you need to be perfect , then everything is too hard to start .
Here 's a self - discipline issue I have : I want to keep up with my reading pile and not let it get so high on the kitchen counter that it falls over .
This goal requires me to read things immediately , as they pass in front of me .
I 'm great at doing this online , but not offline .
I realized , though , that the trick is to read fast and if I can't , I throw it out .
There is no harm in doing a bad job of going through a reading pile , and there is more harm in setting the goal ” ? to keep the pile low — and not meeting it .
Self - discipline is mental , but only because it ’s about believing in yourself .
Take , for example , the person who stops going to the gym for a month .
A person who thinks of himself as someone who goes to the gym is more likely to start going again than someone who thinks of himself as a non -gym type .
And this is true in a more broad sense :
If you think of yourself as someone with high self - discipline then when you are not having self - discipline , you expect to start having it again , and you do .
Also , self - discipline is like a muscle so you need to practice to get stronger with it , and part of practicing is talking with yourself about who you are : a person who has self - control .
The moment of regaining self - discipline feels triumphant .
I have not blogged in more than a week .
For most people , it would n't matter that much .
But blogging is a job for me .
So I really need to be doing it .
Also , blogging keeps the rest of my life on track — I feel connected to a community , I think in a more critical way , and when I write a good blog post , I have self - confidence that I will do other things well , too .
So I am telling you that the moment today , when I finally sat down to write , and I could feel that I 'd start blogging again , felt so good , and so secure , that I hope it will remind you to put aside an hour today to do the thing you have wanted to do for weeks , or months , to get yourself back on track .
It wo n't just change that hour , or that day , it will change your life .
All of us are in denial .
Without it we could n't get through life .
Were we to confront the implications of mortality , were we to comprehend all we have done to the world and its people , we would n't get out of bed .
To engage comprehensively with reality is to succumb to despair .
Without denial there is no hope .
But some people make a doctrine of it .
American conservatism could be described as a movement of denialogues , people whose ideology is based on disavowing physical realities .
This applies to their views on evolution , climate change , foreign affairs and fiscal policy .
The Vietnam war would have been won , were it not for the pinko chickens at home .
Saddam Hussein was in league with al - Qaida .
Everyone has an equal chance of becoming CEO .
Universal healthcare is a communist plot .
Segregation was n't that bad .
As one of George Bush 's aides said : " We 're an empire now , and when we act , we create our own reality . "
Collective denial has consequences .
A new study by the US Centres for Disease Control ( CDC ) shows that during the latter years of the Bush presidency , America 's steady progress in reducing teenage pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases was shoved into reverse .
Between 1990 and 2004 , the birth rate among teenage girls fell sharply : by 46 % for 15 - to 17 - year - olds .
The decline was unbroken throughout these years .
( The same thing happened in the rest of the western world , though about 20 years earlier ) .
But between 2005 and 2006 , something odd happened : the teen birth rate increased by 3 % .
In 2007 it rose by another 1 % .
I think most people would agree that this is a tragedy .
According to the UN agency Unicef , women who are born poor are twice as likely to stay that way if they have children as teenagers .
They are more likely to remain unemployed , to suffer from depression and to become alcoholics or drug addicts ( all references are on my website ) .
Similarly , the incidence of gonorrhoea dropped for more than 20 years , then started to rise in 2004 .
After a long period of decline , syphilis among teenage boys began to increase in 2002 ; among girls in 2004 .
The CDC makes no attempt to explain these findings , but the report contains four possible clues .
The first is that between 1991 and 2007 , the percentage of high school students who had ever had sex declined .
So did the number of their sexual partners , and their level of sexual activity .
But from 2005 onwards there was a levelling or reversal of all these trends .
The second possible clue is that while the use of condoms among high school students rose steadily from 1991 to 2003 , it stagnated then declined between 2003 and 2007 .
Towards the end of the Bush years , schoolchildren began abandoning condoms at the same time as their sexual activity rose .
The third clue is provided by the shocking data from the Hispanic community .
Adolescent Hispanic girls have less sex than their non-Hispanic classmates ; but they have three times as many children as non-Hispanic white teenagers .
Why ?
Because they are less likely to use contraceptives , probably because of the doctrines of the Catholic church .
But perhaps the most interesting clue is this one .
The CDC has published a map of trends in the teenage birth rate .
I ran it against a political map of the Union and found this : nine of the 10 states with the highest increase in teenage births voted Republican in the 2000 and 2004 presidential elections .
( Eight of them voted for McCain in 2008 . )
Among them are the Christian conservative heartlands of Kentucky , Alabama , Mississippi , Louisiana and Oklahoma .
These are the places in which Bush 's abstinence campaigns were most enthusiastically promoted .
Bush did not invent sex education without the sex .
Clinton 's last budget set aside $ 80 m for abstinence teaching .
But by 2005 Bush had raised this to $ 170 m , and engineered a new standard of mendacity and manipulation .
A congressional report in 2004 explained that programmes receiving this money were " not allowed to teach their participants any methods to reduce the risk of pregnancy other than abstaining until marriage .
They are allowed to mention contraceptives only to describe their failure rates . "
The report found that over 80 % of the teaching materials " contain false , misleading , or distorted information about reproductive health " .
They suggested , for example , that condoms do nothing to prevent the spread of STDs , that 41 % of sexually active girls and 50 % of homosexual boys are infected by HIV , and – marvellously – that touching another person 's genitals " can result in pregnancy " .
While " abstinence - plus " campaigns ( teaching contraception while advising against sex ) are effective , a long series of scientific papers shows that abstinence - only schooling is worse than useless .
A paper published in the British Medical Journal found that abstinence programmes " were associated with an increase in the number of pregnancies among partners of young male participants " .
An article in the Journal of Adolescent Health found that although teenagers who have taken a pledge of abstinence are less likely to have sex before marriage , and then have fewer sexual partners , they have the same overall rate of infection as the kids who have n't promised anything .
This is because the pledgers are less likely to use condoms , take advice or go to the clinic when they pick something up .
Most teenagers ( 88 % ) who have taken the pledge end up breaking it .
But , like the campaigners , they are in denial : they deny that they are having sex , then deny that they have caught the pox .
A study published by the American Journal of Public Health found that 86 % of the decline in adolescent pregnancies in the US between 1991 and 2003 was caused by better use of contraceptives .
Reduced sexual activity caused the remainder , but this " ironically … appears to have preceded recent intensive efforts on the part of the US government to promote abstinence - only policies " .
Since those intensive efforts began , sexual activity has increased .
Unicef , when it compared teenage pregnancy rates in different parts of the world , found that the Netherlands had the rich world 's lowest incidence – of five births per 1,000 girls – and the US had the highest : 53 per 1,000 .
Unicef explained that the Dutch had " more open attitudes towards sex and sex education , including contraception " .
There was no " shame or embarrassment " about asking for help .
In the US , however , " contraceptive advice and services may be formally available , but in a ' closed ' atmosphere of embarrassment and secrecy " .
Barack Obama 's new budget aims to change all this , by investing in " evidence - based " education programmes .
The conservatives have gone ballistic : evidence is the enemy .
They still insist that American children should be deprived of sex education , lied to about contraception and maintained in a state of medieval ignorance .
If their own children end up with syphilis or unwanted babies , that , it seems , is a price they will pay for preserving their beliefs .
The denialogues are now loudly insisting that STDs and pregnancies have risen because Bush 's programme did n't go far enough .
The further it went , the worse these problems got .
My grandfather , Emanuel Gold , died on July 6 , 2009 at the age of 92 .
By conventional historical standards , he was not a great man .
A million people did not clamor for tickets to his funeral .
He was a very good and decent man , though .
One who cared a lot about his family and who led by example .
All of his grandchildren were asked to say a few words at his funeral .
In putting together my remarks , I realized that I had learned a number of valuable life lessons from my grandfather .
And because CNN is not releasing podcasts of the funeral , I wanted to share a few of those lessons here .
The first of those lessons was that it is important to make a good living , but not important to make a great one .
Like many people who lived through the Great ( the one in the 1920s , not the Great Recession going on right now ) , my grandfather experienced tough times .
His family struggled to make ends meet .
As a result , he was very concerned with having enough money to pay for the necessities .
Obviously , we all care about being able to deal with our true needs .
In the 1940's Abraham Maslow argued that people are first concerned with their basic bodily and security needs
For my grandfather , though , once he was sure that those basic needs would always be met , he was not concerned with accumulating stuff .
He was content to drive his cars until they started to break down ( or until a grandchild with a new driver 's license asked if he could have it ) .
His house did not have to have the latest gadget .
He did not have to dress in the latest fashions .
The Psychologist Danny Kahneman talks about the .
He argues that people set and aspirations that they seek to achieve .
They may feel unsettled when they have a goal that they have not satisfied , and that motivates them to aim to achieve the goal .
Once people achieve these goals , they are briefly satisfied , but then the motivational system will set a new goal or aspiration that goes beyond what they have achieved , and once again they will feel unsettled until they achieve this next goal .
Because aspirations are constantly being reset further away , Kahneman argues people are rarely satisfied with what they have at that moment .
My grandfather found a way to step off the hedonic treadmill .
He had what he needed , and he seemed content with that .
Perhaps more importantly , he passed that on to his grandchildren in the way that he talked to us about our careers .
Because I chose to go into academia , my grandfather was always concerned that I would have trouble making a living .
( I guess the stereotype of the starving academic was a strong one for him . )
Over the last 20 years , whenever I saw him , he would ask if I was doing ok ... financially .
When I assured him that I was doing fine , he never went further .
There was never a sense that he felt you had to be doing better than ok financially .
After that , he just wanted to know if I was happy .
The hedonic treadmill is an easy one to get on .
It is easy to begin to take your current life for granted and to seek the next level of fulfillment .
But the hedonic treadmill is not a necessary part of human experience .
At some point , it is fine to just enjoy what you have .
Trooper Placed on Leave After Pulling Over Ambulance , Fighting With EMT
An officer was placed on leave after an altercation with a paramedic .
June 16 , 2009  --
An Oklahoma state trooper who got into an an altercation with an ambulance driver that was captured in a dashboard camera video has been placed on paid administrative leave and is facing questions about whether his actions were appropriate .
During a routine police call May 24 , Trooper Daniel Martin passed an ambulance but minutes later returned to pull it over .
Martin was upset because he said paramedic Maurice White failed to yield and even made an obscene gesture .
But White had a different account of the incident .
" He was assaulting a paramedic in the act of carrying out his duty .
At this point the trooper became even more enraged , " he said .
What the Video Shows
The video shows the medic getting out of the ambulance to ask the trooper , " What 's wrong ?
What 's going on ? "
" I 'm gonna give you a ticket for failure to yield , " Martin replied .
" You do n't need to give me no hand gestures now .
I ain't gonna put up with that s-- t ; .
Do you understand me ? "
White had a patient in his ambulance at the time of the incident and tried to explain that to the officer .
" We got a patient in this , " he told the officer .
By this point the patient 's family , who were following the ambulance , had gathered and began shooting video of the incident with a cell phone .
" I 'm getting evidence , " one of the patient 's relatives said .
At one point , the video shows the officer grabbing the paramedic 's throat .
Meanwhile , the patient 's family watched what was happening and tried to get help .
The patient can be heard screaming in the background during one part of the video and the patient 's sister jumped into the ambulance to calm her down .
" Imagine a woman strapped to a gurney with an IV / EKG and you 're hearing your family members screaming outside , " White said .
" That was torture for this lady . "
The Fallout
Martin's attorney said he had every right to pull the ambulance over because it did n't have its sirens on .
" [ The exemption ] shall apply only when the driver is properly and lawfully making use of an audible signal or flashing red or blue lights , " White 's attorney , Gary James , said during a press conference Monday .
James also said the paramedic escalated the situation by challenging the trooper .
Martin ended up scuffling with White .
Only after another trooper arrived was the ambulance was allowed to continue .
The paramedic said the reason the ambulance 's sirens were n't on was because the situation was n't life threatening and therefore they were n't necessary .
White said because the patient was suffering from chest pains the loud noise would have only made the situation worse .
Authorities placed Martin on paid administration leave on June 1 pending an investigation .
After initially refusing to do so , the Oklahoma Highway Patrol released the eight - minute dashboard camera video showing the incident .
OHP Capt .
Chris
West said in a statement the highway patrol decided to release the video because it had " drawn enormous attention " and a department investigation would n't be affected .
The Associated Press contributed to this story .
Supernatural is a horror series that goes a lot deeper than your average monster - chaser story .
This past season , heroes Sam and Dean were caught in a dirty war between some nasty demons and even nastier angels .
We asked show scribe Sera Gamble about the show 's unconventional take on religion .
Advertisement
Last week season 4 of the show ended with Lucifer rising from Hell , aided in part by a group of double - crossing , unethical angels who say they want to do a " planetary enema . "
That 's right - the angels wanted Lucifer to rise because they are so bloodthirsty they 're looking for any excuse to wage a war .
So they stopped protecting the world from demons and lied to our monster - hunting brothers Sam and Dean about their intentions .
Over the past four seasons , the show has evolved from the story of two boys stalking the demon who killed their mother , to a genuinely smart and funny exploration of metaphysics .
I do n't mean to say the show has gotten boring - far from it .
Older , snarkier brother Dean 's way of talking about the ambivalence of angels is to tell his winged friend Castiel that he 's " being a dick . "
And he expresses his rage over the angel 's unthinking obedience to a God they never meet by calling them " Stepford bitches in paradise . "
Advertisement
Think of it as a heavy metal version of Judeo - Christian paradoxes that are as old as the Bible itself .
How can there be freedom in heaven when the definition of paradise is obedience to God ?
How can humans hope to change their own destinies if they are merely playthings of demonic and angelic forces stronger than they are ?
What happens to human life when angels declare that it 's time for Heaven on Earth ?
Will there be hamburgers and beer in Heaven ?
( Actually that last question has been answered with a definitive yes . )
With its dim view of angels , and hints that there may actually be no God at all , is Supernatural a show for atheists ?
We talked about this question with Supernatural writer and producer Sera Gamble , who has been with the show since the beginning and wrote recent episodes like " I Know What You Did Last Summer " ( where the brothers meet rebel angel Anna ) and " When the Levee Breaks " ( where Sam tries to detox from demon blood ) .
Gamble said the show tries to avoid sticking to one particular mythos :
I suppose the apocalypse storyline is rather Judeo - Christian , but we have been telling monster stories from all over the world for the last four seasons .
We 're clear that we 're not a religious show , and we 're not trying to tell religious stories per se .
We 're just cherry - picking the good bits of one of the most terrifying stories of all time .

I asked her whether the choice to make the angels into dicks was in the tradition of atheist - leaning novels like Philip Pullman 's His Dark Materials trilogy .
In that series , the angels are just superbeings jockeying for power in what seems to be a godless universe .
She replied :
When you think about it , scary and suspect was really the only viable way to characterize angels on a show like ours .
Whatever we do , it has to be scary , and it has to make life harder for Sam and Dean .
The only people they can really rely on is each other , or the show just is n't the show .
We 've been careful to leave room for agnosticism when we talk about God .
There 's no direct line to answers about His existence — at least not in the first four seasons .
And in my mind , there 's been lots of room for atheists to stay on board .
First of all , no one 's trying to convince anyone of anything ; we 're just here to entertain you .
Second — even some of the angels doubt God 's around , so join the club .
I think at the end of the day , we 're trying to tell a story about humanism .
We come out suspicious of organized anything .
We 're for individuals with balls and a strong moral center telling bureaucrats from heaven and hell to fuck off .
That 's where the fun is .
Advertisement
I could n't agree more .
Gamble also gave us a few hints about next season :
We just got in the room a couple weeks ago for season five , and of course all bets are off for everything I said .
Lots of possible directions now , theologically — given the finale of season four , I doubt anyone will be surprised to hear that .
Sometimes I just sit there listening to everyone debating about God and the devil and the true implications of free will as it relates to the hierarchy of angels and demons ... and I think back to season one when I was like " well , maybe the dead boy in the water , like , wants revenge on the people who drowned him ? " and I kind of can't believe how far the show has come .

Voters go against the grain on pot
Posted Thursday , June 18 , 2009 7:23 am
" The Board of Selectmen found a criminal penalty contrary to how the voters in Massachusetts felt last November , " Selectmen Chairman Donald Sommer said as he motioned to approve the article during the annual town meeting Tuesday night .
" This gives us the ability to go after the wise guy who sits down on a bench on Park Street and lights up a joint .
We can soak him with a $ 300 fine .
This is n't about the guy in his backyard .
This is like the open container law . "
Last November , some 65 percent of voters in Massachusetts decided " yes " on Question 2 , which reduced the minor marijuana possession to a fine - only offense .
The law makes possession of an ounce or less of pot a civil offense punishable by a $ 100 fine with minors required to attend a drug awareness program .
Previously , possession of similar amounts of the drug was a criminal offense with a possible fine of $ 500 and a maximum six - month jail term .
The new Massachusetts law , however , specifically allows communities to draft their own public consumption ordinances .

Town meeting member Marshall Taylor argued that any public ordinance should strive to criminalize the public consumption of marijuana .

" My understanding of the law was that it protected the guy whose kid smokes pot and leaves the roach in the car ashtray , " Taylor said .
" If he gets pulled over for a tail light being out and gets caught with the roach , he is n't going to go to jail for six months .
We need something that gets the guy who sits in the McDonald 's parking lot smoking a joint . "
He asked for clarification on whether there would be harsher penalties for subsequent offenses , using the example of a man being caught smoking a joint in the McDonald 's parking lot eight times .

" It 's $ 300 each time , " Town Counsel Edmund St. John III said .
" So if someone wants to smoke a joint in public eight times and is caught each time , the fine would total $ 2,400 -- that would be the most expensive ounce or less of pot . "
The fine increase was approved with a standing vote of 67 to 40 of the 113 meeting members in attendance .
Meeting members approved a majority of the warrant articles without discussion , including a $ 7.6 million town budget , an appropriation of $ 3.1 million for the Adams - Cheshire Regional School District and an additional appropriation of $ 548,329 for the school district in anticipation of a shortfall in state aid .

Okaz is also in a critical condition in hospital , after being injured as he tried to save his wife .
Ms Sherbini had sued her killer after he called her a “ terrorist ” because of her headscarf .
Sherbini , who was pregnant at the time , had sued and won the case .
At this point in time they had been in the courthouse to hear Axel / Alex ’s appeal .
According to CNN :
The man , identified in German media as Alex A. , 28 , was convicted of calling Sherbini , who wore a headscarf , “ terrorist , ” “ bitch ” and “ Islamist ” when she asked him him to leave a swing for her 3 - year - old son Mustafa during an August 2008 visit to a children ’s park .
Subsequently , Sherbini sued W. for his Islamophobic rant .
Christian Avenarius , the prosecutor in Dresden where the incident took place , described the killer as driven by a deep hatred of Muslims .
“ It was very clearly a xenophobic attack of a fanatical lone wolf . ”
He added that the attacker was a Russian of German descent who had immigrated to Germany in 2003 and had expressed his contempt for Muslims at the start of the trial .
The Islamophobic and racist nature of the attack is clear .
If one follows the events as reported by the media , it appears clear that this man was driven by a hate of Muslims .
He initially referred to her in Islamophobic ways and was thus sued and lost .
He then attacked her again , though the nature of the attack is unclear , which resulted in prosecutors seeking a jail term for W .
He then murdered Sherbini in the courtroom , yelling “ [ y ] ou have no right to live . ”
The Hijab Martyr
Sherbini is being hailed by many Egyptians , as well as others , as the “ Hijab Martyr ” as she lost her life because she was Muslim , a part of her identity made obvious by her hijab .
Newspapers in Egypt have expressed outrage at the case , asking how it was allowed to happen and dubbing Ms Sherbini “ the martyr of the Hijab ” .
– BBC News Anger about Sherbini ’s death smoldered online , as Twitterers and bloggers pushed the cause .
“ She is a victim of hatred and racism , ” tweeted Ghada Essawy , among many other Arab twitters and bloggers .
Essawy called Sherbini “ the martyr of the veil . ” – CNN According to numerous interviews in Egyptian local papers with el - Sherbini family , the man who stabbed al - Sherbini used to accuse her of being a “ terrorist , ” and in one incident , he tried to take off her head scarf .
Mourners at her funeral called her the “ martyr of the head scarf . ” – Huffington Post
Some have stated that claiming her to be a hijab martyr is inappropriate as W. did not state that he hated her because of her hijab or that he killed her because of it .
But what they forget is that the hijab is what made it obvious that she was Muslim .
It is the hijab which led to the initial harassment .
Had she not worn the hijab , perhaps she would not have faced Islamophobic comments .
Additionally , Sherbini died defending her right to wear the hijab without fear of harassment as a result of it .
Therefore , the term “ hijab martyr ” seems appropriate in this case .
The hijab , in this case , serves to function as the proxy for being Muslim .
It ’s about Egyptians , not Sherbini
As Maggie Michael of the Huffington Post mentions this story has received little attention in German and Western media .
However , the attention that has been given to the case has focused on the anger Egyptians in Egypt , as well as other Muslims and Arabs , have felt over the case .
BBC News entitled their piece “ Egypt mourns ‘ headscarf martyr ‘ ” .
Additionally , they describe the murderer ’s initial actions toward Sherbini as “ insulting her religion ” – an inaccurate statement , as W. insulted Sherbini herself , not her religion .
Making such a statement skews the reality of the case and paints the story as the “ Muslim angry over insult to Islam ” trope .
Stating this lie trivializes Sherbini ’s very real experience of personal hate and Islamophobia .
It diminishes W.’s hateful actions toward a Muslim woman .
It ignores the fact that it was human being who was hurt , not a religion .
CNN reported “ Egyptians angry over German court slaying “ .
The article focuses on the anger that many Egyptians are feeling as a result of the incident providing such quotes as
Many shouted hostile slogans against Germany and called for Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to take a firm stand on the incident .
Egypt ’s grand mufti , Mohammed Sayyed Tantawi , demanded the severest punishment to be issued against Alex A. Berlin witnessed angry protests on Saturday , when hundreds of Arabs and Muslims demonstrated after a funeral prayer that called her killing an outrageous racist murder against Muslims .
The Guardian entitled their piece “ Outrage over Muslim woman killed in court ” and continued to explain
Many in her homeland were outraged by the attack and saw the low - key response in Germany as an example of racism and anti-Muslim sentiment . …
“ There is no God but God and the Germans are the enemies of God , ” chanted mourners for 32 - year - old Marwa el - Sherbini in Alexandria , where her body was buried .
“ We will avenge her killing , ” her brother Tarek el - Sherbini told the Associated Press by telephone from the mosque where prayers were being recited in front of his sister ’s coffin .
“ In the west , they do n’t recognise us .
There is racism . ”
The rage that many feel over her death is not just about the loss of an innocent life .
But it also reflects an anger at the hate that many Muslims are facing around the world .
Sherbini ’s murder , and subsequent silence on the part of Germans , appears to demonstrate a disregard for the experiences and lives of Muslims .
Therefore , although many could take those statements out of context and attribute them simply to “ those angry Muslims ” , one must consider that such anger is not just about Sherbini ’s murder .
It is about the complicity of many Western nations in Islamophobic beliefs and actions , and about the frustration of Muslims regarding this lack of respect for such traumatic experiences faced by Muslims living in Muslim minority countries .
From the Huffington Post :
A German Muslim group criticized government officials and the media for not paying enough attention to the crime .
“ The incident in Dresden had anti-Islamic motives .
So far , the reactions from politicians and media have been incomprehensibly meager , ” Aiman Mazyek , the general secretary of the Central Council of Muslims , told Berlin ’s Tagesspiegel daily .
Egyptian commentators said the incident was an example of how hate crimes against Muslims are overlooked in comparison to those committed by Muslims against Westerners .
Many commentators pointed to the uproar that followed the 2004 murder of filmmaker Theo van Gogh by a Dutch - born Islamic fundamentalist angry over one of his films criticizing the treatment of Muslim women .
Also from the Huffington Post :
“ What we demand is just some attention to be given to the killing of a young innocent mother on the hands of fanatic extremist , ” he wrote in his column .
An Egyptian blogger Hicham Maged , wrote “ let us play the ‘ What If ’ game . ”
“ Just imagine if the situation was reversed and the victim was a Westerner who was stabbed anywhere in the world or _ God forbid _ in any Middle Eastern country by Muslim extremists , ” he said .
Yes , imagine .
The news would have spread like wildfire and all Muslims would be being condemned .
From the articles , one would assume that it is only Egyptians and / or other Arabs and / or Muslims who are the ones outraged by this Islamophobic murder .
And one could assume right .
No outrage has poured out from Germans .
No outrage from any other Western nations either .
It is here I will ask the same question asked of Muslims every time a Muslim some place in the world commits a crime .
Where are the moderate Germans I ask ?
Where are the moderate Westerners ?
Where is their outrage at the acts of hate by one of their own ?
Why is the burden of being outraged at the actions of “ one of our own ” only placed on Muslims ?
Why can we not expect fellow Germans as complicit in some manner as all Muslims are assumed to be complicit ?
We are thought to be one monolithic entity , barbaric to the point of being complicit in all acts of violence .
White Westerners on the other hand are viewed as diverse , understood to not condone violence , therefore not required to express their condemnation of violent acts committed in their name .
Of course they would not condone such violence , we are expected to believe .
But Muslims , and other minority groups , are not given that luxury .
We must prove that we condemn violence .
Such condemnation of violence cannot be assumed or expected of us .
We are after all barbarians , we are expected to believe .
And this leads to my next and final point .
The Lone Wolf
In one above quote W. is described as a lone wolf .
In this Racialicious post regrading the shooting at the Holocaust museum , a discussion ensued in the comments section regarding the problems with painting a white supremacist criminal as a lone , crazy killer acting on his / her own .
The fact is that such white supremacist beliefs and attitudes do not exist in a vacuum .
They do not occur in isolation .
They require nurturing and a complicit society .
W. ’s use of the terms “ terrorist ” and “ Islamist ” were not creations of his own imagination .
The association of Muslims with terrorism and Islamism was not his creation .
His hate of Muslims and derogatory views of Muslims were not his own creation , but rather a creation of the world he lives in .
His actions were not that of a lone wolf , but rather of one living in a society full of Islamophobia .
This of course does not shift the blame from him , but rather places his behavior in context and demonstrates how , when one is the powerful group in society , if not the world , then that power means a greater ability to perpetuate hateful views and to cause more damage as those words and actions become just another method of oppression .
Additionally , if one views this portrayal as the one lone criminal in contrast to the ways in which people of color , including Muslims of color , are portrayed as guilty by association , one sees the ways in which people of color are viewed as violent barbarians whereas white , non-Muslims as civilized individuals who would never condone violence .
Conclusion
Sherbini ’s tragic murder has reminded us once again of the violent nature of Islamophobia and the lack of regard for a Muslim life .
From the ways in which the media reports this tragedy , one would assume that Sherbini ’s murder has disturbed only those who share her religion .
Not many others have expressed any outrage .
Even a “ German government spokesman , Thomas Steg , said that if the attack was racist , the government ‘ naturally condemns this in the strongest terms ’ ” ( emphasis mine ) .
Although many more should be outraged , there seems to be a denial among those who have allowed for such hateful views of Muslims to perpetuate of the severity of this case .
Let ’s hope she gets justice , Insha’Allah .
So Col­on­el Gad­dafi of Libya has been dish­ing out the dip­lo­mat­ic gifts gen­er­ously to the former US admin­is­tra­tion .
Lis­ted in the pub­lic declar­a­tion are even such items as a dia­mond ring presen­ted to former Sec­ret­ary of State , Condaleeza Rice , and oth­er gifts to the value of $ 212,000 .
This seems a slightly uneven dis­tri­bu­tion of lar­gesse from the Middle East to the West .
Before 9/11 and the ensu­ing war on ter­ror , Gad­dafi was still seen by the west as the head of a “ rogue state ” .
Bombs , rather than gifts , were more likely to rain down on him .
How­ever , since 2001 he has come back into the fold and is as keen as the coali­tion of the “ will­ing ” to counter the threat from Islam­ic extrem­ist ter­ror­ists .
So now he ’s the new best­est friend of the US and UK gov­ern­ments in this unend­ing fight .
But that was kind of inev­it­able , was­ n’t it ?
As a sec­u­lar Middle East­ern dic­tat­or , Gad­dafi has tra­di­tion­ally had more to fear from Islam­ists than has the West .
Par­tic­u­larly when these same Islam­ist groups have received ongo­ing sup­port from those very gov­ern­ments that are now cosy­ing up to Gad­dafi .
Just to remind you , the reas­on I helped Dav­id Shayler in his whis­tleblow­ing on the crimes of MI5 and MI6 was because of just such a plot - the attemp­ted assas­sin­a­tion of Gad­dafi in 1996 that was fun­ded by the UK extern­al intel­li­gence gath­er­ing agency , MI6 .
In 1995 Shayler , then the head of the Liby­an sec­tion in MI5 , was offi­cially briefed by his coun­ter­part in MI6 , Dav­id Wat­son ( oth­er­wise known as PT16 / B ) , about an unfold­ing plot to kill Gad­dafi .
A Liby­an mil­it­ary intel­li­gence officer , sub­sequently code - named Tun­worth , walked in to the Brit­ish embassy in Tunis and asked to speak to the res­id­ent spook .
Tun­worth said he was the head of a “ ragtag group of Islam­ic extrem­ists ” ( who sub­sequently turned out to have links to Al Qaeda — at a time when MI5 had begun to invest­ig­ate the group ) , who wanted to effect a coup against Col­on­el Gad­dafi .
They needed fund­ing to do this , and that was where MI6 came in .
As a quid pro quo , Tun­worth prom­ised to hand over the two Lock­er­bie supsects for tri­al in Europe , which had for years been one of MI6 ’s pri­or­ity tar­gets — not to men­tion all those juicy oil con­tracts for BP et al .
Over the course of about 5 months , MI6 paid Tun­worth ’s group over $ 100,000 , thereby becom­ing con­spir­at­ors in a murder plot .
Cru­cially , MI6 did not get the pri­or writ­ten per­mis­sion of their polit­ic­al mas­ter , the For­eign Sec­ret­ary , mak­ing this action illeg­al under the terms of the 1994 Intel­li­gence Ser­vices Act .
Mani­festly , this coup attempt did not work — Gad­dafi is now a strong ally of our west­ern gov­ern­ments .
In fact , an explo­sion occurred beneath the wrong car in a caval­cade con­tain­ing Gad­dafi as he returned from the Liby­an People ’s Con­gress in Sirte .
But inno­cent people died in the explo­sion and the ensu­ing secur­ity shoot - out .
So , MI6 fun­ded an illeg­al , highly reck­less plot in a volat­ile part of world that res­ul­ted in the deaths of inno­cent people .
How more hein­ous a crime could there be ?
But to this day , des­pite a leaked MI6 doc­u­ment that proved they knew the exist­ence of the pro­posed plot , and des­pite oth­er intel­li­gence sources back­ing up Shayler­ ’s dis­clos­ures , the UK gov­ern­ment has still refused to hold an enquiry .
Quite the oppos­ite — they threw the whis­tleblower in pris­on twice and tried to pro­sec­ute the invest­ig­at­ing journ­al­ists .
Some people may call me naïve for think­ing that the intel­li­gence agen­cies should not get involved in oper­a­tions like this .
Put­ting aside the retort that the spies often con­flate the idea of the nation­al interest with their own , short - sighted career­ism , I would like to remind such cyn­ics that we are sup­posed to be liv­ing in mod­ern demo­cra­cies , where even the secret state is sup­posed to oper­ate with­in the rule of law and demo­crat­ic over­sight .
Illeg­al assas­sin­a­tion plots , the use of tor­ture , and false flag , state - sponsored ter­ror­ism should remain firmly with­in the retro , pulp - fic­tion world of James Bond .

Researchers are reporting the first use of a fundamentally new approach in the quest to snare the Holy Grail of the lighting industry : An LED ( light - emitting diode ) — those ultra-efficient , long - lived light sources — that emits pure white light .
The new approach yielded what the scientists describe as the most efficient and stable source of pure white light ever achieved .
The advance could speed the development of this next - generation technology for improved lighting of homes , offices , displays , and other applications , they say .
Soo Young Park and colleagues note that white LEDs show promise as a brighter , longer - lasting and more energy - efficient light source than conventional lighting , such as incandescent and fluorescent lights , which they may replace in the future .
But scientists have had difficulty producing white LEDs that are suitable for practical use .
Existing technologies produce tinted shades of white light , require complex components , and become unstable over time .
The researchers describe development of a new , simpler white LED that is the first to achieve stable white light emissions using a single molecule .
Their specially engineered molecule combines two light - emitting materials , one orange and one blue , which together produce white light over the entire visible range .
In laboratory studies , the scientists showed that light production from an LED using the new molecule was highly efficient and had excellent color stability and reproducibility , features that make it a practical white light source .
Sitting here with an Iranian friend who just showed this to me .

After shelving plans to detail a browser clickjacking vulnerability that is indirectly related to Adobe Systems ' products at the company 's request earlier this month , a security researcher plans to detail the flaw next month .
Jeremiah Grossman , chief technology at White Hat Security , will discuss the vulnerability at the Hack In The Box ( HITB ) conference in Kuala Lumpur , Malaysia .
" We have no ETA on Adobe fixes , but we 're hopeful that it 'll be weeks and not months .
Whether or not they ' patch , ' it will not change the content of my keynote speech , " he wrote in an e-mail .
[ Learn how to secure your systems with Roger Grimes ' Security Adviser blog and newsletter , both from InfoWorld . ]
Grossman was scheduled to detail the clickjacking flaw with Robert Hansen , CEO of SecTheory , at the Open Web Application Security Project conference in New York , but they pulled the presentation at Adobe 's request .
The hackers said no pressure was put on them , but Adobe wanted time to study and address the vulnerability before it was made public .
" This is not an evil ' the man is trying to keep us hackers down ' situation , " Hansen wrote on his blog at the time .
Clickjacking is an attack where a user clicks on a button in a browser , thinking the button will perform a specific function , such submitting a news story to Digg , but instead an attacker hijacks the button to use it for another purpose .
The vulnerability is " obviously scary enough for Adobe to call it a critical issue and ask for more time , even though they were only indirectly affected , " Grossman wrote in an e-mail .
Over the weekend , Grossman and Hansen planned to inform Adobe of their intent to proceed with the presentation and make the proof - of - concept code they developed available .
" We gave Adobe time out of courtesy because they asked and we have a good working relationship with them .
They are using the time productively , but we could not agree to another delay , " Grossman wrote .
" Our belief is clickjacking as an issue is not a problem in their software , but with browsers in general .
It would not be fair to the others that it does impact to be without the information they need . "
HITB will be held in Kuala Lumpur from Oct. 27-30 .
GitHub Rebase で 「 Rip」というプロジェクトが開始した、というニュースを見たので調べてみた。
特徴は
ディレクトリ・ファイル・github・gemなどいろんなソースからインストール可能。
必ずしもパッケージを「ビルド」する必要はなく、リポジトリから特定のバージョンを直接インストール可能
" ripenv " という、仮想環境機能がある。ライブラリの新バージョンが出たときは、まず新しい環境を作って試してみるとか
依存関係はdeps.ripというテキストファイルに、一行一ライブラリで指定する。バージョンも込みなので、RubyGemsよりきっちり管理できる(?)
ということらしい 。
状況は
まだ始まったばか り
RubyGemsを置き換える気はなく、共存すればいいと思っている
けど、便利さゆえにシェアが逆転する可能性はいずれあるかも？
というところのようだ。
まとめる と 「 今後に注目」ということで。
以下は調査ログ 。
Githubチームの新作
ディレクトリ・ファイル・github・gemなどいろんなソースからインストール可能
" ripenv " という、仮想環境機能がある。ライブラリの新バージョンが出たときは、まず新しい環境を作って試してみるとか
別にRubyGemsが嫌いなわけじゃない、むしろ大好き
Ripはライブラリの配布より使用側に重点を置いている
どのバージョンが使われるのかちゃんと分かるようにしたい
RipとRubyGemsの違い
RubyGemsはrequireをハックするが、Ripは$LOAD_PATHをハックする
RubyGemsのような 「 require ' rubygems '」が不要
RubyGemsは1つの環境に複数バージョンのライブラリをインストールするが、Ripは複数の環境を持ち、それぞれは1つのバージョンのライブラリしか持たない(?)
RubyGemsは*.gemしかインストールできないが、Ripはもっといろいろなソースに対応する(予定)
要するにゴールが違うんだ。RubyGemsと共存できればいいと思っているよ。
Ripだと、処理 系( 1.8 , 1.9 , JRuby , ..)ごとに別の環境を作ることができる。簡単でしょ。
あと今後の予定についていろいろ。svnとかhgとかもサポートするつもりだそう。
RipはRubyの次世代パッケージングシステムを作るプロジェクトで、まだ荒削りだけどいい感じだよ。
「 パッケージングシステム」っていうか、gitリポジトリからインストールとかできるから、そもそもパッケージ作る必要もないんだけど。
なんならgistからだってインストールできる。もう*.gemspecは書かなくていいってわけだ。
RipはRubyGemsのいくつかの欠点を解決すると共に、全く新しいアイデアも提供する。
ま だ" development alpha " バージョ ン
「 パッケージ」というものを、別のレイヤで抽象化する
いくつかの仮想環境を作り、それぞれ別のライブラリ群をインストールできる
Gitと同様、分散指向。 「 中央 の Ripパッケージサーバ」みたいなものは存在せず、各人が好きなところから好きなものを入れる。
だから、 「 gem install ライブラリ名 」 の代わりに、 「 rip install URI 」 のような感じになる 。
Ripはいろんな長所があるし 、Gitがこんなに速く普及したのを考えると、すぐに人気になってもおかしくないと思うね。
RipはRubyのための新しいパッケージングシステムで、パない
いろんなソースからインストールできる
仮想環境
実行時じゃなく、インストール時に依存が満たされてるかチェック
例
$ rip install git://github.com/defunkt/grit.git v1.1.1b
Pythonのvirtualenvとpipにインスパイアされた
特徴
いろんなパッケージ形式のサポート
仮想環 境( ripenv ) 。あるripenvを作るためのレシピも簡単に作成・公開できる
インストール時に、依存関係をチェック。(※実装はどうなってるんだろう？)
親切なエラーメッセージ
Rip自身 はRubyだけあれば動く
RubyGemsとの違い
パッケージを 「ビルド」しなくていい。Gitリポジトリにタグを打って「これが最新版だよ」とか。
依存関係はテキストファイルで、一行一ライブラリで指定する。
仮想環境。ライブラリのバージョンを上げるときは、既存の環境をコピーし、インストールして試してみる。うまく行ったら、古いほうの環境を消す。
Ripではあるライブラリの 「どのバージョン」が必要なのか指定するので、実行してみてからバージョン違いで動かない…みたいなことはない(?)
既存のライブラリ をRipに対応させるには、ただdeps.ripというテキストファイルを書くだけ。
中央集権的 な 「 Ripサーバ」は存在しない( 良くも悪くも… )
あるプロジェクト( ambition ) のdeps.rip
git://github.com/drnic/rubigen.git REL -1.3.0 git://github.com/seattlerb/ruby2ruby.git e3cf57559 # 1.1.8 git://github.com/seattlerb/parsetree.git 480ede9d9 # 2.1.1
ambitionをインストールすると、これら(とその依存ライブラリ)も同時にインストールされる。rip install deps.ripとかもできる。

The Fishing Dog " Dog jumps into river and catches huge live catfish several times "
Dear Cecil : Cecil , you 're my final hope
Of finding out the true Straight Dope
For I have been reading of Schroedinger 's cat
But none of my cats are at all like that .
This unusual animal ( so it is said )
Is simultaneously live and dead !
What I do n't understand is just why he
Ca n't be one or other , unquestionably .
My future now hangs in between eigenstates .
In one I 'm enlightened , the other I ain't .
If you understand , Cecil , then show me the way
And rescue my psyche from quantum decay .
But if this queer thing has perplexed even you ,
Then I will and wo n't see you in Schroedinger 's zoo .
Randy F. , Chicago
Cecil replies :
Schroedinger , Erwin !
Professor of physics !
Wrote daring equations !
Confounded his critics !
( Not bad , eh ?
Do n’t worry .
This part of the verse
Starts off pretty good , but it gets a lot worse . )
Win saw that the theory that Newton ’d invented
By Einstein ’s discov’ries had been badly dented .
What now ?
wailed his colleagues .
Said Erwin , “ Do n’t panic ,
No grease monkey I , but a quantum mechanic .
Consider electrons .
Now , these teeny articles
Are sometimes like waves , and then sometimes like particles .
If that ’s not confusing , the nuclear dance
Of electrons and suchlike is governed by chance !
No sweat , though — my theory permits us to judge
Where some of ’em is and the rest of ’em was . ”
Not everyone bought this .
It threatened to wreck
The comforting linkage of cause and effect .
E’en Einstein had doubts , and so Schroedinger tried
To tell him what quantum mechanics implied .
Said Win to Al , “ Brother , suppose we ’ve a cat ,
And inside a tube we have put that cat at —
Along with a solitaire deck and some Fritos ,
A bottle of Night Train , a couple mosquitoes
( Or something else rhyming ) and , oh , if you got ’em ,
One vial prussic acid , one decaying ottom
Or atom — whatever — but when it emits ,
A trigger device blasts the vial into bits
Which snuffs our poor kitty .
The odds of this crime
Are 50 to 50 per hour each time .
The cylinder ’s sealed .
The hour ’s passed away .
Is
Our pussy still purring — or pushing up daisies ?
Now , you ’d say the cat either lives or it do n’t
But quantum mechanics is stubborn and wo n’t .
Statistically speaking , the cat ( goes the joke ) ,
Is half a cat breathing and half a cat croaked .
To some this may seem a ridiculous split ,
But quantum mechanics must answer , ‘ Tough shit .
We may not know much , but one thing ’s fo ’ sho ’ :
There ’s things in the cosmos that we cannot know .
Shine light on electrons — you ’ll cause them to swerve .
The act of observing disturbs the observed —
Which ruins your test .
But then if there ’s no testing
To see if a particle ’s moving or resting
Why try to conjecture ?
Pure useless endeavor !
We know probability — certainty , never . ’
The effect of this notion ?
I very much fear
‘ Twill make doubtful all things that were formerly clear .
Till soon the cat doctors will say in reports ,
“ We ’ve just flipped a coin and we ’ve learned he ’s a corpse . ” ‘
So saith Herr Erwin .
Quoth Albert , “ You ’re nuts .
God does n’t play dice with the universe , putz .
I ’ll prove it ! ” he said , and the Lord knows he tried —
In vain — until fin ’ly he more or less died .
Win spoke at the funeral : “ Listen , dear friends ,
Sweet Al was my buddy .
I must make amends .
Though he doubted my theory , I ’ll say of this saint :
Ten - to - one he ’s in heaven — but five bucks says he ain’t . ”

Some of the weirdest paintings you will ever see in your lifetime :
The Nazca lines in Peru were made many centuries before the rise of the Inca empire and they are one of the most important legacies of ancient pre-Inca Peruvian culture .
Basically they are are geoglyphs and geometric line clearings in the Peruvian desert .
The German scientist Von Däniken , in his book “ The Response of the Gods ” , claims the lines were treated as signals and landing strips for alien spacecraft .
But it is Maria Reiche , a German immigrant and apprentice archaeologist , who defined them as the strange testimony and legacy of the ancient Peruvian cultures :
The Spider , Nazca Lines .
Photo taken by Maria Reiche
“ The Nazca lines in Peru are nothing less than a documented history of science and scientists of the pre-Columbian Peru .
A scientific tradition in which the ancient Peruvians developed an alphabet to record the most important astronomical events of those days .
The Nazca lines are the pages of a book written with this strange alphabet . ”
You can see figures such as big giant spiders , lizards , llamas , monkeys , dogs , hummingbirds , etc. , not to mention the zigzagging and geometric designs .
There are a lot of unanswered questions regarding the lines such as how they remain intact after hundreds of years or even why they embarked in such a big project .
The Nazca Line Drawings Discovery
In 1927 , archaeologist Mejia Xespe- disciple of Julio C. Tello , the Father of the Peruvian - Archeology was informed about the presence of some mysterious geoglyphs or lines on the ground in the Peruvian coast but at that time it wasn´t given much importance .
They were more attracted to other archaeological sites like the majestic Machu Picchu in Cuzco and the fascinating cultures of Chavin and Chan Chan among others .
The same year , 1927 , another researcher arrived to Peru , Dr. Paul Kosok , he was very attracted to these cultural pre-Columbian expressions .
In one of his first trips to the south of the country , he stopped at the top of a plateau and saw extensive lines on both sides of the road near the mountains .
After some onsite research , he was amazed to find that one of the figures had the unmistakable shape of a bird flying .
In 1946 , Kosok returned to his country but not before suggesting to Maria Reiche , who had assisted him on the investigations , to continue studying the Nazca line drawings that he had begun to decode .
María devoted her life to this work .
Maria Reiche , studied the Nazca line drawings for 50 years .
She explained how these lines were used by ancient peruvian astronomers as if they were a gigantic solar and lunar calendar , nestled in the sand , legends and myths of the locals .

Among the larger geoglyphs are a bird of nearly 300 m , a lizard of 180 m , a pelican of 135 m , a condor of 135 m , a monkey of 135 m and a spider of 42 meters .
These dimensions are cause for admiration .
Some of the animal designs that are perceived in Nazca are a whale , a dog with long legs and tail , two llamas , various birds such as herons , the crane , the pelican , the gull , the famous hummingbird and the parrot .
In the category of reptiles , there is an alligator , an iguana and a snake .
How to Get to Nazca ?
If you plan to visit the Nazca Lines , you must take a bus from Lima because there are no flights between both cities .
The distance is 475 Km and the bus will take you in approximately 5.5 to 6 hours .
You can stay in the city of Nazca or Ica and get to know beautiful places in the area like Chincha or Paracas .
How much does it cost to fly over the lines ?
The Nazca Lines in Peru are an incredible place where artists drew pictures in the sand ; pictures that they themselves couldnt appreciate , because you need to be flying to do so .
If you are up to sitting down in a little Cesna for about 40 minutes ride and look down on a spider , a monkey , a dog , an astronaut a whale among many other and witness this ancient place , it will only cost you around 45 US dollars .
Try to avoid eating before the flight otherwise you could feel sick .
While you may think it would be a good idea to walk among the lines , you should avoid doing this .
Damaging or vandalizing the lines would be considered a criminal activity .
Even if done by accident it would be best to not walk through them .

The music gang were arrested after a joint operation with the FBI
A group , including a number of DJs , have been accused of making hundreds of thousands of pounds by buying their own music online with stolen credit cards .
It 's alleged the gang put their own music on Apple iTunes and Amazon and spent about £ 459,000 buying it back - claiming nearly £ 200,000 in royalties .
Nine people were arrested in London and the Midlands after a joint operation with a new E - crime unit and the FBI .
It 's thought the music was sold between September 2008 and January 2009 .
The gang are alleged to have used 1,500 stolen credit cards .
Detective Chief Inspector Terry Wilson , from the Met 's Police Central E - Crime Unit ( PCeU ) said : " This has been a complex investigation to establish what we believe to be an international conspiracy to defraud Apple and Amazon .
" We are now making it more risky for criminals who seek to exploit the internet and commit e-crime across national borders . "
Police raided addresses in London , Birmingham , Kent and Wolverhampton following the investigation , which started in February .
The nine people arrested are being held on suspicion of conspiracy to commit fraud and money laundering .
Funny Slogans and Light - Hearted Designs for the Dead
Some of these headstones are both unique and hilarious .
From headstones that say â€ œThat 's all folks ! â€ to a Rolling Stones tombstone , these commemorating messages seem to show what the deceased person was passionate about .
You can probably come up with different stories about the deceased by checking out the headstone gallery .
From a clothes pin and a motorcycle , to a computer , there must be a tale that lies behind these stones .
Implications -
In many cultures , death is not seen as a morbid or tragic event , but rather an opportunity to celebrate the life of the deceased .
Humor is an effective means of doing so , and these humorous headstones are the perfect example of using humor to make a tragic situation easier .
While some may see these headstones as tasteless , those who use them are surely in the mindset that the deceased would have appreciated the originally comedic perspective on tragedy .
a tankie is a banana that runs around and kill donuts and throws the donuts at people and kill them .
And so it develops .
From the GATA press release :
Dear Friend of GATA and Gold :
GATA today urged the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission to investigate the Goldman Sachs Group Inc. computer trading program that , according to a federal prosecutor , the bank acknowledges can be used to manipulate markets .
GATA 's complaint referred to the Bloomberg News story dispatched to you yesterday --
http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=a_6d.tyNe1KQ)
-- reporting the arraignment in U.S. District Court in New York of a former Goldman Sachs employee accused of stealing the program .
The prosecutor , Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Facciponti , was quoted as telling the court : " The bank has raised the possibility that there is a danger that somebody who knew how to use this program could use it to manipulate markets in unfair ways . "
In letters to the SEC and CFTC , GATA wrote : " The assistant U.S. attorney 's comment can be construed to suggest Goldman Sachs considers its own manipulation of markets to be fair , while such manipulation by others would be unfair .
The court proceeding described in the Bloomberg News story would seem to impugn all markets in which Goldman Sachs trades . "
GATA asked each commission " to investigate Goldman Sachs ' trading program urgently and report its findings publicly . "
The text of GATA 's letters is appended .

Dear Chairman Gensler / Dear Chairman Schapiro :
I 'm enclosing a copy of a report distributed July 6 by Bloomberg News Service about the U.S. government 's prosecution of a former employee of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. involving the purported theft of a Goldman Sachs computer trading program .
The report quotes Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Faccipointi as saying in U.S. District Court in New York City : " The bank has raised the possibility that there is a danger that somebody who knew how to use this program could use it to manipulate markets in unfair ways . "
If the report quotes the assistant U.S. attorney correctly , and if he was characterizing Goldman Sachs ' position correctly , then Goldman Sachs claims to have possession of a computer trading program that can manipulate markets .
The assistant U.S. attorney 's comment can be construed to suggest Goldman Sachs considers its own manipulation of markets to be fair , while such manipulation by others would be unfair .
The court proceeding described in the Bloomberg News story would seem to impugn all markets in which Goldman Sachs trades .
On behalf of the Gold Anti-Trust Action Committee Inc. , I ask your commission to investigate Goldman Sachs ' trading program urgently and report its findings publicly .
Thanks for your consideration .
With good wishes .

Ca n’t Touch This
SONOMA , Calif . —
It is not the perfume that seduces , but sound .
Or so it was for me one summer morning as I toured a lavender farm in the Sonoma Valley here , Napa ’s lesser - known neighbor , which in recent years has become a haven for that herb ’s enthusiasts .
Swollen tufts of violet and green shifted in the breeze like beach balls ready to take flight .
There was a whisper of sweetness in the air , the fragrant oil from flowering stalks clinging to fingertips and pants legs at the slightest brush .
What attracted me , though  stopping me as I walked down a gravel path  was a drone that seemed to pulsate amid the quiet .
Was it traffic from a nearby road ?
An air - conditioner set on low ?
Neither .
Instead the field vibrated with the hum of thousands of bees shifting among blossoms , a waltz of elegance and economy .
A lavender field , it seems , is an intoxicating but very busy place .
Provence is well known for its purple highways .
There the French have devised herbal factories where vast acres of lavender are grown for use in essential oils , sachets , bath products , tea and honey .
But in the past decade Americans too have come to value its culinary and aromatic attributes .
As a result , lavender farms have sprung up in small towns from Texas to California to Washington State .
For those unable to wander among the sun-soaked fields of southern France , the Sonoma Valley is a civilized alternative .
Nestled between the Pacific Ocean and the more crowded Napa Valley , it retains much of the rural charm of California .
At a farmer ’s market in Santa Rosa one Wednesday night , a woman sold fresh bundled lavender for $ 1 , the fragrant bouquets stacked two feet high .
In June and July many of the area ’s small growers invite guests to browse blooming fields at their peak .
And restaurants liberally use lavender in place of rosemary or thyme in drinks and summer dishes .
The remains of the final two missing Defence personnel from the Vietnam War have been found .
Flying Officer Michael Herbert and Pilot Officer Robert Carver 's Canberra bomber went missing in November 1970 .
Greg Combet , Minister for Defence Personnel , Materiel and Science , says their remains were found in an extremely remote area of Vietnam near the Laotian border .
" An Air Force investigation team which recently deployed to Vietnam have found human remains at the site where the wreckage of a Royal Australian Air Force Canberra bomber was located in April this year , " Mr Combet said .
" The aircraft , which went missing on 3 November 1970 , was flown by Flying Officer Michael Herbert and Pilot Officer Robert Carver . "
Mr Combet says the recovery team transported the remains to Hanoi , where Vietnamese and Australian forensic specialists identified them as those of Michael Herbert , from South Australia , and Robert Carver from Queensland .
" Relatives of the two crew members have been advised of the discovery and Air Force will continue to keep them updated .
These airmen gave their lives in the service of their nation .
I hope finding the remains of the airmen will bring some comfort to the families , " Mr Combet said .
" This is an excellent result for the investigation team and the cooperation of the Vietnamese authorities has been exceptional and highly valued by the team and the Government of Australia .
" Invaluable assistance has been given by a number of former North Vietnamese and Viet Cong soldiers and their commanders as well as many local villagers .
Their compassion and commitment to assisting this vital mission is greatly appreciated . "
Mr Combet praised the work of the Defence Science and Technology Organisation in using innovative modelling techniques in order to refine the area of interest , plus the exhaustive and skilled research and expertise of the Army History Unit in supporting the investigation .
He also acknowledged the efforts and commitment to the recovery of Australian war dead shown by Jim Bourke and Operation Aussies Home .
A timetable for the return of the airmen 's remains to Australia has yet to be agreed between the Australian and Vietnamese Governments .
Mr Combet says details of the airmen 's burials are a private matter for their families .

Literature can exert a powerful influence on our ideological views . [ 1 ]
Ayn Rand , after all , was primarily a novelist .
Many people were converted to liberalism ( or at least some variety of it ) after experiencing in person her unquestionable charisma and magnetism , but the significance of her novels , most notably Atlas Shrugged , [ 2 ] can hardly be overlooked .
Indeed , it is only having read that expressive story that many future libertarians — among them Walter Block [ 3 ] — once and for all denounced socialism along with all the physical and mental bondage which it ineluctably imposes upon people .
Hence , it was a narrative — a novel or , if you want , a fairy tale — that had managed to shape and contextualize the readers ' notion of such abstract matters as freedom , l'étatism , or egalitarianism .
Another novelist who also managed to gain an exceptionally wide circle of readers and admirers was John Ronald Reuel Tolkien , the author of a worldwide bestseller The Lord of the Rings . [ 4 ]
Even though Tolkien 's style of writing was much less obtrusive than Rand's — he never forced upon his readers any particular reading of his book , and he overtly disliked conscious and intentional allegories — the English novelist never denied that his work concerns something more than just elves or dwarves , or that it deals with certain ideas .
As he wrote to Michael Straight , the editor of New Republic , The Lord of the Rings was meant to succeed first of all as an exciting and moving tale — but a tale addressed primarily to adults , involving something more than mere chase and escape , namely some reflection of the writer 's own views and values . [ 5 ]
Since Tolkien considered himself a conservative anarchist , [ 6 ] it should come as no surprise that while trying to answer his publisher 's questions regarding the symbolism hidden in his magnum opus , he suggested to " … make the Ring into an allegory of our own time … an allegory of the inevitable fate that waits for all attempts to defeat evil power by power . " [ 7 ]
Therefore , even though Tolkien 's saga is all too often interpreted as an apolitical " road novel " or " picaresque novel for children , " The Lord of the Rings could very well be the source of unending inspiration for libertarians as a belletristic dramatization of Lord Acton 's famous statement that power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely .
Both Rand and Tolkien , then , passionately tell their tales about freedom , but they resort to completely different aesthetics , and , in consequence , paint two entirely different pictures of the world , with different heroes and different challenges .
Are those differences important ?
How do they affect the " moral " of the respective tales ?
Given that it is of utmost importance just what kind of story one tells , it is perhaps worthwhile to reflect upon the different world images depicted in Atlas Shrugged and The Lord of the Rings , comparing the characters of both narratives along with the predicaments they face , and asking the fundamental question , which of the two novels constitutes a better context , a better literary frame of reference for freedom and Hans - Hermann Hoppe 's idea of natural order ? [ 8 ]
The Titans
Atlas Shrugged is , shortly put , a story of a strike , although not an ordinary one . [ 9 ]
Rand does not write about labor unions or working masses , but about titans whose irreplaceable work , like that of their Greek predecessor Atlas , keeps the world alive .
Titans are big capitalists , owners of ironworks and mines , men of genius , people who are creative and in every respect outstanding .
Such is also the main character of the novel , Dagny Taggart , the heiress to the huge railroad company Taggart Transcontinental , which she desperately strives to save against ever more impudent government attempts to lay hands on her fortune .
The society in which the heroine lives is dull , envious , lazy , essentially quite helpless , and were it not for the handful of Atlases , it would have definitely plunged into despair .
Dagny loves what she does for a living .
She is an extremely talented railroad executive , and directing the whole enterprise seems not to tire her at all .
The real burden for her is not work itself , but the necessity — the legal obligation — to share its plentiful fruits with the rest of society — the ungrateful mob of losers .
Initially , the situation , though harsh , seems bearable , mainly because the heroine carries on with all her everyday duties with the relieving thought in mind that she is not alone , that other great achievers feel and think similarly , and though they may be outnumbered , they constitute the real engine of the world .
Gradually , however , Dagny realizes that the very engine of which she considered herself a part has been abruptly turned off and the titans , one after another , seem to be disappearing .
The kidnapper turns out to be John Galt — a mysterious , legendary hero , whose name elicits expressions of helplessness among the losers :
" How should I deal with it ? " asks one frightfully mediocre worker .
" How should I know ? " is the invariable , dull reply .
" Who is John Galt ? "
Galt used to be one of the titans , but greed , collectivist bias , and ingratitude from the society to which he had given so much in the past have induced him to go on strike — not to fight with the oppressive system , not even to try to change it , but simply to leave , taking others along .
And so they go , one by one : the great composers , innovators , creators , directors , owners …
As a result , the engine of the world stops , and the economy plunges into chaos , for when there is no one to prey upon , the society of insatiable vultures no longer knows what to do .
The Übermenschen find refuge in an extraordinary valley hidden somewhere in Colorado , where the dollar sign does not stand — as on the " other side " — for greed , bribery , and sneakiness , but instead symbolizes success , skillfulness , and creative powers .
The one and only unforgivable sin there is altruism .
So they live , far from the dying world , bound by a promise that never again will they let unproductive loafers gain from their work .
They await the end of history , the moment when
the creed of self - immolation has run , for once , its undisguised course — when men find no victims ready to obstruct the path of justice and to deflect the fall of retribution on themselves , when the preachers of self - sacrifice discover that those who are willing to practice it , have nothing to sacrifice , and those who have , are not willing any longer — when men see that neither their hearts nor their muscles can save them , but the mind they damned is not there to answer their screams for help … when they have no pretense of authority left , no remnant of law , no trace of morality , no hope , no food and no way to obtain it — when they collapse and the road is clear … . [ 10 ]
Then the titans will once more lift the Earth — all the superior individuals will come back to rebuild the world .
The Hobbits
Tolkien 's novel also ends with a theme of rebuilding the world , a promise of setting things straight , bringing back the right order of things .
It begins , however , in an entirely different way : not on the platform of a huge railway station , nor in a big factory , nor in a beautiful palace .
The Lord of the Rings begins in the Shire — more precisely in Hobbiton , a small village peopled by hobbits , unobtrusive , somewhat clumsy , little creatures , whose straightforward and rather friendly nature makes them very similar to humans .
One day a great magician , Gandalf the Grey , pays a visit to the village .
He is concerned by the fact that one of the hobbits , a certain Mr. Bilbo Baggins , keeps there hidden a precious artifact — a mysterious ring .
Forged many years ago by Sauron , the Lord of Darkness , the Ring of Power is one of many rings of power , the one , however , that controls all the others .
It has apparently found its way to Hobbiton by mere chance , as Bilbo brought it with him from one his journeys , hoping to hide it there from the rest of the world , adoring its gleam and magnificence .
The ring would give Bilbo strength and vitality , unusual in his advanced age , but it would also make him dependent on the ring itself .
Before he knew it , the old hobbit became a serf of the Ring of Power , never daring to part with it , he would always keep it in a pocket of his ornamental waistcoat .
This state of affairs would have probably gone on for many long years had Gandalf not learned the mysterious history of the ring , and recognized its true dark nature .
Gandalf understood that Sauron knew very well where to look for his long lost precious treasure , and would inevitably claim it .
The ring cannot , however , go back to its creator , since it would mean the destruction of the whole Middle - earth and slavery of all peoples inhabiting it — darkness would fall over the once wonderful world , covering the horizon with a veil of smoke .
Unfortunately , that mighty source of power cannot simply be buried or hidden , since the ring itself tries to return to its master who surely will not spare strength or efforts to regain rule over the world .
Thus , the only way to save Middle - earth seems to be to destroy the damned ring .
Easy as it may seem , the task is in fact extremely difficult , for being a magic artifact , it will not yield to ordinary flames or any smith 's hammer — it can only be thrown into the fire of Mordor in the Cracks of Doom .
First , however , somebody must take it there .
This will not be easy , since the road is guarded by Sauron 's soldiers , the ugly , ruthless orcs .
It might seem that only Gandalf himself or one of the great and noble knights of Middle - earth could undertake such a dangerous quest .
Unfortunately , to the extent that the Ring of Power gives its bearer strength to rule the world , it also overcomes him .
It is an entity whose nature is to control everyone and everything .
Thus , if the ring were to be worn by Gandalf or any other of the great heroes , it would become a terrifying implement of destruction , since anyone who slips it on his finger stops being himself and becomes instead a mere servent to the ring .
Only someone so mediocre , so weak , inept , and created seemingly for the sole purpose of minding his own merry business like Frodo Baggins — Bilbo's heir — could , at least to some extent , resist the evil power .
Not clearly knowing what awaits him , Frodo sets upon his mission accompanied by a few friends from the Shire along with the distinguished knights of other races : Gimli the Dwarf ; Legolas the Elf ; two men , Aragorn and Boromir ; and wise Gandalf himself .
Many times , the long journey puts Frodo 's immunity to the test , showing that even such a moderate creature as himself cannot always resist the power of darkness .
Once the ring eventually gets thrown into the abyss of Mordor , the sun rises again over Middle - earth , everything can be started anew , and the old world order is restored — without replacing the defeated power by a new , more sinister one .
How to Fight the System
These summaries might suggest that since the story told in The Lord of the Rings takes place in a fictitious world , while Atlas Shrugged describes a real - life situation , it is Rand 's novel that does a better job of dramatizing the libertarian creed .
Nevertheless , even though Tolkien creates his own world , different from the one we see around us each day , he meant the characters , the heroes of the war for Middle - earth , to be just as real as , say , the pygmies of the African jungle . [ 11 ]
Legolas , Aragorn , and Gimli are all characters created for the purpose of storytelling , but this does not change the fact that they are exemplifications of definite truths , principles , and values — as are Rand 's characters , John Galt and Dagny Taggart .
It does not matter whether one fights to defend Hobbiton or Taggart Transcontinental .
In their most profound , most significant message , the two novels essentially talk about the same things — about challenges that a man must face , about his moral responsibility for himself and for all that he loves , and about the captivating and destructive influence of power and coercion .
Moreover , both novels clearly denounce the so - called imperative of action , that is , the belief that a system can easily be changed from within .
It is plainly described in Atlas Shrugged , where the main characters express their opposition to the wickedness of the world by simply running away from it , confirming with their deeds the famous dictum of Etienne de la Boétie : " Resolve to serve no more , and you are at once freed . " [ 12 ]
Even though in The Lord of the Rings it is an active fight and not passive resistance that forms the central theme of the novel , the fight is fought outside the system .
Gandalf and Galadriel , both of great powers , consciously reject the possibility of defeating Sauron with the ring — they know very well that it would turn them into tyrants themselves . [ 13 ]
The Lord of Darkness can only be defeated by destroying that which constitutes the very essence of his might — the Ring of Power .
Those similarities do not imply that there are no differences between Atlas Shrugged and The Lord of the Rings .
Quite to the contrary — differences exist and they are the very reason why one of the novels serves better as a contextualization of the idea of natural order .
To see this , we shall turn to the dissimilar structure of worlds and characters in both novels .
In Atlas Shrugged , for example , it is hard not to notice that somebody drives the world , maintains the reality in order , and without him everything would plunge into chaos .
Clearly , that mysterious entity is not the state apparatus — rightly described as a machinery of exploitation — but a group of exceptional individuals who have simply created civilization — radio , television , central heating , music , law and order , etc .
Luckily , the Übermenschen are benevolent and have no evil intentions vis -à - vis ordinary people .
They wish neither to exploit , rule , nor control the rest of the society , but rather to impose upon it their rational project of " enlightenment " — they want to make use of their genius and bring prosperity and comfort to all .
It is totally different in The Lord of the Rings , where there is no " great plan for the world " ; Middle - earth is inhabited by many different races — elves , dwarves , hobbits , men , ents , etc. — who all live , albeit separately , in tolerance , sometimes even friendship , but as a rule not interfering with each other .
There is no government , central or local , [ 14 ] no industrial revolution and no uniform vision of progress or future .
Even in the face of a terrible war , it is extremely hard to create a coalition against Sauron .
The world in Tolkien 's novel is simply divided , decentralized to the extreme ; beautiful in the diversity of various races , peoples , languages and outlooks — that is why no such thing as a " plan for humanity " could ever arise there as something good .
There are , however , millions of smaller plans — for living through a harsh winter , for cultivating one 's garden , for drinking a pint of beer in a local inn — drafted by millions of distinct individuals .
The only unified vision that appears in the book is Sauron 's plan ; and let us not forget that Sauron stands for " an incarnation of Evil . " [ 15 ]
It is instructive to compare also the main characters of the two novels .
In Atlas Shrugged they are exceptional and it is precisely because of that quality that they became characters of the novel .
Each of the Atlases is unblemished , pure , proud .
Every detail of their physiognomy speaks of genius and magnificence .
The Übermenschen do not simply move : they make motions full of charm and elegance .
They do not simply work : they craft , always with passion and enthusiasm .
They never get tired , weary or bored with what they do ; they have no families , no children , no obligations ; they are frightfully rational ; they live only for themselves and for their occupational passions .
If they happen to be businessmen , they never own little family businesses ; they run huge corporations , ironworks , mines , or railway companies .
In Rand 's novel there is no place for moderation and inconspicuousness .
Only that which is huge and effective deserves praise and attention .
Completely different , more human - like , are Tolkien 's characters .
In fact , the whole novel — though told from the hobbit 's perspective — has a profoundly anthropocentric dimension .
There are men in The Lord of the Rings , to be sure , but it is the hobbits who resemble real humans the most — they are rather clumsy , neither exceptionally smart , stout , nor courageous , but good , sociable , faithful and generally cheerful .
The most important characters in Tolkien 's novel are actually anti-heroes — they try to stay away from the world of big politics ; however , when fate throws them in its very middle , they act bravely and ultimately bring salvation .
What the author of The Lord of the Rings seems to be saying , then , is that it is not titans who support the earth , but hobbits ; each and every one of us , therefore , can answer the call of greatness and novelty , even should he live in Hobbiton spending most of his time cultivating his garden , smoking a pipe , and drinking beer in the local pub .
Every one of us struggles daily with the Saurons of his life , and maybe it is precisely those little triumphs that make the world a better place .
As for respect and praise , it is not the directors of big corporations who deserve it the most — since , by the very nature of things , they are much too close to the ring — but those who , using only their own modest resources , earn their living by running little shops , kiosks , and family businesses .
In those places one can sometimes still find the real , healthy spirit of capitalism .
No wonder , then , that the Eye of Mordor constantly looks in their direction .
Conclusion
Given the breadth and length of both novels , the comparison of Atlas Shrugged and The Lord of the Rings could go on much longer , revealing many new themes and interpretations .
It seems , however , that even the few differences sketched above allow for a tentative answer to the questions raised in the introduction .
As much as Ayn Rand 's novel , with its strictly modernist message , could have been at some point in the past an effective remedy against the plagues of socialism and collectivism , the world described in it does not fit today 's reality and does not help in introducing the idea of natural order .
Today , it is no longer necessary to protect big business from people .
On the contrary , it is people who need protection from big business , which now goes hand in hand with Leviathan in trying to create a homogenous and completely atomized society .
The Lord of the Rings shows not only the great danger associated with all attempts to defeat evil power by power , but it also teaches that collectives do not really exist , that every one of us is the hero of his own individual story , and that law and order can easily exist without the state .
Despite its egoistic message , Atlas Shrugged is full of imperatives to act , to fight , to bring salvation .
Rand 's characters suffer not only because the state reaches into their wallets , but because the society rejected their rational , " enlightened " vision of what is good and right .
Tolkien , on the other hand , disliked such imperatives .
He hated the outlook that if something can be done , it has to be done , and once even admitted that the greatest deeds of mind and spirit are born in abnegation . [ 16 ]
That is most likely the reason his characters do not look for great challenges , nor wish to change the world , and instead live quietly , fulfilling Voltaire 's dictum
Il faut cultiver notre jardin .
This is what makes The Lord of the Rings a much better means for conceptualizing the ideas of freedom than Atlas Shrugged .
Reading Tolkien helps realize that , even after the " end of history , " the world and society can move in the direction of Merry Old England rather than a soulless homogenized mass of atoms .
Moreover , The Lord of the Rings conveys an extremely important and optimistic message , namely that a plurality of many different cultures , languages , societies and visions , all existing together , yet separate and independent of each other , is still viable — not in a democratic regime , but in the new world of Hoppean natural order .

Researchers have identified a potential biological mechanism that could explain why oral contraceptives may be less effective at preventing pregnancy in obese women , as some epidemiological studies have indicated .
Although conventional oral contraceptives appear to eventually reach the effective blood concentrations needed in the body to prevent conception in obese women , it appears to take twice as long , leaving a " window of opportunity " every month where the contraceptive may not be at a high enough level to prevent a pregnancy .
The findings are of particular importance , researchers noted in their study , because about 30 percent of all adults in the U.S. are obese and the birth control pill is one of the most popular forms of contraception in the nation .
" We do n't have enough data yet to recommend that physicians change their clinical practise for use of oral contraceptives with patients who are very overweight , " said Ganesh Cherala , an assistant professor in the College of Pharmacy at Oregon State University .
" However , until more studies are done , women may wish to consult with their physicians about this issue and consider a backup method of contraception at some times of the month . "
The study was just published in the journal Contraception , by scientists from OSU , Oregon Health and Science University , University of Colorado at Denver , Oregon National Primate Research Center , and the University of Southern California .
The research was supported by the National Institutes of Health .
The underlying problem , Cherala said , is that oral contraceptives , like most drugs , are initially tested in " healthy " people , which rarely includes people who are more than 130 percent of their ideal body weight .
" When we first test drugs for safety and efficacy , we generally do not include people with a high body mass index , " Cherala said .
" But body weight and amounts of fat can seriously change the pharmacokinetics , or way drugs act and are processed in the body .
There 's a growing awareness that we need to more carefully consider obesity and other factors that affect drug absorption , distribution , metabolism and other factors . "
Conventional oral contraceptives , Cherala said , are thought to be relatively " lipophilic , " or tend to concentrate in fat tissue .
However , the researchers in this study said they were somewhat surprised to find that the affinity of these drugs for fat tissue was not significantly different between obese and normal body weight subjects .
Rather , the researchers found that contraceptive drug levels in both obese women and those of normal weight eventually were about the same , but it took longer to achieve that level in very overweight women .
The study showed it took an average of about five days for the drugs to achieve their maximum concentration in women of normal weight , an average of 10 days for obese women , and even longer than that for some individuals .
One woman in the study took more than 20 days to reach a " steady state " drug concentration .
Women of normal weight who follow their oral contraceptive directions should have appropriate protection against pregnancy .
But the delay in reaching a steady state drug concentration raises questions about how well oral contraceptives may work for obese women .
Increasing the drug dosage might help address this issue , Cherala said , but also adds other health concerns .
In fact , the researchers noted in their report that many clinicians actually prescribe lower - dose oral contraceptives to obese patients in an effort to decrease their risk of venous thrombosis .
These are blood clots in the legs or elsewhere that can increase the risk of stroke and heart attacks .
The study was done with 20 women of ages 18 to 35 , all of them healthy and seeking contraception , 10 of whom were of normal weight and 10 with a " body mass index " of more than 30 - a common measure of obesity .
According to Dr. Alison Edelman , lead author of the study and assistant director of the Family Planning Fellowship at Oregon Health and Science University , the participants in this study were purposely selected for obesity in order to explore this issue .
But several demographic studies have shown that even women just considered " overweight , " with a body mass index of 25 - 30 , may also be at increased risk of contraceptive failure .
" Although our research has found this interaction between obese women and oral contraceptives , we do n't have enough information yet to recommend changes in clinical practice , other than choosing a contraceptive option that works better for both normal weight and obese women , like an intrauterine device , " Edelman said .
For future work , she said , studies of contraception would be more useful if they included participants that reflect the general population , including women with different body mass indexes .
The biological underpinnings of how oral contraceptives work , their effects on the hypothalamic - pituitary - ovarian axis , has only been studied in women of normal weight , the researchers noted in their study .
At present , Cherala said , there is no readily available test that would tell a woman how long it would take for her to reach an effective concentration level of a particular contraceptive , and this does vary with the individual .
However , scientists are continuing research on that issue , and they may ultimately develop tests or methods that would improve drug efficacy for women who wish to use oral contraceptives .
MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - Russia said on Friday it was seriously concerned by the use of force in Iran after a disputed presidential election and urged Tehran to settle all issues in a democratic way , Interfax news agency reported .
“ We naturally express our most serious concern about the use of force and the death of civilians , ” Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was quoted as saying on the sidelines of a meeting of Group of Eight foreign ministers in Italy .
“ We count on all questions which have arisen in the context of the elections being resolved in accordance with democratic procedures , ” Lavrov said .
Russia and China earlier this month congratulated Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad on his controversial re-election as he attended a summit in Russia .
Official results handed Ahmadinejad a landslide victory while defeated candidate Mirhossein Mousavi has said the vote was rigged .
Group of Eight powers deplored the post-election violence in Iran on Friday and called on Tehran to resolve the crisis soon through democratic dialogue .

The 2010 CrossFit Games Website !
We are going to launch the 2010 Games website in a few days .
There will be preliminary information available immediately on the entire season of qualifiers .
This year , there will be 13 Regionals around the world that all take place in May .
But unlike last year , you now have to qualify for the Regionals ( with a few exceptions in continents with sparse populations of CrossFitters ) .
Feeding these Regionals will be approximately 30 Sectional competitions , which will be open to anyone .
The Sectionals will take place from mid-February to late March .
There will even be a Sectional held as one of the events at the Arnold Classic in Columbus , Ohio .
Registration for all events worldwide will hopefully launch Monday , December 21st through our dedicated Registration Website .
We will do our best to allow everyone in who wants to compete , but at some point we may have to cut it off .
Spectator attendance at most Sectionals will be limited , so you 'll want to act quickly .
After a brutal day in the Aromas sun , the couplet event was all that stood between a handful of female competitors and a berth in the top 16 , and day two .
A strong finish here could keep their dreams alive for this years Games .
The heat was stacked with competitors .
Rebecca Voigt , of Valley CrossFit , finished in 13:54 , a course record at the time .
Her time set the bar for the rest of the heats and she maintained fourth place in the event .
Glory Dawson , of Cross Fit BWI , finished just behind her and recorded the sixth fastest time of the day .

Mikko Salo recounts the 7 kilometer run from the safety of Finland .
He talks about the camaraderie of the weekend , and his introduction to Spealler on the last stretch of the run .
" I do n't know why I did it , it just came naturally ...
Hello , I 'm Mikko ... but I think it 's the spirit of Cross Fit .
You are having this huge fight in the first event , for who will be number one and still we shook hands .
It was quite nice . "
Other than the run , most of the events were a blur to Mikko until he saw them on film .
" I do n't remember the events at the Games , they are not clear to me .
It 's quite funny to watch , I look and remember like ten things . "
He was happy not to fully relive the events though .
" I had flashbacks and thought , yes it was like that .
But I did not feel that pain that is on my face . "

All superheroes have alternate identities .
Tanya
Wagner is no exception .
The 26 year old school teacher from Pennsylvania co-owns CrossFit Apex with her husband and fellow competitor , Josh Wagner .
She leads by example in compeition with an easy - going attitude and positive approach to sport .
Tanya finished second at the 2008 CrossFit Games .
Going into the final chipper event on Sunday , Wagner was almost assured the title , ' World 's Fittest Woman . '
Annie Thorisdotter trailed by seven points and could dethrone Tanya if she finished 8 places ahead , or if Tanya failed to finish the workout .
The question ?
Ten muscle - ups .
Annie had never done one and Tanya got her first just six months prior .
Wagner was having doubts entering the final event .
" I was freakin ' out and I just needed to calm down .
Jolie really helped , she 's awesome . "
Mostly , she was nervous about the muscle ups .
She was unfamiliar with the equipment and had a realatively limited exposure to the movement itself .
" I just got my muscle up in February ...
I 've never done ten total in a workout . "
In the end , Annie got her first muscle - up , and Tanya emerged victorious .
She was proud of course , but ready for some well deserved rest .
" I 'm just happy it 's over . "

In a deleted clip from , " In Pursuit Of Sunday , " by Again Faster , Affiliate teams use different strategies to maximize their points in the North Pad Event .
Will Dotterweich of CrossFit Sacramento tripled 245 on his overhead squat and narrowly missed 275 , as the crowd watched on .
" I 've been training the snatch a lot , so this event just fit into my training really well . "
CrossFit Silicon
Valley took a more relaxed approach .
" Plenty of time , plenty of time , " said a casual looking Tim Dymmel .
Something paid off and Silicon Valley finished fifth in the North Pad Event .
CrossFit Norcal took first overall for the event , with a score of 958 .

CrossFit Oakland was crowned the 2008 CrossFit Affiliate Cup Champions .
After a rocky start in the stadium event this year , they were unable to close the gap for a berth in Sunday 's final , despite an 8th place finish in the run event .
Mike Minium , owner and coach of CrossFit Oakland , breaks down the weekend , and the changes his team will make for next years competition .
" We got hung up on the wall balls ( in the stadium WOD ) which cost us a lot of time . "
The weights were standard , but the target was set higher .
All four athletes had to complete 30 reps before moving on .
Mike was expecting to make some serious ground in the stadium event , but good plans often deteriorate when the clock starts .
" What are you gonna do ?
That 's competition . "
The team managed to roll with the punches as well , despite their disappointment .
" I 'm proud of my team , after the first workout it would 've been easy to give up ... but in the very next workout we took first in our heat . "
Going into the North Pad Event , Team Oakland knew their strategy was to just ' hang in there ' as it was an area where they needed to develop more .
They managed to finish the event with 764 points , keeping them right in the center of the competitor field .
On moving forward , Mike spoke like a wise competitor .
" Weaknesses were exposed so we 're gonna go back to the drawing board and figure out how to make us better as a team . "

" You lift like a girl , " should be taken as the highest of compliments , especially if the girl you refer to is Tanya Wagner , this years CrossFit Games Champion and the Fittest Woman Alive .
Tanya solidified her lead with the second best performance overall in the Snatch Event .
Tanya entered Sunday with a two point lead over Annie Thorisdotter .
In the snatch event she lifted 135 pounds , ten pounds less than Tamara Holmes , but enough to maintain her lead in the overall competition .

Mikko Salo is opening an affiliate .
From the new box he speaks about his plans for programming .
" We will probably follow one cycle behind main site because it 's great programming and it's enough for 99 percent of the people . "
He recognizes that top Games competitors may need to supplement with additional workouts in order to win the Cross Fit Games .
However , all too often he sees people attempt too much right out of the gate .
" We have seen guys , like in our firehouse , that get hungrier and hungrier and they want to do more than just the workout of the day .
They 'll make it like three or four days for maybe three cycles and then they burn out . "
Mikko is going to be careful to indoctrinate clients slowly to allow proper adaptation .

Cyndi Frieling came to this year 's Games with a 365 lb deadlift PR in her back pocket .
The hopper worked in her favor for the second event .
Many doubted that any men would make it through the gauntlet of bars in the deadlift competition .
The expectations for the women , as echoed by some spectators , were lessened still .
However , in spite of an unforgiving schedule , extreme heat and fatigue , PRs were the rule instead of the exception .
The power of screaming fans and performance pressures that athletes face are intangibles that cannot be quantified .
Cyndi , from CrossFit Mesquite , inspired the whole stadium when she pulled a ten pound personal best , and became the only female to complete the entire event .
She finished 21st at the 2008 CrossFit Games and rode a third place finish in the Great Basin Qualifier into this years competition .

Finally some concrete evidence that Mikko Salo is indeed human .
From his hometown in Finland Mikko talks about how he dealt with the stresses dealt to his body from the demands of the games .
Mikko woke up with cold sweats at 2 am on Sunday morning .
" It was like sleeping in a pool ... the night was a bit strange for me . "
But he rallied and pulled through for an amazing second day .
" In the morning , I felt fine . "
He also talks about how hard it was to refuel during the tenuous two days of competition .
" Eating was hard for me ... I was n't hungry . "
He found it hard to choke down food even after both full days of hard work .
" I knew I needed the energy , so I had to eat everything .
But it was a bit of a struggle for me . "
The competition was so intense , in fact , that Mikko's victory celebration party ended early with one beer , lots of untouched food and a very early bedtime .
" It was a wise decision at that point . "

Think you had a gnarly commute to the Cross Fit Games .
The affiliate team from CrossFit Copenhagen in Denmark spent a cool 20 hours in the air closing the roughly 6,000 miles to Aromas .
Pair that with a short notice entry into the competition and their presence is all the more impressive .
They finished the weekend in the 41st spot , highlighted by securing 20th overall in the run event .

Sometimes laughter is the best medicine .
Pat Sherwood , of Cross Fit HQ , is quick to deliver humor in most situations .
On the eve of the competition , after the daunting itinerary of challenges had been announced , Pat needed a dose himself .
" I 'm here to go as far as I can and then cheer for Chris Spealler , " he said .
Sherwood finished sixth in the Mid-Atlantic Qualifiers in 2009 .
After talking about strategy for the Affiliate North Pad WOD , conversation turned toward the 7 kilometer run , namely strategy for the downhill portion .
" I 'm calling it controlled falling ... I guess ...
I 'm gonna try not to roll both of my ankles and dislocate my hips .
If all else fails , I may jump on Rob Orlando 's back and ride along , like Yoda . "
He commented on the formatting of the Games as well , which was not exactly to his liking .
" I like to deadlift fresh ... so the deadlift event is going to be a unique experience .
We shall see . "

What started as " just a good run " ended as a dream come true .
As you can see in this video , Mikko is sportsmanship incarnate and the rightful proprietor of the title , World 's Fittest Man 2009 .
Whether a cause or effect of their training , Cross Fit champions tend to exemplify the very best ethos of sport .
Mikko is no exception .
The firefighter and rescue diver from Finland embodies the spirit of the Games .
One of the amazing traits of Mikko is that he never seems fazed .
He approached each event with an air of amusement .
When he had reps taken away from him , he just kept going .
Even after the brutal final chipper , which he completed nearly two minutes faster than any other competitor , he kept his humor and his humility .
" It 's the ending I dreamed of , " Mikko said in response to whether this was the result he wanted .
" Not what I wanted ... dreamed of . "

" The men and women competing here today have legitimate claim to the title , " Fittest Men and Women on Earth , " by the same rights and logic that the Lakers , the Steelers , the Penguins and the Phillies are the best basketball team , football team , hockey team and baseball team on Earth . "
- Greg Glassman , at the Inception of the 2009 CrossFit Games
As a strength and conditioning program , the goal of CrossFit is to consistently exceed the capacities of its athletes , including the world 's fittest humans .
No matter where you are in life , gains in fitness cannot be achieved without discomfort .
Of course , that pain should n't be excessive , nor should it be just for its own sake ( it 's easy to create a painful workout that does n't lead to much ) .
But , there is certainly a high correlation between competency in life and tolerance of discomfort .
Obviously , any attempt to determine the World 's Fittest Humans must be , by definition , extremely arduous .
Was this year 's Games enough , or did we make it too hard ?
Is This Too Hard ?

Woman who cried rape after date with man she met in internet chatroom is jailed for a year
Wronged : Gary Wood was accused of rape by Natalie Jefferson , who he met in an internet chat room
An innocent man almost lost his freedom after being accused of rape by a woman he met over the internet .
Gary Wood was hoping for romance when he arranged to meet Natalie Jefferson after chatting to her online , but ended up facing a potential 10 - year jail term .
Instead 27 - year - old Jefferson is beginning a 12 - month jail term after detectives saw through her lies .
Mr Wood , 31 , of Walker , Newcastle , said he was still baffled by her motives .
' I just want to know why , ' he said .
' Maybe she 's is messed up in the head , maybe she 's an attention - seeker or maybe it is a bit of both , but I could have lost everything because of what she did . '
Newcastle Crown Court heard how Jefferson , of Fellgate , South Tyneside , agreed to meet Mr Wood in Newcastle 's Gateshead before going for a drink in nearby Jesmond .
But she received a phone call during the evening and claimed one of her children had been taken to hospital .
Mr Wood offered to go with her but she only let him travel on the Metro underground system part of the way with her .
False allegation : Jefferson accused Gary Wood of attacking her near Luckies wine bar in Newcastle , above
He phoned her later but was horrified when she told him she had been raped by a stranger .
It was a lie - but she had already called police claiming Mr Wood himself had raped her .
Soon officers were on his doorstep to arrest him .
He said : ' I got a call saying the police wanted to speak to me .
They did n't say what it was at first but when they came to my flat , the officer said , " I will be up - front with you - we have had an allegation of rape against you . " '
Mr Wood was held in custody for three hours .
Jefferson - also known as Natalie Dawn Dodsworth - had alleged Mr Wood attacked her on January 7 near Newcastle 's Luckies bar and even agreed to go to a rape crisis centre .
But she was arrested and charged with perverting the course of justice after investigating officers interviewed Mr Wood and witnesses , as well as studying CCTV , and grew suspicious about her version of events .
In court Jefferson admitted the charge .
Robin Patton , prosecuting , said : ' It 's quite clear she had concocted this account for no good reason at all .
' The man 's medical examination was about to start but police , having viewed the CCTV footage , immediately stopped the examination because they were sure he was an innocent man . '
Ailsa MacDonald , defending , told the court : ' There is a considerable psychiatric background and she has alcohol problems . '
Pronouncing sentence , Judge Esmond Faulks said : ' This was a huge waste of police time and , more seriously , led to the arrest of an innocent man . '
Det Con Graeme Barr , of Newcastle CID , said : ' We are happy with the sentence passed by the court as it sends out the message that people will be punished for making false reports of crime .
' Gary is an innocent man and she could quite easily have ruined his life .
I hope he can now put this behind him and get on with his life . '
Mr Wood said : ' I had met her on the internet .
She did n't seem right as soon as I met her and kept going to the toilet , which was strange , but I never thought she would do anything like this .
' I have never been in any trouble with the police before this .
I was on bail for two weeks with this allegation hanging over my head .
' I can't stop thinking that if there had been no witnesses or CCTV to prove that she was lying I would have been in real trouble and would have been sent down .
I would have lost my friends and everything I 've got . '
He added : ' It has still affected me and if I was to meet someone now , I would only do it in public .
I am glad with the sentence but think she should have got more because she could be out and doing it to someone else in six months . '
Complex single - and double - floats used to be represented as pairs of SSE registers on the x86 - 64 port .
Doing so simplified the porting work , since more code could be shared with other backends .
Representing complexes packed in SSE registers as would be obviously preferable was left for the future .
Luckily , most of my work on SSE intrinsics is directly applicable to that task : all the SSE { 1,2} instructions were finally defined , and modifying a pre-existing primitive object type is much simpler than adding a new one .
The initial work was mostly straightforward , since , by default , the only operations on complexes are moves ( to / from registers , the stack / arguments , vectors , or the heap [ as boxed objects ] ) , creation from scalar components , and extraction of components .
The modifications mostly entailed modifying the way register allocation manipulates complexes ( they only need a single SSE register , like scalar values ) , and making the boxed representation more SSE - friendly ( alignment , packing single floats for MOVQ ) .
There 's only one problem I can remember in that part of the code : the stack is n't guaranteed to be aligned on 16 byte boundaries !
That means that I 'm forced to use MOVUPD when moving complex double floats between the stack and an SSE register .
Already , using half the registers and half the memory accesses is interesting .
The real pay - off with packed complexes , however , is the ability to use vector instructions in arithmetic operations .
The obvious cases are addition and subtraction ( both complex - complex and complex - real ) , which exhibit natural horizontal parallelism : each pair of components ( real - real or imaginary - imaginary ) can be processed separately .
For complex - real multiplication or division , things are only slightly more complex : the real operand has to be duplicated before operating in parallel .
I encountered two important bugs in that code .
First , scalar values were still passed around with narrow register - register moves ( movsd or movss ) .
When we only ever manipulated scalars , that was n't an issue .
Complex - real addition and subtraction , however , really want to exploit the fact that the high part of a scalar value is filled with 0 .
That 's not the case when a narrow move is used to move a single float value into a register that used to hold a double ...
Using full register moves instead ( for both complex and scalar values ) not only made the code correct , but also improved performance , due to their being simpler for the SSE pipeline to handle .
Second , packed single float division executes four divisions , not two .
Thus , it 's not enough to duplicate the real operand in a complex - real division before executing a packed division : depending on the exception mask , the 0.0/0.0 in the higher half of the result may trigger an arithmetic exception .
The simplest solution I found was to perform the same operation in both halves of the operands .
Obviously , an exception will be signalled iff operating only on the lower half would have signalled too .
The cost is one additional shuffle step for the complex value : the real value always has to be duplicated , and the high half of the result must be reset to 0 anyway .
That leaves complex - complex multiplication , and complex - complex / real - complex division .
Complex multiplication is a fairly common operation ; common enough for Intel to pretty much dedicate an instruction to that operation ( ADDSUBP{S , D} ) in SSE3 .
Even when restricting ourselves to SSE2 , the code is fairly simple .
The most unnatural part is computing the conjugate , given the absence of ADDSUB ( more on that later ) .
Complex division , however , is a much more complicated beast .
I decided to stick to an implementation in CL , but rewritten to use block ( complex - at - a - time ) instead of component - wise arithmetic .
In the end , it still wanted an additional operation : swapping the real and imaginary components of a complex .
Finally , that leaves non-arithmetic operations , like equality tests ( both bitwise and as numbers ) , conjugate and negation .
Once there 's a guarantee that the unused components in a SSE register are 0 - filled ( a guarantee that is supported by most load - from - memory instructions ) , testing for equality is very straightforward .
Computing the conjugate of a complex or negating one , on the other hand , is n't so nice .
One look at the way floats are laid out in register shows that they may be implemented as simple bit - wise operations .
That leaves the problem of loading the relevant constants in .
That 's where a later patch comes in .
Negating and taking the absolute value of a real requires constants for bit - wise operations , like conjugating or negating a complex .
Until now , SBCL generated code that loaded the constant in a GPR , and then moved it from the GPR into an SSE register .
Generating the constant usually required some shifting ( often slow ) , and moving data between the GPR and SSE register files takes a relatively long time on current microarchitectures .
Loading such constants from memory directly into SSE registers would be preferable .
However , by the time assembly code is generated , it 's too late to add constants , and some of these constants would have to be boxed ( be it as fixnums or bignums ) .
In other words , both not feasible and not always a good idea .
A second patch adds support for unboxed constants stored inline , after the executable code .
The system must already support code relocation , so the moving GC is n't an issue more than it already is ( RIP - relative addressing on x86 - 64 , and post - GC fixups on x86 ) .
I have n't bothered to look at the situation for other platforms yet , but , with some luck , things will be similarly simple .
Storing constants in the code segments was already possible , with a small bit of hacking .
What the patch mostly offers is the ability to pack the constants together .
The advantage is that they can be stored far enough away from code ( one cache line ) to not confuse caches , and that a more global outlook allows the code generator to merge identical constants together and to reorder them to guarantee sufficient alignment without wasting too much space .
With that infrastructure in place , it was easy to generate much simpler and faster code for the previous bitwise operations on floats .
It also became interesting to store some unboxed constants inline .
On x86 - 64 , I implemented that for constant floats ( both real and complex ) and fixnums that fit in registers , but can't be assembled as immediates ( so +/- 2^29 and wider ) .
On x86 , fixnums can always be assembled as immediates , so only floats are stored as unboxed inline constants .
Float constants are interesting to store inline because they 're frequently found in speed - oriented code .
Wider - than - fixnum constants , on the other hand , not so much .
There 's also a certain trade - off to consider : unboxed constants cause additional consing ( and code bloat ) each time they must be boxed .
Unboxed constants open the door for another set of improvements for x86oids : many instructions can load one operand directly from memory .
Using that feature may save a register , and always makes the code smaller .
The latter can often have a heavier impact on performance than the former .
Using fewer registers mostly matters when the compiler has to spill values ; that does not happen so often in inner loops on the x86 - 64 .
Smaller code , on the other hand , helps with memory ( fits better in cache , needs less bandwidth ) and reduces the pressure on the instruction decoder .
Finally , when a constant shows up as an operand , it pretty much always pays off to store is inline , so even wider - than - fixnum integer constants are stored inline in that case .
The union of these changes transparently speeds up most complex float operations by up to ~ 100 % on my Core 2 .
In the current version of Bordeaux - FFT , that translates into a 110 % speed - up for 1024 - point FFTs .
Scalar operations also show significant improvements .
Nikodemus Siivola 's implementation of the ( broken ) mandelbrot routine at http://random-state.net/log/3452921796.html shows a 55 % speed - up for hand - rolled complex arithmetic ( within 20 % of the execution time of the fastest g++ version ) .
The complex - ful version shows a lesser speed - up , 38 % , probably because a good portion of the runtime is spent operating element - wise to compute the 2 - norm of complexes .
If you have performance - sensitive code that performs a lot of floating point computations , you might be pleasantly surprised by this month 's release .
P.S. Considering the size of these patches , I would probably be even more pleasantly surprised if they were bug - free .
Bug reports ( to sbcl - bugs , or , more realistically , directly to sbcl - devel ) are always welcome , especially during the code freeze period starting today !
Many political observers in Alaska are fixated on rumors that federal investigators have been seizing paperwork from SBS in recent months , searching for evidence that Palin and her husband Todd steered lucrative contracts to the well - connected company in exchange for gifts like the construction of their home on pristine Lake Lucille in 2002 .
The home was built just two months before Palin began campaigning for governor , a job which would have provided her enhanced power to grant building contracts in the wide open state .
SBS has close ties to the Palins .
The company has not only sponsored Todd Palin ’s snowmobile team , according to the Village Voice ’s Wayne Barrett , it hired Sarah Palin to do a statewide television commercial in 2004 .
Though Todd Palin told Fox News he built his Lake Lucille home with the help of a few “ buddies , ” according to Barrett ’s report , public records revealed that SBS supplied the materials for the house .
While serving as mayor of Wasilla , Sarah Palin blocked an initiative that would have required the public filing of building permits — thus momentarily preventing the revelation of such suspicious information .
Just months before Palin left city hall to campaign for governor , she awarded a contract to SBS to help build the $ 13 million Wasilla Sports Complex .
The most expensive building project in Wasilla history , the complex cost the city an addition $ 1.3 million in legal fees and threw it into severe long - term debt .
For SBS , however , the bloated and bungled project was a cash cow . [...]
The Meaning of “ Scalable ” Needs to Change
The word “ scalable ” has been used in IT for over forty years .
IBM used the word when they first talked about their 360 series of mainframe computers in the 1960’s .
Since that time scalability has been a consideration in every aspect of computing : mainframes , minis , personal computers , servers , networks , proprietary systems , open systems , even smartphones .
But up until recently , “ scalable ” usually meant that you could make a system scale up — you could add more computing power and run the same application with much higher transaction volumes .
That ’s what most people were interested in : being able to reuse their application architecture for higher volumes as their companies grew .
We began to see the need for downward scalability about twenty years ago during the beginning of the outsourcing era .
As IT organizations outsourced some of their applications , they needed less processing power on the computers they had been using for those applications .
But they found that it was n’t very economical to scale down .
Vendors usually offer you great deals to trade - in your smaller hardware for bigger boxes , but you wo n’t find such a good deal when you want to replace a large box with a smaller one .
In the last ten years , virtualization has had a large impact on scalability .
With virtualization you can carve up a large computer into a series of smaller virtual computers , then alter the size of those virtual computers at will .
Virtual computers can scale both up and down , but you ’re still stuck with the large computer that ’s underneath all of those virtual systems .
So while virtualization can help you balance computing load across your different systems , it does n’t help much if your overall enterprise computing requirement is shrinking .
More recently , “ cloud computing ” has given us an outsourced version of virtualization .
Now our virtual computers can exist at a vendor location or even at a combination of onsite and remote facilities .
Scalability has gotten many times more flexible , with its limits determined more by what we can negotiate than by the limits of physical computer hardware .
Yet despite all of the advances that have been made in virtualization and cloud computing , I still hear the word “ scalability ” primarily referring to the ability to scale up .
It ’s like our IT people have been trapped in the scale - up definition for so long that they forget that downward scalability is important too .
Take a look at IT departments that are doing well in the current bad economy .
You ’ll find that in many cases their success is due to their ability to provide the same systems capabilities at much lower volumes with corresponding reduction in cost .
Downward scalability is helping them be successful in a time when revenue and system volumes are declining .
So when you look at a new application system as a candidate for use in your company , make sure that it ’s scalable both upward and downward .
Your success — and the success of your company — may depend on it .

When Windows Mobile 6.5 was officially revealed last month at the Mobile World Congress ( MWC ) 2009 in Barcelona , it sported the honeycomb Start screen that users could n't quite agree on , even when early screenshots began to leak .
Apparently , soon after Microsoft started dogfooding Windows Mobile 6.5 and related services internally last week , feedback coming from its employees started coming in , and it was n't very positive .
This was apparently the final blow , because at MIX09 this week , it has come to light that Microsoft has acted on the negative comments and tweaked the honeycomb interface .
While the layout remains the same and the icons are in the exact same place , they have been enlarged and the actual honeycomb outline ( hexagons around each icon ) is gone .
Furthermore , scrolling up or down no longer means going all the way to the top or all the way to the bottom : the second the finger leaves the screen , scrolling will stop .
The rather blurry screenshot above is actually two screencaps of a video which is filming Loke Uei Tan , Senior Technical Product Manager of the Mobile and Embedded Devices Group in Microsoft , as he uses the new interface during one of the 129 sessions at MIX09 .
This one was entitled " Windows Mobile 6.5 Overview , " and before showing off the changes , Tan says in the video : " The middle screen is what we call the honeycomb interface .
Well , this screenshot is a little bit old .
We 've got some feedback from the users that says ' Hey , wait a minute , this honeycomb UI does n't work very well .
Let 's change it a little bit . '
So I 'll show you what the new one looks like . "
I 've embedded the full video of the session below ( Silverlight required , honeycomb changes start at 6:50 ) .
It 's not the first time Microsoft has altered a key UI element during the beta development phase , but it 's still very interesting because there must have been quite an uproar if the company made the changes even after having publicly unveiled the new operating system .
That said , while the tweaks are notable , the fact that the honeycomb layout remains demonstrates that the changes are an evolution , not a revolution .
How much faith should the faithless put in Barack Obama ?
Atheists keep faith with Obama
How much faith should the faithless put in Barack Obama ?
The president said in his inaugural address that the United States is “ a nation of Christians and Muslims , Jews and Hindus and nonbelievers . ”
And in his commencement speech at the University of Notre Dame , he said that the Golden Rule binds “ people of all faiths and no faith together . ”

While the atheist community appreciates the shout - outs , George W. Bush offered similar acknowledgements of nonbelievers during his presidency .
And like Bush , Obama has repeatedly invoked religion in his speeches .
The latest dose came Thursday in Cairo , in his speech to the Muslim world , during which Obama talked of the “ Holy Quran ” and invoked this Quranic supplication : “ Be conscious of God , and speak always the truth . ”
But while atheist advocates railed against Bush , they seem willing to give Obama a pass on his God talk — at least for now .
Nathan Bupp , director of communications for the Center for Inquiry , says that many nonbelievers view Obama ’s invocations of faith as nothing more than a “ symbolic gesture ” used to aid his quest for social justice .
“ There is a sense where secularists are politically savvy enough to do this , ” says Bupp .
“ They realize [ Obama ] is not doing what he ’s doing for Pat Robertson - type reasons . ”
Over the past several years , in large part in response to the Sept. 11 attacks and the Bush presidency , the American atheist movement reached its rabble - rousing zenith , underscored by the publishing success of anti-God manifestos like Sam Harris ’
“ End of Faith , ” Christopher Hitchens ’ “ God Is Not Great ” and Richard Dawkins ’ “ The God Delusion . ”
In Obama , the community saw a prospect for change .
But now , Ed Buckner , president of the American Atheists , wonders whether advocates and activists may witness a one - step - forward , two - steps - backward phenomenon with Obama .
While grateful for the new president ’s cap - tipping , Buckner says , “ The fact that our best shot of making things better still goes around saying God stuff all the time in some ways maybe makes it worse . ”

Rep. Pete Stark ( D - Calif. ) , the highest - ranking U.S. politician to claim unbelief in a higher power , cautions atheists not to put too much faith in a religious politician — even one raised by a secular humanist mother .
“ Underneath it all , he is a pretty standard Christian , go - by - the - book kind of person , ” Stark says of the president .
“ Look at all the stuff he is trying to do in the White House .
I mean , come on .
I think that is probably not constitutional . ”
Stark is referring to Obama ’s White House Office of Faith - Based and Neighborhood Partnerships , a continuation of a Bush initiative that troubled a number of freedom - from - religion types .
Like Bush ’s , Obama ’s faith - based office has yet to make a practice of disallowing organizations that engage in religious hiring discrimination from being eligible for funds .
The administration has simply said it will evaluate each organization on a case - by - case basis .
Though disappointed by this , Toni Van Pelt , director and chief lobbyist for the Center for Inquiry , thinks that now is the time for nonbelievers to tread lightly , “ in a thoughtful way , to be successful and not suffer a severe backlash . ”
As part of this , Van Pelt says nonbelievers are wise to keep their consternation in check , particularly over such things as rhetorical matters .
“ I do n’t want you to think that I am undercutting the importance of cultural messages , ” she says , “ but pragmatically , there are some really serious things that we need to focus our work on . ”
And , to be sure , Obama has pleased many secular humanists with specific actions he ’s already undertaken , such as overturning a last - minute Bush order that gave protection to health care providers who refuse to attend to medical requests on account of their personal beliefs .
In addition , advocates say they have been heartened by Obama ’s push for “ evidence - based ” science policy , as well as his individual selections for administration science posts .
Last week , the Secular Coalition for America , an atheist advocacy group , held its first - ever individual face - to - face with the White House .
Ron Millar , the coalition ’s acting director , told POLITICO that he met with Paul Montero , Obama ’s religious liaison in the White House Office of Public Engagement .
Obama “ is opening a little door to include us in , which we are very appreciative of , ” says Millar , who says he anticipates a number of additional such meetings with the administration .
Among the concerns Millar says he touched on was proselytizing in the U.S. military : “ That is something we really want to follow up with this administration , because we have not seen much there . ”
In April , Joshua DuBois , the Pentecostal minister who now heads Obama ’s faith - based office , met with representatives from the Coalition Against Religious Discrimination .
Van Pelt , who was among the participants , says that she and others relayed their concerns over the discriminatory hiring practices of faith - based institutions receiving federal funds .
“ We have stated what our position is , ” Van Pelt says .
“ But , frankly , we ’ve been told that they are listening .
They have not been imparting much information to us .
So it is kind of a wait - and - see attitude [ on our part ] . ”
Meanwhile , some nonbelievers are also nervously waiting to see whether Obama will appoint former Human Genome Project Director Frances Collins , a born - again Christian , to run the National Institutes of Health .
Bloomberg News recently reported that Collins was the front - runner for the position , a prospect that troubles folks such as Harris .
But for the most part , atheist groups are keeping quiet on this , deciding that their best bet is to give Obama the benefit of the doubt .
“ The one important thing to recognize , ” says Harris , “ is [ Obama ] is so much better than the last guy in the Oval Office , and everyone is feeling so much relief for the change he has brought , that they are inclined not to gripe too much about all the delusional stuff he may be paying lip service to or holding over from the previous administration . ”
In what can only be described as a weird thought , Joel Hanrahan could have been the first player in major - league baseball history to win and lose the same game .
If Hanrahan had been traded to Houston instead of Pittsburgh , the oddest scenario ever could have been played out .
The Astros and Nationals have to finish a suspended game tomorrow .
The game is tied 10 - 10 after ten and a half innings .
Joel Hanrahan pitched the top of the 11th for Washington without giving up a run .
He is in line to get the win if Washington could scratch out a run in the bottom half .
The game was then suspended before Washington got to bat .
Here is where it gets tricky …
Had Houston acquired Hanrahan instead of Pittsburgh and put him on the mound in the bottom of the 11th and Hanrahan gives up a run .
He would have been the winning pitcher for Washington and the losing pitcher for Houston .
However , it will not happen as Pittsburgh continues to run a flea market for the rest of MLB .
Just saying though , how weird would that have been ?

It was nearly midnight as I plodded through the woods next to the old paper mill off of Highway 59 .
I had sneaked out of my house through the window in my room just an hour before .
This is the place where I always went to calm myself and think .

PUBLIC DEBT UPDATE
Figures for total public debt outstanding were uncharacteristically jumpy this week and briefly passed $ 11.5 trillion .
Mon : $ 11.36 trillion
trillion Tue : $ 11.55 trillion
trillion Wed : $ 11.52 trillion
trillion Thu : $ 11.49 trillion
( Click chart to enlarge in new window )
To put these figures in perspective , every $ 100 billion increase in the public debt is effectively a $ 900 tax hike for each American household .
Keep in mind that this headline figure drastically underestimates the real national debt because it excludes the present value of our Medicare and Social Security liabilities .
Properly figured , the real national debt is $ 61.9 trillion .
That ’s $ 560,000 per household .
FED BALANCE SHEET UPDATE
The Fed ’s balance sheet has stayed relatively steady as increases in permanent holdings of Treasurys , Agencies and Agency mortgage - backed securities ( MBS ) have lately been offset by declines in central bank swap lines and term auction credit .
It should be noted that the balance sheet only reflects about 70 % of the Fed ’s Agency MBS purchases since it began quantitative easing earlier this year .
These purchases can take up to two months to settle .
Only then do they hit the balance sheet .
QE ( “ PRINTING PRESS ” ) UPDATE
Under its quantitative easing plan , the Fed has committed to purchasing $ 1.25 trillion of Agency MBS and $ 200 billion of Agency debt by the end of the year , along with $ 300 billion of Treasurys by autumn .
In other words , it is printing $ 1.75 trillion dollars this year in order to finance home loans and the federal government ’s stimulus .
So far they ’ve purchased $ 622 billion of Agency MBS , though only $ 462 billion is reflected on the balance sheet due to the settlement issue noted above .
These purchases have occurred very evenly , about $ 20 - $ 30 billion per week since January .
At that rate , the Fed will hit the $ 1.25 trillion target on schedule .
With Agency debt , the Fed is half way to its $ 200 billion target .
And with Treasurys , the central bank has purchased $ 190 million so far .
( QE data is published on the NY Fed ’s website . )

I 've written extensively on the many basic problems that make all government - run , computer - automated mass surveillance programs a waste of taxpayer money .
But a new report ( PDF ) from the Offices of Inspectors General of the Department of Defense , Department of Justice , CIA , NSA , and Office of the Director of National Intelligence shows in some detail how our government took the bad idea of building powerful computers to sniff out a terrorist needle in a digital haystack , then made it even less useful in practice .
The new OIG report on the NSA - run Presidential Surveillance Program ( PSP ) , of which the previously revealed warrantless wiretapping program was just a part , contains a number of stunning revelations ; I 'll go through some of those in subsequent articles .
But perhaps the report 's greatest value is in the way that it provides a glimpse into how the secrecy - obsessed Bush administration actually sabotaged the NSA 's massive , law - free surveillance program by overly restricting intelligence personnel 's knowledge of and access to it .
In short , the PSP was too secret for its own good .
A throat so deep
One of the pervading themes of the OIG report is that the PSP was really , really , really secret .
It was so secret , in fact , that the president himself picked which non-operational personnel were to be " read into " the program .
So if you were n't actually involved in the day - to - day running of the NSA 's giant SIGINT vacuum , then the commander - in - chief personally decided whether you should know that it even existed .
This extreme level of secrecy posed myriad practical problems when it came to actually using the PSP 's output in the day - to - day counter - terror work that goes on at a number of agencies — DHS , CIA , FBI , the National Counterterrorism Center ( NCTC ) , and so on .
Almost none of the working - level analysts who might benefit from the PSP 's output were allowed to know of the program 's existence , so getting that output into those workers ' hands meant carefully stripping it of any hints about its provenance , thereby rendering it significantly less valuable .
The problem was especially acute at the FBI , which was n't as widely looped in on the PSP as the CIA ( more on the latter , shortly ) , despite the fact that the Bureau is involved in domestic counter - terrorism .
When the few people at the FBI who were in - the - know about PSP 's existence got " product " from it , they had to be very careful about what they did with the information , lest some lowly FBI guy in the trenches learn of the existence of the program .
But even if FBI agents had known of the existence of PSP and of the origin of some of the tips they were getting , that still would n't have been much help .
Just ask the CIA , where more people knew about the PSP but still had no idea how it worked .
The multibillion - dollar electronic anonymous tipster
The CIA seemed to have an easier time dealing with the PSP since more of its people were read into the program , but there were still serious problems .
Most of those who had knowledge of the PSP were senior managers and not the working - level personnel who could have made practical use of the PSP 's products .
The report notes that even for the few working - level CIA folks who were read in , " much of the PSP reporting was vague and without context , " so they wound up relying more on other , more familiar and accessible analytical tools and sources .
The briefing that CIA folks were given on read - in did n't tell them much about how PSP worked or how to use its products , and without that knowledge the output of the program was of limited intelligence value .
Like journalists , CIA officers are trained to consider the source of their incoming information in order to evaluate it by placing it in context .
In the case of the PSP , the source was a giant black box — a sort of electronic anonymous tipster who would periodically drop vague , context - free nuggets into the already unmanageably wide inbound information stream that they had to sift each day .
This black box problem highlights the key barrier that the PSP 's deep secrecy raised to its effectiveness in the war on terror .
The output of any information - gathering system will eventually have to be evaluated by a human ; but for any human knowledge worker who is tasked with looking for a slender needle of relevance in an overwhelmingly large informational haystack , any additional data that arrives free of context , where the worker does n't have any understanding of the mechanisms that produced it , is noise , not signal .
You can easily imagine that when the NSA tells a CIA analyst , " Here 's a tip to add to your pile of things to look into ; it comes from our giant , computerized black box , and you have no idea how that box works or how it actually decided that this ( potentially vague ) tidbit was important , " the analyst may prefer instead to tune out that incoming data and to turn instead to the tools and sources he knows .
It was n't just the CIA that ran into the black box problem .
According to the OIG report , " NCTC analysts noted that the NSA policy protecting the source of the PSP information would have resulted in them not fully understanding the value of the PSP information . "
Another widely quoted section of the report bears out this same point :
NCTC analysts involved in preparing the threat assessments told the ODNI OIG that only a portion of the PSP information was ever used in the ODNI threat assessments because other intelligence sources were available that provided more timely or detailed information about the al - Qaida threat to the United States .
During the interviews , the NCTC analysts noted that PSP information was only one of several valuable sources of intelligence information available to them .
In the end , the PSP 's secrecy put it at a disadvantage vs. other sources of information that working - level analysts knew and trusted .
So when the OIG sought to isolate the impact of the PSP on the nation 's intelligence - gathering activities , the best that analysts in one agency after another could tell them was that the PSP product was just one source among many , and a difficult one to use at that .
The PSP was shrouded in such deep secrecy partly for operational security reasons , but also because of political considerations .
Some of what went on under the auspices of the PSP was later determined to be illegal , and in the next article we 'll take a closer look at the darker corners of the program .
Commodore computers up to BASIC 2.0 ( like the Commodore 64 , the VIC - 20 and the PET 2001 ) only had a very basic understanding of mass storage :
There were physical device numbers that were mapped to the different busses , and the “ KERNAL ” library had “ open ” , “ read ” , “ write ” and “ close ” functions that worked on these devices .
There were also higher - level “ load ” and “ save ” functions that could load and save arbitrary regions of memory :
The first two bytes of the file would be the ( little endian ) start address of the memory block .
With no special knowledge of “ block storage ” devices like disk drives , BASIC 2.0 , which was not only a programming laguage but basically the shell of Commodore computers , could not express commands like “ format a disk ” , “ delete a file ” or “ show the directory ” .
All this functionality , as well as the file system implementation , was part of the firmware of the disk drives .
Sending a Command
Sending commands to the drive was done by using the “ open ” call with a “ secondary address ” of 15 :
The computer ’s KERNAL just sent the file name and the secondary address over the IEC bus as if it were to open a file , but the floppy drive understood secondary address 15 as the command channel .
So for example , deleting a file from BASIC looked like this :
OPEN 1,8,15 , " S:FOO " : CLOSE 1
“ 1 ” is the KERNAL ’s file descriptor , “ 8 ” the device number and “ 15 ” the secondary address .
Experts omitted the close , because it blocked on the completion of the operation .
Getting Data Back
While the “ OPEN ” line for disk commands was pretty verbose , it was still doable .
Getting the error message of the last operation back was more tricky :
It required a loop in BASIC that read bytes from channel 15 until EOF was reached .
Getting a directory listing would be in the same class of problem , since it requires the computer to send a command ( and a file name mask ) to the floppy and receive the data .
Neither BASIC nor KERNAL knew how to do this , and since this was such a common operation , it would n’t have been possible to have the user type in a 4 line BASIC program just to dump the directory contents .
The BASIC Program Hack
Here comes the trick :
If the program to load started with a “ $ ” ( followed by an optional mask ) , the floppy drive just returned the directory listing – formatted as a BASIC program .
The user could then just “ LOAD ” the directory and “ LIST ” it if it were a BASIC program :
LOAD " $ " ,8 SEARCHING FOR $ LOADING READY .
LIST 0 " TEST DISK " 23 2A 20 " FOO " PRG 3 " BAR " PRG 641 BLOCKS FREE .
In this example , “ TEST DISK ” is the disk name , “ 23 ” the disk ID and “ 2A ” the filesystem format / version ( always 2A on 1540/1541/1551/1570/1571 – but this was only a redundant copy of the version information which was never read and could be changed ) .
There are two files , 20 and 3 blocks in size respecively ( a block is a 256 byte allocation unit on disk – since blocks are stored as linked lists there are only 254 bytes of payload ) , and both are of the “ PRG ” type .
Encoding of Commodore BASIC Programs
The floppy was aware of the encoding that Commodore BASIC ( a derivative of Microsoft BASIC for 6502 ) used and prepared the directory listing in that way .
A BASIC program in memory is a linked list of lines .
Every line starts with a 2 - byte pointer to the next line .
A 0 - pointer marks the end of the program .
The next two bytes are the line number , followed by the zero- terminated encoded line contents .
The LIST command decodes a BASIC program in memory by following the linked list from the start of BASIC RAM .
It prints the line number , a space , and the line contents .
These contents have BASIC keywords encoded as 1 - byte tokens starting at 0x80 .
Character below 0x80 are printed verbatim .
Here is what 10 PRINT" HELLO WORLD ! " would look like :
0801 0E 08 - next line starts at 0x080E 0803 0A 00 - line number 10 0805 99 - token for PRINT 0806 " HELLO ! " - ASCII text of line 080D 00 - end of line 080E 00 00 - end of program
The example directory listing from above would be encoded by the floppy like this :
0801 21 08 - next line starts at 0x0821 0803 00 00 - line number 0 0805 '" TEST DISK " 23 2A ' 0820 00 - end of line 0821 21 08 - next line starts at 0x0821 0823 14 00 - line number 20 0825 ' " FOO " PRG ' 0840 00 - end of line [...]
A couple of things are interesting here :
The line with the disk name and the ID is actually printed in inverted letters , which is done by having the “ revert ” character code as the first character of the first line , i.e. the floppy makes the assumption that the computer understands this convention .
BASIC will print the file sizes as variable - with line numbers , so the floppy adds extra spaces to the beginning of the line contents to have all file names aligned .
The floppy needs to populate the next line pointers for the linked list .
The Link Pointer
The obvious question here is :
How can the floppy know where in the computer ’s memory the BASIC program will live ?
The answer is :
It does n’t .
The BASIC interpreter supports having its program anywhere in memory , and loading programs that were saved from other locations on memory – or possibly other Microsoft BASIC compatible computers with a different memory layout .
The VIC - 20 had BASIC RAM at 0x0401 , the C64 at 0x0801 and the C128 at 0x1C01 .
Therefore , BASIC “ rebinds ” a program on load , searching for the zero- terminator of the lines and filling the ( redundant ) link pointers .
The floppy therefore only has to send non-zero values as the link pointers for BASIC to accept the directory listing as a program .
In fact , a 1541 sends the directory with a 0x0401 - base , which would be valid on a VIC - 20 .
The reason for this is that the 1541 is only a 1540 with minor timing fixes for C64 support , and the 1540 is the floppy drive that was designed for the VIC - 20 .
Therefore , if you do LOAD " $ " , 8,1 on a C64 , the extra “ , 1 ” will be interpreted by the KERNAL LOAD code to load the file at its original address ( as opposed to the beginning of BASIC RAM ) , and since there is screen RAM at 0x0400 on the C64 , garbage will appear on the screen , because the character encoding of screen ram is incompatible with BASIC character encoding .
Directory Code in 61 Bytes
There are two problems with this “ directory listing is a BASIC program ” hack : Listing the directory overwrites a BASIC program in RAM , and listing the directory from inside an application is non-trivial .
Therefore , many many implementations to show a directory listing exist on the C64 – and I want to present my own one here , which is , to my knowledge , the shortest existing ( and maybe shorted possible ? ) version .
It is based on a 70 byte version published in “ 64 ’er Magazin ” some time in the 80s , and I managed to get it down to 61 bytes .
, C000 : A9 01 LDA # $ 01 ; filename length , C002 : AA TAX , C003 : A0 E8 LDY # $ E8 ; there is a " $ " at $ E801 in ROM , C005 : 20 BD FF JSR $ FFBD ; set filename , C008 : A9 60 LDA # $ 60 , C00A : 85 B9 STA $ B9 ; set secondary address , C00C : 20 D5 F3 JSR $ F3D5 ; OPEN ( IEC bus version ) , C00F : 20 19 F2 JSR $ F219 ; set default input device , C012 : A0 04 LDY # $ 04 ; skip 4 bytes ( load address and link pointer ) , C014 : 20 13 EE JSR $ EE13 ; read byte , C017 : 88 DEY , C018 : D0 FA BNE $ C014 ; loop , C01A : A5 90 LDA $ 90 , C01C : D0 19 BNE $ C037 ; check end of file , C01E : 20 13 EE JSR $ EE13 ; read byte ( block count low ) , C021 : AA TAX , C022 : 20 13 EE JSR $ EE13 ; read byte ( block count high ) , C025 : 20 CD BD JSR $ BDCD ; print 16 bit integer , C028 : 20 13 EE JSR $ EE13 ; read character , C02B : 20 D2 FF JSR $ FFD2 ; print character to stdout , C02E : D0 F8 BNE $ C028 ; loop until zero , C030 : 20 D7 AA JSR $ AAD7 ; print carriage return character , C033 : A0 02 LDY # $ 02 , C035 : D0 DD BNE $ C014 ; skip 2 bytes next time ( link pointer ) , C037 : 20 42 F6 JSR $ F642 ; CLOSE , C03A : 4C F3 F6 JMP $ F6F3 ; reset default input device
( There is a similar implementation here . )

Gary Rea Articles , Constitution , FEMA , Government , NWO , S&PP / NAU , Social Engineering FEMA National Level Exercise 2009 , FEMA Region VI , foreign troops on U.S. soil , martial law drills
According to a page on FEMA ’s own website , they will be holding a “ National Level Exercise ” from July 27th through July 31st , 2009 .
What is significant about this “ exercise ” is that it will be the first that is regional in scope , encompassing all of FEMA Region VI ( Arkansas , Louisiana , New Mexcio , Oklahoma and Texas ) , and , even more significant is that it will also be the first time in our history that troops from foreign countries will be involved in policing American citizens on U.S. soil .
Those countries participating will be Australia , Canada , Mexico and the UK .
This will be the first time since 1814 ( the end of the War of 1812 ) that armed British troops have been on American soil menacing Americans .
The last time the bastards were here , they burned our national capitol building .
The stated objectives of this exercise are , as is typical of our government in recent years , vaguely worded :
* Intelligence / Information Sharing and Dissemination
* Counter - Terrorism Investigation and Law Enforcement
* Air , Border and Maritime Security
* Critical Infrastructure Protection
* Public and Private Sector Alert / Notification and Security Advisories
* International Coordination
So , in other words , they will be spying on us , imposing illegal and unconstitutional “ law enforcement ” upon us , shutting down access to air , sea and land travel , closing down access to bridges , roads and highways , enlisting the aid of the Infraguard private sector Stazi force against us , and “ coordinating ” all this with assistance from other nations that have no business being involved in U.S. internal affairs .
FEMA states that this drill will be “ White House directed ” and “ congressionally mandated . ”
Of course , as many of us know , that really means it ’s being mandated by Bilderberg , the CFR , the Trilateral Commission and the international banking cartel that is behind all of these organizations .
Of course , all of this is being done in the name of “ fighting terrorism , ” and the drill will supposedly begin somewhere outside the U.S. ( I ’m guessing Mexico ) , then move into the U.S.
It will involve supposed “ terrorist attacks ” that will then become a threat to the U.S .
On September 11 , 2001 , the Department of Defense was running military “ drills ” concurrently with the “ attacks ” on New York and Washington , D.C. and , as many researchers have pointed out , these drills were used to achieve two things : first , to mask the real attacks that the drills were simulating and , secondly , to send our fighter jets to locations far away from the areas being attacked , thus facilitating the attacks .
I believe this FEMA drill may be something similar .
Actually , I believe it may be one of three things :
1 . The beginning of a martial law take - over , focusing on the region where they have determined they will have the most resistance first .
2 . A drill / exercise , as FEMA claims , to test the waters for a full blown nationwide martial law take - over and to acclimate the public to the next phase of conditioning : i.e. , having armed foreign troops blatantly on U.S. soil , violating U.S. citizens ’ rights .
3 . A drill / exercise designed to see if they can get us to revolt , in which case , they will go from drill mode to the real thing immediately .
As a life - long resident of Oklahoma , I am debating whether to go somewhere outside of FEMA Region VI for the four days of this drill , or to stay put and make sure my shotgun is locked and loaded .
Given possibility number three , I ’m thinking maybe a short vacation might be in order .

( CNN ) -- Despite two injections of anesthetic , Amy Anderson felt like her dentist was jamming rods into her tooth during a root canal .
She writhed in pain as her infected tooth was hollowed with a drill , its nerve amputated , and then sealed .
Studies say redheads avoid dental care after having painful experiences and may require more anesthetics .
" I knew this time something was wrong .
I could feel my lips , " said the Syracuse , New York , resident , who told her dentist the drugs were n't working .
Her doctor kept assuring her she had given her a proper dose and said : " I 'm almost done . "
" I was hurting so bad , I was hitting myself in the stomach , " said Anderson , a redhead .
" I almost wanted to hit her . "
Studies have indicated that redheads may be more sensitive to pain and may need more anesthetics to numb them .
New research published in this month 's Journal of American Dental Association found that painful experiences at the dentist might cause more anxiety for men and women with red hair , who were twice as likely to avoid dental care than people with dark hair .
" Redheads are sensitive to pain , " said Dr. Daniel Sessler , an Outcomes Research Department chair at The Cleveland Clinic , in Cleveland , Ohio , who is one of the authors .
" They require more generalized anesthesia , localized anesthesia .
The conventional doses fail .
They have bad experiences at the dentist and because of the bad experiences , they could avoid dental care . "
Sessler , an anesthesiologist , began studying redheads ' sensitivity to pain after hearing chatter from colleagues .
" The persistent rumor in the anesthesia community was that redheads were difficult to anesthetize , " Sessler said .
" They did n't go under , had a lot of pain , did n't respond well to anesthesia .
Urban legends usually do n't start studies , but it was such an intriguing observation . "
This led to two studies .
In 2004 , research showed that people with red hair need 20 percent more general anesthesia than blonds and brunettes .
A 2005 study indicated that redheads are more sensitive to thermal pain and are more resistant to the effects of local anesthesia .
Researchers believe variants of the melanocortin - 1 receptor gene play a role .
This MC1R gene produces melanin , which gives skin , hair and eyes their color .
While blond , brown and black - haired people produce melanin , those with red hair have a mutation of this receptor .
It produces a different coloring called pheomelanin , which results in freckles , fair skin and ginger hair .
About 5 percent of whites are estimated to have these characteristics .
While the relationship between MC1R and pain sensitivity is not entirely understood , researchers have found MC1R receptors in the brain and some of them are known to influence pain sensitivity .
Non-redheads can also carry a variant of the MC1R gene .
In this dental study that had 144 participants , about a quarter of the non-redheads had variants of the MC1R gene .
These people also experienced heightened anxiety and avoided dental care compared with others who did not have the variant .
There is no commercial test available for variations of the MC1R gene .
After Sessler and his colleagues published the first studies about redheads and pain susceptibility , he received nearly 100 e-mails from redheads around the country who complained of terrible experiences at the dentist 's office .
Dr. Catherine Binkley , an associate professor at the University of Louisville 's School of Dentistry , in Kentucky , also observed the same phenomenon in her 25 years of practice .
Her redheaded patients seemed " anxious and did n't get numb .
It 's a difficult experience for them , " said Binkley , one of the study 's authors .
But this does n't seem to affect all people with red hair .
" I have a [ redheaded ] hygienist that I have to numb up a lot more than normal , " said Dr. Peter Vanstrom , an Atlanta , Georgia , dentist .
" She 's very sensitive .
I have another redheaded patient who is tough as nails , but his father is extremely difficult to numb . "
Binkley said the best tip for dentists is to " pay more attention , evaluate everyone for dental anxiety , and ask them about previous experiences . "
" If you know someone 's anxious , do different things , " she said .
" Make sure they 're numb before you start working on them . "
Patients who 've had bad experiences with pain should inform their dentists .
The next phase of research is to evaluate whether more anesthesia is needed for people with red hair and those with variants of the MCR1 gene for dental procedures .
The authors say an unpleasant incident -- much like the one Anderson had this January -- could cause patients to postpone dental care and exacerbate any problems they might have .
Anderson got a root canal because she dreaded the dentist after a bad experience of getting cavity fillings .
Inevitably , Anderson has to return to her dentist to follow up on her root canal and this fills her with apprehension .
" I have wicked dread of the dentist , " she said .
" I was up for two hours in the middle of the night because of the dentist . "

With any more spinning we would be in a financial carousel .
New home sales data was released on Monday and showed a “ whopping ” increase in sales .
This is the primary headline on all mainstream reports .
Little is mentioned that the median price of a new home fell to $ 206,200 in June from $ 219,000 in May ( small caveat ) .
A drop of over $ 13,000 in one month apparently is not important enough to discuss .
This is pure economics with prices falling you will expect new home sales to increase especially in the spring and summer months which are normally stronger .
So even if we may be reaching a bottom nationwide in terms of months of inventory the coming wave of Alt - A and option ARM toxic waste will guarantee that we have years of pricing pressure on the downside .
In the last 2 weeks , the S&P 500 has rallied by over 11 percent .
What would constitute an above average year in terms of gains was accomplished in two weeks .
Not because of spectacular earnings but because people want to believe in the financial idols of Wall Street .
Mixed earnings is not reason enough for this massive rally but Wall Street as you may have noticed does not reflect main street reality .
Let us however focus on housing .
The increase in sales is good but is largely being driven by massive price discounts and foreclosures which dominate in many markets including California :
A couple of things we should highlight .
Existing home sales make up the bulk of sales at any given point .
Existing home sales look like they have stabilized but keep in mind that 30 to 40 percent of all homes sold for the past few months have been foreclosure resales ( in California the number is more like 40 to 50 percent ) .
So prices have been falling like a lead balloon and we have yet to experience the Alt - A and option ARM hit that will take down more prime locations in areas in California but also in places like Florida .
The next thing to understand is historical context .
The jump in new home sales is largely a price driven jump based on tax incentives and a deep cut in prices .
Even with that , you can see from the chart above that the jump merely highlights that we are n’t starring into the abyss .
Yet this increase does not mean happy days are around the corner .
It is simply a reflection that housing prices are n’t going to fall to zero yet many market observers somehow think we are back on solid ground .
What about rising unemployment ?
Over $ 3 trillion in commercial real estate debt ?
State budget deficits ?
All minor trifles to the Wall Street crowd .
You have many states like California with budget deficits that are being patched up for the short - term but will only solve the issues on a temporary basis .
The headline on Monday should read :
“ New home sales increase because of steep price cuts . ”
But that would be honest reporting .
There is nothing more distressing to the housing market than foreclosures .
And nationwide foreclosures are still in record territory :
What we are seeing is foreclosures keeping a lid on any sort of pricing power on the upside .
Foreclosures are the kryptonite to any housing recovery .
And until the foreclosure situation stabilizes , it is much too premature to call a housing bottom especially in a state like California .
As we have highlighted , the foreclosures are now starting to hit higher priced homes in more prime locations like :
Santa Monica , Culver City , Palms , Rancho Park
And much of this has to do with the Alt - A and option ARM wave that is now striking .
Let us first take an overall look at the California housing market :
First , 76 percent of owner - occupied homes have a mortgage .
This is higher than national data which comes in at 68 percent .
Also , there is n’t a large amount of newly built homes in the state .
In many of the prime areas homes are multiple decades old ; in some cases homes were built prior to the Great Depression .
So the dynamics of the California housing market are unique .
But what is also important is to look at the makeup of those 5,381,874 mortgages .
Let us dig deeper :
Subprime loans still active in CA : 345,505
Average balance : $ 321,745
Alt - A loans still active in CA : 632,215
Average balance : $ 443,223
Total toxic mortgages still active : 977,720
This is where you should take pause .
18 percent of all current mortgages in California are toxic waste or near toxic waste .
That is a gigantic number .
This is n’t including the many jumbo “ prime ” mortgages out in the market which are equally at risk .
So when we talk about the Alt - A and option ARM tsunami this is what we are talking about .
The only place you will find a new home in California for $ 200,000 is out in the Inland Empire or Central Valley but those areas unfortunately are facing massive economic problems .
The state itself is in tatters but these areas are reeling .
That is the new home market for California and it is a small subset .
And the home vacancy rate for California is still trending higher :
The vacancy rate is the highest it ’s ever been for California since data was first tracked starting in 1985 .
So that trend is unmistakable .
This is in large part due to the massive amount of foreclosures the state is seeing ( or not seeing depending on how lenders are hoarding inventory ) .
Either way , the data is rather telling .
California home prices will be falling for mid to upper priced regions in the upcoming months .
But do n’t expect to read that in the headlines .

Edinburgh psych researcher Richard Wiseman and team left a load of wallets lying around with various contents , trying to see if there was a correlation between , say , baby pictures or cards indicating charitable giving and the rate at which wallets are returned .
It turns out that people in Edinburgh ( and maybe everyone ) have a high likelihood of returning wallets with baby pictures , but are much less likely to return the wallets of charitable givers :
The baby photograph wallets had the highest return rate , with 88 per cent of the 40 being sent back .
Next came the puppy , the family and the elderly couple , with 53 per cent , 48 and 28 respectively .
At 20 per cent and 15 , the charity card and control wallets had the lowest return rates .
Overall , 42 per cent of the wallets were posted back — more than the team had anticipated .
" We were amazed by the high percentage of wallets that came back , " said Dr Wiseman .
Scientists have also found evidence for a baby instinct in brain scanning experiments .
A recent study at the University of Oxford examined how people responded when they were shown photographs of baby or adult faces .

Wikipedia bans Church of Scientology
Added by viorel on Jun 04 , 2009 | Visited by 5139 | Voted by 77 persons
Wikipedia decided to make an unprecedented move to block self - serving edits .
The supreme court of the online encyclopedia recently banned contributions from all IP addresses that are owned by the representatives of the Church of Scientology as well as all of its associates .
It is worth mentioning that this was Wikipedia\ 's longest - running case in its entire history .
The arbitration Committee of the online encyclopedia voted 10 to 0 , with one abstaining , agreeing on the ban , which took effect straight away .
To note that the website , which is listed in the top ten most popular sites on the Internet , claims to be \ " the free encyclopedia anyone can edit , \ " though its administrators regularly ban some individual users for abuse of the site\'s terms of use .
It is for the first time that Wikipedia completely blocked the IPs of such a large organization as the Church of Scientology .
The reason for the move was the organization \'s attempts to promote its own agenda using the online encyclopedia .
According to the Wikipowersthatbe : \ " the use of the encyclopedia to advance personal agendas - such as advocacy or propaganda and philosophical , ideological or religious dispute - or to publish or promote original research is prohibited\ " .
The truth is that admins at Wikipedia ban those who deceive an extreme conflict of interest , but because the so - called Wikifiddlers usually hide their identity with the help of open proxies , their IPs can be banned as a move of defense .
Shortly after the ruling of the Wikipedia Arbitration Committee , all IPs of the Church of Scientology were \" blocked as if they were open proxies\ " .
However , individual editors have the right to request a release from the ban .
The True Reasons
The administrators of Wikipedia gave evidence of their actions saying that a number of editors have been \" openly editing [ Scientology - related articles ] from Church of Scientology equipment and apparently coordinating their activities . \ "
A lot of news stories talked about the well - known WikiScanner and the editing of articles related to the Church of Scientology from Scientology IPs .
All the stories around Wikipedia\ 's move , made some administrators think that such actions are \ " damaging Wikipedia\ 's reputation for neutrality . \ "
One of the Wikipedia administrators said that monitoring edits from computers used by the Church of Scientology has been difficult due to the fact that countless editors use a few IPs and the address of each editor is continuously changing for an unknown reason .
Such actions make it difficult for administrators to determine if one editor is using several accounts on the online encyclopedia in order to game the site\'s system .
Surely these kinds of moves are prohibited in the Wikiland .
The decision of the Wikicourt was to ban only those Scientology IPs that referred to articles on Scientology .
However , in order to perform the ban , the administrators will have to \ " checkuser \ " editors , meaning they will have to identify their IP each time an edit is made , but even then it would be impossible to find out who is who .
One of the admins wrote in a comment that at the moment the only alternative is to block the IPs completely or checkuser every \' pro-Scientology \ ' editor on this subject .
However , the latter is less possible and could trigger a lot of debates .
The majority of editors under discussion edit only those articles that are linked to Scientology .
If to translate in the terms used at Wikipedia , these users are \ " single purpose accounts \ " .
The Methodology
There are people who consider that users who edit the articles related to Scientology are doing so without having given any order for the Church .
According to ex-member of Scientology \'s Office of Special Affairs , which is liable for \" directing and coordinating all legal matters affecting the Church\ " , the organization took specific steps in order to remove certain materials and criticism that are linked with the Church of Scientology .
Tory Christman mentioned that the people he worked together with , used to post everyday the whole day , using five different computers , five separate anonymous identities in order to disprove any facts from the Internet regarding the Church of Scientology .
He left the Church of Scientology in 2000 , prior to the birth of Wikipedia .
It is worth mentioning that it is the fourth Wikicourt case that is linked with Scientology .
The administrators from the online encyclopedia decided to ban not only Scientology IPs , but a host of anti-Scientology editors , who were editing certain subject related to the Church of Scientology .
Previously Wikipedia did not take such severe actions , but things change and Wikipedia is no exception .
The site\'s ruling body harshly bans at least the most evident examples of propaganda promotion .
The level of criticism around Wikipedia could raise but the online encyclopedia will keep its position as one of the most popular websites on the Internet with an increasing number of visitors reading and editing articles on a myriad of topics .
A proposed ban on climbing Uluru in Central Australia has sparked debate between tourists , traditional owners and political leaders .
A draft management plan for the Uluru - Kata Tjuta National Park was released today , recommending a ban for cultural and environmental reasons .
The plan could come into effect within 18 months , but must first go through a consultation process and be signed off by Federal Environment Minister Peter Garrett .
The Northern Territory 's Tourism Minister , Chris Burns , says the Territory Government does not back the proposal .
" We have never supported the full closure of the climb at Uluru and that remains our position , " he said .
But a traditional owner of Uluru , Vince Forrester , says he is is relieved a ban on climbing the iconic rock is one step closer to becoming a reality .
He says the rock is sacred to the local Aboriginal people and traditional owners have wanted the climb closed since the park was handed back to them in 1985 .
" You ca n't go climb on top of the Vatican , you can't go climb on top of the Buddhist temples and so on and so forth , " he said .
" Obviously you have to respect our religious attachment to the land too , so we 're saying please do not climb Uluru - we 've said it in all languages . "
Mr Forrester says tourism operators should not be concerned about the closure .
" The visitors will get more information by walking around the base of Uluru and getting told the stories which Aboriginal people are available to do , " he said .
Mixed response
The 346 - metre high rock is visited by about 350,000 people a year , about half of whom are from overseas .
More than 100,000 people climb the rock against the wishes of the traditional owners .
More than 35 deaths have been recorded on the climb , which can be steep , slippery and extremely hot .
The draft management plan , which is open to public comment for the next two months , notes that recent surveys show 98 per cent of people would not be put off visiting the area if they were not allowed to climb the rock .
But members of the public writing to ABC News Online have had a mixed reaction to the proposed climbing ban .
" This is a secular country .
Dictating access to a popular tourist destination based on religious beliefs is unacceptable , " wrote one , called Jim .
" By all means close the rock to climbers in adverse weather conditions , but to permanently close it would a denial of the rights of all Australians , " wrote Saint Mike .
" The decision to climb or not to climb should remain with the individual , not the park management ( white or black ) . "
" I understand the opposition to people climbing it .
But at this point , it is a pilgrimage to travel to Uluru and climb it .
I suggest that it is as important to Australia in general as it is to the traditional owners , and that should be considered , " said another , Si .
" It is not as if anyone built it .
It was always there .
Climb on it if you want .
It is like saying you can't swim in Sydney harbour or walk around the Grand Canyon , " wrote Ron Rat .
But others were more supportive of the ban .
" About time .
We would be horrified if people were allowed to climb all over our churches or sacred sites , " wrote Lilly .
" I think a ban would be great .
We should all respect others ' cultural and sacred areas , " agreed Jenny .
" I have climbed the rock , but would never attempt it again out of respect for the owners , " said one person , going by the nickname The Owl .
" When I view it now , it is similar , in a spiritual sense , to a church or mosque .
Walking around the base is the most respectful method of experiencing the monolith .
" Land rights is not about legal ownership , it 's a link with Mother Earth and our appreciation of the land .
We can all enjoy it now , without possible desecration . "
Tourists
Most of those who had already visited the rock said they had not climbed it , or if they had , they said they would not do so again .
" I have just visited this magnificent region - both Kata Tjuta and Uluru .
I loved it !
I did not climb Uluru nor did I wish to - it is far more beautiful and mystical from a distance , " wrote Anne-Marie .
" I 've been there , and the walk around the rock is rewarding , probably just as rewarding as the climb up , " agreed another .
" Our family has recently visited Uluru and gained an appreciation of this wonderful icon , " wrote John .
" We were delighted to take the walk around the rock and gain some understanding as to why ' the rock ' would have such cultural significance to the traditional owners .
" Uluru is far more impressive than I ever imagined .
It is an experience every Australian should have and not climbing the rock is part of the experience . "
But some who were planning to visit the national park said they would not be deterred from climbing the rock .
" I am a student in a rural area and I am expecting to go to Uluru next year - I want to be able to experience what other people have been allowed to !
Nature is beautiful , let us see its beauty ! " wrote a student .
" I would love to climb this spectacular part of our country .
I would like my children to see the view from the top , " wrote Barrie .
Two people said if the ban was imposed , they would not visit the national park .
Michael Owen 's Newcastle United career is not over just yet after a scan showed the England international has not suffered any serious damage to his groin .
The injury , while painful enough to keep Owen out of Newcastle 's costly 1 –0 home defeat by Fulham last weekend , is only a minor one and the manager , Alan Shearer , is hoping the club 's record signing , whose contract expires next month , will be fit enough to play against Aston Villa on Sunday .
Shearer said : " He had a scan on Monday and there is no serious injury so we 're hopeful he 'll be involved on Sunday . "
That appearance could still be Owen 's last in a black and white shirt .
Although the club will offer him a new contract if they avoid relegation , the Magpies need at least a point at Villa Park to have any chance of staying in the top flight .
Owen had been offered a £ 70,000 - a- week , four - year deal last December , but that was withdrawn in January when Owen postponed making a decision about his future until the end of the season .
We already pointed out this audio recording of the 911 call placed by the lone survivor of that botched home - invasion robbery carried out by Shawna Forde and her gang of Minutemen .
But further listening reveals a number of details about the crime .
It begins simply :
" Somebody just came in and shot my daughter and my husband . "
The dispatcher begins asking questions and obviously dispatches deputies to respond .
As she 's asking about the killers , the victim cries out :
" They 're coming back in !
They 're coming back in ! "
An exchange of gunfire ensues .
When the woman comes back on the line , she explains :
" They told us that somebody had , um , escaped jail or something and they wanted to come in and look at my house or something .
And they just shot my husband .
And they shot my daughter and they shot me . " " ...
Oh my God , I can't believe they killed my family . "
She explains that the killers walked up cold - bloodedly to her daughter , 9 - year - old Brisenia Flores , as she cowered and cried , and shot her two or three times anyway .
Later in the call she tells the dispatcher that the shooting began when her husband became suspicious of the invaders and asked them about their guns .
We also learn that the shooters were two men -- both tall , one white with a painted face , the other Latino -- and a " shorter fat woman . "
That very much describes the gang that was arrested this week .
Scott North and Jackson Holz have more details on the tape .
Vivir Latino points out that there 's been a disturbing theme in some of the coverage -- suggesting that perhaps the family somehow had it coming :
Something that tends to happen when the media covers these types of horrors , is double victimization .
In an effort to answer the question why , subtleties , like how immigration has been racialized and how Latinos , painted as immigrants , are criminalized and dehumanized , get swept under the rug .
It certainly does raise the question :
Why are the media paying so little attention to this story ?
Are they still wedded to their favorite narrative , that the Minutemen are just some big " neighborhood watch " ?
As we said , that 's some neighborhood watch .
I guess they 're too busy covering that all - important David Letterman protest .
Official results were expected on Monday at noon here .
Three groups of election monitors have been deployed , including former President Carter ’s organization .
But even before the race began , it was marred by charges of unprecedented vote buying .
In the most contested districts , there were reports of votes being bought for as much as $ 2,000 , and thousands of expatriates received all - expense - paid trips to Lebanon to vote .
In one district , an ambulance brought hospital patients to the polls to cast ballots .
Lebanon has long been seen as a proxy battlefield for regional and global interests , and so foreign powers from Washington to Tehran have paid close attention .
But its politics are also intensely local , with power divided among sect leaders who jealously guard their interests .
On one side is the March 14 coalition , which holds the majority bloc and is led by the Sunni Muslim Future Movement of Saad Hariri , whose father ’s assassination in 2005 led to huge protests that forced Syria to withdraw its troops from Lebanon .
On the other side is the March 8 coalition , whose two main members are Hezbollah and the Christian party of Mr. Aoun , the Free Patriotic Movement .
If Hezbollah ’s alliance had emerged victorious , it would have represented another step in the evolution of a once parochial Shiite militia that started as a guerrilla force fighting Israeli occupation of the south into a national institution that slowly has defined the identity of the state .
Hezbollah has said that it would work to build what it called a “ culture of resistance , ” and define the enemy of Lebanon as Israel and the United States .
It also said it would make it a high priority to build a strong national military .
Instead , it is the March 14 group that appears to find itself having won greater legitimacy .
When Mr. Hariri ’s alliance first won in 2005 , it did so as part of an alliance with Hezbollah .
The two camps broke ties shortly after the election and for years since Hezbollah said that March 14 would not have had the majority if not for its help , and therefore represented an illegitimate government .
I screwed up .
Big time .
Not just with Adblock Plus users but with the Mozilla community at large .
I did something extremely wrong , which I will regret forever .
I abused the power and wasted the enormous trust capital gained by the NoScript add - on through the years to prevent Adblock Plus from blocking stuff on four internet domains of mine , without asking an explicit preemptive user consent .
This is absolutely inexcusable .
Something I would never conceive again for the life of me .
Please let me apologize first , then briefly explain what happened from a slightly different point of view than Wladimir Palant 's , then apologize again .
You may ask why it took me so long to post something about the infamous Adblock Plus whitelisting incident here .
I 've been quite busy all Friday night up to 11 AM of Saturday , apologizing with NoScript users one by one through facts , by hurrying out the 1.9.2.6 update which automatically removes any Adblock Plus related configuration with no questions asked .
Then , after a couple hours of sleeping , I tried to answer some questions left open in the public forum thread where discussion about my admittedly stealthy and borderline reaction to EasyList 's attack on my web sites had been politely going on and leading to an acceptable solution , before Wladimir decided to invite Reddit , Slashdot and Digg to the party .
Furthermore I 'm still coping with a huge backlog of email messages : I 've never left a NoScript - related email unanswered , and the fact some are ( legitimately ) less kind than usual now is not a good reason to give up .
Preamble
The development of NoScript is sustained both by donations and advertisements published on a few related web sites in four domains ( noscript.net , flashgot.net , informaction.com and hackademix.net ) .
I 've never tried to hide the latter revenue stream , as you can see in this very old FAQ about NoScript 's default whitelist , which Wladimir loves to rehash every time he has a chance to depict me as a hypocrite driven by greed .
What I really think is that while ads are important to support NoScript development , users ' ability to block anything displeasing them is much more important .
Deciding what is their prerogative .
Adblock Plus is meant to block ads , but it does n't block anything by default .
In facts , according to its own author , it 's meant to block obnoxious ads , implying it 's up to users to choose which ads are acceptable and which deserve to be annihilated .
I could n't agree more with this " user choice is the king " principle , even though I recently abdicated to it myself by doing the odious thing we 're talking about here .
When users install Adblock Plus , though , they are encouraged at subscribing so called filtersets , which choose for them what 's good and what 's bad .
EasyList is the most popular of these filterset subscriptions .
When something is blocked by a filterset like EasyList , stuff just disappears from the page without notice .
There 's a " blockable items panel " you can open to check what 's going on , but you never get any notification .
This is still good as long as either what disappears has been a choice of yours , or the filter subscription did a perfect job guessing what can interest you and what cannot .
Otherwise you do n't even get to know something is missing and why .
For some time my sites used a publicly known Adblock Plus bug to work - around EasyList 's generic filters against Adsense and display their Google Ads boxes , even though Adblock Plus users could still easily block them if they wished to by adding their own custom filter .
Furthermore , NoScript users could even more easily remove those ads all at once by just forbidding googlesyndication.com .
In other words , this " trick " , as Wladimir calls it , put the choice back in users ' hands .
About 2 weeks ago Wladimir decided this had been going on long enough : the Google boxes supporting NoScript had to be shut down for good .
So , rather than fixing his Adblock Plus bug , he asked Ares2 ( the new Easylist maintainer , after Rick752 passed away ) to nuke them by specifically targeting NoScript sites .
When I noticed this , I thought it was Ares2's own initiative ( new person , new mentality ) , but Wladimir finally clarified this point in his Friday 's post :
I suggested that EasyList should be extended by a filter to block ads specifically on NoScriptâ€™s domains .
This finally happened two weeks ago .
All this time I could n't imagine that he had been behind Ares2 from the start , otherwise I would have just asked Wladimir why he was sniping my sites , rather than coding a more reliable Adblock Plus version .
Instead I began tracking EasyList changes and counterreacting .
Of course Ares2 did n't stop , nor I did , so we engaged in an escalation through more than 30 EasyList updates ( even 4 - 5 per day ) specifically aimed at my sites , with filters like these ( yes , stacked all together ) :
/flashgot.net/*$script,subdocument,xmlhttprequest
/hackademix.net /*$ script
/noscript.net/*$script,subdocument,xmlhttprequest
/oss.informaction.com /*
informaction.com/*$script,subdocument,xmlhttprequest,domain=flashgot.net|noscript.net|software.informaction.com
flashgot.net #*( href*=informaction ) ( href*=com ) ( href * = %62 )
flashgot.net #*( href*=informaction ) ( href*=com ) ( href*=flashgot )
flashgot.net #*( href*=oss ) ( href*=informaction ) ( href*=com )
flashgot.net#ul(class=tla )
noscript.net #*( href*=informaction ) ( href*=com ) ( href * = %62 )
noscript.net #*( href*=informaction ) ( href*=com ) ( href*=noscript )
noscript.net #*( href*=oss ) ( href*=informaction ) ( href*=com )
If you 've got some familiarity with Adblock Plus filters , you 'll notice any standard web technology beyond basic HTML / CSS ( scripting , frames , AJAX ) was completely disabled .
They got to the point where users could no longer even see the regular links to install NoScript or FlashGot .
Crossing the Dirty Line
As you can imagine I was quite pissed off then .
Blocking my ads was one thing ( it 's EasyList 's job , after all -- I was just surprised of being so popular to deserve such a dedicated treatment ) , but disabling any dynamic feature and destroying essential site functionality such as install and development build links was a different story .
Mind you , I 'm not trying to justify my actions here .
They are unjustifiable , and anger is hardly a justification for anything , but since I 've been accused of having acted out of pure greed I need to clarify that it was not my prevalent feeling at all , even though I wo n't hide that EasyList 's crusade had actually cut the NoScript development funding by a substantial amount .
So I had this crazy idea of retaliating against EasyList " from the inside " , and in my blindness I did not grasp that I was really retaliating against my own users and the Mozilla community at large .
Even worse , my hacker attitude led me to dig directly in the low level Adblock Plus internals where filters are enforced , assuming there was no " interesting " API to hook ( more on this later ) .
Therefore , while I was about to release a long awaited feature ( bookmark - based synchronization ) , I took 10 minutes to add a small piece of code ( mrd.js ) which implemented my own " hand made " whitelist , working around those filters targeted to my sites but leaving the Adblock Plus functionality otherwise intact .
I included also an about : config preference ( noscript.mrd ) to deactivate this " feature " : it was meant for an user interface to follow up , but I 've been foolish enough to defer its implementation and perform a stealthy " test drive " instead , while trying to figure out the best way to go public afterward .
When I pushed the " release " button , my soul was already damned .
Digression 1 : AMO
Some of the thousands who commented on this issue so far argued that AMO should have reviewed the code or at least test the package before releasing it to the public .
This did not happen , and I want to clarify it 's not AMO 's fault .
Nobody from AMO even saw the release passing by , because the extension was considered " trusted " , i.e. not needing any approval for exiting the so called " Sandbox " .
This kind of " trust " is not related to malware , but to quality assurance : if an extension demonstrates to be tested enough ( e.g. because it has already many beta testers ) it gets approved automatically , alleviating AMO editors ' huge workload .
Either way , with my insanity I betrayed this " trust " as well and put AMO in an awkward position .
I apologize with to the AMO staff people , whose hard and continuous work constantly improves the Mozilla ecosystem , and with all the other add - on developers : now I realize that the general security of the Mozilla extensibility system is being questioned because of this incident .
Believe me : I did n't even considered such a fallout as a remote risk .
I 've been too much enraged and stupid to think about all these consequences .
Please forgive me .
Digression 2 : Obfuscated (!)
Wladimir wrote :
When I investigated this issue I couldnâ€™t believe my eyes .
NoScript was extended by a piece of obfuscated (! ) code to specifically target Adblock Plus and disable parts of its functionality .
There are several parts of his post and comments who would need an accurate rebuttal , either because overstretched , subtly smearing , spreading FUD or just plainly false .
But this post is about my sins , repent and begging forgiveness , so that will have to wait .
However the " obfuscation " argument deserves to be treated right now , because it 's very pertinent to the facts we 're discussing here and hinting about the real nature and extent of my intentions ( while no way this is meant to mitigate the judgment on my actions ) .
I already answered in the forum to direct questions about this so called obfuscation , but let me summarize here .
While writing readable code may not be my primary skill , the code Wladimir analyzed was hardly obfuscated , not at least in the traditional computer - related meaning of " making it unreadable to fellow coders " : in facts it 's even nicely indented , and identifiers ( function and variable names ) are concise but yet meaningful enough .
Some data had been actually made harder to read ( i.e. ABP 's id and the CSS rules template for element unhiding ) even though by a very simple and recognizable method ( unicode hex encoding ) , not to target code reviewers ( who would understand it at first spot , like Wladimir did ) or users ( who would not read it anyway ) : the quite self - evident recipients of this " obfuscation " were EasyList maintainers and Ares2 specifically .
My ( ingenuous and stupid ) intent was checking how the system worked " live " but far from his eyes , and in the meanwhile searching for the best way to turn it into a public " feature " , e.g. by building an user interface around the noscript.mrd preference .
NoScript's Black Friday
The rest of this story is quite well known and documented : while I was on a disconnected weekend trip , I took some time looking more broadly at Adblock Plus code , and I slapped my head when I found a public API meant to allow just that after all : adding external filtersets from another extension ( it was meant for Filterset . G , apparently ) and making them visible and easily manageable from Adblock Plus ' own user interface .
So when Wladimir contacted me with a friendly mail about my alleged malware , I offered using that API as a quick solution .
He answered that it was OK by principle , but since NoScript was a security add - on users should have been asked and a prominent disclaimer about this " feature " be added on the AMO description .
Since I had no problem with giving users all the information in the open , included detailed removal instructions ( two clicks ) , but was concerned about the annoyance of a blocking nag box on startup , I replied
I 'll inform users about the added whitelist filter both in the AMO description and on the landing release notes page [ automatically shown after updates ] , where I 'll provide them also with instructions to remove it .
He did not answer anymore , so I assumed he had no objections .
And this was my second big mistake .
This " open " approach went in a beta ( 1.9.2.3 ) and then in a stable release ( 1.9.2.4 ) .
But almost immediately after releasing it , I realized that this was not enough and expressed my intention to add to NoScript an explicit startup prompt asking once forever if user wanted to keep / install or permanently remove ( also retroactively ) the filterlist .
This was announced on friday morning ( Italy time ) , and was planned to be done in 24 - 36 hours ( on Saturday ) , but unfortunately 10 hours later was already too late .
The email from an AMO representative , suggesting to add an opt - in dialog in the next version , found me ( at 3 AM local time ) already working like a night owl to hurry out NoScript 1.9.2.5 which implemented it retroactively ( more than what AMO was actually asking for ) .
At 7.05 AM I finally announced to him 1.9.2.5 was in the AMO Sandbox , waiting for approval .
Unfortunately in the meantime too much stuff had already hit the proverbial fan , so he informed me that adding the opt - in dialog was not enough anymore ( something I had been realizing myself while I was coding and my inbox kept growing with a bad smell ) :
We 've given this some thought and came up with the following policy after internal discussion as well as discussion with the community : http://blog.mozilla.com/addons/2009/05/01/no-surprises/
From what we understand of your filterset install , your filter change is unrelated to the functionality of your add - on and will be rejected .
I 'm asking you to remove this functionality and retain the retroactive box .
You can include a link to the filterset on your first run page but as far as in -extension functionality , we wo n't allow this on AMO .
Please let me know your thoughts .
At that point my answer was immediate and almost relieved , because 1.9.2.5 was already available on my site , but 1.9.2.6 ( with much more drastic cleanup measures ) was already in my mind as the most honorable offer to make my users as a sign of repent :
I 'm OK with removing the functionality .
If you do n't mind , could you explain what exactly you mean by " retaining the retroactive box " ?
Could I just delete the filterset on startup , or I need to do something else ?
Sorry to waste your time , but I 'd want to be sure before creating other useless code at 7:34 AM after having spent all the night on this issue ( for my fault , of course ) .
Many thanks !
After receiving an enthusiastic OK on this resolution , I wrote the apology that every NoScript user ( even those who did n't know about all this mess yet and / or had no Adblock Plus installed ) was meant to read on automatic update page , dared a ( painful ) look at Slashdot , Reddit , Digg , NoScript 's AMO page and my own forums , had a much needed shower , kissed my spouse and my child and finally headed to bed ( about at 11 AM ) to sleep a couple of hours .
Saturday Night Fever
When I woke up , the sky was still falling ( especially on AMO , where NoScript had received more ratings than in 4 full years of life ) .
But I also noticed some unexpectedly encouraging email was coming in and , incredibly , donations were skyrocketing .
Maybe the sincerity of my sorrow for this incident was arriving to someone .
So I started multitasking between the forum and this very writing , and here we are .
Obviously there are still many things to do , but I desperately hope abandoning NoScript development is not among them .
One is this blog post , which I should finally be able to publish in minutes .
Another is setting up a publicly accessible code repository for my extensions , something I procrastinated too long but suddenly became a top openness priority .
Other ways to try regaining NoScript 's user base 's trust will probably come to my mind later , and any suggestion is welcome .
But back to the main topic of this post .
I beg you to accept my most sincere apologies and believe in my shame and contrition .
I know I 've done something horrible , creating a scandal like the Mozilla community never had faced before and betraying the trust of many , many people .
Please help me to repair the damage I 've caused with my errors .
Three teenagers have been arrested after a drug - sniffing dog uncovered more than half - a - ton of marijuana beneath the deck of their 22 - foot boat when it docked at San Diego 's Shelter Island , according to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection .
The three were returning Saturday from Mexico when agents made a routine inspection .
The three told agents they had been on a fishing trip off Ensenada .
Beneath the deck , agents found 277 packages of pot , weighing 1,060 pounds and worth about $ 636,000 , officials said .
The boat was seized and the teens _ two men , one woman _ were turned over to authorities for possible prosecution .

No one has a real interest in stamping it out .
The politicians are on the take .
The Taliban use drugs money to finance their operations .
American , British and other Nato forces have come to realise that eradication programmes risk deepening local poverty and losing the very " hearts and minds " they are there to win .
With the Taliban resurgent , and with British casualties mounting , and with more illegal opium being grown than ever before , it is time to look again at one obvious solution .
Surely we should be pursuing the argument first proposed three years ago by the Senlis council : to see if we can work with Afghan villages and farmers to develop a legitimate medical market for their crops .
We have an ageing Western population ; we are making infinite advances in fighting disease and in prolonging life .
We are therefore going to be in need of ever more painkilling drugs .
The people of Afghanistan have shown they can grow those drugs in quantity .
Surely we should be helping them to turn those poppies into medicine .
To put it at its bluntest : why are we paying our farmers to grow poppies in Oxfordshire , and paying our soldiers to destroy them in Afghanistan ?
Be in no doubt that what British troops are doing in Helmand is heroic , and it is very far from futile .
If Nato forces pulled out , the Taliban would probably overrun Kabul in three weeks , with catastrophic consequences for Pakistan and for global stability .
That is why we need them there , and that is why they deserve to be properly armed and protected .
That is why they need better domestic support than the bizarre fence - sitting of the Liberal Democrats , who simultaneously claim to be in favour of the Helmand operation while cunningly playing to their anti-war constituency by criticising its handling .
Nick Clegg either believes we should pull out , or else that the operation needs more men and material .
He should have the guts to say one or the other , and stop faffing around .

OTTAWA — Larry O’Brien ’s trial will resume July 6 after Justice Douglas Cunningham rejected a defence application to throw out the influence - peddling charges against the Ottawa mayor .
In a decision read to a packed courtroom Friday , Cunningham affirmed that O’Brien ’s alleged conduct falls within the scope of the two Criminal Code sections under which he has been charged .
By doing so , he may have , for the first time , put some judicial definition to what constitutes unacceptable conduct in the world of back - room political dealing in appointments .
O’Brien is accused of offering former mayoral rival Terry Kilrea an appointment to the National Parole Board in exchange for his withdrawal from the 2006 mayoral race .
In asking for a directed verdict dismissing the charges , O’Brien ’s lawyers argued the Criminal Code sections do n’t apply to appointments negotiated purely to gain political advantage .
If they did , they contended , the law would criminalize Senate appointments made to open up seats for star candidates or deals in which opposition MPs cross the floor to accept cabinet posts .
But Cunningham said the aim of the two sections is to preserve government integrity by protecting against the corruption of our democratic system , within which the appointment process occupies an important place .
“ Appointments to government offices such as the National Parole Board are not to be traded for political favour , ” he said .
“ They are appointments that must be made in a fair , open and transparent manner .
To do otherwise is to do harm to the integrity of government . ”
The ruling appeared to stun O’Brien and his entourage of family and friends .
Before Cunningham entered the courtroom , they were almost giddy , laughing and chattering in a manner reminiscent of students on the last day of school .
O’Brien had even tentatively scheduled a series of media interviews and TV appearances on the assumption the ruling would go in his favour .
But as the judge read his decision , O’Brien became visibly more subdued .
By the time he left court , he had resumed the Sphinx - like silence that has been his trademark throughout the trial .
Michael Edelson , O’Brien ’s lead lawyer , told the court he ’d take the weekend to review Cunningham ’s decision and advise the court and Crown attorney Scott Hutchison by next Wednesday or Thursday whether the defence will call evidence .
Hutchison , who completed the Crown ’s case June 2 , is especially keen to know whether O’Brien will take the stand in his own defence .
While that ’s considered unlikely , Edelson promised to advise Hutchison of that next week .
While the trial will continue , it would be wrong to read into Friday ’s ruling any indication of the judge ’s assessment of O’Brien ’s guilt or innocence .
That will await the end of the trial .
Nevertheless , a striking feature of Cunningham ’s 24 - page judgment was his acceptance of the Crown ’s position on every substantive legal point .
That came as a surprise to some because Cunningham had appeared skeptical of some of Hutchison ’s arguments during submissions on the directed verdict application earlier this month .
There was none of that Friday , though .
A key defence argument turned on the meaning of the phrase “ advantage or benefit of any kind , ” which appears in both relevant Criminal Code sections .

普通では考えられない優遇策--「 Google提案」を振り返る
皆さんこんにちは、毎度おなじみ（？）文字コード漫談の時間がやってまいりました。前回が3月の掲載ですから3カ月ぶりですか。今まで3回にわたって絵文字をUnicode及びISO/IEC
10646（国際符号化文字集合）に収録しようという提案の動きについてご説明してきましたが、今回から2回に分けて完結編をお届けします。どうぞよろしくお付き合いください。
ひさしぶりですから、ここまでのポイントを整理しておきましょう。前述した「提案」とは、もともとはUnicodeに収録するためにGoogleがAppleと共同で作成したものです。以下、主唱者の名前をとり「Google提案」と呼ぶことにします。これはこの2月に開かれた最高議決機関、UTC会議で承認されてUnicodeコンソーシアムの総意となりました。ついでGoogle提案はISO/IEC
10646への収録を目指して、3月5日にその提案書が公開されています（N3582、N3583、和訳文書）。
UnicodeはISO/IEC
10646と文字集合を共有していますが、それはUnicodeが収録決定した文字を、無条件でISO/IEC
10646も収録することを意味しません。いくらUnicodeコンソーシアム（＝アメリカ・ナショナルボディ）と言えども、ISO/IEC 10646を審議するWG2会議で参加各国の賛成を得なければならないのです。なお、両者の関係について詳しいことは前回の冒頭部分を参照してください。以下ではとくにISO/IEC
10646への提案を意味しない限り、規格名としては「Unicode」で統一して話をすすめます。
次に前回のおさらいをしておきましょうか。Google提案の内容は自分が考えた絵文字を収録しようというのではなく、NTTドコモ、KDDI、ソフトバンクモバイルという3キャリアで使われている既存の絵文字との相互運用を至上目的とするものであること。ところがよく知られているように絵文字は「色と動き」を持っており、それらを符号化の対象としない文字コードの技術で互換を目指すのはむずかしいこと（本来これはファイルフォーマットの仕事）。そこでGoogle提案は「色と動き」は絵文字の本質ではないとして、これらを除いて符号化することにしたけれど、やはりどうも無理があること。
さらに今まで のUnicodeの原則では似たような字を1つに統合してしまうところを、絵文字については一切それはせず、3キャリアのレパートリを重複は除き1文字も欠けることなく収録する「ソース・セパレーション・ルール」（以下、ソース分離）を適用することにしたこと。これは普通では考えられない優遇策と言えます。
それだけでなく 、Google提案は現在行われている3キャリア間の変換サービスとなるべく同じ結果になるよう設計されていること。ところが現行の変換サービスというのは、1対1対応（往復の情報交換）が当然である文字コードの世界から見ると、1対多対応（片道だけの情報交換）を大量に許している「異常な世界」であること。しかし互換を目指す以上、このような悪い部分までGoogle提案は抱え込まざるを得なかったこと。
だいたい、こんなところでしょうかね。たぶん前回まで読んだ人が、当然抱くであろう疑問は「では、なぜGoogleはそこまでして3キャリアとの互換にこだわるのか?」ということではないかと思うのですが、このあたりがオチになってくるので、ちょっと頭の隅において読んでくださいね。また勝手ながら以下、敬称を略させていただきます。
「 Unicode - ML」で議論された絵文 字
ここまで読んで分かるように、Google提案はいささか強引と言うべきシロモノなのですが、昨年UTC会議への提案を前に一般へのパブリックレビューが発表されると、やはりというか当然というかすごい勢いで反対の声があがりました。
絵文字についてインターネット上で議論された場所は2つに分けられます。1つはGoogleの『emoji4unicode』グループの「ディスカッション」（掲示板）。こちらはそもそもの発案者であるGoogleによる公式ページであり、パブリックレビューでもフィードバックの宛先はこのディスカッションのページが指定されています。しかし、ここでの議論は盛り上がったと言えるほどでなく、主な議論は公式ページではなく別のところでおこなわれたのです。それがUnicodeの公式メーリングリスト（以下、Unicode-ML）でした。
これ はUnicodeのイベントの案内だとか規格改訂など、何か新しい動きがあったときにここで告知したり討議したりするものです。国際標準化活動におけるメーリングリストとしては、代表的存在としてIETF（The Internet Engineering Task Force）のものが挙げられますが、Unicode-MLはそれと比べるとテーマごとに細分化されておらず、単一のメーリングリストの中に総てのスレッドが同居するイメージです。
ではどんな人達が投稿しているのしょう。職業でいうと圧倒的多数を占めるのがソフトウェアの国際化に関わるエンジニア、居住地で言うと一番多いのはやはり米国、残りのほとんどが欧州諸国（たまに中国、インド、日本）と思われます。
Pornstar Lucy Lu Flips Out Behind the Scenes
NSFW due to cussing and quick booty shot .
Watching people flipping out is great fun .
It ’s proven to be a popular net pastime with videos like the recent Tanner Mayes Flips

The first L.A Beer Float Showdown was held on July 26th at the Blue Palms Brewhouse .
And yes , it was a BEER float ; brew and ice cream .
How do you feel about that combo ?
I think it would be worth a shot even though I do n’t like beer all that much .
The winning team , The Golden State +
Scoops , produced the event ’s favorite float that I ’d like to get my hands on .
It was North Coast Old Rasputin Imperial Stout and brown bread gelato ( and the brown bread was infused with Old Rasputin reduction ! ) … actually to tell you the truth I have no idea what any of that would taste like all together ( and what the hell is “ brown bread ” gelato ?
Like what flavor is that exactly ? ) but for some reason I imagine it being really good .
Do n’t you ?
The event raised money for a non-profit writing and tutoring program for kids 6 - 18 .
Sounds like an all around good time !

School ’s out for summer 2009 , and instead of getting a jump on the boundless futures that parents and colleges always promised them , students this year are receiving a reality check .
The well - paying summer jobs that in previous years seemed like a birthright have grown scarce , and pre-professional internships are disappearing as companies cut back across the board .
Recession - strapped parents do n’t always have the means or will to bankroll starter apartments or art tours of Tuscany .
So many college students and recent graduates are heading to where they least expected : back home , and facing an unfamiliar prospect : downtime , maybe too much of it .
To a high - achieving generation whose schedules were once crammed with extracurricular activities meant to propel them into college , it feels like an empty summer  eerie , and a bit scary .
“ Things have changed drastically , ” said Ron Alsop , author of “ The Trophy Kids Grow Up : How the Millennial Generation Is Shaking Up the Workplace , ” a book that only last year portrayed young workers as entitled and in a hurry .
“ It has to be a huge wake - up call for this generation . ”
Numbers provide the backdrop to the story  not just the grimly familiar national unemployment rate , 9.5 percent in June , but the even scarier , less publicized unemployment figure for 16 - to 19 - year - olds , which has hit 24 percent , up from 16.1 percent two years ago .
Internships available to college students have fallen 21 percent since last year , according to the National Association of Colleges and Employers .
Across the country , there are countless tales like that of Morgan Henderson , a student at the University of San Francisco , who , along with friends , planned a big road trip to Las Vegas this summer .
With so few of the friends finding jobs , they downgraded plans to a road trip to Reno , then to no road trip at all .
They ’re spending time watching DVDs at one another ’s houses .
There are many ways to save money around the house and in our daily lives .
Here ’s 50 great ways to start saving money right away .
Please feel free to add your own ideas in the comment section at the end of the list .
1. Use Vinegar
Vinegar is useful around the house in so many ways .
It ’s a great replacement for several household cleaners .
Take for example window cleaning , you can easily pay four dollars on a bottle of Windex , or simply mix 30 percent white vinegar with 70 percent water and create an excellent window cleaner .
Many people say it works better then Windex .
Dry the windows with newspaper and save on paper towels as well .
2. Save Cans
I know we all know this but if you drink soda , beer , or anything else that comes in an aluminum can it can add up quite quickly .
Did you know that you can sell the pull tabs on eBay for around a penny a piece ?
If you save the cans till earth day many recyclers pay double the normal fee as a way of promoting Earth Day and their company .
3. Use Less Shampoo and Conditioner
Some dermatologists say that we all wash our hair too often .
By washing our hair every day and sometimes twice a day we are stripping out essential oils that can leave our hair too dry , then we spend more on conditioners in order to replace the natural oil .
4. Make Your Own Pet Food & Save Money
If you ’re like me your always looking for great ways to cut down on waste and save some money at the same time .
Pet food can be quite costly and if you have dog ’s like I do , one of their favorite activities is eating .
Making your own dog food can be a wonderful treat and a fantastic way to save money
5. Wash Out Your Zip Lock Bags and Re-use Them
Many times zip lock bags are used only once and then discarded .
These bags are expensive and can be used more than once and in many cases several times .
Name brand bags are more durable so it pays to spend the extra money up front if you plan to reuse them .
6 . Always ask for Discounts
In order to discover the real price of any item , always ask for discounts .
If you ask for a large discount on an item , it will often makes the seller give you the absolute lowest price they will accept .
7. Save Your Change
Save your change , save the dollars or save every other 5 dollar bill , what ever your budget will allow .
Get a 5 gallon water jug and put your “ extra ” cash away .
8. Invest In a Deep Freezer
You can get a used deep freezer for as low as 75 dollars .
Make sure to consider whether it ’s energy efficient , as you could end up spending the money you save on your electric bill .
When meats and other freezer items go on sale , buy in bulk and freeze it till you need it .
This can save a lot on your grocery bill .
9. Adjust Your Thermostat Up or Down .
Those few degrees can make a big difference in your monthly electric bill .
Use blankets when it ’s cold instead of turning up your heater , your body will acclimate .
10 . Consider Using Skype or Other Alternative Phone Services
We ’ve recently switched to Skype and now we use video conference to talk to family members that live far away .
They use Skype as well , and that makes long distance family phone calls completely free .
Magic Jack and Vonage are also great ways to save .
11 . Shop by Unit Price
When shopping at the grocery store , be sure to pay attention to the unit price , it can save you a great deal of money at the grocery store .
Read more about Unit Price
12 . Keep Your Tires At The Correct Air Pressure
Keep your vehicles tires at the right air pressure .
This is a common one but under filled tires can really eat up the gas .
13 . Stay in And Rent a Movie
Even if you splurge on the new release , you will save big if you ’re doing it instead of a trip to the movie theater .
It use to be that a trip to the movies was a budget night out .
Now a family of four going out to the movies can cost 60.00 or 70.00 dollars or more .
14 . Quit Drinking or Cut Down
If you quit drinking alcohol or simply cut down , you ’ll save money .
This is a expense that varies by the person .
You can sit down and figure out what you would save by cutting down or quitting or even switching to a less expensive brand .
15 . Quit smoking or Cut Down or Roll Your Own Cigarettes
Quit smoking or at least cut down .
If you smoke a pack of Marlboro ’s a day at over 4 dollars per pack , you can easily spend 120.00 dollars or more per month .
Cut down , switch brands , or even quit .
If quitting , or cutting down is n’t for you consider rolling your own , this can save up to 50 % or more .
Read more about rolling your own cigarettes to save money .
16 . Shop at Thrift Stores
By shopping at thrift stores , you ’ll find great deals on just about everything you need .
Shopping at flea markets , and yard sales are great ways to save as well .
By the way , do n’t forget , you can negotiate at thrift stores , yard sales , and flea markets .
17 . Skip Star Bucks at Least on Occasion
Skip the gourmet coffee every once in a while , or at least buy the less expensive regular black coffee they offer and take advantage of the coffee condiment section .
You can create an excellent vanilla , chocolate , or even hazelnut brew for half the price .
18 . Buy Generics
Generic products are often be just as good as the name brand , and sometimes even better .
In many cases there are less preservatives and artificial flavors .
In fact , Wal - Mart brand almost never has hydrogenated oils .
19 . Avoid Overdraft Fees
Overdraft fees can add up quickly .
Over draft twice for even a dollar or two and you ’ve got 70.00 dollars in fees at bank of America .
Keep a reserve in your account to guarantee that this does n’t happen .
20 . Grow a Small Garden
Having a garden can save you a great deal of money on the vegetables that you use most often .
If you have neighbors that grow a garden , work out a barter system and trade the extra produce .
Everything you do n’t use right away , you can jar and use at a later date .
21 . Go Fishing
If you enjoy eating fish , go fishing and catch your own .
You can catch a few extra dinners each and every month .
This can also be a great way to save on your entertainment budget as well .
That is , if you enjoy fishing .
22 . Always Use Coupons
Use coupons and save a great deal of money each and every time you visit the store .
Do n’t buy the product just because you have a coupon , but instead use the coupons for the products you need .
23 . Use Dollar Stores Sparingly
Use dollar stores sparingly , there are items that you can save on in the dollar store but the temptation to spend a dollar on an item you do n’t really need is common .
Dollar stores often do well because we come out with 10 extra items that we really did n’t need in the first place .
24 . Seal Windows and Doors
Seal and weather - proof your windows and doors .
Caulk and weather strip every unsealed area of your home .
You will save a great deal of money on both heating and cooling your home each and every month .
25 . Save Your Leftovers and Use Them
Most leftovers usually last for 3 - 7 days and sometimes even longer .
Have leftover night ever few days , work it into your monthly lunch and dinner menu .
If you do n’t get to them in time and you have a pet , use it in preparing you own dog food a few times a week and save money on your dog food bill .
26 . Do Your Own Oil Change
It ’s recommended that you perform an oil change ever 3 - 5 k miles .
By doing the labor yourself you can save each and every time .
27 . Do It Your Self Pet Care
You can trim easily trim your pets nails and give them a bath .
If you do this on a monthly basis and since the average cost for a trip to the pet groomers is around 25.00 dollars with each visit , you ’ll save in the neighborhood of 300.00 dollars a year .
28 . Walk Instead of Drive
Let ’s face it , we could all use more exercise after all it ’s healthy and makes us feel better .
Other than the wonderful health benefits , walking can also save money on the fuel bill .
Consider walking to the grocery store , movie store , or bank next time .
If you ’re not up for a walk consider a bike ride instead .
29 . Turn Off The Television
Many households have the television on at all hours of the day , many people simply enjoy the background noise .
Turning it off can be quite relaxing and will save money on the electric bill at the same time .
30 . Turn Off The Lights
Getting in the habit of switching the lights off in rooms you ’re not using is a great way to reduce your monthly electric bill .
In fact , make sure that electricity is not being used unnecessarily .
Make sure your not heating and cooling rooms you ’re not in and the TV is off in rooms you ’re not in as well .
31 . Brown Bag Lunches
Bringing your own lunch at least a few times a week to either work or school can save a great deal of money over the month .
Fast food and restaurants can really add up .
Simply putting together a nice lunch at home is a great way to use up those leftovers as well .
32 . Buy In The Off Season
Looking to get new ski equipment ?
Buy it at the very end of the season .
Looking for a new bathing suit or canoe ?
At the end of the season the prices often go down , in fact way down .
You can easily save up to 75 % and in some cases even more .
Last year I bought 20 pairs of water shoes that were originally $ 5.00 dollars per pair , I paid .25 cents a pair brand new .
I bought them to sell on eBay the following summer .
For our own entertainment , we were also able to purchase a $ 99.99 inflatable canoe for only 10.00 at the end of the season , that ’s a 90 % savings .
33 . Use a Clothes Line
Use a clothes line in the summer time to dry your clothes .
An electric or gas dryer can run up quite an electric bill .
By using the air and sun to dry your clothes you will get fresher clothes and linens without the cost .
34 . Brick or Mason Jar
Put a mason jar or a few bricks in the back of your toilet to cut down on the water bill .
35 . Save On Shipping Materials
If you sell merchandise on eBay you can get shipping boxes for free at Wal - Mart .
Ask the manager or the stock person when they are stocking the shelves , they are often happy to help and will give you as many boxes as you desire .
You could otherwise spend 1.00 - 2.00 dollars for a box at the shipping store .
36 . Save On Paper Towels
By cutting your paper towel roll in half you will save 50 % .
For most spills you only need half anyway .
This is a great way to double the life of a paper towel roll .
Use a sharp bread knife to complete this task
37 . Invest in Rubber Spatulas
It ’s quite amazing how much more mayonnaise or miracle whip you can get out of a jar with the use of rubber spatulas .
38 . Bring Your Own
If you drink , invest in a flask .
Generally they hold around six shots of alcohol .
We ski quite often and occasionally have a cocktail while we ’re on the mountain .
Nearly everyone there has a drink or two and they end up spending a great deal of money on cocktails .
If you bring a flask and some packages of hot chocolate .
You ’ve got a chocolate peppermint schnapps for around .75 cents and that includes the cup of hot water as well .
39 . Use Alternative Medicine ( intelligently )
Did you know that if you have a serious headache , you can drink a cup of ginger tea and get rid of it completely .
You save around 10.00 dollar over a bottle of Advil or Tylenol without the health risks .
In fact you can take natural magnesium for a headache as well .
40 . Pay Your Bills On Time
Pay all your bills on time , if possible and save on late fees .
41 . Save On Entertainment
You can save on entertainment by spending some of your entertainment budget on services such as Netflix .
It ’s a bit of a double standard because you ’re buying an extra service , but if you have a tendency to go out several times a month , or if you spend too much at the movie store renting movies , Netflix will actually work out to be a savings .
42 . Save On Soil
If you have a garden it pays to save all your leftover coffee grinds .
Coffee ground enrich the soil and will certainly help your plants to grow nicely .
43 . Rice , Beans & Potatoes
Incorporating rice , beans and potatoes into your meals is an excellent way cut down on your food bill .
In fact , if for example you make a pot of chili , and serve it over rice the chili will go twice as far .
Using beans rice and potatoes in your recipes is a great way to save .
44 . Use Your Local Library
Libraries are free and you can save money by reading the books and returning them when you ’ve finished them .
They often have the same books as Barns and Noble or Borders , but without the cost .
Many libraries carry an inventory of VHS and DVD movies .
Some Libraries have a video game section as well .
45 . Plan a Meal Menu
Planning a meal menu is one of the best ways to same , when it comes to your grocery bill .
Knowing exactly what you need will reduce the chance for impulse buying .
46 . Carpool
Carpooling and share a ride programs are certainly a great way to save money .
Whether you ride with a friend or join a local car pool program , you will immediately see a saving on your monthly fuel bill and reduce the wear and tear on your vehicle .
47 . Shop Insurance Rates
Insurance companies are always looking for new clients and will almost always offer a discount over what your paying at your current insurer .
Even better if you like your insurance company let them know about the better rate you found while shopping and let them know that you will gladly stay with them if they can match the rate .

48 . Shop Credit Card Rates
Do n’t be intimidated by your credit card companies .
Many people use the trick of finding a 0 % credit card offer and transferring the balance over .
If you contact your credit card company , making sure to talk to a person who in charge , such as a manager .
They will often reduce your interest rate and in some cases offer you lower rate for an even longer period of time than you found at a competing card company .
49 . Save When Buying a Vehicle
Buying a new or used car at a dealership can be a daunting task especially if your unprepared .
For many people a dealership and the thought of a car salesman can be quite intimidating .
The customers who end up with the very best price , utilize the internet .
I ’ve sold cars , and I ’ve worked in the Internet marketing department of a car dealership .
The individuals that contact the Internet marketing department always pay much less , this is also known as the fleet department .
Find the car and price on the Internet before you go to the dealership , print it out and bring it with you , this will disarm the salesmen , and often lead to the very best price .
50 . Negotiate Everything
No matter what your buying , always negotiate .
They have a price they would like to get for a products , and you have a price you would like to pay for a product .
Find a middle ground , and you will always save money .

BBC News , Iowa
The presence of prairie winds and rich soil makes Iowa literally fertile ground for developing alternative energy sources from wind turbines and biofuels .
Iowa invested $ 6 m in wind turbine manufacturing
But the landscape is also a reminder that achieving energy independence is a formidable challenge and making an agricultural economy green is not easy .
Farm workers cannot take subways to work , farmers have to drive long distances into the fields to sow and harvest their crops and to deliver them to markets .
Farm animals themselves , not to put too fine a point on it , produce methane - a powerful greenhouse gas - that is trapped in the atmosphere .
Those challenges have not stopped the state setting itself ambitious goals .
Energy pioneers
The Iowa Climate Change Advisory Panel recently wrote a report for Governor Chet Culver setting out how the state can reduce carbon emissions by 90 % by 2030 .
The state has set up an Office of Energy Independence - surely the perfect place , I thought , to test how easy it will be for President Obama to achieve energy independence for the whole of America .
There are plenty of energy pioneers to be found in Iowa .
I feel like I 'm doing something more than just building a washing machine , I 'm building something for everyone to capitalise on
Crugar Tuttle
Wind turbine factory worker Roger Neuberger , a farmer , lives near Clear Lake in the north - west part of the State - where the wind blows hardest .
He gets money from an energy company each year for making room for two wind turbines on his land .
Mr Neuberger has promised the energy company that he will not publicly reveal how much he is being paid , but other farmers have let it be known that , depending on when their contracts were signed , they can receive somewhere between $ 2,000 ( £ 1,400 ) and $ 4,000 per turbine every year for the next 30 years .
Mr Neuberger is very happy , if rather modest about his role at the new frontier .
Asked if he felt like a pioneer , he replied : " Yeah , I suppose so . "
" There were a number of farmers who did n't want to do this because they did n't understand - they were concerned how they were going to be treated .
We 've been treated wonderful .
I could n't ask for anything better . "
Foreign oil Iowa hopes that wind energy will deliver more than just electricity - and that investment in wind technology will help to transform towns depressed by unemployment .
Towns like Newton , which is just to the east of the capital , Des Moines .
Nearly 2,000 people lost their jobs in Newton when the town 's biggest employer , Whirlpool , shut its doors in 2007 .
Is ethanol really a clean alternative to fossil fuels ?
Hundreds of those same workers , who once made washing machine parts , now make blades for wind turbines at the TPI factory .
But the jobs did not come cheap .
The state gave the manufacturer $ 6 m in subsidies and tax breaks - in return the company promised to hire 500 people .
Larry Crady worked at Whirlpool for 23 years , making coin-operated laundry machines .
" It just wows you when you see a blade open and close , " Larry says .
" When you pull that blade out of the mould it 's exciting , I feel like I 'm doing something more than just building a washing machine , I 'm building something for everyone to capitalise on . "
Mr Crady 's sense of wonder is understandable - the plant certainly has the " wow " factor .
The turbine blades are as long as a 747 jet and the factory is longer than an aircraft carrier .
It is fitting , then , that - according to the plant 's manager - so many of those that work there feel that making the blades is as much about national security as it is about electricity .
" A lot of us in this company and in wind energy have a sense of calling to this , " Crugar Tuttle says .
" I think in the interview process it comes out with a lot of our veterans that this is about weaning us off foreign oil . "
But wind energy is a long way from delivering independence for Iowa any time soon .
It provides just 8 % of Iowa 's energy needs .
If it is to go any way towards making the rest of the country energy independent , a distribution grid would be needed .
Controversial President Obama has promised to invest $ 150bn in renewable energy over the next 10 years .
He hopes to increase dramatically the contribution that wind , solar and other renewable sources can make to the country 's energy supply .
According to current projections , renewables will still be providing only 8 % of the country 's energy supply 20 years from now .
Certainly , energy independence will not be possible without replacing the foreign petrol used in cars .
We need sources of power that are constant and do n't rely on things like whether the wind 's blowing or the sun 's shining
Phil Wyse
Iowa state representative Many Iowans think the solution is biofuels ( as do most presidential candidates - albeit only while they are campaigning in the crucial Iowa caucuses ) .
Refineries across the state produce 1.5 billion gallons of ethanol a year - enough to replace 10 % of the petrol in America 's cars .
But biofuels are controversial .
A UN report says they drive up the price of food .
And is ethanol really clean ?
We visited POET 's ethanol plant in Hanlontown in the northern part of Iowa .
The plant , like most in the state , is powered by fossil fuels .
I spoke to POET 's Vice President for Project Development , Larry Ward .
He insists that despite the use of natural gas in the production of ethanol , it is a good bargain .
" There 's a tremendous net gain from an energy standpoint .
Using natural gas to produce ethanol you have a gain - for every unit of energy you put into the plant you get two units of energy out . "
The trouble is , many of Iowa 's ethanol refineries use coal - the dirtiest fuel of all .
It is one of the reasons why Iowa will soon be building another coal - fired power plant .
More than half of all the electricity produced by the new plant is expected to be used to fuel the state 's ethanol refineries .
King coal
Another problem is that Iowa gets very cold in winter .
How many Americans would risk living in a place where January temperatures hover around - 18 F , if they had to rely on sun or wind power for heat ?
What happens when the sun goes down and the wind dies ?
That is why , despite the push for ethanol and wind power , coal is still king when it comes to powering Iowa .
It currently provides 85 % of the state 's energy needs .
Phil Wyse , a state representative for 22 years , believes Iowa and America need nuclear power .
" We need sources of power that are constant and do n't rely on things like whether the wind 's blowing or the sun 's shining , " he says .
" Alternative to coal ?
Nuclear more in the mix . "
Despite all the wind energy and ethanol Iowa strives to produce , carbon emissions are still growing here - and they are 1 % higher than the average for the whole of the US .
Iowa may have much to show the rest of America about green energy - including how hard it will be to make America energy independent .

Normally , I dislike posting on the same topic twice in a row ( heck , I ’d prefer to have at least two weeks ) but an item was brought to my attention by my most faithful reader , i.e. , the wifey , who forwarded this item from the Publisher ’s Marketplace newsletter –Publisher ’s Lunch Deluxe ?
–not online for non-members , so forgive me if I quote the whole thing :
“ A Publishing - Centric Observation on Palin ’s Resignation “ While we would n’t pretend to know the cause of Sarah Palin ’s resignation from office , we have realized at least one effect : the size of her book advance will probably never be known publicly as a result .
“ You may recall that attorney Robert Barnett submitted exclusively to Harper , helping ensure that Palin ’s advance ( despite some wild speculation in the press ) would remain private initially .
At the time it was presumed that the advance would be revealed subsequently when she disclosed her income as required by Alaska ’s laws every March .
“ But the Alaska statue would appear to require disclosure only up until when she leaves the governor ’s office ( “ after leaving office , a former public official shall file a final statement covering any period during the official ’s service in that office for which the public official has not already filed a statement ” ) .
So unless Palin has already received her first advance from Harper , or takes another public office within the next year or so , her advance is likely to remain private .
” Naturally , if her advance became public record , there ’d be no way of hiding it once she began her presumed presidential run .
Of course , presidential candidates normally disclose financial statements , but La Palin evidently figures she could get away with submitting only her 2012 statement .
We do n’t have any idea how much HarperCollins paid or will pay her , but the word on the street is that it is several millions .
She may need a new strategy for making believe she ’s just one of the people , after all , how many just - a- hockey - moms have a couple of cool mil in ye olde checking account , hmmm ?
Perhaps that rambling incoherent resignation speech was really meant to draw attention away from the real reason after all .
When in doubt , follow the money .
Here are a few links from earlier this year discussing the need for disclosure : Hillel Italie , AP via Seattle Times :”
If terms of the book deal are n’t leaked by next spring , at least some of the details will be revealed in Palin ’s next financial disclosure forms with the Alaska Public Offices Commission .
Income next must be reported on March 15 , 2010 .
However , if she is n’t paid in full by Dec. 31 , some income may fall over to the next year ’s report . ”
The Common Progressive : “ The actual amount of the advance that Palin is being paid was not released as public information , however the information will eventually become public as Palin will be required to disclose the earnings as income on her state disclosures .
The figure is widely believed to be in the millions at a minimum . “

BEIJING ( Reuters ) - China ’s first Mars probe is expected to be launched in the second half of this year on top of a Russian rocket , said Xinhua on Thursday , the latest milestone in the nation ’s ambitious space program .
Yinghuo - 1 , or Firefly Light - 1 , weighs 115 kgs ( 253 lb ) and passed an important test , Xinhua quoted Zhang Weiqiang , deputy secretary of the Shanghai Academy of Spaceflight Technology as saying .
The probe has an expected life of two years and would go into orbit around Mars in 2010 after a 10 - month , 380 - million - km journey , Zhang said .
The probe wo n’t land on Mars , but would only orbit and monitor the planet , he said .
Earlier this year , a Chinese probe ended its 16 - month mission with a planned crash into the lunar surface , the first step in plans to land a vehicle on the moon in 2012 .
China launched its third manned space mission last year , which included its first spacewalk .
Beijing is looking to eventually put astronauts on the moon , but the government has not announced any schedule for that mission .

Relational algebra is an offshoot of first - order logic and is a set of relations closed under operators .
Pointfree
José Nuno Oliveira : First Steps in Pointfree Functional Dependency Theory .
A concise and deep approach , it is pointfree .
See also the author 's homepage and also his many other papers -- many materials related to in this topic can be found .
Just a thought
An early , immature thought of mine to represent relational algebra expressions :
data Query :: * -> * -> * where Identity :: Scheme a => Query a a Restrict :: ( Scheme a , Scheme b ) => Expr b Bool -> Query a b -> Query a b Project :: ( Scheme a , Scheme b , Scheme b' , Sub b' b ) => b' ->
Query a b -> Query a b' Rename :: ( Scheme a , Scheme b , Scheme b' , Iso b b' ) =>
Query a b -> Query a b'
Product :: ( Scheme a , Scheme b1 , Scheme b2 , Scheme b , Sum b1 b2 b ) => Query a b1 -> Query a b2 -> Query a b Union :: ( Scheme a , Scheme b , Id b ) =>
Query a b ->
Query a b -> Query a b Difference :: ( Scheme a , Scheme b , Id b ) =>
Query a b ->
Query a b ->
Query a b
... using the concepts / ideas of
generalised algebraic datatype
a sort of differential approach ( I think I took it from Zipper ) .
Can Query be regarded as an arrow , and if so , is it worth of doing so ?
be regarded as an arrow , and if so , is it worth of doing so ?
extensible record and more generally , type arithmetic
The case of Restrict uses Expr .
I think , the concept of Expr is an inside approach ( making the relational algebra -- regarded as an embedded language -- richer , more autonome from the host language , but also more restricted ) :
data Expr :: * -> * -> * where Constant :: ( Scheme sch , Literal a ) => a ->
Expr sch a Attribute :: ( Scheme sch , Match attr a , Context attr sch ) => attr ->
Expr sch a Not :: Scheme sch => Expr sch Bool -> Expr sch Bool And :: Scheme sch => Expr sch Bool -> Expr sch Bool -> Expr sch Bool Or :: Scheme sch => Expr sch Bool -> Expr sch Bool -> Expr sch Bool Equal :: ( Scheme sch , Eq a ) =>
Expr sch a ->
Expr sch a -> Expr sch Bool Less :: ( Scheme sch , Ord a ) =>
Expr sch a ->
Expr sch a ->
Expr sch Bool
Maybe an outside approach ( exploiting the host language more , thus enjoying more generality ) would be also appropriate :
data Query :: * -> * -> * where ...
Restrict :: ( Scheme a , Scheme b , Record br , On b br ) => ( br -> Bool ) ->
Query a b ->
Query a b ... Rename :: ( Scheme a , Scheme b , Scheme b' , Iso b b' ) => ( b -> b' ) ->
Query a b ->
Query a b '
Practice
Thus , in contrast to direct SQL text manipulation , database management systems can be approached also in declarative , type safe ways .
More specifically , they may be implemented as domain specific embedded languages -- using e.g .
Haskell for their host language .

Microsoft ’s Long , Slow Decline
There were two interesting Windows - related news stories last week .
First , Joe Wilcox ’s story on a report from NPD claiming that 91 percent of $ 1,000 - and - higher retail computer sales now go to Apple .
Second , Microsoft ’s quarterly financial results , in which revenue fell $ 1 billion short of projections and declined 17 percent year - over - year .
To be clear , Microsoft remains a very profitable company .
However , they have never before reported year - over - year declines like this , nor fallen so short of projected earnings .
Something is awry .
What is particularly alarming about Microsoft ’s numbers is that revenue from its Windows PC division suffered an even greater year - over - year revenue decline than the company as a whole : 29 percent .
One explanation for that is that Windows 7 , a major new update , goes on sale in October , and so it ’s expected , somehow , that Windows revenue would decline in the months preceding its release .
But Microsoft ’s operating system business is not new , and it has never been particularly cyclical .
Windows revenue , prior to this just - completed quarter , has only ever gone in one direction : up .
Windows is at the core of everything Microsoft does that makes money .
They sell Windows , then they sell software that runs on Windows .
As Windows goes , so goes Microsoft , and right now Windows is heading south .
One argument is that the fault lies with the global economy , not Microsoft itself .
( This seems to be the argument Microsoft ’s executives are making . )
But not every tech company is suffering .
Google is doing just fine , and Apple reported record non-holiday - quarter numbers for its just - ended quarter .
Apple operates in the same economy Microsoft does , and Mac sales are up .
And the numbers from the aforementioned report by NPD are simply astounding .
It ’s worth noting , though , that NPD ’s report is specifically about retail computer purchases ; Wilcox ’s story does n’t make that clear .
But that they do n’t represent all computer purchases does n’t mean they are n’t astounding figures .
Things have not always been like this .
NPD conducted the same survey at the beginning of 2008 , and at that point Apple ’s share of the $ 1,000 + retail computer market was only 66 percent .
Repeat : Apple ’s share of this segment has grown from 66 to 91 percent in a year and a half .
Apple has always only competed in the middle - to - high range of the computer market .
But it was never the case , historically , that Apple sold a majority of middle - to - high - end computers .
Even given that NPD ’s numbers represent only retail sales , is there any reasonable doubt that Apple ’s share of the non-retail market for $ 1,000 + computers is also growing ?
Apple ’s strong growth in this segment is a sign that the market is turning against Windows .
If for no other reason than that Apple has never entered the low - cost computer market , it ’s always been the case that the most budget - conscious computer buyers were Windows users .
But the converse was n’t true — not all Windows users were cheapies .
Today , though , Microsoft is increasingly left only with customers whose priority is price .
A Simple Pointed Question
During the late - ’90s dot - com boom , it was standard operating procedure at many companies for professional web developers and designers to have two computers on their desks : one Windows , one Mac .
One for primary development , one for testing in browsers on the “ other ” OS .
( Virtualization was n’t yet practical . )
But which to choose as the primary platform ?
Many chose one , many chose the other .
But it was an interesting test group , because they were exposed to both platforms .
These web developers were not like the people who , in a form of tribalism , claim to despise one or the other platform without having actually used it .
Web developers had to know both the Mac and Windows , at least with passing familiarity , and the truth is that many , if not most , preferred Windows .
Today that is simply no longer the case .
Microsoft has lost all but a sliver of this entire market .
People who love computers overwhelmingly prefer to use a Mac today .
Microsoft ’s core problem is that they have lost the hearts of computer enthusiasts .
Regular people do n’t think about their choice of computer platform in detail and with passion like nerds do because , duh , they are not nerds .
But nerds are leading indicators .
This is true in many markets with broad appeal , not just computers .
Microsoft is looking ever more so like the digital equivalent of General Motors .
Car enthusiasts lost interest in GM ’s cars long before regular people did ; the same is happening with Windows .
Or consider cameras .
Companies like Canon and Nikon make most of their money from consumer - level point - and - shoot cameras .
But they are intensely competitive at the high end of the market , too .
Enthusiasts are valuable customers not just because they themselves buy expensive products , but because they , as enthusiasts , tend to recommend products in their area of expertise to others .
The photo nerd who ’s delighted with their $ 2,500 Canon SLR is likely to recommend a lot of $ 250 Canon point - and - shoots to friends and family .
Vista was a disaster for Microsoft .
Windows 7 is , supposedly , the light at the end of the tunnel .
But the best consensus about Windows 7 is only that it ’s not going to be a complete and total clusterfuck like Vista .
That it ’s something XP users will actually want to upgrade to .
Something that , when it comes pre-installed on a new machine , will not prompt questions about how to downgrade to XP .
But no one seems to be arguing that Windows 7 is something that will tempt Mac users to switch , or to tempt even recent Mac converts to switch back .
It does n’t even seem to be in the realm of debate .
But if Windows 7 is actually any good , why would n’t it tempt at least some segment of Mac users to switch ?
Windows 95 , 98 , and XP did .
Microsoft seems to have conceded that the enthusiasts who ’ve switched to the Mac in recent years are gone for good .
Their apparent goal for Windows 7 was merely to make something better than Windows Vista .
If Microsoft were a healthy , functional , competitive company willing and able to honestly assess its own shortcomings — like the Microsoft of the ’90s that conquered the entire industry — their goal would have been to make something not just better than Vista , but better than anything else on the market , including Mac OS X .
Some Joke
The evidence is staring Microsoft ’s leadership in the face that they have lost the most lucrative segment of the market , but , judged by their actions and public remarks , they seem to think it ’s all a big joke .
They should be sweating this but they ’re laughing it off .
Two weeks ago Microsoft held its annual Worldwide Partners Conference .
There was a much - reported bit from the remarks of Kevin Turner , a former Wal - Mart executive who is now Microsoft ’s COO .
What caught people ’s attention were Turner ’s comments regarding having gotten a phone call from a lawyer at Apple regarding Microsoft ’s “ Laptop Hunter ” ads .
From Microsoft ’s transcript :
And so we ’ve been running these PC value ads .
Just giving people saying , hey , what are you looking to spend ?
“ Oh , I ’m looking to spend less than $ 1,000 . ”
Well we ’ll give you $ 1,000 .
Go in and look and see what you can buy .
And they come out and they just show them .
Those are completely unscripted commercials .
And you know why I know they ’re working ?
Because two weeks ago we got a call from the Apple legal department saying , hey — this is a true story — saying , “ Hey , you need to stop running those ads , we lowered our prices . ”
They took like $ 100 off or something .
It was the greatest single phone call in the history that I ’ve ever taken in business .
( Applause . )
I did cartwheels down the hallway .
At first I said , “ Is this a joke ?
Who are you ? ”
Not understanding what an opportunity .
And so we ’re just going to keep running them and running them and running them .
That ’s interesting insofar as it proves that Apple has an eye on Microsoft ’s ads .
But I ’ve always imagined that this is pretty much what corporate attorneys do all the time when a competitor runs an ad that claims things which are not true .
This is why you do n’t often see direct price comparisons in TV commercials — prices change .
And , in fact , a week later , Microsoft changed the ads to remove specific mentions of Mac prices .
That silly lawyer .
But the really interesting part of Turner ’s remarks from the conference is what he said immediately preceding the above , when he first broached the topic of Apple :
Now let ’s talk about Apple .
What are you going to do about those Apple ads ?
That was a year ago .
Gosh , when I went home for the holidays , brothers , sisters , cousins — hey , hope you do n’t have anything to do with marketing over there at Microsoft .
What are you guys going to do about those Apple ads ?
Stay tuned , stay tuned , stay tuned .
Wow .
Did we punch right back ?
The PC Hunter ads , the PC Rookie ads clearly have been winners in the marketplace .
Such winners in the marketplace that Apple ’s laptop sales went up last quarter , and the rest of the industry ’s declined .
( Perhaps Microsoft would do better to measure the efficacy of their ads by their effect on sales , rather than by the number of phone calls they prompt from Apple lawyers . )
Then comes the real insight into Microsoft ’s thinking :
I pulled this out of my Sunday newspaper .
I have an old habit because I came from retail looking at the Sunday tabs and circulars that are in newspapers .
This is straight out of my paper last Sunday .
This is a comparison out of a leading electronics retailer that you can get a 13.3 - inch Macbook for US $ 1199 from that retailer .
Guess what .
That same retailer , you can get the same PC with more RAM , a bigger hard drive , and almost a three - inch bigger screen for US $ 649 .
What an incredible opportunity .
And so Microsoft ’s official stance regarding Apple ’s growing domination of the $ 1,000 + market is that Apple is charging hundreds of extra dollars in pure margin — $ 500 in the case Turner cited in his prepared remarks .
The computers that Microsoft chooses to brag about on stage at a major conference are the $ 650 17 - inch laptops advertised in Best Buy Sunday circulars .
There ’s no question that retailers sell tens of millions of cheap Windows laptops every year .
But no one with a pair of eyes thinks such machines are of comparable quality to Apple MacBooks .
Even without turning the machines on , anyone can see the difference in design and build quality .
In fact , you do n’t even need eyes — just pick them up and see which one squeaks .
Apple is selling more MacBooks every quarter .
Microsoft thinks it is sitting pretty because Best Buy has a 17 - inch Dell for $ 650 .
Turner is not alone .
Back in April , when the new PC Hunter ad campaign started , David Webster , general manager for brand marketing at Microsoft , said the following in an interview with Newsweek ’s Dan Lyons :
He says the idea was to turn Apple ’s “ I ’m a Mac ” campaign to Microsoft ’s advantage .
“ We associate real people with being PCs , [ but then Apple ] ends up looking pretty mean - spirited , the way they go after customers , ” he says .
“ It ’s clear that ’s who they are insulting . ”
At the same time he ca n’t resist taking a crack at the preciousness of some Mac users .
“ Not everyone wants a machine that ’s been washed with unicorn tears , ” he says .
Quoting the above , I wrote :
It seems clear that Microsoft ’s stance on the Mac ’s sales growth is that there ’s nothing wrong with Windows or right with the Mac , but rather that there ’s something wrong with Mac users .
Microsoft is no longer ignoring Apple ’s market share gains and successful “ Get a Mac ” ad campaign .
But the crux of these ads from Apple is that Macs are better ; Microsoft ’s response is a message that everyone already knows — that Windows PCs are cheaper .
Their marketing and retail executives publicly espouse the opinion that , now that everyone sees Apple computers as cool , Microsoft has Apple right where they want them .
They ’re a software company whose primary platform no longer appeals to people who like computers the most .
Their executives are either in denial of , or do not perceive , that there has emerged a consensus — not just among nerds but among a growing number of regular just - plain users — that Windows PCs are second - rate .
They still dominate in terms of unit - sale market share , yes , but not because people do n’t recognize Windows as second - rate , but because they do n’t care , in the same way millions of people buy metric tons of second - rate products from Wal - Mart every hour of every day .
That ’s the business Wal - Mart wants to be in — selling a zillion cheap low - margin items and turning a profit on volume .
That ’s not the business Microsoft is in .
And in mobile software , the fastest - growing segment of the computer industry , Microsoft ’s platform is both inferior and unpopular .
Their plan to address this is to change its name .
I ’m not arguing that Microsoft will collapse .
They ’re too big , too established for that to happen .
I simply think that their results this quarter were not an aberration , but rather the first fiscal evidence of a long , slow decline that began several years ago .

For centuries , scientists have puzzled over why the toucan 's bill is so remarkably large - but now one team thinks it might have an answer .
Writing in the journal Science , the researchers say that the toucan uses its enormous beak to stay cool .
They used infrared cameras to show the bird dumping heat from its body into its bill , helping it to regulate its body temperature .
The toucan has the largest bill of any bird , relative to body size .
It makes up about one - third of its total body length .
Hot secrets
The oversize appendage has received many different interpretations : Charles Darwin thought it might be used to attract mates , more recent ideas centre on fruit peeling , nest predation and visual warnings .
Darwin thought that the beak could be a sexual ornament
To investigate further , a team of researchers from Brock University , Canada , and Universidade Estadual Paulista , Brazil , looked at the toco toucan ( Ramphastos toco ) , which has the biggest bill of all the toucans .
Dr Glenn Tattersall , the lead author of the paper , from Brock University , Canada , said : " We used infrared thermal imaging technology to assess the surface temperature of the bill of toucans while they were encountering a range of air temperatures from 10C to 35C .
" This allowed us to measure the exact temperature of the bill . "
The scientists found that as the surroundings got warmer , the toucan 's bill would rapidly heat up , effectively acting as a radiator to draw heat away from the bird 's body , allowing it to stay cool .
Conversely , in cooler temperatures , little heat would radiate from the bill , letting the bird conserve its warmth .
As the surroundings heat up , the toucans dump body heat into their bills
The effect was particularly evident at night : at sunset , the birds would , in a matter of minutes , pump out heat from their beaks , lowering their body temperature as they slept .
The birds ' bills have a network of blood vessels that can increase or restrict the flow of blood .
Dr Tattersall said : " By altering blood flow to the bill 's surface , toucans can conserve body heat when it is cold or cope with heat stress by increasing blood flow .
" Essentially , the large surface area of the bill , and the fact it is not insulated , means that the blood flowing through is able to release heat into the bill , thus cooling the bird .
" This blood - derived heat in the bill is then dissipated into the air . "
Effective radiators
Other animals also use parts of their bodies to regulate temperature , for example , elephants and rabbits radiate heat from their ears to cool down .
Birds do not sweat , so must cope with other mechanisms to deal with elevated temperatures
Glenn Tattersall , Brock University
But the sheer size of the toucan 's bill means that relatively , it has one of the largest " thermal windows " in the animal kingdom .
The Science study also shows that the toucan is extremely effective at controlling its body heat with it : its bill can account for as much as 100 % of body heat loss or as little as 5 % if the blood flow is shut off .
Dr Tattersall explained : " Bird bills are not ' dead tissues ' , incapable of playing a role in heat balance , but are active contributors to thermoregulation . "
He added : " Birds do not sweat , so must cope with other mechanisms to deal with elevated temperatures . "
The researchers say that the finding that the toucan uses its beak to regulate body temperature does not rule out its other suggested functions .
The team now plans to look at other birds to see how their bills are involved with temperature regulation .

Cats have a vocal way of manipulating their owners into doing their bidding , according to a study .
Karen McComb , a researcher from the University of Sussex , was inspired by her own cat , Pepo , who continually woke her up in the mornings with an " insistent and rather annoying " purr that reliably motivated her to get up and feed him .
Unlike regular , low frequency purring , further study revealed that this " solicitation purr " contained an embedded sound with a similar frequency to a baby 's cry ; a sound that humans have an inherent bias to respond to .
She and her colleagues played recordings of these purrs to human volunteers , who found them to be " more urgent and harder to ignore " than regular purring .

Not to be confused with Homebrew Browser
The Homebrew Channel is a self - updating homebrew application loader by Team Twiizers which allows users to load homebrew applications without having to run an exploit every time .
Once installed , users can access the channel from the Wii System Menu just like any other Wii channel .
It can launch or install homebrew applications from an SD or SDHC card or via TCP / USB Gecko using Wiiload .
You can install the Homebrew Channel as part of the HackMii Installer by seeing the Installation part of this page .
Installation
See also : Homebrew status
READ THE DISCLAIMER !
In the VERY unlikely case that your Wii gets bricked by the installer , this will let you know where you stand in regards to Team Twiizers .
Pick an exploit
Some of these are specific to certain versions of the System Menu , while others are not but require you to own a certain Wii game in order to use them .
System Menu 3.4 And Below System Menu 4.2 And Below System Menu 4.3 Any System Menu Any System Menu Any System Menu PAL ONLY ( NTSC-U/J use Yu - Gi-Vah ) Any System Menu Any System Menu Any System Menu NTSC-U/NTSC-J/PAL
/ / Any System Menu ( Requires Internet Channel ) Any System Menu Any System Menu
Using a loader
Download the HackMii Installer .
Extract the HackMii Installer to find the boot.elf
Place the boot.elf file in the root ( SD :/ ) of your SD card .
Boot the loader that will work for your System Menu .
Wait for the Hackmii Installer to run tests on your Wii Press when told to continue installing HBC and BootMii .
NOTE : Newer Wii Remotes with WiiMotion + integrated will not work with the Hackmii Installer .
You 'll need to use ( borrow from a friend ? ) the older Wii Remote style and perform a red-button synchronisation on the System Menu to use the Hackmii Installer .
As in Hackmii Installer v1.0 , Wii Remotes with WiiMotion + will work .
The installation should be automatic from this point on , and your Wii will reboot .
Using a DVD
The DVD method requires a drivechip and wo n't work with the 3.3 firmware update or newer .
DVD images for the more recent versions are currently unavailable , though you can install beta8 and then update .
Using a previous unsigned code - loading method
If you have an older version of the Homebrew Channel or another means of executing unsigned code , you can use the auto update function to install the latest version .
Configuring Applications
In order to make an application appear in the Homebrew Channel , the following steps must be taken :
Make a folder on the root of your SD card called " apps " .
In the folder " apps , " create a folder for the application ( for this example , ScummVM will be used ) .
Copy the files for the application into its folder ( e.g. apps / scummvm / ) .
Find the executable file ( either .elf or .dol ) and rename it to boot.elf ( or boot . dol if it was a .dol file ) if it is not already named that ( e.g. apps/scummvm/boot.dol ) .
If the app comes with these files , copy the icon.png and meta.xml files into this folder .
Now the application will appear in the Homebrew Channel .
However , if the application did not come with icon.png or meta.xml , its appearance on the menu is ugly , and difficult to distinguish from other applications .
To fix this , text and an image can be added .
Adding Text
To add text to an application in the Homebrew Channel , do the following : ( note : you may install the Homebrew Browser and download pre-formatted apps without performing this step for every app )
Make a file in the folder of the application ( e.g. apps / ScummVM / ) called " meta.xml " ( e.g. apps / ScummVM/meta.xml ) .
Open " meta.xml " in Notepad and add the following text as a template : <?xml version = " 1.0 " encoding = " UTF - 8 " standalone = " yes " ? > < app version = " 1 " > < name ></name > < coder ></ coder > < version ></version > < release_date ></release_date > < short_description></short_description > < long_description></long_description > </ app >
Add the appropriate information in between the relevant indicators .
For example , the name of the application goes between < name > and </ name > .
The purpose of each field is as follows : <?xml version = " 1.0 " encoding = " UTF - 8 " standalone = " yes " ? > < app version= " 1 " > < name > The name of the application </ name > < coder >
The name of the person or group that wrote the code for the program .</ coder > < version > The version of the application .</ version > < release_date >
The data the application was released .
It has to be a timestamp using this format : YYYYmmddHHMMSS</release_date > < short_description > This is displayed on the main menu of the Homebrew Channel ( before you select an application ) and is used as a space to add a few words to describe the program .</short_description > < long_description > This is displayed once the application is chosen .
It describes the program and its function in great detail , and can be used to elaborate on a program 's controls.</long_description > </ app >
An example of a completed " meta.xml " for ScummVM is provided below :
<?xml version = " 1.0 " encoding = " UTF - 8 " standalone = " yes " ? > < app version = " 1 " > < name > ScummVM</name > < coder > dhewg </ coder > < version > rev32231</version > < release_date>20080523000000</release_date > < short_description > Point & Click Adventures </ short_description > < long_description > ScummVM is a program which allows you to run certain classic graphical point - and - click adventure games , provided you already have their data files .
The clever part about this : ScummVM just replaces the executables shipped with the games , allowing you to play them on systems for which they were never designed !
Some of the adventures ScummVM supports include Adventure Soft's Simon the Sorcerer 1 and 2 ; Revolution 's Beneath A Steel Sky , Broken Sword 1 and Broken Sword 2 ; Flight of the Amazon Queen ; Wyrmkeep 's Inherit the Earth ; Coktel Vision 's Gobliiins ; Westwood Studios ' The Legend of Kyrandia and games based on LucasArts ' SCUMM ( Script Creation Utility for Maniac Mansion ) system such as Monkey Island , Day of the Tentacle , Sam and Max and more .
</long_description > </ app >
Optional meta.xml XML nodes
The following nodes must be children of the < app > node .
Additionally supported by The Homebrew Channel ( starting with v1.0.7 ) :
node name meaning example arguments list of arguments passed to the loaded application as argc and argv < arguments > < arg >-- loaded - by - hbc</arg > < arg > insane argument with spaces </ arg > </ arguments > ahb_access
Requests full hardware access ( AHBPROT ) < ahb_access / >
FAQ
Q : Is this required to get full hardware access ?
Adding an Icon
See also : Homebrew Channel icons
In order to make icons for the Homebrew Channel show up , they must be in .png format with dimensions of 128x48 pixels .
The full alpha channel can be used .
Copy it into the folder of the application under the name " icon.png " ( e.g. apps/scummvm/icon.png ) .
Complete Setup Format
You should have a compatible SD or SDHC card .
See here for a list of SD and SDHC cards known to be compatible or incompatible .
Note : it is by no means a complete list .
An SD card should be formatted in FAT16 or FAT32 .
After you have installed the apps on your SD card , its folder structure should look something like this :
Removable Disk ( eg : ( E : ) on Windows and where it is mounted to on Linux or Mac OS X eg : /media / disk / ) apps ScummVM boot.dol meta.xml ( Optional ) icon.png ( Optional ) WiiShopInstaller boot.dol meta.xml( Optional ) icon.png ( Optional )
If you have any problems having your Applications showing up on the ' HBC ' , make sure you are following the correct format .
Loading from USB
Apps on your USB storage device are stored like on a SD card .
Controls
You can use to navigate though the app list .
or Action / Up / Down / Page left / Page right Select Menu + or Scroll text Back Settings Swap view Shutdown + Screenshots
Uninstall
Removing the channel can be done by simply deleting it with the channel management in the Wii system software .
Compatibility
Note : The Homebrew Channel requires that you system have at least one unpatched IOS in order to guarantee reliable performance ; we 've received too many bug reports that were later traced to misbehaving versions of IOS .
The HackMii Installer will automatically choose an appropriate ( unpatched ) IOS to use when installing the Homebrew Channel ; if you attempt to defeat this safety measure by replacing its IOS with a corrupted version , you may experience an " impaired HBC experience " ( an upside - down screen or a warning message at every startup ) .
Please just do n't do it .
Themes
As of 1.0.7 , The Homebrew Channel is capable of theming .
The images and fonts are stored in a theme.zip , which can be executed like a boot . dol from the Homebrew Channel .
For a theme database and a " How to install " guide , check this page .
Further details on this can be found at Hackmii .
Fonts
As for 1.1.0 , you can use your own TrueType or OpenType fonts with The Homebrew Channel .
You can assign a font , size , and color to individual GUI elements :
element ID meaning label Labels ( background info , group headings , " Author " and " Version " ) button Buttons ( and " radio " buttons ) button_desel Radio buttons ( not currently selected ) dlgtitle Message box title memo
Text box ( description or message ) appname Application name in main browser appdesc Application description in main browser
Each font can be specified using a < font > element inside the theme.xml file .
You can specify the file , size , and color like this :
< font target = " memo, dlgtitle " > < file>foo.ttf</file > < size >16</size > < color >< red>0</red >< green>0</green >< blue>0</blue >< alpha>255</alpha></color > </ font >
As you can see , each < font > element can be assigned to one or multiple targets , separated by commas .
There can also be a single < font > element with no target attribute that overrides the defaults for the entire theme .
The rule is that for each font , each parameter ( size , color , font name ) gets individually looked up first in a < font > element with the specific target ; if it does n't exist or does n't have that parameter , it gets looked up in the base < font > element , and if that does n't exist or does n't have that parameter , the default is used .
You should no longer use the old < font_color > element ( though it is still supported for backwards compatibility ) .
As an example , the following theme.xml ( combined with the appropriate TTF files ) sets up the fonts exactly the same way as they are by default , but without actually falling back to the defaults :
<?xml version = " 1.0 " encoding = " UTF - 8 " standalone = " yes " ? > < theme version= " 1 " > < description > Droid Sans font </ description > < font > < file >DroidSans-Bold.ttf</file > < size >16</size > </ font > < font target = " button , dlgtitle , appname " > < size>20</size > </ font > < font target = " memo " > < file >DroidSans.ttf</file > < size >16</size > </ font > < font target = " button_desel " > < file >DroidSans.ttf</file > < size>20</size > </ font > </ theme >
Additionally , you can specify that the theme supports certain CKJ languages in its fonts , to enable those translations ( though currently only Japanese is supported ) .
Specify the language codes separated by commas as the langs attribute of the main < theme > element :
< theme version = " 1 " langs = " ja " >
Keep in mind that the button and button_desel fonts should always be different in some way ( weight , size , color ) .
Otherwise , you will not be able to tell the currently selected options in the options menu .

FAQ
The official FAQ from the developers of the Homebrew Channel can be found here .
Easter Eggs
Pop the Bubbles !
Being able to pop the bubbles in the background of the HBC was a frequent request , and as of 1.0 , it is possible .
Press + and the animated background will be the only thing visible , along with a score counter in the bottom right hand corner .
Place the hand cursor over any bubble and it will pop , spawning smaller bubbles and adding to the score counter .
The smaller bubbles can also be popped .
When you are done , press + again to return to the list of applications .
If you leave the wii on this screen for too long , it will crash .
NOTE : As of version HBC 1.0.5 the Pop the bubbles ( with scoring ) is removed .
You can still pop the bubbles ( without scoring ) by pointing at the bubbles as usual , but you cannot prompt a score board .
You can also remove the SD Card ( and / or USB drive ) to make more room on the screen .

By Marta Harnecker , translated by Federico Fuentes for Links International Journal of Socialist Renewal
1 . In the previous article , we stated that a large section of the party left has found it very difficult to work with social movements and develop ties with the new social forces in recent decades .
This has been due to several factors .
2 . While the right wing has demonstrated great political initiative , the left tends to be on the defensive .
While the former uses its control of the institutions of the state and the mass media , as well as its economic influence , to impose its new model , subservient to financial capital and monopolies , that has precipitated privatisations , labour deregulation and all the other aspects of the neoliberal economic program , to increase social fragmentation and foment anti-partyism , the party left , on the other hand , has almost exclusively limited its political work to the use of current institutionality , subordinating itself to the rules of the game imposed by the enemy , and hardly ever taking them by surprise .
The level of absurdity is such that the calendar of struggle of the left is set by the right .
3 . How often have we heard the left complain about the adverse conditions it had to face during elections campaign , after discovering that its electoral results were not what it was expecting ?
Yet the very same left seldom denounces the rules of the game imposed on it , nor proposes electoral reforms , during its electoral campaigns .
On the contrary , what tends to occur is that in seeking votes -- instead of carrying out an educational , pedagogical campaign that serves to increase the organisation and awareness of the people -- the left uses the same techniques to sell its candidates that the ruling classes uses .
4 . On the other hand , the current rules of the game imposed by the dominant classes hinder the unity of the left and foment personality - based politics .
In some countries , the left is forced to work to support its own party instead of for a broader front , because if it does n’t the party tends to disappear from the political sphere .
5 . This means that , when electoral defeats occur , the frustration , wearing down and debts incurred during the campaign are compounded by the fact that the electoral effort does not translate into political growth , leaving a bitter sense of having wasted their time .
The situation would be very different if campaigns were conceived from a pedagogical point of view , where election campaigns are used to deepen awareness and popular organisation .
Then , even if the electoral results are not the most favourable , the time and effort invested in the campaign are not wasted .
6 . It is not surprising that some argue that the cult of the institution has been the Trojan horse that the ruling system has been able to introduce into the fortress of the revolutionary left , thus attacking the left from inside .
7 . The work of the ranks is progressively delegated to people who hold public and administrative positions .
Majority effort stops being directed towards collective action and are redirected towards parliamentary action or building a media presence .
8. Militant action has tended to be reduced to activities on election day , putting ‑up posters and other such trivial public acts .
9 . And , even worse , party financing is increasingly relying on the participation of party cadres in state institutions : parliament , local government , election boards , etc. , with all that this entails , in terms of dependency and undue pressure .
10 .
The political activity of the left cannot be reduced to the conquest of institutions ; it must be directed towards changing those institutions in order to be able to transform reality .
A new balance of forces must be created so that the necessary changes can be implemented .
We have to understand that we cannot build a political force without building a social force .
11 . At the same time , we must also avoid “ partyising ” all initiatives and the social movements we relate to ; on the contrary , effort must be made to bring together their practices into a single political project .
12 . Additionally , the party left has had a hard time adjusting to the new realities .
On many occasions it has remained firmly locked into rigid conceptual frameworks that prevents it from appreciating the potentiality of the new social subjects , exclusively focusing efforts on forces that have traditionally mobilised , such as trade unions , that today are much weaker due to a variety of factors .
13 . Lastly , one of the greatest difficulties for the party left regarding work with the social left has been the viewpoint that sees social movements as conveyor belts for the party .
The leadership of the movement , positions in leadership bodies , the platform of struggle , that is everything , is decided by party leaders and only afterwards is the line of march taken to the social movement in question , without allowing them to participate in the process of deciding the matters that affect them directly .
14 . Summing up , in order for the party left to develop strong bonds with the social left , the party left must renew itself ideologically , change its political culture and work methods , and incorporate into its arsenal the innovative forms of struggle and resistance utilised by the social left .

For the last 30 years or so , our homes have been growing .
The square footage in the average home today is TWICE what it was during our parent ’s grade school years and up until recently , this trend did n’t seem stoppable .
Then the bubble burst and we found out that we really did n’t need a 4,500 square foot home with amenities galore .
The McMansion could be going the way of the mastodon as home buyers discover the joys of less maintenance , less cost , and more family togetherness .
Whether you ’re considering building a new home or buying and existing smaller home , there are some distinct advantages .
A smaller home might just be the home of your dreams .
1 . A smaller home is cheaper up front .
A smaller initial cost means less down payment , less points on your mortgage , and a smaller monthly payment for your budget .
If you can swing it , putting more than 20 percent down might even get you a better interest rate and will certainly exempt you from private mortgage insurance , saving you a substantial amount .
2 . A smaller home saves energy .
So long as it ’s properly constructed and insulated , a smaller home has less cubic footage to heat and cool , provided you do n’t build one with 14 foot ceilings !
Smaller homes have fewer windows ( energy leaks ) , fewer exterior doors ( energy leaks ) , and smaller HVAC systems to run which will help save energy .
3 . A smaller home is expandable .
So long as you plan for it ( and sometimes even if you do n’t ) , a smaller home can be expanded .
If you think your parents may move in with you or you plan on growing your family , plan to build a smaller home with an addition mind .
4 . A smaller home could leave more room for a garden .
If you build a 1,200 square foot home rather than a 2,800 square foot home , you ’ll have more space to grow vegetables and flowers !
5 . A smaller home is cheaper to decorate .
Do we really need a breakfast nook and a full - size dining room ?
How about a living room and a den ?
Every room you eliminate is one less room to heat , cool , and decorate .
6 . A smaller home forces us to have a “ home . ”
When there ’s four people in a 4,500 square foot monster , each of them in a separate part of the house “ doing their own thing , ” there is n’t any family togetherness .
I know .
My home is no where near that size but the five of us seem to rarely be in the same room – together .
7 . A smaller home gives you peace of mind .
Half the size could mean half the price – and half the payment .
If you lose your job , would n’t a 50 percent smaller house payment be nice ?
8 . A smaller home saves on maintenance and cleaning .
They have fewer windows to wash , fewer gutters to clean , less semi-annual maintenance to do , and a smaller roof to one day replace .
Your broom , mop and vacuum cleaner will last longer .
You might not need that maid anymore .
9 . A smaller home can be more durable .
Since you ’re constructing less square footage ( and that is typically how a home builder prices his homes ) , you can afford to buy more durable materials ( which are usually more expensive ) .
10 . A smaller home eliminates the temptation to spend .
If you do n’t have anywhere to put all the stuff you ’re tempted to buy , you might buy less !
11 . A smaller home gets you outside more often .
With less space , you ’ll probably be more inclined to enjoy the outdoors more , giving you the motivation to exercise or just enjoy the sunshine and that garden I mentioned .
12 . A smaller home is more customizable .
If you ’re spending less to construct the home , you may have more funds to install fancier counter - tops , nicer faucets , better cabinets , or premium flooring .
You have less space , so you ’ll buy less of those upgraded products anyway !
Have you considered scaling down to a smaller home ?
Leslie A. Lyons , an assistant professor at the School of Veterinary Medicine at the University of California , Davis , explains .
Over the course of evolution , purring has probably offered some selective advantage to cats .
Most felid species produce a " purr - like " vocalization .
In domestic cats , purring is most noticeable when an animal is nursing her kittens or when humans provide social contact via petting , stroking or feeding .
Although we assume that a cat 's purr is an expression of pleasure or is a means of communication with its young , perhaps the reasons for purring can be deciphered from the more stressful moments in a cat 's life .
Cats often purr while under duress , such as during a visit to the veterinarian or when recovering from injury .
Thus , not all purring cats appear to be content or pleased with their current circumstances .
This riddle has lead researchers to investigate how cats purr , which is also still under debate .
Scientists have demonstrated that cats produce the purr through intermittent signaling of the laryngeal and diaphragmatic muscles .
Cats purr during both inhalation and exhalation with a consistent pattern and frequency between 25 and 150 Hertz .
Various investigators have shown that sound frequencies in this range can improve bone density and promote healing .
This association between the frequencies of cats ' purrs and improved healing of bones and muscles may provide help for some humans .
Bone density loss and muscle atrophy is a serious concern for astronauts during extended periods at zero gravity .
Their musculo - skeletal systems do not experience the normal stresses of physical activity , including routine standing or sitting , which requires strength for posture control .
Because cats have adapted to conserve energy via long periods of rest and sleep , it is possible that purring is a low energy mechanism that stimulates muscles and bones without a lot of energy .
The durability of the cat has facilitated the notion that cats have " nine lives " and a common veterinary legend holds that cats are able to reassemble their bones when placed in the same room with all their parts .
Purring may provide a basis for this feline mythology .
The domestication and breeding of fancy cats occurred relatively recently compared to other pets and domesticated species , thus cats do not display as many muscle and bone abnormalities as their more strongly selected carnivore relative , the domestic dog .
Perhaps cats ' purring helps alleviate the dysplasia or osteoporotic conditions that are more common in their canid cousins .
Although it is tempting to state that cats purr because they are happy , it is more plausible that cat purring is a means of communication and a potential source of self - healing .

BNP leader Nick Griffin will sit in the European Parliament The BNP has won its first two seats in the European Parliament .
BNP leader Nick Griffin was elected for the North West region while Andrew Brons picked up another BNP seat in Yorkshire and Humber .
Mr Griffin said the party gained votes from other parties because it " spoke openly about the problem of immigration . "
The BNP polled fewer votes in the North West region than it had in 2004 - but the slump in Labour support meant its share of the vote increased .
BBC
News website readers have been telling us why they decided to vote for the party .
MARK , TEIGNMOUTH
I 've never voted in the past , but I wanted to vote now .
I decided to vote for the BNP because I like what they are saying .
They have an opinion and I want them to be heard .
I do n't like the way the country has been run to date .
I have seen British culture being eroded in the past few years , and British people being made to feel like second class citizens in their own country .
I must stress that I am not racist , but I do believe that when in Rome , do as the Romans do .
I have no problem with skilled immigrants who come here and add to our economy and more importantly fit in with our way of life .
I do have a problem with so called ' no go zones ' for whites .
Some of my family are from Luton , and they will all tell you of the racial tension there .
It simply does n't work when you have mass uncontrolled immigration with no regard for the views of the native British people .
The BNP want to deport all criminal and illegal immigrants .
What on earth is wrong with that ?
Do we want other countries ' criminals here ?
The BNP 's view on foreign affairs is also good .
It means no more illegal and immoral wars .
No more invading other countries for ' peace keeping ' missions .
We will trade with other countries when it benefits us .
Is n't that what trade is supposed to be about ?
I 'm totally sick to death of our country being run by out of touch politicians
The BNP will raise speed limits on the motorway !
Hooray !
Why on earth is the limit 70 miles - per -hour ?
Cars of today are far more advanced than cars of 30 - 40 years ago .
Yet the speed limit has n't changed .
The BNP will also stop persecuting motorists .
This will be a welcome move , as I 'm sick to death of the government using speed cameras , roadside traps and parking tickets as a source of revenue .
If the BNP were in power the police would actually be fighting crime rather than hassling innocent people .
People think the BNP is racist .
Is it racist to want to look after your country ?
I certainly do n't think so .
And I 'm totally sick to death of our country being run by out of touch politicians who have everyone else but the native British peoples interests at heart .
JAMES , HARROGATE
I voted BNP and have done in the past .
The current political crisis did n't affect my decision , I voted BNP as I 'm sick of mass immigration which no mainstream British party is interested in tackling .
if we have jobs available we should be training people who live in the UK to do those jobs
The fact that the BNP have won seats just goes to show the main parties that they are not tackling the issues that matter to people .
I believe immigrants do contribute to our economy , but if we have jobs available we should be training people who live in the UK to do those jobs .
We should n't be inviting more people in .
The country is already overpopulated , and there are n't enough homes for the people already here .
I have two children who go to state school , and education is another worrying topic .
There are now 15 state schools in the UK where not one child speaks English as a first language .
A fifth of state schools now have a white minority .
Education will suffer if teachers are having to spend more time teaching children who do n't speak English as a first language .
It ca n't be possibly be right that our government continues to force mass immigration on us .
That is why I voted BNP .
ANDY , CAMBRIDGE
I voted BNP for the first time in these elections as I wanted to use my vote as a protest against the mainstream parties .
I have previously voted Conservative .
It was a tactic to raise awareness about what is happening in this country .
Andy : ' It will refocus attention on the issues that matter ' I feel that the main parties are too busy these days trying to get the minority vote .
To them gaining power seems more important than representing the views of the majority of people in this country .
The main parties no longer represent my views .
People are worried about immigration , they are worried about their jobs , and we are n't giving enough support to the workers in this country .
I do n't agree with everything the BNP say .
I think people should be free to marry who they chose regardless of race .
But you have to make tough decisions .
The focus of politics in this country is out of balance with too much emphasis on minority views .
I voted BNP to try and redress this balance .
I 'm glad the BNP has won two seats , it will refocus attention on the issues that matter to the people of this country .
MORE OF YOUR COMMENTS
I voted for the BNP this year for the first time after viewing the various policies online of other parties .
I absolutely did not do this out of any disrespect for other cultures or race , indeed several of my close friends are of ethnic minority backgrounds and I am very happy to say that they are my friends and enrich my life very much .
The reasons I voted for them were because I agreed with their more ' old fashioned values ' in certain respects ( ie , a more hardline approach to policing and welfare handouts ) and I think it is ridiculous that Europe dictates almost everything we do !
I wanted to send a clear message to the mainstream parties that I am not happy with the ' soft ' politics in place today .
Anon , Blackburn , Lancashire I voted BNP and I 'm very pleased that they have won two seats .
Being in the Yorkshire and Humber , I am pleased that my vote has for once counted .
Despite thoughts of many , especially media who are supposed to be impartial , I am not racist nor condone racism .
I do however agree with 90 % of the BNP 's policies which I cannot say about the other parties .
The country has become a laughing stock and an easy free ride for people who come into the country with nothing .
The ordinary person is ignored and what 's more I do not see why we cannot celebrate St Georges day incase we offend others .
It 's part of our country 's heritage .
Jolene , West Yorkshire I voted BNP for the first time and so did my family , immigration is a huge issue and so is the fact the UK is becoming PC mad .
We feel it will take a party who is willing to speak out to actually do some thing rather than avoiding all the questions put to them like all the main stream parties .
Mark Smithys , Huddersfield I voted for the BNP for the first time in the European elections .
I read the party 's policies , they are not racist , they simply want to look after people who are British first , and that includes all races who have a right to be here .
Our elderly citizens are not getting the care they deserve
People who work and contribute to our country and society ( irrespective of colour or religion ) are welcome and people who come here for our benefits system and the NHS who have never contributed to this country are not so welcome .
Neither are bogus asylum seekers and criminals .
We have enough of our own .
I have every sympathy with people from countries where the system is not so generous , but we can't look after all of them in Britain .
We 're full up , and our elderly citizens are not getting the care they deserve .
It 's because we are so generous that everyone wants to come here , to the detriment of people who have lived here all their lives , paid their taxes and deserve to have their place in the queue .
Nick , Oxford
They are upfront and clear in wanting to change the terrible immigration laws that exist in the UK whilst all other parties hide away from the real issues .
They are publically stating what the majority in this country knows to be true .
Jason Duncan , Aberdeenshire I voted for the BNP , as I did not trust any of the main parties on the EU Issue .
They all seem to ne too cosy to the EU and not standing up for the UK but give the EU anything they want .
Maybe with the increase of the BNP vote the main parties will take on board what has been said and not put the voters to one side with the " we know what is best for you . "
They are there at our behest not for their own gain .
Andrew Smith , Plymouth , Devon I 'm no supporter of the BNP , but if the other parties are worried about the BNP praying on people 's fears and turning them inwards , the option open to these parties is to deal pro-actively with immigration .
It is a massive problem and the people are increasingly worried about the effects of immigration on many aspects of their lives , not least of all employment .
And surely the BNP is no worse than any other party for praying on people 's fears , the most powerful tool there is
Bruce , East Kilbride , Scotland Surely Harriet Harman has entirely missed the point .
Whilst I abhor the BNP 's policies and their party in general , it was n't fear that led to the BNP getting into Europe , it was clearly an easy choice for the voters given Labour 's recent less than shoddy performance and headline - grabbing lack of trust in their ability to run a country .
They 've only themselves to blame .
Jonathan Edwards , Hove , UK Liam
Fox is absolutely right in his comment .
The main parties have allowed this to happen through their contempt for the section of the electorate to whom the BNP appeal .
Their concerns have been dismissed as ' fears ' by the political classes and have not been listened to .
The BNP claims to have listened and has reaped the electoral reward .
( Besides , are not all political issues fears of some form ?
Fears of economic instability , fears of loss of personal freedoms etc )

Details from the July issue of OXM leaked onto the net , this morning and it ’s full of Mass Effect 2 information along with some DLC talk for the first Mass Effect .
It is suggested that you take most of this as rumor until the new issue is released , but E3 will have already happened by then , so when it comes out , more than likely we will already know all of this .
As far as DLC for the original Mass Effect , that is not too much of a shocker because more gameplay for the title was was promised back in February .
It will , however , be the last bit of anything until the sequel comes out .
“ We are definitely working on a substantial new DLC , ” said BioWare to OXM .
“ We ’re finishing it up and making sure that it ’s going to be really good , and then we ’ll announce it , probably pretty [ soon ] .
“ That ’ll be the last thing between Mass Effect 1 and 2 in terms of content . ”
However , most of the article in the mag talks about what will be shown by BioWare at E3 regarding Mass Effect 2 .
Apparently this entails whether Shepard is really dead , the new transit system , exploration of new worlds , who you will play , and more information on Thane .
More is posted after the break .

The information is as follows :
You will play as Shepard , but for how long is unknown
There is a new species called the Drell and Thane is a new character who is an assassin and may join your party
Planets –
There will be a Krogan planet , and Illium , an Asari planet , that is like Coruscant from SW .
Also there is “ Omega ” with is like an anti-Citadel in that it ’s huge and it ’s the bottom of the barrel whereas the Citadel is the height of civilization .
Also a Cerebus mothership will act as a location of significance .
Story –
The ultimate story is still civilization fending off the Reapers , but this chapter will deal with this Cerebus corporation and it ’s enigmatic leader .
There are human civilizations disappearing and it ’s up to Shepard to investigate , it ’s termed as a “ suicide mission ” which may lead to the details of the teaser .
New vehicle that controls better than the Mako…a “ new ” control scheme .
Totally revamped inventory system
Elevator system revamped where you will get the sense of scope of where you ’re at and where you ’re traveling .
No more texture pop in .
Secondary races like Volus and Elcor are much more mobile , giving more depth and makes things more interesting .
Choices are more meaningful and there is a real risk that major support characters ( i.e. anyone not Shepard ) can and will die .
Also on the story , they ’re super - hyping the ending , saying that it ’s much more grand meaningful in ME2 .
More weapons , more species , more / new team members .
returning team members , locations , weapons .
There is loads more over on NeoGAF , so hit the link for more .
Again , do n’t take any of this as fact until the new issue of OXM is released .

Clever marketing from the folks at Cisco ( CSCO ) .
Just how do you sell something as yawn - worthy for most people as Internet router specs ?
Well , Cisco is satirically treating its ASR 9000 router as a Valentine 's Day Present .
We got a giggle out of this , but will it sell any business ?
There 's really only a tiny handful of people with the budgetary authority to buy stuff like this .
If even only a few them smile and think of Cisco more as a funny cool friend than a stodgy IT firm , it was worth it .
THE “ 2009 version of a show trial ” is how Robert Monks , a veteran corporate - governance activist , describes the annual meeting last month of Exxon Mobil shareholders .
After being presented with “ an extremely lavish offering of coffees and various pastries ” by the company , Mr Monks proposed five shareholder motions , relating to matters such as the separation of the posts of chairman and chief executive , currently both held by Rex Tillerson .
Each time he was allowed to speak for exactly three minutes , after which , as in previous years , Mr Tillerson simply stated that the management opposed the resolution .
It had already been defeated by proxy votes cast by shareholders who did not attend the meeting — so why bother engaging Mr Monks in debate ?
There was a question period , but it was without any genuine interaction .
According to Mr Monks , Mr Tillerson shrugged off most questions — although when one shareholder asked why the meeting did not take place in New Jersey , the state in which the oil giant is incorporated , rather than Dallas , Mr Tillerson replied , “ I like Texas ” .
Bloomberg News
Tillerson : shrugging off questions
Exxon Mobil is not alone in giving the appearance of regarding the annual meeting as a pointless legal obligation , a sort of tax on the time of the executives and board which must be endured with the least possible effort .
Indeed , there is no reason to think that Exxon Mobil is a particularly serious offender : at least it provides decent pastries , and the entire board attends .
Contrast that with an infamous annual meeting of Home Depot shareholders in 2006 .
Bob Nardelli , the retailer 's then boss , was the only director to show up .
Large clocks were used to keep the utterances of talkative shareholders to a minimum .
Mr Nardelli , whose combative style earned the firm the nickname “ Home Despot ” , did not take questions .
The whole event was over in less than 40 minutes .
Mr Nardelli was fired soon after , in part because of shareholders ' fury at his annual - meeting arrogance — though more because he had failed , despite a huge pay package , to move the firm 's share price in the right direction .
The annual meeting is the most visible evidence that the democracy at the heart of corporate governance ( especially in America , where shareholders struggle even to propose motions for discussion or candidates for the board ) is a sham .
Moreover , it is a sham that few people other than activists such as Mr Monks care a damn about .
And even he has decided no longer to attend the Exxon Mobil meetings , having concluded that his presence serves only to legitimise the sham .
One of the great questions surrounding corporate governance is why the big institutional shareholders , which tend to vote in support of management , go along with such a sham .
Why do they not act as responsible owners and insist that management take shareholder democracy more seriously ?
They typically leave attendance at annual meetings to activists and trade - union shareholders , which in turn gives corporate managers the excuse they need to not take the meetings seriously .
The fact that the meetings are dominated by groups pursuing their own obsessions ( labour practices in the developing world , say , or disinvestment from dodgy regimes ) is also used by management to argue against reforms that would make them more accountable — such as making it easier to nominate candidates for the board or to force a vote on executive pay .
One obvious reason why institutional shareholders do not take more care in exercising their votes is that they are too busy trying to beat the market in the short term , so as to earn juicy bonuses , even though taking their duties as owners more seriously would lead to companies performing better in the long term .
Public trust in business has plunged during the current economic crisis , as a new report by the Arthur Page Society and the Business Roundtable points out .
But considering that many financial firms failed in the recent crisis under boards elected by docile institutional shareholders , it is surprising that there is not even more popular outrage , and indeed lawsuits , over the institutions ' failure to look after their clients ' money properly .
Yet it does not have to be this way .
Last month shareholders flocked , as usual , to the annual meeting of Berkshire Hathaway , an event that has become known as “ Woodstock for Capitalists ” .
This year , Warren Buffett , the firm 's boss , invited some leading journalists to pose questions to the management for the first time — an idea that other companies would do well to copy .
Indeed , given the grievous errors many bosses have made , and the public 's loss of faith in them , it would do them no harm to pay a bit more attention to what their critics say .

There are also several excellent event descriptions with photos here .
In an unprecedented feat , British surgeons implanted a donor heart in a dying toddler whose own heart was too weak to sustain life , then removed it 10 years later after the girl ’s own heart had fully recovered .
The technique is unlikely to become widespread because of the severe shortage of pediatric donor hearts , but it suggests that better mechanical assist devices that take some or all of the load off a diseased heart could allow time for weakened hearts to heal themselves .
The procedure , reported online Monday in the medical journal Lancet , shows that “ the heart has reparative capabilities that we suspected it might have , but for which we have really lacked a great deal of proof , ” said Dr. Douglas Zipes of Indiana University , a former president of the American College of Cardiology .
“ We need to understand better how it does it , capitalize on that and be able to use it in routine therapy . ”
There have been cases in which a second heart was implanted , then failed “ and the patients were able to go on for a while with the native heart , ” said Dr. Matthias Loebe , director of thoracic transplantation and assist devices at the Baylor College of Medicine , one of the leading U.S. centers for heart surgery in children .
“ But there has never been anything similar to this reported in the literature .
That ’s impressive . ”

As the journal article recounts :
In July 1995 , Hannah Clark was 2 years old and suffering from dilated cardiomyopathy , in which the heart becomes weakened and enlarged and cannot pump blood efficiently .
The problem is most often caused in young children by genetics or viruses , and affects 1.2 to 1.4 children per 100,000 .
The prognosis is normally very poor .
Noted heart surgeon Dr. Magdi Yacoub of Imperial College London and Harefield Hospital grafted a donor heart , obtained from a 5 - month - old infant , in parallel to Hannah ’s own heart -- allowing it to take over the bulk of pumping duty , a procedure known as a heterotopic heart transplant .
The procedure required substantial doses of immunosuppressive drugs to prevent the heart from being rejected .
The heart functioned efficiently , and Hannah was soon able to lead a normal life , but the drugs began to produce their own problems -- allowing the development of a virus - related cancer called Epstein - Barr virus - associated post - transplant lymphoproliferative disorder .
The cancer was suppressed with courses of powerful drugs , but it kept recurring , and surgeons reduced the dose of anti-rejection drugs to help Hannah ’s body fight it .

By February 2006 , the reduced doses of immunosuppressive drugs were interfering with the donor heart ’s function : Hannah was near kidney failure , was having difficulty breathing and at one point her family was told she had less than 12 hours to live .
Yacoub and Dr. Victor Tsang of the Great Ormond Street Hospital in London decided to remove the donor heart and stop the drugs altogether .
Hannah , now 16 , has fully recovered from her cancer , her heart is functioning normally , and she is able to carry out all the activities of a teenage girl .
Today , children with weakened hearts are occasionally treated with an implanted left ventricular assist device , a form of artificial heart that assumes some of the load from the patient ’s heart .
Such devices are typically left in for a few months to a year or two .

That Hannah ’s piggybacked heart could be successfully removed after 10 years is “ remarkable , ” said Dr. Kathy Magliato , director of women ’s cardiac services at St. John ’s Hospital in Santa Monica and a spokeswoman for the American Heart Assn .
The family , which lives in Mountain Ash near Cardiff , Wales , appeared at a London news conference Monday .
Hannah burst into tears when a journalist asked her how the surgery had changed her life .
“ Thanks to this operation [ removal of the heart ] , I ’ve now got a normal life just like all my friends , ” she said .
She added that she cherished every moment and that she now plays sports and has a part - time job working with animals , which would have been impossible before she stopped taking the transplant drugs .
Hannah ’s mother , Liz , praised the family whose daughter provided the donor heart : “ They lost a child , we ’ve gained a child .
How can I ever thank them ? ”

I do n’t want to get into the entire IRMA vs Eircom and IRMA vs ISPs debacle .
The only reason I ’m even writing this is because I ’m getting a bit tired of all the “ quotes ” of “ quotes ” and other unclear and misleading things that people have been saying about ISPs over the last few weeks .
To start with , we at Blacknight are not an access provider .
Basically that means that we do not provide broadband services ( internet access ) to anyone .
We provide hosting , domain registration and a lot of other services .
We are , however , members of both RIPE and ISPAI
So I was more than a bit taken aback when we got a letter from solicitors representing IRMA ( EMI , Sony , Universal Music and Warner ) .
Since so many people have heard about these letters but so very few people have actually seen one I ’ve taken the liberty of publishing the one we received below ( I ’m not sure if our legal counsel will approve , but I ’m more than a little tired of all the “ cloak and dagger ” ) .
Sorry it ’s a PDF , but I was n’t going to type it out again !
irmaletter.pdf
Since we do n’t provide access , as I ’ve already said , I do n’t see how this can affect us , so I instructed our legal counsel to tell them as much :
Dear Sirs ,
We act as solicitors for Blacknight Internet Solutions Limited who have handed us a copy of yours of the 13th inst .
We have explained the contents in detail to our clients who acknowledges your clients situation .
It is most important to note however that our clients are a hosting provider .
This is distinct to an access provider and our client therefore does not offer DSL or other internet access services .
We understand that the agreement with Eircom relates to DSL services , which make illegal filesharing possible .
Again we reiterate that our clients do not offer this service .
Nor does our client have any subscribers as outlined in your letter .
We sympathise with your clients , we hope you will see that our clients are not involved in such activities and therefore we would be grateful if you would kindly revert and confirm our clients cooperation and also a release from any legal action as mentioned in your aforesaid letter .
Obviously we cannot and will not condone any illegal activity on our network and will quite happily enforce our terms of service should we find them breached .
However the reality is that most of the “ illegal content ” that we do find on our network ends up there due to servers being hacked or people using weak passwords , though there have been exceptions !
Ultimately as a service provider we have to be answerable to our clients as well as the law .
So if someone gets a court order we will act on it , however we will not share client data with $ random 3rd parties .
If you have an issue with one of our clients for whatever reason then get a court order – sending us silly threats is n’t going to work .
Seriously .
Demanding that ISPs act as a replacement for the judicial system , due process and all those lovely things that we expect in a democracy , is unreasonable .
Apart from anything else the privacy issues cannot be ignored .
From a purely business perspective .. it ’s a bit like David taking on Goliath in some respects ..
While there are several large ISPs being targetted , others would n’t be much bigger than ourselves in terms of staff numbers etc. ,
It ’s highly doubtful that any of the smaller providers could really afford to engage in a lengthy and costly legal battle .
I guess we ’ll see how things progress in the coming days and weeks ….
MUSIC NEWS - Soulive , the New York - based funk - powerhouse trio , now with their own record label , Royal Family Records , having released it 's latest studio effort , UP HERE , as a download earlier this year , today released it on CD with a bonus live DVD .
The band has toured nationally this past Spring , launched their own festival , the Royal Family Get Down , and will hit the road again this Fall ( itinerary below ) .
The physical release of UP HERE includes a bonus DVD of footage filmed live at the Blue Note in Tokyo in Summer 2008 .
UP HERE is the debut release on the band 's Royal Family Records .
The album was recorded in Soulive drummer Alan Evan 's Play on Brother Studio in Hatfield , MA in Fall 2008 .
" This is the Soulive album I 've always wanted to record - I 've been hearing it in my head for years , " says Evans , who also tracked and mixed the record .
Soulive 's fall tour begins on Sept 12 at their festival , The Royal Family Get Down .
The line up features Sharon Jones and the Dap Kings , Charlie Hunter Trio , Nigel Hall and Soulive 's own headlining set with special guest , jazz guitarist , John Scofield .
Soulive then heads out west for a series of dates anchored by stops at the Monterey Jazz Festival and four nights at Yoshi's in Oakland and San Francisco .
The fall tour will then head back east for a series of Northeast dates including the Bowery Ballroom in NYC and Burlington 's Higher Ground .
The sperm can reach lengths 10 times that of the ostracods A new method for analysing the interior of fossils has shown that millimetre - long mussel - like crustaceans called ostracods used giant sperm to mate .
Sperm of modern ostracods can reach 10 times their body length .
The technique , known as holotomography , imaged the large sperm pumps and seminal receptacles of well - preserved ostracod fossils found in Brazil .
The results , published in Science , show ostracods had already evolved the giant sperm 100 million years ago .
The samples came from the Santana Formation , which has already yielded a wealth of perfectly preserved fossils , particularly of fish .
Because they are scavengers , ostracods were also found in abundance near some of the fish , with their soft internal organs equally well preserved .
New light Renate Matzke - Karasz of the Ludwig Maximilians University in Germany took Harbinia micropapillosa ostracod fossils , part of the collection of the Natural History Museum in London , to the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in France .
There , light from accelerated particle beams was used to image the interiors of the fossils , yielding a detailed picture of their inner structure .
What the team found was that the sexual organs of the fossils were remarkably similar to those of modern ostracods .
The soft internal organs can be seen between halves of the shell Both males and females have fully separate pairs of organs .
The males have two sperm pumps , or Zenker organs , and the females have two vaginas and large seminal receptacles , separated by a lengthy duct that seems optimised to accommodate the sperm .
" It was very surprising that these structures were so similar to organs we know from modern ones , " Dr Matzke - Karasz told BBC News .
" Now we know that it happened at least 100 million years ago - it developed quite early in the freshwater ostracods . "
Ostracods are not the only animals that use giant sperm as a mating strategy - it has also been seen in the fruit fly Drosophila .
However , because it costs a lot of energy to produce long sperm , it is still unclear to biologists why the strategy arises .
For Dr Matzke - Karasz , the results open a new avenue of research for palaeontologists .
" This holotomography is so helpful ; it could bring out much , much more of fossils which are all over the world in museums , buried in the collections , " she said .

Jacqui Smith has admitted she was not up to being Home Secretary - and should have been given some proper training before she was handed the job .
Ms Smith , who is likely to be remembered for claiming expenses for a porn film watched by her husband , said any success she had was down to luck rather than skill .
She added : " When I became Home Secretary I 'd never run a major organisation .
I hope I did a good job but if I did it was more by luck than by any kind of development of skills .
" I think we should have been better trained .
" I think there should have been more induction . "
When asked by Total Politics magazine if she had worried she was not up to the job , she replied : " Every single time I was appointed to a ministerial job I thought that .
I did n't sleep for a week in 1999 when I got my ministerial job . "
Ms Smith , who was initially a schools minister , suffered a series of scandals and crises when she became Home Secretary .
She was widely regarded as being very nervous when she had to deal with a terror attack on her first day in the job in 2007 .
Ms Smith admitted during the interview : " I 'm not sure I understood , I 'm ashamed to say , when I first heard it , quite how serious it was . "
She was also blamed for the Damian Green affair , when police raided the Tory MP's Commons office while hunting the source of leaks from the Home Office .
The ex-teacher was one of the first MPs embarrassed by her expenses after she listed a room in her sister 's house as her main home when her family lived in a detached house .
It was then revealed husband Richard Timney watched a porn film and she put it on expenses .
She resigned last month .
Two DeKalb County police officers have been placed on paid administrative leave after an investigation revealed they ran a background check on President Barack Obama .
A representative for the DeKalb County CEO ’s office identified the officers as Ryan White and C.M. Route .
Officials said Obama ’s name was typed into a computer inside a DeKalb County police car on July 20 and ran through the National Crime Information Center .
The secret service was immediately notified and contacted the DeKalb County Police Department .
It is unclear why the officers ran a check on the president .
I guess they mean – unclear – aside from the coppers probably being nutball Republican birthers .
Or just a couple of boneheads who forgot what they were told about using the computer .
You are not going to believe this , but there are claims coming out that actor Morgan Freeman , who plays ' God ' in the flicks Bruce and Evan Almighty , has been having sex with his granddaughter since she was a teenager .
Oscar - winning actor Morgan Freeman , who is in the midst of a divorce from wife Myrna of 25 years , has allegedly been having sexual relations with his step - granddaughter E'Dena Hines since she was just a teenager .
According to bombshell report out from the National Enquirer , 72 - year - old Morgan Freeman 's affair with step - granddaughter E'Dena Hines , 27 , began when she was a teen - and the alleged affair not only contributed to his split from Myrna , his wife of 25 years , it also led to his breakup with his longtime mistress , former schoolteacher Mary Joyce Hays .
E'Dena , Morgan 's ex-wife Jeanette Adair Bradshaw 's granddaughter , was raised by Morgan and Myrna " since she was a little girl , " a source reveals to the Enquirer .
The source continues : " Myrna said E'dena told her that when she was a teenager , she and Morgan went to dinner at a friend 's house one evening .
Both had been drinking , and when they returned home , Morgan attempted to have sex with her .
They stopped just short of having intercourse . "
" E'Dena explained to Myrna that she stopped Morgan from going any further . "
Apparently Myrna confronted Morgan about the incident - but while he admitted to doing it , he agreed to never do it again .
Little did Myrna know , Morgan and E'Dena continued the affair for a decade .
The Enquirer also reports that E'Dena has also been Morgan 's escort to several public events , including last summer 's premiere of the blockbuster Bat - flick hit , The Dark Knight .
The insider adds : " Nobody thought anything of it , because she would be introduced as his ' granddaughter . ' "
As for the incest charge , the source says : " It 's not technically incest , because they are not related by blood ...[ but ]
Morgan is trying desperately to keep his divorce out of open court so all the shameful facts wo n't become public . "
Well , to anyone who has raised step children and grandchildren , the word " step " is insignificant .
They love their " step " children as their own , so technically incest or not - it 's still incest .

the return of the alien menace next door
According to a self - proclaimed expert in diplomatic relations with aliens , NASA is about to start an illegal war with an extraterrestrial outpost on the Moon .
Exopolitics expert Alfred Webre has a dire warning for his fellow humans about missions surveying the Moon for water ice with kinetic projectiles and spectrometry .
Not only do they violate international space law , they ’re also bound to affect alien bases on the lunar surface so much , the extraterrestrial powers that be could get pissed off enough to start an interstellar war .
Oh great .
Just when we already have wars and upheavals along half the globe , now NASA ’s lunar bombardments are going to usher in a bloodthirsty horde of aliens that were living on our celestial companion all this time .
I wonder what President Obama ’s advisers will recommend as our skies swarm with advanced battle craft brimming with multi-petawatt lasers and pure fusion devices that could level our biggest cities in one blast .
Pardon me for being a buzzkill but I have to wonder how exactly we could have a qualified expert in exopolitics on our planet and why he ’s not already employed by SETI .
After all , exopolitics refers to studying the dynamics of social interactions between species that evolved on different worlds and without a confirmed discovery of alien bacteria , much less an actual intelligent species that wants to interact with us , I ca n’t imagine there are lots of universities offering qualified , accredited training in this discipline .
To say it bluntly , Webre is making it up as he goes along , giving us distilled ufology and conspiracy theories because without a scientific frame of reference , that ’s all he ’s got .
In the past , I tackled the idea that the Moon is home to an advanced alien species as postulated by a Russian documentary on the subject in a long and detailed post .
The evidence presented by Webre is right in line with those ideas and ultimately suffers from a lack of evidence as his main source is a ufology site which , as it so happens , uses the Russian newspaper Pravda as a backbone for its claims , the very same newspaper that floated the ideas behind the documentary in question .
And even though in Russian , the word “ pravda ” means “ truth , ” this story is a case of eager imaginations of restless conspiracy theorists rather than something being kept secret by the U.S. government .
Just think about it .
The Moon is n’t very far away .
If there ’s activity anywhere around the lunar surface , anyone with a starter telescope could see it .
Obviously there are many more points that have to be addressed for a proper skeptical inquiry and for those , I ’ll refer you to the link above .
But back to Webre ’s claims about the potential to start an interstellar war with an exploratory mission .
If NASA knows all about the supposed alien bases on the lunar surface , why would it send anything to crash into the Moon ?
This is the same NASA which fled after after enough close calls with flying saucers and the nefarious beings guarding these outposts according to the conspiracy theory .
Why would they come back to start a fight with the aliens ?
And what about the Kaguya impact ?
Are n’t those aliens already as ticked off as much as one of the Examiner ’s columnists and it does n’t matter what we do now because we ’ve already infuriated those extraterrestrial rulers and their generals ?
Finally , as the column tries to wade into international law , Webre ’s reasoning that bombarding the Moon is n’t only a potential assault on alien territory , it ’s also illegal , rests on the Moon Treaty of 1979 , a document that ’s ratified by only 13 nations , none of which have any space faring capability .
The reason why no country with an astronaut ever agreed to it is because the treaty seeks to share any and all benefits from space exploration with the entire world according to UN committee which would decide who gets what .
And without signing this treaty , the world ’s space faring nations have no obligation to follow it so for them , it ’s not an international law .
Seems odd that someone with an advanced degree in law does n’t know how this process works , but maybe international law is n’t Webre ’s strong suit .
Look , I know a universe teeming with alien civilizations and awash in political dramas worth of Star Trek is an exponentially more exciting place to inhabit that a world where mundane problems keep over 99.9999 % of the population forever grounded in boring jobs .
But unfortunately we do n’t live in that kind of universe and finding an alien empire is a complex and very risky business .
To say otherwise based on a fanciful tale conjured up in a newspaper once used for Soviet propaganda and then quickly imploded into a cheap tabloid is pretty much like taking the Weekly World News as holy writ and dreaming up complex theories from its highlights .
Maybe instead of bulking up on self - appointed exopolitics experts , the Examiner should finally get a science column and find a competent science writer or two .

Just three years ago , Twitter was merely a dream of a few social media techies .
Today , the online juggernaut has an estimated 4 - 5 million users , and as President Obama can attest , has become one of the most powerful communication tools to hit the web .
Twitter co-founder Biz Stone spoke with Mother Jones about how Twitter has evolved into an AP rival and why people seeking information are like a flock of birds .
Mother Jones :
Biz stone , thank you very much for speaking with us .
Biz Stone : Thank you .
MJ : So what are you doing right now ?
BS : What I ’m doing right now is just finishing up a half day ’s work at Twitter .
Just left some interesting conversations with Ev [ Evan Williams ] and the team about product stuff , and now I ’m talking with you .
MJ : Are you tweeting this ?
BS : [ Laughs . ]
No .
MJ : How would you describe Twitter to my grandmother ?
BS : That ’s a good question .
I think we ’re entering a new phase , so the way I might describe it to her now is as a very simple communications network .
Something to think about would be the telephone or the telegraph , something that ’s very utility - like in her life .
So from her perspective , something that ’s very simple to stay in touch with her grandchildren .
MJ : It seems like Twitter has been criticized somewhat for being the ultimate example of a narcissistic age .
Now that we ’re moving more into an age of shared sacrifice and sobriety is the Twitter theme still going to be in the zeitgeist ?
BS : I think what we ’re actually seeing is humans as a species evolving the way they communicate .
We ’re moving away from more traditional forms of electronic communication like email or instant messaging .
We ’re moving into a space where we communicate openly because there ’s a lot more value in it .
And frankly we ’re just catching up to other species that have been doing it for millions of years , and doing it really well to their advantage .
And so what I see over the last ten years is — and it ’s not just Twitter , although Twitter is a very sort of perfect example of it — but over the last ten years with the evolution of blogging and Flickr and MySpace and Facebook and all these services , we ’re seeing people move their communications from this ‘ one - to - one ’ scenario to this ‘ one - to - many ’ scenario and ideally letting others in on the conversation , attracting others to themselves , and in many ways just creating value out of this .
MJ : Last year Twitter helped Barack Obama get elected President , helped the LA Fire Department communicate endangered residents , helped many people deal with getting laid off in the recession , helped connect concert - goers at South by Southwest music festival , helped protestors follow the Olympic torch through San Francisco , helped a UC Berkeley graduate journalism student get himself out of an Egyptian prison …
What ca n’t Twitter do ?
BS : Well I think the bigger question is , ‘ What ca n’t people do when they can collaborate in real time and network in such a way ? ’
Twitter is really just about unlocking the value of human spirit really .
What you see when you look at Twitter during and after an earthquake , what we ’re really seeing is people helping one another , coordinating in real time using a tool that did n’t exist before we made Twitter .
It ’s the ability to essentially move just like a flock of birds can move around an object in real time , and it can look very choreographed and beautiful .
They are really just basing that moving off of a set of rudimentary communications and feedback .
And that ’s what Twitter provides .
It ’s this very simply utility that allows people to very quickly communicate with one another in these short bursts , and in such a way coordinate themselves in real time so they can move as one like a flock of birds .
So when you talk about all these different scenarios you ’re really just talking about people doing what they would natural do but using this new tool that gives them an enhanced form of communication .
MJ : Twitter is free and it is open to the public , I wonder have there been occasions when you ’ve felt that Twitter as a platform was being used inappropriately ?
BS : Certainly , there ’s inappropriate uses of any tool .
They range from fairly insignificant , you know , squatting on a company name , or impersonating a company or another person , which we put very clearly in our policies that we ’re against those and we go ahead and fix those when they come up to us .
As a unique and powerful tool , it ’s possible that it can be used inappropriately as well as appropriately , and we tend to see in networks such as Twitter , we tend to see when inappropriate use … and then there ’s spam , which is an issue for us ongoing … when there ’s inappropriate use on a network tool such as this , we tend to see a lot of self policing and self correcting which is one of the benefits of such a system .
MJ : Do you have any doubt that intelligence agencies monitor Twitter activity ?
BS : Do I have any doubt ?
I do n’t know a lot about those industries .
I would imagine that they would try to gather as much information as they could , being intelligence agencies , that they would want to gather information from everywhere .
So , yeah , I would assume that they would look at Twitter and Twitter Search to type in key words of interest and see what people are saying about them .
MJ : Have you ever assisted an intelligence agency in looking at a Twitter account ?
BS : I ’m trying to remember .
We have an obligation to assist , there are certain legal obligations that I can’t really recall .
I usually have to look them up during these times .
Certainly police and fire department and things like that , there ’s certain public issues , there are certain protocol to follow in those cases when you operate a network like Twitter .
I actually ca n’t speak about intelligence agencies because I can’t think of a time when I ’ve actually interacted with them .
MJ : Recently the Israeli consulate in New York used Twitter to hold a “ citizen press conference , ” in which they answered people ’s questions about a complicated , age - old conflict in 140 - character responses .
Do you expect to see more governments using Twitter ?
BS : Oh yeah .
I definitely do .
There ’s already over 40 members of the US Congress on Twitter .
The candidates were on Twitter .
Protestors are on Twitter .
Other governments are using Twitter .
Like I said , I think we ’re evolving the way we communicate ; so it ’s not just governments , it ’s organizations like NASA , and companies like JetBlue , and Whole Foods and Starbucks .
They ’re realizing the value in this form of open and short communication , and so I think we ’re naturally going to see them moving to it .
As long as it provides value to them and to the people who are consuming this information and using it , I think we ’re going to see them moving toward it , and that includes governments .
MJ : Is this the future of PR ?
BS : Well , I think the future of PR is listening and becoming part of the conversation .
In as much as Twitter allows communication specialists to really participate and listen to what their customers or consumers , or what have you , are saying and feeling about issues and products , then yes .
I think as PR gets into this realm where the specialists become more a part of this conversation , then it is the future .
MJ : It seems like some techies and new media junkies have really embraced Twitter and use it all the time , while others do n’t understand it and never touch it .
What do you think separates the users from the non-users right now ?
BS : I think that ’s the way that we position the product .
What we did was we had this concept in 2006 , which we took two weeks to build out , and introduced to some of our friends , who are of course the geeky , techie types who are compelled to try a new form of communication just because .
And they invited their like similar - minded friends .
And we positioned the product as such :
As this cool new way to stay hyper - connected with friends , family or organizations that you care about and thus we ’ve become sort of the pulse for those things .
What got promoted a lot was , ‘ Oh is n’t this fun , small , short tweets and you can stay hyper connected in real time . ’
I think that ’s kind of a divisive way of presenting the product because there ’s going to be plenty of people saying , ‘ I do n’t want to stay that connected , ’ and that ’s absolutely fair to say .
But when you look at it differently , when you take into consideration Twitter Search — which is sort of the better half of Twitter and will become a lot more important as it is better integrated into the overall product experience of Twitter — when you take into consideration that we have updates coming in from all around the world from eyes and ears everywhere on the planet telling us what they ’re seeing , what ’s happening with them , what going on around them , and this is all coming in through one magnificent real time feed , and you have the ability to filter in real time and say , ‘ OK , just give me updates where people are talking about earthquakes ’ or iPhones , or things that are relevant and interesting in my life .
When you begin to position the product as something that can bring more value and relevance to your everyday use - case — there was a loud noise outside my house , ask Twitter what it was — then I think you get a broader appeal , as opposed to ‘ stay hyperconnected to your nerdy friends . ’
So I think the answer to that question , ‘ How do we cross that chasm ? ’ is really a simple matter of being more effective with our communication on our website , and in the way we present what we ’ve built .
MJ : The Twitter responses to the Mumbai attacks really showed off the serious crowd - sourced journalism side of Twitter .
How do you recommend professional US journalists use Twitter to enhance or report international stories ?
BS : Well that is an interesting question .
I think there ’s a lot of inventive use cases from reporters and journalists , but one of the things that ’s recently occurred that ’s sort of piqued my interest is CNN declaring that they were cutting themselves off from the AP and that they were going to start their own newswire .
This industry is something like 175 years old , I think it started with Agency French Press , and it has n’t really changed that much .
I mean it ’s gotten faster and it ’s gotten more electronic , but what else has happened ?
I do n’t think a lot .
And I ’m admittedly not an expert there .
But when you take into consideration this massive feed that I talked about that ’s coming in in real time through Twitter , I think there ’s a compelling complementary arrangement there with the idea of a newsfeed .
To answer your question , I think reporters should take advantage of the fact that Twitter has sort of brought the pace of news into real time , away from several minutes and into instantly .
And to take advantage of that they should look at what ’s coming through Twitter , and they should use it to do what they do best , which is to put some perspective and some framing around that information and then tell the story as they see fit .
That ’s really the most compelling way I can think to use it , now there are a lot of other use cases I ’m sure , but that ’s a good place to start .
MJ : Should print journalists who do n’t have a Twitter account yet be freaking out ?
I mean are they too old school to survive the ‘ new media showdown ’ of 2009 ?
BS : No definitely not .
I mean , for one thing they do n’t even have to have a Twitter account to go to search .
twitter.com and immediately begin to investigate what ’s happening in real time in their area .
For example , I live in Berkeley , if I want to know what ’s happening in Berkeley , I can ask Twitter search to just give me the trends , the most talked about things in the last 30 seconds in my town .
And we do trend analysis on all the incoming tweets .
You can look at the front page of Twitter Search , just look at it , that ’s not very high tech , and say , ‘ What ’s trending that ’s interesting ?
Why do I see this name ? ’
You ’re going to see some obvious ones like ‘ happy new years , ’ but then you ’re going to see a name or a location or something like ‘ Mumbai ’ that ’s going to peak your interest and you ’re going to say , ‘ Why is Mumbai suddenly on here ?
Why are people suddenly talking about Mumbai ? ’
And you click through and you access the real time stream of what ’s going on in Mumbai right now .
So I think even people who have a very limited technology sense can visit a webpage and look at what the top issues are and I think that ’s a compelling enough reason to get involved .
MJ : I ’ve read that Twitter has grown 600 percent over the last year and is expected to grow 10 times it ’s current size in this next year .
The Financial Times has reported estimates of 4 - 5 million users .
But you ’ve repeatedly declined to discuss numbers publicly .
Why is that ?
BS : We made the decision early on that it did n’t really benefit our users or us to publicly disclose data such as the total number of registered users or the total number of tweets going through the system per second , and things like that .
I mean we regular share relative data , we just do n’t feel the need to disclose absolute data .
That was primarily early on , for a variety of reasons , really .
While reporters and competitors are very interested in this data , we could n’t see a direct benefit to us or to our users .
That being said , we thought relative data would be of enough interest to reporters and users that we could go ahead and release that .
But we just made it a communications policy that we are a private company and therefore some of our information , you know we have a right to keep that private , and so that ’s what we ’ve been doing .
MJ : Twitter is still privately funded , is this because you prefer the simplicity and freedom of private investment , or because you have n’t yet developed a viable business model ?
BS : It is privately funded at this point .
We built this very conceptual form of communication , we were n’t sure how it was going to go , when it started to take off and get popular we new we were on to something so we wanted to kind of double down on it and keep working .
The best way to do that the best way to add more people to our team and to grow the service was to raise money so we could fuel that growth and build that team and the company .
The plan is to make a sustainable business out of this new communication system .
So the private funding is to get us through the technology phase where we ’re rock solid and very performing , then into the phase where we are developing business products so that we can emerge from that venture capital phase and into a phase where we ’re growing on our own .
That ’s primarily why we did it .
It ’s not too strange of a plan .
MJ : There ’s plenty of speculation about what Twitter is worth , but what ’s your guess ?
BS : Those numbers are traditionally calculated by the amount of money we raised and the percentage of equity in the company that we ’ve exchanged for that money combined with other factors like growth and things like that , and since those are figures we do n’t give out , I ’m not at liberty to take a stab at the valuation .
MJ : Twitter started as a way for friends to communicate with each other , but more and more companies and organizations , not to mention journalists , are using it these days .
Do you think Twitter is used now more for personal or professional purposes ?
BS : Well that ’s a good question too .
It ’s interesting , some refer to Twitter as a social network , but I really think it ’s more of a communications network that has very social elements to it .
It ’s different from a social network because , just think about the way you use a social network , you get a friend request and you approve the friend and now you ’re friends .
But on Twitter it ’s the reverse .
You look through Twitter and you try to find compelling sources of information that you ’d like to receive and be updated about .
And those sources are increasingly a mix of friends , family , coworkers , brands , companies , organizations , and the like .
It has definitely turned into something that you make of it .
For example I follow Whole Foods , JetBlue , a bunch of friends , this guy that posts the funny cats because he makes me laugh .
In a way it ’s kind of a different approach , and like I said a very open form of communication , and that ’s what it ’s become .
MJ : So you ’re 34 years old .
A lot of tech 2.0 stuff has come from people in their young 30s or even under 30 .
Is this a young person ’s game ?
BS : You know , I do n’t think it is .
I think increasingly , the tools that we use to build things like social networks and in particular Twitter have taken an innovative approach because we ’ve combined the mobile texting world with the web world .
But increasingly the tools you can use to build these sort of systems are not , in and of themselves , that innovative or that outrageous .
You can just find them and you can put them together .
So I think this game , as you put it , is something that is going to come increasingly from folks who are more like artists or humanities type people who say , ‘ How can we make people better ?
How can we make the world better ?
What can we add ?
What do we have already that we can just combine and create more efficient ways of communicating or helping one another ? ’
So I do n’t think it ’s young person ’s or even a technologist ’s realm .
It ’s the realm of anyone who has a dream of making things better , or improving things , or adding something to the world .
MJ : Is it a young man ’s game ?
BS : I think traditionally when you isolate the realm of technology companies in Silicon Valley , there are a lot of men in the workforce .
But there ’s a very conscientious attempt to increase the number of women who are in the business .
I would wager a guess that at least a quarter of Twitter employees are women .
Like I said , I think as we move forward in this , it ’s going to be less about technology for technology ’s sake , which may very well include a lot of men , and it ’s going to be more about people who really want to contribute to making the world better and that certainly would be much more inclusive .
MJ : Twitter was getting a lot of flack a few months ago because the site kept crashing , mostly because the number of users was growing faster than Twitter ’s infrastructure .
The site does n’t seem to be crashing too often these days , but are you still having growing pains ?
BS : I think we ’re still scaling , yeah .
And that word applies not only to the technology but also to the company itself , and it ’s an important thing to be wary of at this stage .
We have made hugely significance progress from a performance or reliability standpoint , consistently coming in at 99.99 percent up time , but yeah we were certainly having trouble early on because popularity caught up with use quicker than we were ready for it .
We were in firefighting mode for a while which is a horrible place to be in because we were losing the trust of our users and just morale and everything was not great .
We were able to take a deep breath and find the right path out of that situation and toward a stable performance system which has been a very inspiring thing for us .
That word ‘ scalability ’ also applies to a company , a growing company , and we can look to the successes of our engineering and operations department and say , ‘ What was it that actually worked there ?
What was it that made that work ? ’
It ’s not necessarily just a technology thing , it ’s a matter of leadership , it ’s a matter of communication , and it ’s a matter of identifying the weakest points and making them no longer the weakest points .
That can also be said about growing a business and a company .
So that ’s the point we ’re at now .
The answer to your question is I do n’t think we ’ll ever stand up and declare ‘ mission accomplished ’ because I think it ’s an ongoing thing .
You always want to become more efficient , more reliable , more scalable .
Obviously you reach a certain point where you ’re pretty happy with the system , and we ’re getting there , but I do n’t think it ’ll ever be over .
MJ : Obama ran a very tech - savvy campaign , and he really embraced new social tools like Twitter and Facebook .
Did anyone from the Obama campaign contact you about using Twitter ?
BS : We were in contact with both camps , just about small stuff like questions about how to do certain things .
The Obama folks were on it much , much earlier , so they had a head start in terms of growing their base .
I think it was actually us who reached out the McCain folks , and said , ‘ You should really … you know , Obama ’s got this great account with all these people on it …’
We actually were building a special view on the election , so we had to put out a call to the McCain folks and say , ‘ You should get out here so we can put you up on the top of the page along with Obama . ’
So they did that , but they did it a little late in the game .
MJ : Do you think Twitter influenced the course of public debate during the presidential election ?
Or maybe even its outcome ?
BS : I would love to say yes .
I would n’t want to take credit for it .
Where we were able to help was we certainly raised a lot of eyebrows and people said , ‘ Huh , maybe the pace of democracy now is operating in real time and maybe tools like Twitter are something to be considered very seriously as we do this . ’
I think in other elections , smaller elections , and even in the next presidential election , Twitter will be an obvious go - to tool , where if you ’re not on it you ’re making a big mistake because you need the tools to let you make smart decisions in real time .
You do n’t have the luxury of mulling things over for as long as you ’re used to now .
When there are people operating in real time out there you need to jump in and be at that same pace .
MJ : What makes somebody popular on Twitter ?
I mean , how can I make my Twitter feed popular ?
BS : I think there are a few ingredients .
First of all , being an active user .
Having something compelling to say , and that does n’t mean it has to be this genius content because it really depends on who is following you .
Like I said , the other day I heard music outside of my house and so I typed ‘ music , playing , concert , Berkeley ’ into Twitter Search and I got an update that was a minute old from someone who said they were at a Radio Head concert at the Greek Theater which is near my house .
So I said , oh ok , question answered .
But all they wrote was ‘ listening to Radio Head at the Greek in Berkeley ’ which in and of itself is n’t that compelling of an update , but at the same time it was very meaningful to me .
So you want to be a fairly active user .
And you want to engage a little bit with other people .
So if you see that you ’re getting ‘ @replies , ’ which are just a public way of addressing another Twitter user so that others can see you ’ve addressed them , if you see you ’re getting these in your replies tab , occasionally to respond to them in kind .
That usually shows signs of life activity .
Once you create that engagement you start creating feedback loops which make the whole experience more compelling and attracts more people to follow you .
And then all that being said , it also helps if you happen to be a celebrity in the first place .
MJ : Twitter updates are known for their creativity .
What ’s the most poetic tweet you ’ve encountered ?
BS : It ’s hard for me to remember exactly the most poetic one , but there ’s a whole group of people insist on Twittering in Haiku form , and those are certainly poetic .
There was contest early on on Twitter where folks were asked to write their , I think it was either five word or six word memoir , and this one in particular was ‘ If I had more time I would ’ve … ’ and that was it .
I thought it was a really clever one .
MJ : That ’s great .
So is it fun being a web celebrity ?
BS : Web celebrity … I do n’t know that I ’m a web celebrity .
I ’m more of a servant of the people who use Twitter .
It certainly is fun .
The ability to communicate with a lot of people , I think , is what ’s very fun because it means that you basically have a leadership position .
You have an opportunity in that case to set a tone and to lead by example and to show character .
Even though it ’s weird , I ’m especially fond of those times when things go horribly wrong and I have the opportunity to show a character and leadership in those times to demonstrate to others , ‘ This is how I think we should all behave . ’
So it certainly is fun in that respect to be able to communicate with a lot of folks instantly .
MJ : Biz Stone is a great name .
Is it short for anything ?
BS : Yes .
It ’s short for my own ineptitude .
I could n’t say my full name , which is Christopher Isaac Stone , I said Bizaber instead of Christopher when I was very young .
My parents and friends starting calling me Biz because of that .
I tried to tell people my name was otherwise , but they would n’t have it .
They insisted on calling me Biz Stone .
I used it on the web a lot when I started blogging and things , and then when I started writing books I used it as my name .
So now it ’s pretty much it .
Everyone just calls me Biz .
I think there ’s some people at the bank who call me Christopher Isaac and I do n’t even turn around when the say the words , but I ’m trying to pay attention a little bit more .
MJ : Biz Stone , thank you very much for speaking with us .
BS : Thank you for having me .
The Regional Court in Hamburg , Germany , has ruled that file - hosting service Rapidshare must proactively filter certain content .
Music industry outfit GEMA asked the court to ban Rapidshare from making 5,000 tracks from its catalogue available on the Internet .
The court estimated the value of the tracks at $ 34 million .
Collections society GEMA claims to represent more than 60,000 composers , authors and music publishers worldwide , protecting their copyrights .
After a request by the group , The Regional Court in Hamburg has ruled that hosting service Rapidshare is forbidden from making any of 5,000 music tracks from GEMA ’s collection available on the Internet .
Rapidshare was also ordered to delete any and all of those same tracks from its servers and ensure that they are not uploaded again by users .
Previously Rapidshare had been using file hashes to recognize tracks that were already removed after requests from GEMA , to ensure that they were n’t uploaded again .
The court decided that the technique used was ineffective .
The court found Rapidshare guilty of breaches of copyright law and estimated the value of the tracks at € 24 million ( $ 34 million ) .
“ The decision of the Hamburg Regional Court is a milestone in GEMA ’s fight against the illegal use of musical works on the Internet , ” said Dr. Harald Heker , Chief Executive Officer of GEMA .
“ We are confident that in this way we will be able to reduce the illegal use of the GEMA repertoire on the Internet to a negligible level , ” he added .
Understandably , Rapidshare sought to downplay the ruling .
Bobby Chang , COO of RapidShare , Switzerland , said : “ We do not consider the court ’s decision to be a breakthrough .
As other proceedings in similar disputes with GEMA have shown , there is considerable disparity amongst the individual courts in some cases . ”
Noting that the courts of appeal “ tend to restrict the scope of the decisions made by the lower courts , ” Chang said it would make more sense to offer music fans the right products and services at the right price to “ open up a new source of income for music - markets on the Internet . ”
Update :
We initially reported that Rapidshare was fined $ 34 million on the back of this report .
This information is wrong , the court only stated that the value of the tracks was estimated at $ 34 million .
The article is updated accordingly and we ’re sorry for the confusion .
In light of the following story , I hereby offer myself up as a paid - for pundit for the cool sum of only $ 1 million dollars !
I ’ve been following the story of Fed - Ex ’s inaccurate , anti-union , smear campaign against UPS with some interest :
The clash revolves around legislation that would clear the way for FedEx drivers to organize with the Brotherhood of Teamsters , just as UPS ’s drivers are .
FedEx opposed the measure , which was supported by both UPS and the Teamsters , and set up a website titled “ brownbailout.com ” that accuses UPS of “ quietly seeking a congressional bailout designed to limit competition for overnight deliveries , leaving Americans with a less reliable next - day delivery network for critical goods like medicines and essential inventory . ”
“ Why is megacorporation UPS trying to use its political clout to get a bailout from the U.S. Congress , leaving you to pay the tab ? ” the FedEx website asks .
What surprised me was that conservatives were weighing in on the side of UPS ( and thus of the Teamsters ) :
But a letter signed by former Sen. Malcolm Wallop ( R - Wyo. ) and the leaders of Americans for Tax Reform , Frontiers for Freedom , the American Conservative Union , 60 Plus , Citizen Outreach , the Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council and the National Taxpayers Union alleges that FedEx is mischaracterizing the situation and unfairly trying to tap into public resentment against federal bailouts to attack its competition .
As far as I can tell , this letter is completely accurate .
Why would wingers be taking the side of unions ?

Last year we threw a birthday party for my daughter who was turning 12 .
Money was kind of tight but we had about 40 people that we needed to feed .
With some sweat equity I was able to get everyone fed for under $ 100.00 .
How did I do this ?
I saved money on food costs by making all of the food myself .
The soda , and juice boxes were probably the biggest expenditure , if we had wanted to cut back more I could have gone with a punch option .
Here is what I served :
4 double layer round cakes , one chocolate with chocolate icing , one lemon , one German Chocolate , and one marble .
These cakes took me about 2 1/2 hours to bake and ice .
I did this the day before the party .
I used pre-made lettering .
I made a huge pan of baked mostaccioli ( Used store bought sauce bought on sale - Start looking out for sales at least a month in advance . )
This is very simple just boil a large pot of noodles , strain water out and poor the noodles in a large baking pan .
Pour sauce in to pan and stir to coat all of the noodles .
Generously sprinkle with parmesan and mozzarella cheese , bake in oven at 350 just until cheese begins to melt .
It looks nice and it very simple .
Set out some extra sauce for people to pour on , as the baking tends to dry the sauce out a bit .
A big pan of baked chicken legs ( this saved money as these are a cheaper part of the chicken but buy what ever is cheapest ) .
A big pan of macaroni and cheese , ( 5 boxes bought generic at .75 per box ) , baked beans ( canned ) cooked in a crock pot .
Roast beef from the deli 12 pounds , cooked in two large crock pots , with beef broth , and sliced green peppers , along with bread to make sandwiches .
You can also ask at the deli if they have the juice for the roast beef if they do they will usually give it to you for free with the purchase of the roast beef .
2 Jello molds - Just Jello in a mold , make two different flavors , or layer flavors , Jello costs almost nothing and kids love it .
Potato salad - Find a recipe and make it yourself .
Buying at the Deli can get expensive unless it is on sale .
One water melon cut in to small quarters of a round piece .
You should get plenty of pieces out of a good sized watermelon , or buy two small ones .
Some Aldi's potato chips
As you can see I had quite a bit of food and I did n't spend that much money .
The mostaccioli and the macaroni together only cost about 10 dollars .
The watermelon was huge , and cost around $ 5.00 .
The beef cost around $ 30.00 , the chicken cost around $ 16.00 , the cakes cost maybe $ 3.00 a piece .
I had the potatoes on hand and they needed to be used anyways so they really did n't really cost much of anything .
I made three large cans of beans that cost about $ 1.50 each so the beans cost around $ 4.50 .
The Jello molds cost just under $ 2.00 .
I spent about $ 100 total .
The remaining money went to sodas and juice boxes , a disposable plastic table cloth , plates , plastic silver wear , and Napkins .
The plates , silver wear , napkins and table cloth were all purchased at the dollar store .
So you can see this was not an expensive party to throw at all and there was plenty of food for everyone .
A lot of people stayed later after the party to play cards and there was enough for everybody to eat again later in the evening .
Misc .
Tips
You could save further by making a punch instead of serving cans of soda and juice boxes , but you risk spillage .
If the party is outside , set up a punch bowl near the door but out of the way of the traffic flow .
You could also make a punch that is light in color or even clear .
Mix a white grape juice with 7 up , or Squirt , it 's quite yummy .
Make two bowls if you like and use sugar free soda in case you have dieting or diabetic guests .
Not fond of making cakes ?
Make cup cakes .
Making your own cake or cakes costs between 2 and 3 dollars per cake as opposed to $ 17.99 to $ 30.00 + for a store made or bakery made cake .
You can use a mix and pre-made icing , simple and still tasty .
If you want to offer another meat option , buy Italian sausage .
Cut the links in to fourths , and fry up with some green peppers to add some flavor and color .
If you do this with about 3 packages it should be enough .
This will cost about $ 9.00 .
The sausage will also compliment the mostaccioli and the chicken .
You could also make meatballs if you make them yourself it will not be expensive , and will also compliment everything .
If right - wing broadcasters do n’t want to be blamed when someone murders a person they have demonized repeatedly — as in the case of George Tiller , the doctor shot dead in his Wichita , Kan. , church last Sunday by an anti-abortion zealot — then they ought to moderate their rhetoric .
No doubt they will choose their words more carefully for a while , and they will whine piteously about anyone who calls attention to their screaming extremism .
This familiar cycle of shaming and blaming , which often follows incidents like the Tiller killing , may well be pointless .
By now , it should be obvious that nothing , not even a murder in a church , will mute the most aggressive and irrational voices in politics and the media , as they attract high ratings and consistent donations .
Yet there is one response to this crime that might make a difference in the future .
Although an overwhelming majority of abortion opponents bear no responsibility for the doctor ’s murder and should feel free to exercise their constitutional freedoms to the fullest extent , there is a violent fringe on the far right that has earned the designation of terrorist .
And the federal government is responsible for ensuring our safety from those menacing forces .
As conservatives never hesitate to remind us , the nation ’s security remains under serious threat from al - Qaida and other violent Islamist groups .
The prevention of future attacks by those groups is a top priority of U.S. intelligence and law enforcement , and we expect government to employ every tactic that does not trespass against constitutional or human rights in that effort .
Similar efforts should be directed at the domestic sources of terror , which are equally real .
When the Department of Homeland Security recently released a report on the potential rise of violent right - wing extremism rooted in economic distress , many observers , especially on the right , mocked that document .
But whatever its intrinsic value , the report drew attention to an enduring problem .
Over the past 15 years or so , according to the Southern Poverty Law Center , authorities have discovered more than five dozen terror conspiracies by far - right groups , including militia outfits , neo - Nazi gangs and others claiming that their cause is above the law .
The Oklahoma City bombing was only the most notorious and tragic of those plots , which have cost lives , damaged property and infringed on our safety and freedom .
The late Dr. Tiller , who was shot on an earlier occasion , was the eighth U.S. abortion provider murdered since 1977 .
At least 17 others have been targets for attempted murder .
Understandably , the opponents of abortion will try to portray the man arrested for this murder as a lonesome nut case , but whether that is true remains far from certain .
Authorities have known about the violent outlook of Scott Roeder , now sitting in a Wichita jail cell , for years .
He was arrested in 1996 for riding around Topeka with improper license plates that read : “ Sovereign private property .
Immunity declared by law .
Non-commercial American , ” slogans that were typical of a right - wing extremist organization called the Freemen , then operating in the Midwest and Northwest .
When the police who stopped Roeder searched his car , they found ammunition , a blasting cap , a fuse cord , a one - pound can of gunpowder and two nine - volt batteries , one of which was connected to a switch that could have been used as a detonator .
Altogether , he had the makings of several powerful pipe bombs , according to reports in The Wichita Eagle .
He was convicted of a single count of criminal use of explosives , along with misdemeanors related to driving without a license or insurance , and sentenced to 24 months of probation .
He was ordered , to little effect , to “ dissociate himself from anti-government groups that advocated violence . ”
But his probation ended early when the Kansas courts overturned his conviction because his car had been searched illegally .
Obviously , that kind of mistake must not happen again .
Attorney General Eric
Holder ’s decision to send federal marshals to protect doctors , nurses and abortion clinics from potential attack was the correct first step .
Now he needs to focus investigative resources and the power of the law on those who would use violence as an ideological weapon .
Joe Conason writes for the New York Observer .
Technology is part of the solution to climate change .
But only part .
Techno - fixes like some of those in the Guardian 's Manchester Report simply cannot deliver the carbon cuts science demands of us without being accompanied by drastic reductions in our consumption .
That means radical economic and social transformation .
Merely swapping technologies fails to address the root causes of climate change .
We need to choose the solutions that are the cheapest , the swiftest , the most effective and least likely to incur dire side effects .
On all counts , there 's a simple answer – stop burning the stuff in the first place .
Consume less .
There is a certain level of resources we need to survive , and beyond that there is a level we need in order to have lives that are comfortable and meaningful .
It is far below what we presently consume .
Americans consume twice as much oil as Europeans .
Are they twice as happy ?
Are Europeans half as free ?
Economic growth itself is not a measure of human well - being , it only measures things with an assessed monetary value .
It values wants at the same level as needs and , while it purports to bring prosperity to the masses , its tendency to concentrate profit in fewer and fewer hands leaves billions without the necessities of a decent life .
Techno-fixation masks the incompatibility of solving climate change with unlimited economic growth .
Even if energy consumption can be reduced for an activity , ongoing economic growth eats up the improvement and overall energy consumption still rises .
We continue destructive consumption in the expectation that new miracle technologies will come and save us .
The hope of a future techno - fix feeds into the pass - it - forward , do - nothing - now culture typified by targets for 2050 .
Tough targets for 2050 are not tough at all , they are a decoy .
Where are the techno - fix plans for the peak in global emissions by 2015 that the IPCC says we need ?
Even within the limited sphere of technology , we have to separate the solutions from the primacy of profit .
We need to choose what 's the most effective , not the most lucrative .
Investors will want the maximum return for their money , and so the benefits of any climate technologies will , in all likelihood , be sold as carbon credits to the polluter industries and nations .
It would not be done in tandem with emissions cuts but instead of them , making it not a tool of mitigation but of exacerbation .
Climate change is not the only crisis currently facing humanity .
Peak oil is likely to become a major issue within the coming decade .
Competition for land and water , soil fertility depletion and collapse of fisheries are already posing increasing problems for food supply and survival in many parts of the world .
Technological solutions to climate change fail to address most of these issues .
Yet even without climate change , this systemic environmental and social crisis threatens society , and requires deeper solutions than new technology alone can provide .
Around a fifth of emissions come from deforestation , more than for all transport emissions combined .
There is no technological fix for that .
We simply need to consume less of the forest , that is to say , less meat , less agrofuel and less wood .
Our level of consumption is inequitable .
Making it universal is simply impossible .
The scientist Jared Diamond calculates that if the whole world were to have our level of consumption , it would be the equivalent of having 72 billion people on earth .
With ravenous economic growth still prized as the main objective of society by all political leaders the world over , that 72 billion would be just the beginning .
At 3 % annual growth , 25 years later it would be the equivalent of 150 billion people .
A century later it would be over a trillion .
Something 's got to give .
And indeed , it already is .
It 's time for us to call it a crisis and respond with the proportionate radical action that is needed .
We need profound change – not only government measures and targets but financial systems , the operation of corporations , and people 's own expectations of progress and success .
Building a new economic democracy based on meeting human needs equitably and sustainably is at least as big a challenge as climate change itself , but if human society is to succeed the two are inseparable .
Instead of asking how to continue to grow the economy while attempting to cut carbon , we should be asking why economic growth is seen as more important than survival .

A couple of weeks ago at a townhall event in New York , Digg announced that it was removing its " Shout " feature in favor of sharing diggs via Twitter and Facebook .
Shout had become spammy and meaningless for many users , so it was a prudent move .
However , Digg also announced that it wanted to build a new communication system that did n't sustain the type of abuse shouts received during their tenure .
Now , we 've learned new details about Digg 's potential communication tool from The LA Times .
And while the new interest - based tool sounds intriguing , it has an uphill battle if it's to avoid the fate that befell shouts .
What Digg's CEO Envisions
In the LA Times piece , Digg CEO Jay Adelson provided some more detailed thoughts and background on the future of any Digg communication tool .
First , the focus of any new Digg tool would be on fostering actual conversations , rather than the " Plz Digg my link tnx " spam that turned the Shout feature into junk .
From the LA Times Blog :
... a tool that would focus on actual conversations , rather than the mass dumping of links that polluted shouts , he said .
Adelson said Digg is considering making the tool a " one - to - one " service , implying that it could be something like a chat function .
" It 's not so much a sharing problem , " Adelson said .
" It 's more of a communication problem , where I have one user who wants to talk to another user . "
The one - to - one service function interests us the most .
Shouts were open and broadcastable links .
The new system seems to be more about individuals connecting , rather than the mass sending of links that Shout provided .
Adelson also revealed that the tool would be based on categories .
So , if you 're a huge sports fan , you 'd hang out with the other sports diggers .
It would also recognize where your strengths are - i.e. if you 're great at finding Tech news , you 'll see your influence in this new system increase there , but perhaps not in environmental news .
According to Adelson , " this new tool would create ' tastemakers ' in various categories . "
So , to summarize : Digg wants to build a new one - on - one communication tool based on categories that would foster communities based on interest .
At least , that 's the gist of it .
Digg 's Monster of a Digg Spam Problem
Facebook is successful tool for discussion because communication is within your social graph - your friends .
You talk about your day , the pictures you took , your most recent vacation , stuff that we are always interested in .
Twitter , which includes your friends , influences , and people of interest , has the same type of vibe , but adds in conversations around useful links and major events in realtime .
Digg , however , is not really based on your friends or your social graph .
It 's based on your interests and getting diggs .
Almost anyone who submits a link to Digg will ask his or her friends for a Digg .
These annoying and usually useless messages are what killed Shouts .
Digg clearly sees this and wants to build a tool that compensates for this .
That 's why the new tool would focus on interest - based discussion .
Here 's the problem : it 's not just a technology problem , it 's also a culture problem .
Its communication tool will almost certainly be filled with the " please digg my link ! " chaos of old , unless Digg can find a way to reshape its community or simply outright bans asking for Diggs .
The new tool must balance all of these factors or suffer implosion .
This much is clear : Digg has an incredibly tough task ahead in its future .
In an effort to solve a number of early computational problems , Microsoft has now called upon the Internet community to help improve the accuracy of current and future Bing - generated search results .
Microsoft is set to release a new online game called Page Hunt that is designed to illicit user interaction and responses .
The information extracted from this game will provide query alterations for use in search refinement and identify other vital issues .
( Source : yahoo.com )
Generate a Hit Word , Find the URL
The game seems quite fun .
A player is shown a random web page with only the URL missing .
Their task is to come up with one or more ( called " hit words " ) that will allow the player to find the actual URL in a Bing search engine .
Page
Hunt then lists the top search results , in order , to see if the player scored a match in the top five .
If so , the player is awarded a fixed number of points ( depending on the place of their match ) with 300 points being given for the top score per search .
Page Hunt allows Microsoft to fine - tune their search algorithm in a forum that is reflective of an actual human search experience .
Best of all , Microsoft users engage in a challenge that is as much fun as it is beneficial to the company .
Every Piece of Information Counts
Unbeknownst to the player , Page Hunt stores every piece of information involved with the gaming experience .
This includes : player ID , web page URL , the actual search process , which results were considered a success , which results were considered a failure , what rank the player received against a backdrop of worldwide participants , etc .
The best part for Microsoft is , even if a player scores no points during the entire game , their contributions are still imperative to the thinking patterns of the average end user .
Page Hunt a Pilot Project
Page Hunt has already been tested on a number of Microsoft employees .
The initial demonstrations showed that there is a direct relationship between the length of a URL and the ability of search engines to find its corresponding web page .
( Source : newsfactor.com )
Microsoft also announced that a demo version of the game is now available online to non-Microsoft personnel .
Analysts are certain that Page Hunt will lead to the launch of other gaming efforts that use the public to help enhance the online search experience .
We hear a lot about the reasons to get rid of Do n't Ask , Do n't Tell .
The fact that having openly gay servicemembers in the armed forces will do absolutely nothing to undermine the effectiveness of the military , whereas discharging gay Arabic translators like Lt. Dan Choi does plenty .
There 's the exorbitant costs of replacing discharged servicemembers .
Here 's something to add to that list : the near - inhuman treatment the partners of gay military members face .
Silent Partners , the new episode of Brave New Foundation 's
In Their Boots shows loved ones of our armed forces confined to a world far from the tearful reunions on military base tarmacs , let alone the spousal support networks , base access , family assistance centers , and other amenities available to members of " typical " military families .
Under DADT , Ben Cartwright , the longtime partner of a deployed servicemember , must strip the " I love you " from his phone conversations , censor his written correspondence , meet his partner at a gas station rather than on base , and " de - gay " their home when his partner is picked up by his military buddies .
From his new post at HuffPo :
While my partner serves our country during these wars , I receive no benefits ( medical benefits , family separation allowance , etc ) ; I cannot access the family and spousal resources on the military base out of which he serves , or take part in military family events .
I have no access to " military spouse " support groups and networks .
When my partner graduated from military training and when he left for Iraq I had to stand on the sidelines - to vanish , disappear from his life and pretend I did not know him .
I was proud to see him off , but heartbroken that I could not give him a hug and what could have been a final kiss goodbye .
Michelle Obama , speaking to military families in March , said , " See , military families have done their duty , and we as a grateful nation must do ours .
We must do everything in our power to honor them by supporting them ; not just by word but by deed . "
An executive order scrapping Don't Ask , Don't Tell sounds like just the deed .

I 'm proud to do social network outreach for In Their Boots .
Steven Morris joins free - thinking youngsters on holiday at Camp Quest to talk about philosophy and where we all come from
Twelve - year - old Julia has very firm views .
" I 'm an atheist .
I believe in the big bang and stuff .
I do n't believe in God .
I do n't sing hymns and I do n't pray .
I 'm the only non-Christian in my class at school and sometimes that can cause a problem .
Some people think I 'm a bit weird . "
Then , as the rain started to pour , she dashed into a big , baggy army tent and joined the rest of her new friends for the first session of the day : philosophy .
This is Camp Quest , billed as Britain 's first summer camp for young atheists .
It 's only day three of the five - day programme taking place in a soggy field in Somerset , but already the event has attracted criticism from parts of the media ( the Daily Mail dubbed it " Camp Faithless " ) and , unsurprisingly , scepticism from the Church of England .
The idea behind the camp is to give a " godless " alternative to traditional religious summer camps .
In the morning the participants discuss philosophical ideas and learn about subjects such as astronomy .
Then in the afternoons they take part in more traditional camp activities .
They swim , they run , they climb , they row .
In the evening – if the rain relents – they sit round the campfire and toast marshmallows .
So Julia said she really enjoyed the Charles Darwin talk , but also loved scrambling over a great big wall .
" But the best thing is that they tell you it does n't matter what you believe – just believe it and stick with it . "
The first Camp Quest took place in the US in 1996 .
Supported with a modest grant from the Richard Dawkins Foundation , Camp Quest UK has been founded to give the children of " atheists , agnostics , humanists , freethinkers and all those who embrace a naturalistic rather than supernatural world view " a summer camp experience not tinged with religion .
Twenty - three youngsters aged from six or seven ( there was some dispute today about the age of the youngest child ; the organisers thought he was seven , little Leroy insisted he was six ) are attending the Somerset mud and think - fest .
First session this morning was philosophy .
The starting point was Hans Christian Andersen 's story of the emperor 's new clothes .
Dianna Moylan , a 67 - year - old former teacher , barn dance musician and " successful atheist – not a failed Christian " , told the tale , then organised the children into three groups .
They were asked to discuss the story and come up with philosophical questions about it .
First they decided what a philosophical question was .
One of the boys , Matthew , went with : " Why are we here ? "
It was taken as philosophy rather than a complaint .
They went on to discuss why the cheating tailors , who take the emperor 's money and convince him that they have made an invisible outfit for him , had been intent on tricking him .
Did they need the money because they were poor ?
And if they were poor could they have been justified ?
From the depths of a big blue cagoule , Julius , the youngest in this group , was impressed with the little boy who came forward and pointed out that the emperor was naked as he paraded through the streets .
Moylan asked Julius if he thought that he could be right even if bigger people told him he was wrong .
" I can be right , " he replied .
Julia chipped in .
" Why do older people not listen to the younger generation ?
They do n't ask younger people stuff . "
She sounded a bit huffy but she probably had a point .
To cut a long discussion short , they came up with two questions to take back to the bigger group .
Firstly , if everyone believed something – such as the idea that the emperor really did have an invisible outfit on – was it as good as fact ?
And secondly , was it ever OK to lie ?
Moylan was pleased .
" They are being taught to be thinkers , not atheists .
Think , make decisions for yourself . "
A quick break and then Jens Christensen , who is originally from Denmark but is the proud founder of the local atheist society in Southampton , where he is studying engineering , blew a whistle and called the campers in for astronomy .
He started to explain how we are all connected to the planets .
How are we made and where do we come from ?
he asked .
Leroy , the boy who insists he is six ( and this is not the sort of place where you doubt children ) , shouted out : " Stardust " .
Christensen told him that he might be right in a way .
" We are all part of the universe and the universe is part of us , " said Christensen .
Then he was asked how big the universe was and it all started getting very complicated .
Which pleases Samantha Stein , the director of Camp Quest UK .
" We try to teach them how to think and not what to think .
We 're encouraging them to leave camp with 101 questions for their parents and teachers .
And that 's got to be a good thing . "

BEIJING / TAIPEI ( Reuters ) - The Chinese government has required that personal computer makers bundle software that filters Internet content from July 1 , raising concerns over cyber - security as well as Internet freedoms .
A journalist types on his laptop while using the internet in the Main Press Center at the Olympic Games in Beijing July 31 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Tim Wimborne )
The free “ Green Dam - Youth Escort ” software , developed by Jinhui Computer System Engineering Co , can effectively filter “ unhealthy words and images , ” according to a Ministry of Industry and Information Technology document seen by Reuters .
Foreign computer makers are now caught between maintaining access to their fastest - growing major market , and concerns the mandatory software will make their products vulnerable to security breaches as well as potential malfunctions .
The requirement to pre-install the software is “ in order to consolidate the achievements of the online campaign against pornography , combine punishment and prevention , protect the healthy growth of young people , and promote the Internet ’s healthy and orderly development , ” the ministry said .
Many aspects of the software are still unknown , but computer industry sources worry it could open a channel for industrial espionage as well as blocking content Beijing dislikes .
China already has a system to block websites deemed objectionable .
Internet police monitor sites , blogs and other online venues for pornographic or politically sensitive content .
“ Summer vacation is coming up , and many Chinese parents worry about what their children will see on the Internet .
That ’s the purpose of the software , ” Jinhui founder Bryan Zhang said .
“ Even if you wanted to use it for , say , political content , you could n’t , because it ’s image distinction software that tracks pornographic images , ” Zhang told Reuters .
PC makers must report to the ministry the number of computer units sold and software packages installed on a monthly basis in 2009 , and yearly starting in February 2010 , the circular says .
“ Using the software is not compulsory .
You can shut it down or take it out if you want to .
With a password , you can turn it off at any time , ” Zhang said .
“ It ’s an optional tool to prevent access to pornography , just like anti-pornography software in the United States . ”
An industry official , who did not want to be identified for fear of retaliation against his company , said foreign technicians testing the software had been unable to uninstall it .
The Wall Street Journal first reported the news on Monday .
CONCERN
China is one of the world ’s fastest - growing PC markets , with research firm Gartner forecasting total PC shipments will climb by about 3 percent this year to more than 42 million units .
The Chinese market is dominated by homegrown brands such as Lenovo and Founder , although global brands such as HP , Dell and Acer also have a significant market share .
Acer said it was not aware of the new requirement , while rival Taiwanese maker Asustek said it was but had not yet been officially informed by the Chinese government .
“ Along with the rest of the industry ... we are studying it and working with relevant government and other parties to seek clarifications , ” said Dell spokeswoman Faith Brewitt .
Jinhui last year won a tender to supply filtering software to the ministry , according to government procurement information .
Since then , the ministry has subsidized the company to make the software available for free downloads , said Zhang .
It previously sold for 368 yuan ( $ 54 ) a package .
The software will remain free for a year , and after that consumers will have to pay to continue using it , Zhang said .
It has already been bundled in over 50 million locally made PCs offered rural dwellers as part of China ’s economic stimulus package , according to a promotional website ( www.lssw365.net).
It said the software is being used by 2,279 schools across China and had been downloaded 3.27 million times by end -March .
The U.S. embassy in Beijing said it was concerned .
“ We would view any attempt to restrict the free flow of information with great concern and as incompatible with China ’s aspirations to build a modern , information - based economy and society , ” an embassy spokesman said .
Compliance could leave computer manufacturers open to charges they abetted censorship and violation of privacy .
The software has a “ black list ” of sites with pornographic or violent content it blocks , said a customer service representative affiliated with a website offering the software for downloading .
The software also has a “ white list ” of permitted websites .
Users can add or delete websites from the white list .
While the white list is publicized , the black list is not .
Savvy Internet users in China currently stay one step ahead of censors by using virtual private networks or proxy servers to access sites outside China , and spread information domestically by quickly reposting expunged content or using oblique language .
Pornography is easily accessed on the Chinese Internet .

YOUR COMMENT CHALLENGE : Assuming The Pirate Bay was a retail store ( see the above comic for precident ) , give me some scenarios that might play in said store .
How about bathroom signs that say “ Employees must wash hooks before returning to work . ”
Or maybe OSHA guidelines demand all peglegs be made of spruce or maple .

Bret Harrison and Tyler Labine speak out on “ Reaper ” finale
I recently had a chance to do a joint phoner with Bret Harrison and Tyler Labine in connection with Season 2 of “ Reaper ” being released on DVD , though it will probably come as no surprise that a sizable chunk of the conversation ended up being about the likely demise of the series .
Rest assured , I pointed out that the general tone of the comments from Premium Hollywood about the season finale …well , at least those of John Paulsen , anyway ( though it ’s clear others share his opinion , too ) … were along the lines of , “ Oh , my God , this is the biggest gyp I ’ve ever seen in my life ! ”
“ Yeah , I ’ve heard a lot of that , too , ” laughed Labine .
“ All in all , maybe it could ’ve been a better ending for the season , regardless of whether it was the wrap - up or not , but you have to understand that there were a lot of cooks in the kitchen by the end with , like , where you have to leave it .
There were a lot of notes coming down from on high , and I think things just get a little bit scrambled at the end of a show that ’s on the bubble , technically .
I think we have to give the writers a little bit more credit , but , yeah , I think we were all … well , I guess we can speak freely .
The show ’s canceled .
We were n’t super happy with the ending of the show , I feel .
But that ’s just me .
I do n’t know .
What about you , Bret ? ”
“ No , no , I was n’t happy , ” admitted Harrison .
“ But I was excited that I got to play Quarters .
“ Oh , yeah , ” agreed Labine .
“ We all were . ”
The full interview will appear on Bullz - Eye on Wednesday , but to tease you until then , here are a few more choice quotes from the conversation :
“ All in all , for a second season , I thought it went well .
We introduced some cool characters .
But I can officially go on record now as saying that I was not happy with the storyline with me trying to fuck my stepsister . ” – Tyler Labine
“ I think they were planning on leading ( Alan Townsend , played by Sean Patrick Thomas ) to be kind of part of the finale , from the little bit I heard them talking about it , but deals do n’t work out all the time , and I do n’t really want to get into too much detail , but …it just did n’t work out , for whatever reason . ” – Bret Harrison
“ If we ’d been able to come back and tell the story in Season 3 , Andi would ’ve been a Reaper , there could ’ve been a whole new rebellion with Michael Ian Black as Sam ’s guardian angel now , basically , and a full - scale battle between Heaven and Hell might ’ve actually started to go on .
It would ’ve taken a whole new turn . ” – Tyler Labine
Admit it : you ’re already chomping at the bit for the interview , are n’t you ?
Stay tuned , “ Reaper ” fans !
North Carolina joins 13 other US states in making hallucinogenic herb Salvia illegal
Zephyr Cove , Nevada  June 29th 2009 : North Carolina has become the 14th state to make hallucinogenic herb Salvia Divinorum illegal , joining one quarter of the whole of the United States to have passed similar laws .
The NC law is slightly looser than its contemporarys ( many of which put Salvia in the same class as heroin ) as Senate Bill 138 deems that anyone in possession , selling or buying the herb will face fines for their first two offences and charges thereon .
This development means potential losses for the Salvia market , yet some companies anticipate a sharp rise in sales shortly before the law is passed .
This could even lead to sustained sales from returning customers who travel to neighbouring states to buy and smoke the Mexican hallucinogen legally .
Nevada based Salvia retailer FreshSalvia.com are selling live Salvia plants for the limited time leading up to and around the passing of the law .
 Salvia Divinorum in the form of dried leaves , extract and live plants is recognised for its healing and divination qualities  says FreshSalvia.com founder Moira Ramone ,  It s simply a legal way for people to relax and experience the joys of spiritual enhancement , so well try and keep it that way for as long as possible . 
Established at the start of 2009 , FreshSalvia.com is still a young company , yet one which has established a solid customer base with its expanding range of Salvia Divinorum products .
Customers make orders on the FreshSalvia.com website , which sells dried leaves , Salvia extract , Salvia Divinorum packages and now live Salvia plants , delivered in oversized planter boxes .
As the 14th US state prepares to pass a law deeming the sale , purchase and possession of hallucinogenic herb Salvia illegal , Nevada based online retailers FreshSalvia.com have widened their product lines .
Live Salvia Divinorum plants are being sold on the companys website for a short period , so opportunistic North Carolinians are expected to take advantage of the limited offer before the law is passed .

Clojure performance tuning
Having done some actual coding in Clojure I can post notes that will hopefully help others .
I have code that gets executed a lot ( it ’s a stack - based language interpreter ) and needed to bring it up to reasonable performance .
Here are some notes from the process :
You really should know the difference between a seq and a list .
If you use any of the seq functions ( such as drop or take ) , your list will no longer have an O ( 1 ) count operation .
Instead , it will become a LazySeq and count will become O( n ) .
If count is something you call frequently ( I do ) , you will want to avoid this .
In my case , my stacks were implemented as lists and count gets called very frequently , so this was a serious and surprising problem .
Surprising , because most tutorials skim over the difference , only emphasizing how general seqs are .
So if your count performance takes a dive , see if you can replace ( drop 2 mylist ) with ( pop ( pop mylist ) ) .
The latter will keep the PersistentList structure .
I implemented my stacks as both lists and vectors .
There was almost no performance difference between the two ( lists were actually slightly faster ) .
I found this to be a surprising result , I expected vectors to be faster .
I still think vectors might have lower memory requirements , but I do n’t know how to check .
For vector access , ( v n ) is faster than ( nth v n ) which is faster than ( get v n ) .
This is not something I expected .
I think this will get ironed out in the future , as Clojure matures .
Attempts to replace Clojure vectors containing integers with primitive Java int arrays produced no performance gains .
In fact , they managed to hurt performance because of some necessary conversions .
As expected , there are very few places where type declarations improve performance .
But if you have loops that get executed a lot , you might want to check .
Always measure , as the results might be unexpected , and remember that less is more .
When measuring anything running on top of the JVM , let it run for a while before you draw any conclusions .
The Hotspot JIT compiler does really cool things with the code , but it does them after a while .
In my case , I run code for at least 10 - 20 seconds and watch the results .
I take them into account only after they stabilize .
It is common to see a 2 x improvement between the first run and the last one .
Accessing vars costs cycles .
Clojure has no constants , so many people use * global - parameters * .
This is not a good idea in performance - sensitive code .
There are two ways around it : Define macros that expand to constants :
( defmacro global - parameter [ ] * global - parameter * )
and use ( global - parameter ) in your code .
Enclose your function definitions in let forms , rebinding global constants to lexical variables :
( let [ global - parameter * global - parameter * ] ( defn my - function [ ] ... ) )
As for profiling tools , the old and tried method of actually measuring wall time worked best .
I tried the YourKit profiler , but was n’t impressed , at at $ 499 it is way overpriced .
If they come out with a Clojure edition ( drop some features ) at $ 79 , I ’ll consider .
I also tried JVisualVM , but it turned out that it is buggy on a Mac and the profiler does n’t work .
I hope this will be fixed in the future .
Al Alcorn is one of the most important figures from the earliest days of the videogame industry .
Not only was he there at the birth of Atari , alongside Nolan Bushnell , but he was the engineer who built Pong – the second coin - operated videogame machine and the game that kicked off an industry .
He was also integral to the creation of the Atari VCS – the first incredibly successful cartridge - based home console , as well as a number of other products and designs .
Over his ten year tenure at Atari , Alcorn saw the company grow in leaps and bounds , had meetings in hot tubs and eventually saw the company starting to slide after Warner Communications bought it .
Mr+Alcorn+himself .
Since those days he has n't been directly involved in the videogame industry , but has remained on the cutting edge , working for Apple from 86 - 91 on a new technology called mpeg and working with a think tank funded by Paul Allen earlier this decade ( from which he spun off Zowie – a company that created a line of ' smart toys ' ) .
We caught up with Al atfor a chat .
Pong .+So+popular+that+the+streets+in+towns+with+machines+were+deserted+-+everyone+was+inside+playing!+Okay,+maybe+not.+But+it+was+popular!
We both wound up with jobs out of college at Ampex .
They built the first audio tape recorder , but the key thing here was that they invented the videotape recorder , so we were working with people who really knew video – analogue video .
Nolan was there in that group , and I was in – I was actually still at college , I was at Cal Berkley in the 60s .
Nolan had worked at an amusement park in Salt Lake City .
He went to college at the University of Utah , and he worked at an amusement park in the summer , so he understood the business of coin - operated games ; in those days [ that was ] pinball machines and mechanical driving games …
Nolan understood the economics of that , but that was n't going to make him any money .
He got a job at Ampex and I was at Ampex at the same time ; it was one group – this was the group from which Atari kind of sprang out of .
Nolan was at the University of Utah … that was very important because – we 're talking back in the 60s – the University of Utah , of all places , they invented computer graphics there .
A gentleman named Ivan Sutherland … one of the greats of computer science , he actually built the first graphic computer there .
Nolan saw the early game of Spacewar ! on the PDP - 1 … saw the confluence of seeing that you could do stuff – a game – with this computer , even though it was a million bucks worth of computers , and understanding the coin - op business , saying ' why not make a game using that kind of technology ?
You could make a fun game . '
That 's really the lead - in .
So here he was at Ampex .
Computers had come down in price pretty rapidly , and his idea was to go build an arcade [ game ] .
He had a Nova mini computer – it was the smallest you could get , cost about $ 2000 at the time .
He knew it was uneconomical , but he still wanted to do it ; he figured the price would come down at some point .
So he designed this game called Computer Space … and that was kind of a rip - off of the Spacewar ! game .
He quit Ampex first .
There was only one coin - op manufacturer west of the Mississippi , a company called Nutting Associates … he brought that to them and they said ' cool , we 'll build this '...
Anyhow , the game did n't do very well , maybe sold a thousand units at most , but he wanted to do another game and got into an argument with Nutting .
Nolan wanted to be part owner of the company , Nutting said no… so Syzygy was born as a company , and he came over and he hired me from Ampex because … being young and out of college I was hip to the new digital electronics , even though I was an analogue engineer .
At Cal , my degree had to be in electrical engineering and computer science , so I learnt a lot about – more than I wanted to at the time – computers , thank god .
We could n't use the name .
That was our first choice , our second was Atari .
Atari is a word from the Japanese game Go. I 'd never seen a videogame , other than Nolan [ had ] showed me his prototype of the Computer Space game .
Yeah .
' It 's the simplest game .
One moving spot , two paddles , score digits ' – that was one of the harder things to actually make , to try to make those seven segment numerals , y'know – and that was it .
It was an idea , but he told me he had a contract from General Electric for a consumer product , which meant that it had to be , like , maybe ten chips , and I was up to seventy chips … but he told me that to get me to work hard at it and do a good job .
So I tried to make it a good game .
I added things like speed up .
When you played the first one it was obvious that without the ball speeding up it was n't fun to play .
Then the reflection off the paddle was kind of tricky to do …
Well , I sort of had to .
If you did n't have it it would be boring !
Have you seen the Youtube video that 's out there of me and Ralph Baer playing the Magnavox Odyssey game prototype at the Game Developer 's Conference last week ?
Take a look at it , it 's really something – you 'll see he has a prototype of the original Brown Box , and it 's impossible to play .
It was a dog of a game !
And Nolan got the idea from that , but it's like the movie The Producers , because he figured we'd rip off the idea for a game , but so what ?
It 's no good , we 're not going to sell it , we 'll throw it away , so what harm is there , right ?
So , it did n't work out that way … they sent us a letter .
So the idea for the [ angles ] was just to make the game playable – it had to be fun !
It was just obvious .
There was no market testing , there was no research , there was no business plan , none of that crap .
And I added sound – you 've heard that story ?
Whom will you chose as more sexy , for The Car is more sexy than the model and for you ?

A Chinese - born engineer living in Orange County was convicted Thursday in the first - ever trial under the Economic Espionage Act .
Dongfan “ Greg ” Chung , 73 , of Orange , a former aerospace engineer at the Boeing plant in Huntington Beach , was found guilty of acting as a foreign agent , conspiring to violate the Economic Espionage Act and seven other charges .
He was found not guilty of obstruction of justice .
The ruling came after a 10 - day trial and roughly three weeks of deliberation by U.S. District Court Judge Cormac Carney .
Chung chose to have his case heard by a judge rather than a jury .
“ The trust Boeing placed in Mr. Chung to safeguard its proprietary and trade secret information obviously meant very little to Mr. Chung , ” Carney said .

“ He cast it aside to serve the PRC [ People ’s Republic of China ] , which he proudly proclaimed as his ‘ motherland . ’ ”
Chung , who had been free on bail , was immediately taken into custody because he is considered a flight risk .
“ He obviously has very close contact with the Chinese government that is ongoing , and frankly , all he has to do is go to the Chinese Consulate and . . . he ’d be gone , ” Assistant U.S. Atty .
Gregory Staples said in arguing that Chung be placed in custody .
With his wife and son standing nearby , Chung stood up and took off his dark blue suit coat and yellow - patterned tie , then relinquished his cellphone , wallet , a folded - up wad of cash and his car keys .
He put his hands behind his back and was cuffed by U.S. marshals .

In a search of Chung ’s home , investigators found some 300,000 documents -- some of them stashed in the crawl space -- that included plans for the fueling system of a Delta 4 rocket , an antenna system for the space shuttle and other aerospace and military technologies .
“ As federal agents sifted through the hundreds of thousands of pages of documents in Mr. Chung ’s home , the story of Mr. Chung ’s secret life became clear , ” Carney wrote in his 31 - page decision .
“ He was a spy for the PRC . ”
In closing arguments last month , the government contended that since the late 1970s , Chung had done everything in his power to lend his technical expertise to China ’s advancement , sending information via mail , sea freight , a Chinese agent named Chi Mak and the Chinese Consulate .
“ He did n’t blindly collect and provide random information , ” Assistant U.S. Atty .
Ivy Wang said .
“ He received specific tasking lists . ”

Defense attorneys said they expected to appeal .
They acknowledged that Chung had an affinity for China and provided some information decades ago during lectures at Chinese universities .
But the information was publicly available , the defense said , and Chung did not agree to give Chinese officials sensitive material .
“ Mr. Chung never went to the next level , ” attorney Thomas Bienert told Cormac .
He “ walked an interesting line , and certainly a risky line . . . but not a line that is criminal . ”
Chung , the defense said , had the documents in his home because he planned to write a book about the space shuttle .
Chung , a naturalized U.S. citizen , was born in China and came to the United States in the early 1960s .
He worked for Rockwell International in Downey until it was bought by Boeing in 1996 .
He was laid off by Boeing in 2002 .
He returned as a consultant after the Columbia space shuttle disaster in 2003 but was fired when the FBI began its probe in 2006 .

After Chung was laid off , the prosecution said , he spent considerable time organizing documents for a planned trip to China and met regularly with Mak , whom the government contends was a conduit to Chinese officials .
Mak was convicted of spying for China two years ago and is serving a 24 - year term .
In Washington , the Justice Department hailed the verdict as confirmation that its aggressive campaign to root out Chinese spies is working .
“ For years , Mr. Chung stole critical trade secrets from Boeing . . . all for the benefit of the government of China .
Today ’s verdict should serve as a warning to others willing to compromise America ’s economic and national security to assist foreign governments , ” said David Kris , assistant attorney general for national security .
The economic espionage charges against Chung were considered especially serious given the length of time involved , Justice Department officials said .
A handful of other people have been charged under the Economic Espionage Act , in cases mostly involving China , and some pleaded guilty in plea agreements .
But Chung ’s was the first to go to trial , Justice Department officials said .

Since late 2006 , the Justice Department has prosecuted more than 50 defendants accused of illicit exports of restricted technology to China , theft of trade secrets for the benefit of China ( economic espionage ) or classic espionage for China .
Prosecutors said they would probably recommend a 15 - to 20 - year prison sentence for Chung .
Sentencing is scheduled for Nov. 9 .

Telling Time
without a Clock :
Scandinavian Daymarks
Introduction | Pointing at the Sun | Hours of Day , Hours of Night | Scandinavian Daymarks | The Midday Daymark | The Other Daymarks | Daymarks and Day Sections Among Other Peoples | How Daymarks Work | Class Projects : Schoolyard Daymarks and Classroom Noon - Line Project
Introduction H ow would we measure time without a clock ?
We know that the Sun moves across the sky during the day .
Can we tell what time it is by looking at the position of the Sun ?
In modern times , precise time measurement is very important .
So many people depend on knowing the " right time " to go about their daily business .
Industrialized societies need accurate regular time measurement to function .
Does everyone on Earth live in such a society ?
No , in some parts of the world people still live much as they did thousands of years ago .
Even our industrialized societies are fairly new when compared to most of human existence .
Only a few hundred years ago telling time exactly was n't so important .
But it was still helpful to get a rough idea of what time it was .
Pointing at the Sun
Probably the simplest way to tell time is by knowing the path of the Sun across the sky and how long it takes the Sun to move .
Where on Earth is this method easiest ?
If the Sun rises high in the sky and its path does n't change much from season to season , it is pretty easy to tell time from the position of the Sun .
The Sun behaves more like this the closer to the equator one gets .
Many pre-industrial peoples in the tropics used this method of telling time , even into this century .
Many African peoples -- such as the Cross River , Caffres , Waporogo , and Wagogo peoples -- would indicate time by pointing to a place in the sky where the Sun would stand at the time they wished to indicate .
The same method was used in other parts of the world , such as the New Hebrides , Dutch East Indies , and Sarawak .
Hours of Day , Hours of Night
What about telling the time of the Sun in regions farther north or south of the equator ?
The Sun 's path changes much more over the course of the year as one moves farther from the equator .
In winter the Sun might be very low while in summer it might be much higher .
One simple way to tell time was to divide the daylight time and the night time into segments .
Many cultures did this , using different numbers of segments .
For example , the Chinese divided one sun-cycle into 12 sections and the Hindus into 60 .
Very early on , the Egyptians divided the period between sunrise and sunset into 10 sections , an d then added two more sections for the periods of twilight at dawn and nightfall - - making 12 sections of daylight time .
They then divided the night into 12 sections also .
This made a division of the sun-cycle into 24 sections , very much like the 24 hours that we divide the sun circle into .
The Babylonians used a similar system , and this is in fact where our modern 24 - hour day has its origin .
1
However , there was an important difference between the hours we use and the " hours " of the Babylonians and the Egyptians .
Their " hours " changed length , depending on what time of the year it was !
They divided both daylight and nighttime into 12 sections each .
When the daylight lasted a long time during the summer , their daylight " hours " could be as long as 75 minutes , while the nighttime " hours " were only 45 minutes long .
In winter , however , when the Sun was not up as long , their " hours " might shrink to as short as about 55 minutes during the day , while at night they were about 70 minutes .
Only on the equinoxes were their " hours " 60 minutes , both day and night , just like our modern hours .
You can imagine what trouble using a system like this would cause in the modern world , as the length of the hours changed slightly each day of the year !
The ancient Greeks had borrowed the Babylonian / Egyptian system of counting hours , but in the late second century BCE , over 2100 years ago , a Greek astronomer called Hipparchos suggested that the " equinoctal hours " of 60 minutes each for use at all times of the year .
This is where our modern system ultimately comes from , but it was a long time before it became widely used .
The Greeks ( and Romans ) continued using the Babylonian / Egyptian system of " temporal hours " which changed length through the year for thousands of years , and many European peoples adopted this usage as well .
In 725 CE , the English monk Bede wrote a highly influential book on time - keeping .
Most importantly , it helped popularize the modern Western system of counting years ( AD / CE and BC / BCE ) , but in it Bede also argued for dividing the sun-cycle into 24 equal hours at all times of the year .
Nevertheless , it was not until mechanical clocks started to become common during the 1300s that the " equal hours " began to replace the " temporal hours " for good .
Scandinavian Daymarks
The Egyptians , Babylonians , Greeks , and Romans all lived far enough north of the equator that they could not rely on a fairly constant Sun - path over the year , as people in the tropics did , but they were not so far from the equator that the differing lengths of day and night made it difficult for them to use their " temporal hours " , even though their lengths changed somewhat over the course of the year .
Very far north ( or south ) of the equator , however , the difference between the length of daylight time in the summer is very much greater than in the winter .
In parts of Scandinavia above the Arctic Circle ( at a latitude of 66.5° North ) the Sun does not set at all for part of the summer -- it is daylight all the time .
On the other hand , for part of the winter the Sun does not rise in these same areas .
Obviously there is no point in dividing the daytime or nighttime into twelve sections if they are not taking place !
Even if the Sun sets for only three of our modern hours in the summer , if one is dividing the daytime and nighttime into Babylonian / Egyptian - style " temporal hours " , the nighttime hours will be so short compared to the daytime hours that there is hardly any point in making the divisions .
However , even very far north ( or south ) , no matter where the Sun rises or sets , the middle of its path is above about the same part of the horizon .
That means you can always tell when the middle of the day is if you know above which point on the horizon the highest point of the Sun 's path is .
Also , no matter how high the Sun is above the horizon , it always passes over the same points on the horizon after the same interval of time .
Using these facts , the people living in Scandinavia developed a system of time - keeping quite different than the Babylonian / Egyptian system .
As said earlier , our modern system of time - keeping divides each sun-cycle into twenty - four hours , each of which is 60 minutes long .
The Scandinavians divided each sun-cycle ( sólarhringr , " sun-ring " in their language ) into eight sections .
2
They did this by dividing the horizon into eight sections ( north , northeast , east , southeast , south , southwest , west , and northwest ) .
Each of these sections was called an eighth ( átt or eykt ) .
3
A place on the horizon which lay dead center in any of these eight directions ( due north , due northeast , etc. ) was called a daymark ( dagmark ) .
4
The identified the time by noting when the Sun stood over one of these daymark - points on the horizon .
The Midday Daymark
What do you think the most important daymark was ?
It was the daymark beneath the highest part of the Sun 's path , since the Sun reaches the highest part of its path above the same part of the horizon every day of the year .
This central daymark was named Highday or Midday ( hádegi or middag ) .
That was the name of the time , just as we would say " twelve o'clock " or " noon " .
The position of the Sun at this time had its own related name : Midday Place ( hádegistað or middagsstad ) .
5
Many , perhaps most , Scandinavians lived in isolated farms or villages in earlier times .
They used geographical features located on the horizon ( as viewed from near their homes ) as guides to the daymarks .
Often they would name a feature , usually a mountain , after the daymarks .
Since Midday was the most important daymark , there were many mountains named after it : Middagsfjället , Middagshorn , Middagshaugen , Middagsnib , Middagsberg , and Middagsfjeld are all mountain names in Norway - - similarly Sweden has Middagsberget and Middagshognan , while Iceland has a Hádegisbrekkur .
All of these names are made by taking the Scandinavian words for Midday ( or Highday ) and adding a Scandinavian word meaning " mountain " .
They are like saying " Mount Midday " or " Midday Mountain " in English .
The Other Daymarks
Midday was the most important daymark , since it divided the Sun 's path in half , but there were seven other daymarks in all , and each of these had names , too .
Some of these daymarks took place during the night when the Sun was below the horizon .
Because Scandinavia was so far north , during the winter the Sun could be below the horizon most of the time !
But when the Sun is not very far under the horizon and the weather is clear , it is still possible to see it 's light showing where the daymark is on the horizon .
What is the opposite of Midday ?
It is Midnight .
Just as we have a name for the middle of the night in English , the Scandinavian 's had a name for the daymark in the middle of the night : miðnætti .
It is very easy to find a Midnight daymark in the summer in Scandinavia .
Although the Sun often does set for a while at night , the twilight is often bright enough to mark the spot on the horizon which the Sun is beneath .
In some parts of Scandinavia the Sun simply does not set in the middle of summer !
Then one need only look for the lowest point in the Sun 's path , and mark the spot on the horizon beneath it .
Just as the Sun reaches its highest point ( Midday ) at due south , it reaches its lowest point ( Midnight ) at due north .
Between Midday and Midnight are three more daymarks .
The first is called Undorn or simply eykt .
The names for this daymark are hard to translate into English .
Their origins were lost long ago , and even the ancient Scandinavians may not have known exactly where the names came from -- only that they referred to this time of day in the afternoon .
6
After the Scandinavians were converted to Christianity , they sometimes used the name nón for this time , borrowed from the Latin term hora nona , which means ninth hour -- the Roman people , who spoke Latin , had considered the ninth hour of the day to happen in the afternoon ( clearly they started counting their hours at a different time ( 6 a.m. ) than we do now ! ) .
7
After undorneykt ( or nón ) comes Mid-Evening ( miðr aptann ) .
At Mid-Evening , the Sun is approximately due west -- or halfway between the Midday ( south ) and Midnight ( north ) daymarks .
On the equinoxes the Sun would set right at the Mid-Evening daymark .
Before Midnight , there was one more daymark called Night - Measure ( náttmál ) .
8
Between Midnight and Midday there are three more daymarks , making eight in all .
Midnight was followed by Ótta .
This name comes from an very ancient Germanic root - word , * uhtwón , and designated the time of night before daybreak , which was thought the deepest and most frightening time of night .
9
Even during summer , the sky would darken a little at this time in many parts of Scandinavia .
In winter , Ótta must have seemed very dark indeed !
Mid-Morning ( miðr morgun ) took place when people woke up in the morning .
10 Most of the daymarks were determined by events in daily life like this .
Since the Sun rose so early in summer , it might have been light long before people finished sleeping .
On the other hand , in winter , the Sun might not rise until long after people woke up .
In a way similar to that of Mid-Evening , the Sun at Rise - Measure is approximately due west , halfway between the Midnight ( north ) and Midday ( south ) daymarks .
On the equinoxes the Sun would rise right at the Rise - Measure daymark .
Before Midday there was one more daymark called Day - Measure ( dagmál ) -- just as Night - Measure came before Midnight .
These other daymarks did not seem to be as important as Midday , but sometimes we find geographical features named after these daymarks , just as we found them named after the Midday daymark : in Norway we find Rismaalsfjeld and Nonsfjeld , in Sweden we find Nonsberget and Nonsknätten .
In Iceland are Dagmálahóll , Eyktargnipa , Nónfell , Miðaptansdrangur , and Undornsfell .
Around a thousand years ago many Scandinavians settled in England , and they used some of these same naming traditions at their new English farms .
Thus , there are some more daymark - type place names in the parts of England where they settled .
How Daymarks Work
On the right is a view of a Scandinavian farm from above .
In the center is the farm house , and around it are imaginary lines and labels showing in which direction the various daymarks are .
The edge of the green circle represents the horizon .
Beyond it the Sun is shown standing at the eight daymark points on the horizon .
Would the Sun always be visible at these daymarks ?
No , sometimes it would be below the horizon and not visible .
But even when we cannot see the Sun it is still below the daymark , underneath the horizon at night .
In the summer , when the Sun is up almost all of the time , the Sun appears to travel around the circle in a clockwise fashion .
Even at midnight , there may be enough twilight lingering in the north to show where on the horizon the Sun would be .
If the farm were far enough north , the Sun might even be visible above the horizon at midnight during the middle of the summer .
In our modern system of telling time , if the time is halfway between one hour and the next -- between 2 p.m. and 3 p.m. for example -- we might say it was " half past two " .
The Scandinavians used a similar system when the Sun stood halfway between two daymarks .
In such a case , they would say it was " evenly near both " ( jafn nærri bá ðu ) daymarks .
So if the Sun were between the Midday and Undorn daymarks , they would say , " It 's evenly near both Midday and Undorn . "

Daymarks on the Horizon
This diagram , on the right , shows a view south from the same Scandinavian farm , with mountains on the horizon drawn in black ..
It shows how the daymarks work , using the Midday daymark as an example .
The people living on this farm could watch the Sun 's path everyday and find where its highest point was -- and in this diagram the Sun is shown at the highest point in its path .
What did the Scandinavians call this place in the Sun 's path ?
They called it Midday 's Place ( hádegistað or middagsstad ) .
Conveniently for the people on this farm , there is a large mountain directly beneath Midday 's Place which they can use as a daymark .
Which daymark is it ?
It is the Midday daymark .
They might name the mountain under the Midday daymark something like " Mount Midday " .
Then they will know that whenever the see the Sun over Mt. Midday , that the time is " Midday " .
When the Sun is in Midday Place , it is above the
Midday daymark .
This means the time is " Midday " .
On the right is a diagram showing a view from the same imaginary Scandinavian farm .
This view shows the Sun 's path on the equinoxes , either autumn or spring .
The Sun is shown its positions at Rise - Measure 's Place ( sunrise ) , Midday 's Place , and Mid-Evening 's Place ( sunset ) .
The Sun 's path is drawn in yellow .
The mountain which marks the Midday daymark is named Mt. Midday .
On some farms , the people might find mountains for the other daymarks and name them , too -- or they might use other features , like passes , waterfalls , etc .
In this diagram , there are mountains named after the Rise - Measure and Mid-Evening daymarks , and their names are in brackets .
Equinoctal View of the South Horizon from a Scandinavian Farm
Summer and Winter and the Daymarks
Now look at the view from the same farm in summer .
Where is the Sun 's path now ?
The Sun is very high in the sky , even when it is over the Rising - Measure and Mid-Evening daymarks !
During the summer the Sun 's path is longer than it is at the equinoxes and much , much longer than it is during the winter .
But no matter how high or low the Sun is in the sky , it still arrives over the daymarks at the same time .
This means when the Sun is at its highest point in the winter it is still over the same daymark as in the summer .
So when the Sun is over Mt. Midday it means that the time is Midday , whether it is winter or summer .
It 's highest point during the winter is not as high as its highest point during the summer .
Summer View of the South Horizon from a Scandinavian Farm
During the summer in Scandinavia , the Sun scarcely ever sets -- particularly in the northernmost sections .
The diagram on the right shows what a view north from the same Scandinavian farm might look like at Midnight in the middle of the summer .
The twilight glow of the Sun is still visible , even though the Sun is below the horizon .
This is the lowest part of the Sun 's path .
At the Midnight daymark on the northern horizon there is a pass - - a gap in the mountains -- which the people living on the farm might name after the daymark .
Perhaps they might call it Midnight Pass , just like they called the mountain to their south Mt. Midday , after the Midday daymark
Summer View of the North Horizon from a Scandinavian Farm
On the right is a diagram showing a view from the same imaginary Scandinavian farm , except that this view show 's the Sun 's path during the winter .
What is different about the Sun 's path now ?
It is shorter .
The Sun rises and sets closer to the middle of its path than it does in the equinoctal diagram above .
The Sun is also lower in the sky .
But is the Midday Place in the winter still the same as the summer Midday Place ?
It is .
No matter what time of year it is , the Sun is always highest in the sky over the same spot on the horizon ( due south ) .
Is this also true for the other daymarks ?
It is .
Even if the people on the farm cannot see the Sun because it is below the horizon , the daymarks remain at the same place ( and same time ) .
However there is a problem !
If during the winter the Sun is only above the horizon around Midday , then no one can tell what daymark it is at .
This seems like a big problem .
However , during the winter it was so dark and cold outside that people spent most of the time indoors , resting , entertaining themselves , or doing indoor tasks .
In such cases it was n't so important to know what time it was .
On the other hand , in the summer , there was a lot of activity -- and luckily the Sun would be up most of the time , so that it would be very easy to tell what time it was .
However , if any daymark would be visible in winter , it would be the Midday daymark .
Why is this ?
It is because Midday occurs when the Sun is at the highest point in its path .
Perhaps this is why there are more mountains named after Midday than any other daymark .

Daymarks and Day Sections among Other Peoples
Many , many peoples around the world divided their day up into sections which , like the Scandinavian daymarks , would change in length at different times of the year .
This is because these people , like the Scandinavians , were farmers who were more interested in using the sunlight than having hours of the same length like we are !
The Native American Natchez people of Louisiana , USA divided up the day - light time into four sections , just like the Scandinavians .
Many other Native American tribes did the same .
Mérida ,
July 29 , 2009 ( Venezuelanalysis.com ) - This week the Venezuelan Education Ministry
began its program , dubbed Project Canaima , to provide primary schools with mini
laptops , and incorporate the technology into the education system .
While
schools are on vacation this week , the ministry will be conducting workshops
for teachers on using the computers as educational tools .
Starting in September ,
when the school semester begins , the ministry anticipates providing 50,000
laptop computers to over 1,150 schools nationally .
The
batch is the first in a total of 350,000 computers that Portugal has
agreed to send to Venezuela
as part of an oil trading agreement between the two countries .
Venezuela also
hopes to set up its own assembly plant for the mini laptops as part of a technology
transfer agreement .
The
computers will run on the open source operating system Linux , while the Education
Ministry together with the National Centre for Information Technology are
working together on designing education programs for the computers .
The
computers are made for children , both in size and durability , and come with
wireless internet access and flash memory instead of a hard drive .
President
Hugo Chavez said in March , " We 're going to put computers in the classrooms .
The
teachers will have their computers connected and every desk will have a
computer , every child will have a little computer . "
According
to World Internet Usage , 29.9 % of Latin America's
population have some kind of access to the internet .
This late - night lamp takes your laziness and turns it into a virtue .
When you are propped up in bed reading and you can no longer keep your eyes open , let alone fumble for a light switch , just drop your book on top of the bedside light .
The wedge - shape of the Reading Lamp will let your book hang over it , keeping your place , and an infrared switch detects the book and kills the power .
Too hot ?
Scared the book might hit Fahrenheit 451 ?
The compact fluorescent inside keeps things cool -ish and the polycarbonate shade is tough enough to last .
The Reading Lamp is part of a group project by designers Alban Le Henry , Olivier Pigasse , Vincent Vandenbrouck and Jun Yasumoto , and looks to us very much like the lights inside the railroad trains of childhood , when the windows had curtains , the seats had ashtrays and the conductors called you sir .
Well , they called my father sir .
I was always to busy throwing up my ice - cream lunch from the window ( an opening window , at least ) .
This is a concept which should be snapped up right now .
Muji and Ikea , I ’m looking at you .

Hatsune Miku is a popular digital songstress from Vocaloid , a Yamaha voice synthesizer that allows people to " sing " simply by inputting lyrics and melodies .
This is relevant , because the green - haired diva has been snapped up by Sega and is appearing in her own PSP music game , Hatsune Miku - Project Diva - .
Sega has been promoting the game by talking up the " 3D modeling " for Miku , and as you can see from the screenshots , there 's a very good reason for that .
I do n't think there is a single shot of Miku wearing anything that could be considered even vaguely dignified .
Still , it looks like she enjoys having a camera basically thrust up her twadge , so who are we to complain ?
- Project Diva - will be making Japanese teenagers masturbate early next month .
The last 2 months I ’ve been seeing ads of Evony the game all over the web and after seeing it for the thousandth time I could n’t help but give it a try — hey , who could resist ads with pretty faces all over it ?
Well , do n’t be surprised because it has nothing to do with pretty faces .
Evony is a free to play browser based MMORTS ( Massive Multiplayer Online Real Time Strategy ) game where you can build up your city and army in order to expand your territory and conquer other enemy players or NPCs .
You can sign up to Evony here if that has already intrigued you .
The Interface
Evony resembles many other RTS games such as civilization , ages of empire and many others .
The learning curve for Evony is very simple due to their quest system which guides new players through their interface .
You can easily grasp the concept and the main functions of the game in as little as 1 to 2 hours playtime .
The three main screens of interface is separated into three parts , the world map , the town and the city .
In the world map , you ’ll find other NPC & player cities , valleys ( resource fields ) and empty slots where you can conquer to progress further into the game .
The city is where you can build farms , sawmills , quarries and iron mines to increase your resource production .
The town is where you ’ll construct most of your buildings for advancement .
Military training and research is also constructed here .
City Building
The game starts you off in a random ( usually the newest ) server in an empty town with only a Town Hall and your job is to build up the stranded city , army and slowly conquer your way through .
Building new facilities , researching , and training troops requires an X amount of time to complete .
The lower level the facility , the quicker it will take .
The first building you ’ll develop is the cottage which takes 1 min and 15 secs , but the second level will require twice as much time and as more levels are acquired , the longer it will take .
Some buildings can even take over 12 hours .
Each city in Evony is limited to constructing 1 building at a time .
You can not set a queue to build a second or third building when one is finished .
This requires a player to come back and check on the progression very often .
Its not about how much time you spend on the game once but how many times you spend on it through out the day .
As you acquire more and more cities however , you will have more than enough tasks to spend your whole day playing .
City Management
Other than gathering resources , consistently upgrading buildings you ’ll also need to manage your taxes , population and the loyalty of your citizens .
You ’ll also need to appoint a mayor which we ’ll get to shortly .
Unlike most RTS games you ’ve played , the ideal tax rate for Evony depends on two major factors , idle or actively playing .
The population will effect the amount of gold you ’ll receive from taxes , production , and how many units you can recruit into your army .
Always having enough resources to continuously construct new buildings may get difficult , thus you ’ll need to put good use of the market place .
In the market place , you can buy & sell food , lumber , stone and iron .
You can even create offers or bids and wait until your price is met .
However , there is a small auction fee .
Heroes
Once you ’ve created an inn and a feasting hall you can hire a Hero to lead your army or become a Mayor .
Each Hero has 3 stats , politics , attack and intelligence .
Politics will decreases your cities construction time and resource production .
Higher attack increases your combat and how fast your units will be trained .
Intelligence shortens the time required for research and scouting ability .
Your heroes will acquire experience points through combat , mayor duties or through items .
There is an hourly fee for maintaining a hero , and the salary will vary depending on their level .
You can dismiss and replace heroes at anytime .
A hero is also required to lead your troops into combat .
Military & Combat
There are a variety of military units available ranging from infantry , archers , cavalries , mechanical units and transporters .
All units has a maintenance cost of X amount of food .
Their movement , health , attack and defense can be upgraded with research .
Training new units will require taking away civilians from your overall population .
Once you ’ve developed your army and have a hero in place , you ’ll need to go to the World Map screen to conquer new lands and terroritories .
There are 3 basic types of land that can be conquered , valleys , empty lots and cities .
Valleys provide additional resources , empty lots are used to build new cities and cities can be plundered and if attacked enough times you can even take it over .
However , if you are attacking a player city , and if that is their only city , you will not be able to take it over .
The combat in Evony is calculated through their algorithm , no actual fighting is visible .
Its either a win or loss and the results are reported in writing .
You lose x amount , they lose x amount and etc .
Attack , defense , health and even movement is factored into the calculation .
For example , you ’re attacking with warriors , cavalries and archers , the archers will start off in combat because of their range followed by cavalries and then warriors last .
In result , if your archers do enough damage , you may win without even going into melee range .
Or your cavalries will take more damage than your warriors because they arrived in melee combat first .
The rally point has an exercise option which servers a skirmish for battles and will calculate the results .
Your research and hero attributes are not factored but it does give you an idea of what to attack with .
Titles & Ranks
As your city grows , you will gain Prestige points which is basically a rating of how well you are doing .
There is an overall ranking that is compared among all other players in your city as well .
As you progress , you will be able to acquire new titles and ranks .
Some ranks are extremely difficult to acquire , it requires gold and medals ( which are very rare to find ) .
The medal drop rates on new servers are about .1 % or less .
The easiest way is to spend a few dollars and purchase the medals you ’ll need .
The higher the rank , the more cities you can control , up to a total of 9 .
Items
There are many different types of items available in Evony which can help speed your production , moving your city location , experience points and much much more .
When you first start , you ’re given a TON of items to try out and help enhance your gameplay .
Items can also be acquired by quest rewards and using real money .
Alliance
Alliances are what most MMO players know as guild or clans .
By joining with other alliances , you can have friends who can offer assistance through knowledge , resources , raids and much more .
Possibly even scaring another player from attacking you if they know you ’re in a well rounded alliance .
Each alliance can only have a maximum of 100 players and have a ranking of their own .
Final Thoughts
One flaw I currently see in the game is when you first start , there is not much interaction with other players you intend to play with .
Your city is picked in a random location , you are given a city teleporter but that is also random .
Further on the game you ’ll receive an advance city teleporter which then you can move your city near friends if empty lots permit .
Last but not least , the medals are TOO difficult to acquire in which you ’ll be more or less forced to spend money in order to play aggressively and compete with others .
After a few days of play time , I can say the game is very enjoyable and the fact that I do not need to spend a whole lot of hours on it is very ideal to me .
I spend most of my day in front of the computer and alt tabbing to hit build or attack once in a while is a relief from work .
If you ’re the type that really enjoys civilization type of games but wish it could ’ve been with 100 other players then this might work just for you .
Final Conclusion –
If you do n’t mind forking out some money then this game is definitely worth playing but otherwise , there are many other games that are really free and good .
Again , here is the sign up link and enjoy !
This appears to be an internal production memo accidentally posted to the Associated Press wire .
I think a web production staffer at AP is being yelled at very loudly right this minute .
Worker Cooperatives from around the country met at Isthmus Engineering on Saturday June 20 to elect a new board , consider some proposals , and debate some serious issues .
We also heard about the research coming out of the UW Center for Cooperatives and heard a rousing speech from Ed Garvey who should remind all of us that this process , this work , should be fun .
As president of the organization , I facilitated the day and did not take notes .
Executive Director Melissa
Hoover took over that role with assistance from NASCO's ED , Tom Pierson .
We elected 4 directors who I think will bring a lot of diversity , energy , and knowledge to the organization .
I wo n't release their names right now since I think that all the candidates should be notified before the winning names get published .
We passed the by - law change that will extend the term limit to 5 years and will alternate the election of at - large members with regional directors .
At next year 's conference in San Francisco , the membership will elect their regional reps and have a special election for an at - large member to serve for one - year ( to replace me ) .
This means that the at - large members will always be elected on the odd - number year during the annual meeting ( without the conference ) and the regional reps will always be elected on the even - numbered years during the conference .
We created the " Worker Cooperator of the Year Award " although their was some discussion about also allowing a Worker Cooperative of the Year as well .
The first award will be presented next year in San Francisco !
The award can not be given to current directors ( or staff ) and nominations will come up through the regions -- so people should start thinking now about who you would like to nominate !
We broke into small groups to discuss areas of interests and to help formulate a plan for the board to act upon in the coming year .
this is where having the notes would be great , but I do n't .
It was a good discussion and presented some very clear ideas about where we will be going this year .
I imagine that the next newsletter will have a lot on this topic .
Ed Garvey presented the keynote address .
Ed 's work over the years has been incredible .
He organized the NFL players and led them through their first strike to get decent pay .
He fought Perrier 's attempt to steal Wisconsin 's water ( and won ) , he ran for the US Senate and Governor of Wisconsin .
He lost , but only due to the negative campaigns and tons of money .
He did n't tell the crowd this , but the race for Senate was so nasty , Ed won a defamation lawsuit against the Senator ( that is almost unheard of ) .
Six years later , Russ Feingold beat the incumbent and that is the rest of the story .
Most recently , he created Fighting Bob Fest in honor of Bob La Follette --a Wisconsin socialist / progressive who was the last third party candidate to win any electoral votes in a presidential election ( 1924 ) .
He had a great speech - he is a powerful speaker and he is very , very funny .
He told us that we are the future of the labor movement .
The unions , while good , have lost their way ( he mentioned Andy Stern and the SEIU 's attempt to offer concessions before they even have a union ) .
He told us , though , that we need to get our story out .
He has offered his web site for Fighting Bob Fest as a platform for us and will print our blogs , our letters , and our stories .
The rest is up to us .
In the big discussion , we ended up with an animated discussion over buying from other worker cooperatives .
For some , the issue is solidarity and growing the movement .
For others , the issues revolves around fairness , the lack of diversity in products and services , and quality issues .
The second discussion was about raising dues for the Federation .
We need to have a full - time staff person to succeed as an organization .
So far , we have done a good job at getting the low - hanging fruit , but now we need to step up .
This will be difficult .
People expect to get services in return for their dues , but our current dues limit our abiities .
Also the spread between the low and high end is very wide .
One thing that we all definitely agreed upon is that we need more member cooperatives .
We especially need the bigger member cooperatives to join as well .
We adjourned for the day to a coop reception and then to Rebecca Kemble and Adam Chern 's house for party .
Rebecca and her sister Martha ( both Union Cab members ) also catered the meeting and were declared best caterers ever .
They kindly invited the Federation to their house for their annual wedding anniversary and solstice party .
( Gordon , there were about 15 - 20 cheeses laid out -- next time you come to Madison , I will introduce you to them and their cheese maven friends ) .
It was an incredible night and I had to use my presidential authority to veto an executive decision from staff that would have made all future meetings and conferences held in Madison !
Update : Caplin Rous ’ FACute , answering many questions .
My first encounter with a capybara was sad and strange : I saw one in a cramped cage at a county fair as a teenager .
In amongst the rides , the shooting galleries , and the weird food , just this tiny cage and this incredibly peculiar creature that I ’d never seen before , or even imagined existed .
It had unbelievably beautiful eyes .
Ever since then , I ’ve been fascinated with capybaras because they seem so fantastical and they also have this gruffly wise look to them .
( I only wish I had found some way to rescue that first one from what could n’t have been a great life . )
Recently , I had a dream about capybaras , and , astoundingly , a capybara named Caplin Rous , responded in the comments !
This led to further investigations , and the discovery that Caplin Rous lives in Texas , and that Melanie Typaldos dons the Caplin Rous ( Rodents of Unusual Size , if you remember your Princess Bride ) persona for her website devoted to her capybara .
Not only that , Typaldos has just released a kid ’s book called Celeste and the Giant Hamster , which does include appearances by a capybara .
( The book is well - written , clever and interesting –definitely worth buying . )
It seemed only natural , given the topics that crop up on Ecstatic Days , to interview Melanie Typaldos about Caplin Rous , as wonderful a capybara as I ’ve ever seen .
The answers about capybaras may surprise you , including what sounds they make !
It ’s just a great interview .
How did you wind up with a capybara in Texas ?
And had you ever had one before ?
Six months before we got Caplin Rous , I went to the Los Llanos region of Venezuela with my two grown children , Philip and Coral .
One of our goals was to see capybaras in the wild .
We were lucky enough to see quite a few of them … actually hundreds , maybe thousands .
Our most amazing experience was holding a three - month - old capybara that our guide simply picked up off the road one evening .
The docile nature of that capybara in our first up - close experience started us thinking that a capybara might make a good pet .
When we got back to Texas we researched capybaras on the web and found surprisingly little information on their suitability as pets .
However , we did note that some sites stated something along the lines of “ commonly kept as pets ” with absolutely no data to back the claim .
What kind of a pet is a capybara ?
How smart ?
And what kind of temperament ?
When we questioned locals in Venezuela , they stated in no uncertain terms that capybaras are the dumbest animals on the planet .
Our experience is quite the opposite .
Caplin is at least as smart as a dog , although differently motivated .
He wo n’t do anything if there is n’t something in it for him .
It seems like he recognizes every person he ’s ever met and reacts differently to them .
In general , he is a very sweet and affectionate animal .
He likes to sit on the couch next to me or in my lap while I feed him treats .
Since he weighs 100 lbs , I can only have him in my lap for a few minutes before it starts cutting off circulation in my legs .
At night , Caplin likes to sleep under the covers if the weather is cold , or on the floor beside the bed in warmer weather .
In a single word , I would describe him as needy .
He always wants to be with me and can “ eep ” loudly if he knows I am nearby but he ca n’t get to me .
He follows me around the house and the yard and expects me to watch him while he swims or grazes .
He panics if he does n’t know where I am .
When he thinks it ’s time for me to come home from work , he will go to the gate and wait for me .
How on earth did you train Caplin Rous ?
Like many rodents , capybaras are very smart and Caplin is no exception .
When he was a month old I taught him to shake hands by saying “ shake ” and tapping his paw until he picked it up .
It took 15 minutes for him to figure it out .
The last trick I taught him was to go in a circle when I signal .
I saw a video of a capybara in a zoo in Japan that could do this trick .
There are n’t many other capybaras that can do any tricks at all and I did n’t want the Japanese capybara to one - up Caplin .
To teach this I used one of his favorite foods , a fruit popsicle .
Keeping the popsicle just out of reach , I led him in a little circle , rewarding each correct step .
After two popsicles , he knew the trick .
What is it that you like so much about capybaras ?
What I love most about Caplin is how much he loves me and how smart he is .
I also love his noises .
When people hear him they are always amazed .
His voice is often mistaken for a birdsong .
When he ’s nervous he sounds like the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park .
When he ’s happy he sounds like a Geiger counter .
Do people do double - takes when they see Caplin Rous for the first time ?
I shared photos with friends and they thought they had been Photoshopped .
I take Caplin out in public a lot just because I like to have him with me .
It is fun to watch people ’s reactions .
Most people have no idea what he is and some take that as a personal affront , angry that such an animal could even exist .
But most people are excited and enthusiastic about him , often referring to him as a giant hamster .
That usually means they like him .
Those who refer to him as a giant rat are more likely to be afraid .
He is confused with a variety of animals such as tapirs , wombats and peccaries .
One thing that amazes me is that very small children in strollers who can hardly speak a dozen words will point at him and say , “ Mouse ! ”
They are almost better at making that connection than adults are .
How many other animals do you have ?
Does Caplin get along with all of them ?
We have four horses , three rainbow boas , two leopard tortoises and a rabbit .
Caplin and the rabbit are great friends although we constantly worry that he ’ll step on her .
The tortoises sometimes invade Caplin ’s corner of the yard and he will do his threat display of clicking and barking to try to drive them off .
They ignore him .
He is scared to death of the snakes , probably imagining they are anacondas .
Of the four horses , only the oldest and gentlest one is allowed near Caplin .
I do n’t trust the others not to paw him out of curiosity .
Does Caplin Rous roam free ?
And do you need a permit to keep Caplin ?
I treat Caplin just like a dog .
He goes in and out of the house at will and has pretty much free roam of the fenced area .
I do n’t let him out at night because we have coyotes that sometimes come near the house .
When we ’re outside the yard I always keep him in his harness and leash .
Catching a capybara is something like catching a greased hog with their similar body shape and his tendancy to be wet and covered with mud .
Where I live in Texas , no permits are required to own a capybara but this is not true in many places .
State and local restrictions may apply .
New York and California have particularly stringent rules concerning rodents .
What ’s your favorite thing about Caplin Rous ?
It ’s hard to pick just one aspect , but I think I love his noises the most .
Since I used to do pharmaceutical research and had frequent occasion to use a Geiger counter , I never would have thought that sound could bring a smile to my face the way it does now .
Did Caplin play a role in the writing of your book ?
Caplin was the inspiration for my book .
My granddaughter wanted a book about cats but I soon found the capybara taking over the story .
The cats mimic human reactions including fear , anger , curiosity and surprise , finally resulting in friendship and acceptance when they get to know the capybaras in the book .
Without Caplin , I would not have known about these reactions or about capybara behavior , which is very poorly documented .
When did you start pretending to be Caplin Rous ?
What do you find interesting about inhabiting the persona of a giant rodent ?
One day as I explored MySpace I noticed that a surprising number of guinea pigs had their own pages .
Just for fun , I created a Caplin page .
He immediately attracted friends , either people or “ anipals , ” who were interested in capybaras .
Since I ’d had so little luck finding information about pet capybaras , I wanted to do my part to contribute to the knowledge base .
Even though the blog entries are written in Caplin ’s voice , they contain a lot of information about his behavior , both good and bad .
The day Caplin bit me I posted a blog expressing both of our confusion over the event and his subsequent hostility .
Over time , I realized he intended me to be part of his herd and I was not cooperating .
Eventually we worked through this .
I also kept a chart of his growth and had him discuss his medical issues , which included a brief period of paralysis following neutering .
New capybara owners now have a little more information about what they are getting into than I did when I got Caplin .
What about capybaras do you think would come as a surprise to someone who does n’t have one as a pet ?
The existence of capybaras surprises people more than anything else .
Once they get over the shock of a giant rodent , they tend to admire his calm demeanor .
When Caplin does a trick , such as shaking hands , they are surprised by his intelligence , frequently claiming that he is smarter than their dog .
I think he is just better trained .
People with some prior knowlege would be most surprised by what active and agile swimmers they are .
If you see capybaras in the zoo , they are almost always doing nothing .
Caplin is a very graceful in the water , more like an otter than a dog .
He has an above ground swimming pool that is about 15 ’ x10 ’ x5 ′ and he zips around underwater , putting his forepaws against his stomach and pushing off with his hind feet .
I love to watch him play with his pool toys .
He especially loves to swim through hoops .

Popular culture seems to have two general depictions of small towns .
The first is a naive , sleepy , hamlet where nothing ever happens ,
populated with lovable eccentrics and warm - hearted folk ( always folk ,
never people ) .
Generally this setup sees the return of the prodigal son
or arrival of an outsider , almost always from the “ big city , ” of which
the townies speak with disdain .
The protagonist will eventually fall in
love with a more wholesome type of woman and realize what he ’s needed
all along is a simpler kind of life .
See television shows like Northern Exposure and Ed , for example .
The other stereotype involves a placid calm that masks a swirling tempest of murder ( Hitchcock ’s Shadow of a Doubt ) , violence , racism ( Pudd’nhead Wilson ) ,
small mindedness , and cowfucking ( that would be Faulkner ) .
The most
accurate depiction of life in a small town I have ever seen , the TV
show Friday Night Lights , is constantly in danger of being canceled .
No one wants to watch it .
Thousands of Broadways : Dreams and Nightmares of the American Small Town by Robert Pinsky .
106 pages .
University of Chicago . $ 16.00 .
Americans love the myth of the small town , while the reality is a little harder to come by .
Small town culture is actually in decline , which maybe explains the renewed nostalgia .
We are an increasingly urban species .
Timothy Clack states in Ancestral Roots that by 2020 , 60 percent of the Earth ’s population will live in cities .
We crowd together in our big city centers while the small towns face dwindling populations and increasingly destitute main streets .
Kids who grow up in small towns , myself included , talk of “ getting out ” and “ escaping . ”
Those left burdened with running the family farm or trapped by poverty or bad luck are looked upon with pity .
When couples decide they ’d like a slower way of life these days , they do n’t move to the small towns — they move to a suburb , many of which try to recreate the small town ideal .
Unsuccessfully .
The lawns might look the same , but while small towns often painfully feel like they ’re sealed off from the outside world , suburbs exist in relation to the city .
You meet your needs — food , work , entertainment — in the city and retreat to your suburban hideaway .
This is why you hear people who live in the Chicago suburbs referring not to “ Chicago ” or “ the city ” but to “ downtown . ”
It ’s no wonder this keeps reappearing as the ideal of what life should be — somewhere between Andy Griffith and Our Town , where everyone knows your name and the streets are safe enough for the kids to play in them .
Of course everyone who grew up in a small town knows that these two extremes — the picture perfect cozy little town and the hidden nightmare — are both wrong .
Yes , everyone in a small town does know your name .
And your father ’s name , and your age , what car you drive , what prescription medication you ’re on , and what you were up to the night before .
And while there are episodes of domestic violence and the occasionally shocking suicide statistic , especially in the very rural areas , towns are hardly the breeding grounds for lynch mobs and serial killers that some might suggest .
Robert Pinsky grew up in the small town of Long Branch , New Jersey , and focuses on small towns in his book Thousands of Broadways : Dreams and Nightmares of the American Small Town .
The essays were originally given as a series of lectures , encompassing both Pinsky ’s personal experiences and depictions in film and books .
While the material is rich — Willa Cather , Mark Twain , Preston Sturges , Alfred Hitchcock , a KKK rally , the death of a president — the book is unfulfilling .
The essays and lectures are so concerned with detail and trivia — for example , did you know that Sturges invented smear - proof lipstick as a teenager ?
I now do — that they forget to say anything sweeping and interesting .
The sharpest section of Thousands of Broadways is a section quoted at length that reconsiders the Stage Manager ’s speech at the end of Our Town as told by a character in a Faulkner story .
“ Nothin ’ much happened .
Couple of people got raped , couple more got their teeth kicked in … ”
It was written by Kenneth Tynan .
When the majority of the writers and filmmakers Pinsky examines were working , the town was the center of American life .
Most of the population either lived in one or traveled there from the countryside to conduct business .
Today the center of culture , education , entertainment , employment are all focused in the cities .
The small town does not represent anything in contemporary society other than itself .
When you want to write an epic , you set it in the city .
The small town is no longer America , except in the pandering talk of politicians .
And yet still the mythic ideal persists .
Perhaps we have collectively seen too many Jimmy Stewart movies and long for a wholesomeness that no longer seems to exist .
If it ever did .
Even when Pinsky was a child , the common refrain was that Long Branch had seen its better days , a holiday retreat of the rich so lovely that President Garfield , languishing after having been shot , wanted to return there .
It was in that town that Pinsky first learned to be embarrassed of his ambition to be a writer , told by well - meaning men in the town that he would never find work .
Perhaps most annoying is Pinsky ’s inability to define what a small town is .
He uses the word “ town ” to sweep up pretty much anything that is n’t New York , Chicago , or Los Angeles , as if a small rural town in Kansas exhibits the same behavior as a resort town on the Jersey Shore .
Perhaps the most interesting part of Thousands of Broadways is barely covered : how the creative soul , the free spirit , the intellectual , the artist , and the writers feel about their childhoods spent in small towns .
Small towns love an eccentric — if you do n’t believe me , ask a Kansan what they think of the Garden of Eden sculptures in Lucas — but they do n’t always handle the ambitious or the iconoclast so well .
Many writers hold their small town roots in contempt , as Jonathan Franzen does in his essays on the subject .
Others — like Willa Cather , who is profiled in Thousands of Broadways — credit their hometowns for character and talent .
In Cather ’s semi-autobiographical novel The Song of the Lark , a famous singer leaves her hometown of Moonstone for the big city of Chicago only to discover , as Pinsky puts it , “ Chicago turns out to harbor provinciality and plausible mediocrity , [ while ]
Moonstone turns out to harbor seeds of high art . ”
“ No matter how much you want to , you never unbecome the place you came from , ” essayist and novelist Rebecca Brown once wrote .
As a native of a very isolated town of 1,200 people — we had to drive an hour to get to a supermarket — I can say it ’s odd to see so little of your life reflected in the culture at large .
I was one who fled and escaped , but I also hold quite fond feelings for where I grew up , and not much gets me angrier than a lazy or stereotypical depiction of the Midwest .
But the era of the small town has passed , and if all we ever remember are these false versions , we ’ll never understand what we ’re losing .

Toronto's 30,000 striking civic workers are set to return to work at last tomorrow after outside workers reached a deal late last night on back - to - work protocols .
The agreement came two confusing and chaotic days after locals 416 and 79 of the Canadian Union of Public Employees had said they had the basis for new contracts .
Local 79 , representing 24,000 inside workers , ratified its contract yesterday and appears ready to return to work once the 6,000 outside workers , represented by Local 416 , dismantle their picket lines .
It now appears that will happen very soon .
Local 416 president Mark Ferguson announced last night his members will hold a ratification vote today and , if passed as expected , workers would resume regular shifts as of midnight .
But there is another potential hitch .
City council is to meet tomorrow morning to examine the deals , but its approval is by no means certain .
If council rejected the agreements , the strike presumably would resume .
The two sides supposedly had a deal to end the strike early Monday , but trash continued to pile up in parks because the city and the outside workers still had n't finalized the wording of an agreement .
More importantly , they had not yet agreed on a back - to - work protocol , which included the thorny question of whether outside contractors would be allowed to help clean up temporary garbage dumpsites and the mess on city streets .
The two sides negotiated throughout yesterday .
Ferguson said the deal they reached will allow city workers exclusively to work on the cleanup until Sunday night .
If more cleanup work remains , the city will be allowed to hire private contractors to help .
With the city 's controversial sick bank program still in the tentative deal , Mayor David Miller faces the prospect that , after all the agonizing negotiations , council could conceivably vote the agreements down .
Reporters quizzed the mayor yesterday afternoon about a provision in the tentative deal that gives current city employees the option to keep banking pay for unused sick time , or take an immediate cash payout .
New employees will not have the option of banking unused sick days .
The mayor defended the deal , repeatedly saying sick bank program had been " eliminated . "
When pressed by reporters who noted employees would be able to continue to accumulate sick days , he eventually said the program was being " phased out . "
He added that the provision almost certainly would have been retained in any agreement reached with an arbitrator if back - to - work legislation had been imposed .
The mayor depicted the pact on the sick bank as a victory for Torontonians , saying it was n't until the city 's public offer of July 10 that CUPE agreed to negotiate the issue .
" This is a very strong achievement , " Miller said .
" Our goal was to constrain that liability .
We 've done that .
We 've achieved our bargaining goal . "
He said the buyout provision would save the city money , but did not provide a specific estimate .
The agreement with CUPE , Miller said , includes wage increases of 1.75 per cent in the first year , 2 per cent in the second and 2.25 per cent in the third .
When he heard what was included in the tentative agreement , Councillor David Shiner ( Ward 24 , Willowdale ) criticized the deal , calling it unfair to taxpayers .
" I 'm against the plan .
I think it 's way too rich of a plan and taxpayers can't afford this , " Shiner told the Star .
Councillor John Parker ( Ward 26 , Don Valley West ) said the city " capitulated " on the sick bank issue and said he does n't see himself voting in favour of the agreement tomorrow .

" It makes me wonder what the strike was all about .
I thought the city was going to the wall on this , " he said .

YEONGJONG ISLAND , South Korea |
On their island base in a tense Yellow Sea , black - clad commando squads armed with automatic weapons surge up ladders onto the deck of a training ship , fast - rope down building exteriors and detonate explosives .
The Special Sea Attack Team ( SSAT ) , an elite South Korean Coast Guard unit tasked with countering maritime terrorism , is preparing to respond with tougher policies to North Korean shipping in response to North Korea ’s missile launches and its second nuclear test in May .
North Korea fired four short - range missiles into waters off the east coast Thursday , Yonhap news agency reported .
“ We have not got word from above yet , ” said Inspector Joung Ku-so , who was suited in body armor and bristling with weapons .
“ But we are practicing boarding drills for PSI , ” he said , referring to the U.S. - led Proliferation Security Initiative that aims to block ships from carrying weapons materials to the North .
North Korea is expected to test its long - range Taepodong - 2 intercontinental ballistic missile ( ICBM ) on Saturday , to coincide with Independence Day celebrations in the United States .
The PSI comprises more than 90 nations that have agreed to monitor and possibly inspect North Korean ships suspected of carrying illicit cargoes .
Currently , a U.S. Navy destroyer is shadowing the North Korean freighter Kang Nam 1 in the South China Sea .
The freighter ’s movements are also being monitored electronically at the South Korean Coast Guard station at Incheon .
Boarding a Coast Guard hovercraft off Incheon - South Korea ’s second - largest port and the location of its main international airport - for the 30 - minute ride to the SSAT base , it is clear how dangerous these waters are .
Coast Guard cutters mount 20 mm rotary chain guns ; in the event of war , they would support naval operations .
The sea is gray and choppy , and fog often cuts visibility to zero .
Mud flats and islands dot the estuary off Incheon , which lies just 20 miles south of the maritime border .
Craft from South Korea , North Korea and China compete over the rich crab fishing .
Incheon was the scene of Gen. Douglas MacArthur ’s September 1950 seaborne landing that turned the tide of the 1950 - 1953 Korean War .
Moreover , it was on an island off Incheon in 1969 where South Korea trained criminals in a “ Dirty Dozen ” - style unit in an attempt to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Il - sung .
That incident was depicted in the hit 2003 South Korean film “ Silmido . ” Mr. Kim died of natural causes in 1994 .
In June 1999 and June 2002 , North Korea initiated naval clashes in these waters , killing six South Korean sailors .
At the time , governments in Seoul were following an engagement “ sunshine policy ” toward Pyongyang and withheld policies and comments that could antagonize the North .
Now , under the leadership of conservative President Lee Myung - bak , policies are tougher .
“ The guidelines for rules of engagement have changed , ” said Coast Guard spokesman Yun Byeong - du .
“ In the past , vessels had to get permission from the Blue House [ presidential residence ] to retaliate .
Now it is up to captains . ”
The Coast Guard is just the front line in the toughest South Korean defense posture in more than a decade .
Last week , the defense ministry told the nation ’s parliament that South Korea was boosting its pre-emptive strike capabilities to counter the North ’s missile and nuclear threat .
According to Yonhap , South Korea ’s military has moved air and artillery assets to the Yellow Sea border region as insurance against possible North Korean gunboat or missile attacks .
While the 1.19 million men of the North Korean People ’s Army vastly outnumber South Korea ’s 655,000 soldiers , analysts think the northern force is a paper tiger .
Its soldiers are poorly nourished and lack both modern equipment and adequate fuel for training .
North Korea is estimated to have more than 300 artillery pieces dug in along the Demilitarized Zone that could hit Seoul , but military specialists say this gun line could be outflanked by airborne or marine landings - assets the North Korean military , lacking a maneuver element and operating without air superiority , would have difficulty countering .
And while Pyongyang ’s 120,000 - strong commando force appears formidable , a defector from one of those units , Kim Shin-jo - captured during a 1968 raid - has said that special forces alone are not a viable threat absent an uprising among South Korea ’s populace .
A pro-North Korea rising by affluent , sophisticated and well - informed southerners seems a remote possibility .
For this reason , many specialists think Pyongyang is building a nuclear missile - based deterrent .
This is tacit recognition that its conventional military is no match for the South Korea - U.S. alliance .
“ North Korea is the weakest state in the region , ” said Dan Pinkston , who heads the International Crisis Group ’s Seoul office .
“ They do n’t have the technological or economic base to compete conventionally , so they have to rely on asymmetric capabilities . ”
In a possible indication of the North ’s lack of conventional strength , no clashes took place in June in the Yellow Sea despite numerous predictions that North Korea would launch naval provocations there following its recent missile and nuclear tests .
Yonhap , citing an unnamed military official , reported that all four missiles fired Thursday flew about 60 miles and identified them as KN - 01 missiles with a range of up to 100 miles .
President Obama told the Associated Press in an interview Thursday that he was trying to “ keep a door open ” for North Korea to return to international nuclear disarmament talks , but the country must abandon its nuclear weapons programs before it can join the world community .
He expressed optimism that he could get international agreement for even tougher action if North Korea does not heed warnings to pull back .
“ In international diplomacy , people tend to want to go in stages , ” Mr. Obama said .
“ There potentially is room for more later . ”
White House press secretary Robert Gibbs told reporters later that the Obama administration was not surprised by the missile test , saying that it was probably not the last challenge the North Koreans would pose the international community .
“ The North Koreans said they were going to launch these missiles .
I do n’t think it ’s surprising that they ’ve launched these missiles , ” Mr. Gibbs said .
“ I take the North Koreans at their word that they ’re going to continue their provocative actions . ”

This is a visit from our most frequent visitor to our site , the Trilateral Commission .
They come to our site dozens of times a day and this is just one of many numerous visit from them .
Further Trialogue and other official writings made clear their stated goal of creating a “ New International Economic Order . ” President George H.W. Bush later and now Obama have talked openly about creating a “ New World Order ” , which has since become a synonymous phrase .
It is clear that the Executive Branch of the U.S. was literally hijacked in 1976 by members of the Trilateral Commission , upon the election of President Jimmy Carter and Vice - President Walter Mondale .
This near - absolute domination , especially in the areas of trade , banking , economics and foreign policy , has continued unchallenged and unabated to the present .
Windfall profits have accrued to interests associated with the Trilateral Commission , but the effect of their “ New International Economic Order ” on the U.S. has been nothing less than devastating .

----------------------------The U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals cheated former Alabama Governor Don Siegelman in multiple ways .
The most glaring example involves the statute of limitations , so we will start there .
It 's undisputed that the government was tardy in bringing bribery charges against Siegelman and codefendant Richard Scrushy .
All of the activity that constituted the alleged bribery took place in summer 1999 .
But the government 's original indictment was dated May 17 , 2005 .
That 's almost one full year past the five - year statute of limitations .
Even if Siegelman and Scrushy had committed the worst sort of bribery -- and the facts and the law show that they did n't commit bribery at all -- the government missed the boat by a long shot .
So how did prosecutors get away with this ?
First , they crafted a vague indictment that made it unclear when the alleged events took place .
And U.S. District Judge Mark Fuller denied Siegelman 's motion for a bill of particulars , which would have forced the prosecution to provide specifics .
That probably was the first clear sign that the fix was in on this case .
More importantly , prosecutors argued that Siegelman did not raise the limitations issue in the proper way , that he essentially waived that defense .
Both the trial and appellate courts have agreed with the government .
But they are wrong .
And here is why .
The 11th Circuit based its finding on two cases , neither of which is applicable to the Siegelman case .
One is United States v. Ramirez , 324 F.3d 1225 ( 11th Cir. 2003 ) .
Ramirez involved a limitations defense raised by way of a post - trial Rule 29 motion , the same method Siegelman 's attorneys used .
And the defense was rejected , as it was in the Siegelman case .
But here is where the cases differ :
In Ramirez , the court found " when a statute of limitations defenseand requires no further development of facts at trial , a defendant waives his right to raise that defense by failing to raise it in a pretrial motion .
” Ramirez does not apply to the Siegelman case because the limitations defense was NOT clear on the face of the indictment .
In fact , the indictment in the Siegelman case said the alleged crimes took place “ [ f ] rom on or about July 19 , 1999 , and continuing through on or about May 23 , 2000 . . .
” On its face , the indictment was unclear .
It cites a first date that is way outside the statute of limitations and cites a second date that is inside the limitations period - - barely .
Fuller did not force the government to make the indictment clear , so Ramirez does not apply .
Of course , if Fuller had forced prosecutors to present a clear indictment , the case would have been over with an acquittal for Siegelman and Scrushy .
And the judge certainly did n't want that .
So he cheated them .
The 11th Circuit also cited United States v. Najjar , 283 F.3d 1306 , 1308 ( 11th Cir. 2002 ) for its proposition that “ the statute of limitations is a matter of defense that must be asserted at trial by the defendant and that failure to do so results in a waiver . "
The 11th Circuit says , " Other circuits agree , " and proceeds to cite a number of other cases .
EMTEC has recently released their G - Top Box which uses Nvidia ’s Ion platform .
It ’s another of those slim nettops which uses the Nvidia ’s Ion due to its high performance in video decoding and a very small form factor .
This enables G - Top Box to have a light and attractive design .
Lets ’s discover how good it works .
The device can be termed as the world ’s smallest desktop .
The nettop is small device over a mount , which can also be connected to the back of a TV .
The bad news is that the device doesnt has a HDMI port yet , which makes it useless to be connected to HD TVs .
However , with the standard VGA connector , it can be connected to a standard monitor to run Windows and even playing HD content with ease , as well as light gaming , thanks to the on board Nvidia Geforce 9400 M which supports full HD decoding .
EMTEC however promised that an HDMI version would be coming soon .
The new G - Top would be a nice addition to the nettop market , especially after it gets the HDMI support .
The initial specifications includes :
Intel Atom Processor N280 1.66 GHz
160 GB Hard Disk
1 GB of RAM
Nvidia Ion Chipset
Nvidia Geforce 9400M Graphics
6 USB 2.0 Ports
Standard VGA Connector
Gigabit LAN Port
Genuine Windows XP
The suggested price of this device is going to be around $ 293 ( £ 179 ) which is below range for these products .
The HDMI version will soon follow , that might be a little highly priced .
However , EMTEC G - Top
Box still offers a nice combination of a portable console which has a potential of a complete computer as well as the ability to decode HD content with ease .
Below is an excellent video showing the oppositions usual talking points and how to conquer them in a logical and factual manner .

We 've all been there - stuck in traffic , inching along , running late and getting angry when suddenly everyone starts moving .
Just like that , the road clears .
No flashing lights , no mangled cars , no clue to suggest what went wrong .
They 're called phantom traffic jams , and mathematicians at MIT are determined to find out what causes them - and more importantly , how to prevent them .
Phantom jams are born of a lot of cars using the road .
No surprise there .
But when traffic gets too heavy , it takes the smallest disturbance in the flow - a driver laying on the brakes , someone tailgating too closely or some moron picking pickles off his burger - to ripple through traffic and create a self - sustaining traffic jam .
Massachusetts Institute of Technology mathematicians have created a model to describe how these frustrating snarls form .
With this understanding , engineers could design build better roads to minimize the odds of them happening .
The mathematics of such traffic jams are strikingly similar to the equations that describe detonation waves produced by explosions , said Aslan Kasimov , a lecturer in MIT 's Department of Mathematics .
Realizing this allowed the reseachers to solve traffic jam equations that were first theorized in the 1950s .
The MIT researchers even came up with a name for this kind of gridlock - " jamiton . "
It 's a riff on " soliton , " a term used in math and physics to desribe a self - sustaining wave that maintains its shape while moving .
The equations MIT came up with are similar to those used to describe fluid mechanics , and they model traffic jams as a self - sustaining wave .
" We wanted to describe this using a mathematical model similar to that of fluid flow , " Kasimov said .
The researchers hit upon the equation after an experiment by Japanese researchers demonstrated the formation of jamitrons on a circular road .
In that experiment , drivers were instructed to travel 30 kilometers an hour ( 18.6 mph ) while maintaining a constant distance between cars .
It did n't take long before disruptions occurred and phantom jams formed .
Denser traffic brought quicker jams .
The MIT team found speed , traffic density and other factors can determine conditions that will lead to a jamiton and how quickly it will spread .
Once the jam forms , the researchers say , drivers have no choice but to wait for it to clear .
The new model could lead to roads designed with sufficient capacity to keep traffic density below the point at which a jamiton can form .
Kasimov found that jamitons have a " sonic point , " which separates traffic flow into upstream and downstream components , much like the event horizon of a black hole .
This sonic point prevents communication between these distinct components so information about free - flowing conditions just beyond the front of the jam can't reach drivers behind the sonic point .
Ergo , there you sit , stuck in traffic and have no idea that the jam has no external cause , your blood pressure racing toward the stratosphere .
The MIT team plans to look more detailed aspects of jamiton formation , including how the number of lanes affects the phantom traffic jams .
Perhaps they can then figure out what to do about people who wo n't hang up and drive .
Here 's a video of the model at work :

Manny Ramirez and David Ortiz , the sluggers who helped the Boston Red Sox end an 86 - year World Series championship drought and capture another title three years later , were among the roughly 100 Major League Baseball players to test positive for performance - enhancing drugs in 2003 , according to lawyers with knowledge of the results .
Some of baseball ’s most cherished story lines of the past decade have been tainted by performance - enhancing drugs , including the accomplishments of record - setting home run hitters and dominating pitchers .
Now , players with Boston ’s championship teams of 2004 and 2007 have been linked to doping .
Baseball first tested for steroids in 2003 , and the results from that season were supposed to remain anonymous .
But for reasons that have never been made clear , the results were not destroyed and the first batch of positives has come to be known among fans and people in baseball as “ the list . ”
The information was later seized by federal agents investigating the distribution of performance - enhancing drugs to professional athletes , and the test results remain the subject of litigation between the baseball players union and the government .
Five others have been tied to positive tests from that year : Barry Bonds , Alex Rodriguez , Sammy Sosa , Jason Grimsley and David Segui .
Bonds , baseball ’s career home runs leader , was not on the list , although federal agents seized his 2003 sample and had it retested .
Those results showed the presence of steroids , according to court documents .
A squirrel has bonded with a builder who has looked after him since he was a week old .
Nutty the grey squirrel lives with Tony Hattersley at his home in Bramhall , Greater Manchester .
He showers with Mr Hattersley , travels to work with him on the dashboard of his car and even stops off at the pub for a post - work pint .
Mr Hattersley found Nutty on a building site and the squirrel now follows him everywhere .
Mr Hattersley said his new pet , who even watches television with him , is dependent on him .
But he added : " As soon as he meets a mate , then he 'll be off . "
The Obama administration , which came to office promising to protect gay rights but so far has not done much , actually struck a blow for the other side last week .
It submitted a disturbing brief in support of the Defense of Marriage Act , which is the law that protects the right of states to not recognize same - sex marriages and denies same - sex married couples federal benefits .
The administration needs a new direction on gay rights .
A gay couple married under California law is challenging the act in federal court .
In its brief , the Justice Department argues that the couple lack legal standing to do so .
It goes on to contend that even if they have standing , the case should be dismissed on the merits .
The brief insists it is reasonable for states to favor heterosexual marriages because they are the “ traditional and universally recognized form of marriage . ”
In arguing that other states do not have to recognize same - sex marriages under the Constitution ’s “ full faith and credit ” clause , the Justice Department cites decades - old cases ruling that states do not have to recognize marriages between cousins or an uncle and a niece .
These are comparisons that understandably rankle many gay people .
In a letter to President Obama on Monday , Joe Solmonese , president of the Human Rights Campaign , a gay rights organization , said , “ I cannot overstate the pain that we feel as human beings and as families when we read an argument , presented in federal court , implying that our own marriages have no more constitutional standing than incestuous ones . ”
I recently ran into a post on a creationist site asking a bunch of questions of evolutionists .
As usual , these questions were moronic – so I answered them .
Many of them , the answer was “ that has no connection to evolution ” .
I e-mailed my answers to the author , with the note that I would be reproducing them here .
I just sent them a couple of minutes ago , so I have no answer as of yet .
I just posted the questions , most of which have pre-amble , so I am linking the site as well : original post
(1) Where are the trillions of fossils of such true transitional forms ?
A : Your definition of transitional form actually represents ignorance .
A creature with half an arm is unlikely , a creature with a limb that function as a rudimentary leg and as a fin is likely , and such have existed .
Now , the fossil record is woefully incomplete for a number of reasons ( we have not dug up the entire planet just for starters ) but there are many creatures that have shown up that have flattened fins for gliding , or arms with flaps of skin for the same purpose .
These transitional forms are so common as to not be worth commenting on .
(2) Is this scientific evidence for creationism , or is n’t it ?
A : If your first supposition was true , this still would not be evidence of creationism .
It would be evidence against evolution , but since it is wrong this is nothing .
( 3) Where did all the 90 - plus elements come from ( iron , barium , calcium , silver , nickel , neon , chlorine , etc ) ?
(4) How do you explain the precision in the design of the elements , with increasing numbers of electrons in orbit around the nucleus ?
(5) Where did the thousands of compounds we find in the world come from : carbon dioxide , sodium chloride , calcium hydroxide , hydrochloric acid , oxalic acid , chlorophyll , sucrose , hydrogen sulfide , benzene , aluminum silicate , mercaptans , propane , silicon dioxide , boric acid , etc . ?
A : Because the theory of evolution is completely unrelated to the formation of the universe .
Seriously , the two are completely unconnected .
I was trying to come up with a metaphor for this , and the best one I can come up with is that you might as well ask why the theory of quantum entanglement does n’t explain why we tend to buy frothy espresso based beverages .
Actually those two might be more related .
The theory of evolution specifically explains the proliferation of different forms of life .
It explains why there are so many forms of life and what they are like , nothing else .
(6) How did life develop from non-life ?
A : Nothing to do with evolution , but there is a theory called abiogenesis that explains this .
Recently scientists tried to replicate the conditions that abiogenesis posits .
They developed self replicating RNA from base chemicals in a remarkably short time .
Now , no scientist worth the name would claim this proves abiogenesis but it does increase the likelihood of it being true by a huge margin .
(7) Where did the human emotions , such as love , hate , and jealousy come from ?
A : Read “ The Selfish Gene ” by Richard Dawkins .
He actually does a great job explaining this , but the upshot of it is that it useful to the survival of the species .
(8) What are the odds that the evolutionary process , proceeding by random changes , would produce human beings , plus millions of species of animals , birds , fish , and insects , all with symmetrical features , i.e. , one side being a mirror image of the other ?
We take symmetry in all these creatures for granted , but is that a reasonable outcome for a random process ?
A : Evolution is not a random process , although random mutation is a piece of it .
It is a rules based system that creates certain outcomes most frequently .
Most of the non-symmetrical species did n’t survive to reproduce .
(9) What are the odds that of the millions of species of animals , birds , fish , and insects , a male of each species developed at the same time and in the same place as a female of the same species , so that the species could propagate ?
A : 100 % .
Every time it did n’t happen , there was no species .
Now , it happened a whole lot of times , but those creatures did n’t have descendants .
( 10 ) Why are there 2 sexes anyhow ?
This is not foreordained in the evolutionary framework .
Is there some sort of plan here ?
A : Because that is a very efficient method of DNA transfer .
However , asexual reproduction is more common on earth than sexual reproduction .
( 11 ) If the first generation of mating species did n’t have parents , how did the mating pair get to that point anyhow ?
Is n’t evolution supposed to progress when an offspring of a mating pair has a beneficial mutation ?
A : No , that is not the case and represents basic ignorance .
Evolution occurs when a descendant of a parent ( this can be through simply cell division as in the amoeba ) has a mutation .
When that mutation is better adapted to the environment it is likely ( although not certain ) to continue to future generations , who will have a survival advantage .
One such mutation was the ability to have offspring who have half of the DNA from one creature , and half from another .
The mechanism for this was not sexual reproduction as you understand it , but simple combination and division .
( 12 ) How did the heart , lungs , brain , stomach , veins , blood , kidneys , etc. develop in the first animal by slow , minute steps and the animal survive while these changes were occurring ?
A : By developing rudimentary forms of the final objects slowly over time .
A little bit of processing of toxins is better than none , and confers a survival advantage .
Same with a little bit of though , a little bit of extra energy to the extremities , etc .
( 13 ) Why do books on evolution , including biology textbooks , always start with a fully developed animal when attempting to explain how one species developed into another species ?
Why do n’t evolutionists first explain how the first animal developed ?
( An animal with a heart , lungs , brain , stomach , etc. )
A : Advanced texts do n’t .
You have probably only read ( very ) introductory texts on the subject if you think this is the case .
If you ever get into more advanced books they talk at great length about how single celled life developed into multi-celled life , and all the way to mammals .
( 14 ) What are the odds that the evolutionary process , proceeding by random changes , would produce a system in human reproduction whereby exactly 50 % of offspring are male and 50 % are female ( based on 50 % X - chromosomes and 50 % Y - chromosomes ) ?
Again is there some sort of a plan here ?
A : 0 % . The human race is slightly biased towards females .
Having said that , environmental conditions can change the bias towards males .
Other species tend other ways .
Now , if the numbers were n’t reasonably close , then the human race would not exist .
You are confusing cause and effect ( again I might add )
( 15 ) Where did the law of gravity come from ?
Did it have a beginning ?
Is n’t it reasonable to assume that when matter was created , the law of gravity was established at the same time to regulate matter ?
A : This has nothing to do with evolution , also , it is stupid .
Gravity is a property of matter .
When you have matter , you have gravity .
( 16 ) Where did this energy come from ?
Is n’t the only reasonable answer that it was the result of a creative act by an almighty designer / creator ?
A : There is no evidence to support this , literally none .
Not only is this the not the only reasonable answer , it is not a reasonable answer .
That does n’t mean it is n’t the case , but there is no reason to support this answer over any other , and it is worse than saying “ I do n’t know ” ( which is actually what science does until something better comes along )
( 17 ) Why do evolutionists summarily dismiss the evidence from design without any serious consideration ?
A : What evidence ?
There has never been any evidence of design submitted for consideration so it ca n’t be dismissed .
Perhaps you need to rethink what you mean by evidence .
( 18 ) Other than rejection of the supernatural , how else can one explain the steadfast adherence of evolutionists to this theory even though they do not know the origin of the 3 main bases of evolution : the origin of matter , the origin of energy , and the origin of life ?
A : The origin of matter , the origin of energy , and the origin of life are not part of the theory of evolution and never have been .
Evolution is not a panacea like religion is .
It is the answer to a very , very specific question .
( 19 ) Can you give us just one coercive proof of evolution , i.e. , a proof that absolutely eliminates any other possible explanation for the origin of the universe , the material world , and human life ?
No , I can ’t .
That is not what the theory of evolution is concerned with and anyone who did come up with such a proof would be an idiot .
Also , this question is kind of stupid .
( 20 ) Is n’t it true that rather than proofs of evolution , all that evolutionists can come up with are evidences for evolution to someone who already believes in evolution ?
Science works by taking a look at the evidence , trying to figure out what could have caused it , and then testing it .
If the hypothesis fails the test you modify it to match the evidence you have now gained or you abandon it ( if it ca n’t fit the evidence ) .
Evolution has changed somewhat over the years , as new facts have become available , and it will probably change more over time .
However , the basic tenets of it have survived hundreds of years of challenge .
No -one has come up with a test that destroys the basic tenets .
If you think you have come up with such a test , by all means publish it .
If you are right ( and it is a valid test , not a piece of sophistry ) then you will probably with the Nobel prize ( it comes with a million dollars , so a lot of people have tried )
In conclusion , you have n’t really presented a single thing that challenges evolutionary theory , you have simply proven that you do n’t have even a high school level of understanding of evolutionary theory .
I suggest you do some reading before trying to challenge this incredibly well established theory .
Start with “ The Origins of Species ” by Darwin .
Move on to the works of Dawkins , as most of his early stuff was evolutionary theory designed to be understood by laymen .
Howard Bloom has some interesting counter theories in “ Global Brain ” ( to give you some idea of how science is actually a competition between ideas , with the best ones usually winning over the long term ) .
Steven Jay Gould is another good resource , as is Christopher Hitchins ( although I find him arrogant and a bit grating in interviews ) .
No , these people do n’t agree on all the fine points , but they do agree on the large points .
Scientists are actually able to build entire careers off of refuting or altering the small points , and they would be much better know and rewarded if they disproved the large ones , so the argument of bias simply fails .
The CIPD says public sector cuts will impact on service provision
As many as 350,000 public sector jobs could be lost over the next five years , the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development ( CIPD ) is warning .
Chief economist John Philpott says the recession will bring " a bloodbath in the public finances " which will force employers to slash their workforce .
This could lead to " guerrilla war " in the workplace , characterised by repeated strike action , he said .
The public sector union , Unison , said support for Labour had " collapsed " .
Speaking ahead of the union 's national conference , general secretary Dave Prentis said a poll of 1,000 members found just over 30 % planned to back Labour at the next election , down from 42 % a year ago .
" Public sector workers were always regarded as the heartlands of Labour , but that vote has collapsed , " he said .
' Fiscal squeeze '
Figures released last week by the Office for National Statistics showed that overall UK unemployment was rising faster in this recession than at any time since the 1980s .
Despite this , employment in public sector occupations such as education , health , and public administration were up 2 % year - on - year .
But Mr Philpott believes any optimism based on figures like this is " premature " .
" The public sector has yet to feel the full impact of the recession , and the resultant bloodbath in the public finances , " he said .
Sympathy will have been frayed by private sector job losses and pay freezes which will have touched many families
John Philpott , CIPD
Bank policy man warns on jobless " The CIPD 's current estimate is that the fiscal squeeze implied by government plans will result in a total of 350,000 job cuts in the public sector overall between 2010 / 11 and 2014 / 15 .
" This will be preceded by around 30,000 job cuts in local authorities in the next year . "
Mr Philpott said the likely scale of job cuts required would " inevitably have an impact on levels of public service provision " .
And he stressed that the " impending age of austerity " would mean that " the greater job security and relative generous pay and pensions packages enjoyed by public sector workers will soon be a thing of the past " .
The CIPD is also warning that there could be a dramatic increase in industrial action .
" As a result the coming era of public sector austerity might not only witness large scale job cuts , but also an ongoing ' workplace guerrilla war ' marked by waves of major public sector strikes and regular bouts of unrest , " Mr Philpott said .
" One brake on this possibility may well be wider public opinion .
" Here sympathy will have been frayed by private sector job losses and pay freezes which will have touched many families , and further exacerbated by a growing awareness of the huge gulf between generous public sector pensions and private sector pension schemes that have been squeezed and in many cases closed . "
A report by the NHS Confederation warned last week that the health service in England is facing a real - terms budget reduction of between £ 8bn and 10bn over the three years after 2011 .
And on Monday , Shadow Chancellor George Osborne said it would be " ridiculous to pretend there wo n't be cuts " in public spending in the coming years .
CBI plea Meanwhile the CBI has said that businesses are being deterred from bidding for public service contracts by the need to match what it says are " costly " pensions when staff transfer to private firms .
The business group said firms had to pay between 25 % and 50 % of salary to fund the pensions of ex-public sector staff .
That the CBI said , was leaving many unable to compete against a public sector employer , which contributed roughly 15 % .
Staff moving to a private contractor should be able to retain membership of their public sector scheme , the CBI said .

Hundreds of thousands of demonstrators flooded Tehran on Wednesday in a fifth day of unauthorized protests demanding the annulment of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's disputed re-election .
As a leading Iranian human rights group reported that 32 people had been killed in the protests so far , the government struck back by expelling foreign reporters , prohibiting coverage of demonstrations and threatening legal action against Iranians who sent videos , news reports and photographs abroad .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Former Secretary of State Colin Powell said Tuesday that he has been the victim of racial profiling but believes Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. could have been more patient with the police officer who arrested him .
Former Secretary of State Colin Powell told Larry King that he has been subject to racial profiling .
At the same time , Powell also faulted the Cambridge ( Massachusetts ) Police Department for escalating the situation beyond a reasonable level .
" I think Skip [ Gates ] , perhaps in this instance , might have waited a while , come outside , talked to the officer and that might have been the end of it , " Powell said in an interview with CNN 's Larry King .
" I think he should have reflected on whether or not this was the time to make that big a deal .
Watch what Powell would advise Gates »
" I think in this case the situation was made much more difficult on the part of the Cambridge Police Department , " Powell said .
" Once they felt they had to bring Dr. Gates out of the house and to handcuff him , I would 've thought at that point , some adult supervision would have stepped in and said ' OK look , it is his house .
Let 's not take this any further , take the handcuffs off , good night Dr. Gates . ' "
Gates , a top African - American scholar , was arrested July 16 for disorderly conduct outside his Cambridge , Massachusetts , home after police responded to a report of a possible burglary .
The charge was later dropped .
Powell said that under the circumstances , Gates may not have been in the appropriate frame of mind to best handle the situation .
" He was just home from China , just home from New York .
All he wanted to do was get to bed .
His door was jammed and so he was in a mood where he said something , " Powell said .
He recalled a lesson he was taught as a child : " When you 're faced with an officer who is trying to do his job and get to the bottom of something , this is not the time to get in an argument with him .
" There is no African - American in this county who has not been exposed to this kind of situation , " Powell said .
" Do you get angry ?
Yes .
Do you manifest that anger ?
Do you protest ?
Do you try to get things fixed ?
But it 's the better course of action to try and take it easy and do n't let your anger make the current situation worse . "
The former secretary of state said he has been racially profiled " many times , " including an incident that took place while he was the national security adviser to President Reagan .
" Nobody thought I could possibly be the national security adviser to the president .
I was just a black guy at Reagan National Airport , " Powell said .
" And it was only when I went to the counter and said , ' Is my guest here waiting for me ? ' that someone said , ' Oh , you 're Gen. Powell . '
It was inconceivable to him that a black guy could be the national security adviser . "
When asked how he dealt with the situation , Powell said , " You just suck it up -- what are you going to do ?
It was a teaching point for him .
' Yes , I 'm the national security adviser , I 'm black , and watch , I can do the job . ' "
In the interview , Powell touched on other issues , ranging from North Korea to U.S. figures such as Sarah Palin and Rush Limbaugh .
While North Korea may be " bizarre , " he said , their negotiators are second to none .
" They are some of the best , toughest negotiators I 've ever dealt with , " Powell said .
" And you can read the whole history of our negotiations with North Korea , going back to the Korean armistice discussion , and you 'll find they know what their negotiating positions are , and they will drive you crazy , and they will use your impatience against you . "
The former secretary praised the United States ' current top diplomat , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton .
Powell said Clinton was handling North Korean relations " properly " by insisting that dialogue with Pyongyang be limited to the six - party framework .
Powell said Clinton seems to be " in the mold of almost all secretaries I have known . "
Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , he said , is a " fascinating figure ... you have got to hand it to her . "
Palin transferred power to Gov. Sean Parnell on Sunday .
He repeated his assessment that the former Republican vice presidential candidate had not been ready for the Oval Office last fall , but said she was worth watching .
" Apparently , she is going to re-enter public life ... .
We will have to see what her plans are , " he said Tuesday .
" I do n't know if she is doing all of this for political purposes or just to start a new life in the wonderful world of speaking .
And we will all be watching with great interest . "
Powell , who has previously been critical of radio host Rush Limbaugh , restated his opinion that members of his party ought to do the same .
" The problem I 'm having with the [ Republican ]
Party right now is that when he says something that I consider to be completely outrageous and I respond to it , I would like to see other members of the party do likewise , but they do n't , " he said .
Watch Powell talk about Limbaugh and the GOP »
Asked whether he thinks Republicans are afraid to take on Limbaugh , Powell pointed out that several prominent Republicans have criticized Limbaugh but that " within 24 hours , they were backing away because there is a strong base of support for Mr. Limbaugh . "
Powell discussed his reaction to the news that then - Sen.
Barack Obama had won the presidency .
" I cried , " he said .
Powell was in Hong Kong to speak to Chinese leaders , and it was late morning in Hong Kong when the final votes were cast in the United States .
" I just sat down in a chair and said ' By God , we did it . '
There were people who said America could not do this , America would not do this , but he did do it . "
The former top diplomat also had some advice for now - President Obama .
" Everybody comes into office -- the new president -- and they 're told by everybody ' You 've got to get it all done in the first year . '
Or ' the first hundred days are important , ' " Powell said . " ...
You have to have a main attack , as we say in the military .
You have to make sure you 're focusing on things that are most important .
Not try to have a dozen main attacks at once because you end up sort of frittering your energy and your troops .
" Now President Obama is out there trying to solve all of the problems he said he would solve .
And I think that he and his staff over time will start to do a better job , in my judgment , of setting priorities . "
Powell did n't limit his advice to the president .
He also offered counsel to his party .
" If the party is going to succeed in the future , the advice I 'm giving to my Republican friends is you 've got to find some way to reach out and draw moderates and independents more toward the right so that we can build a party that will win , " Powell said .
" A base , as I 've said before -- the base is no particular use if all you can do is sit on it and you can't build on it . "

( CNN ) --
The commissioner of the Cambridge , Massachusetts , police department said Thursday he " deeply regrets " the arrest of prominent black Harvard University professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. , but stands by the procedures followed by his department .
Sgt. Jim Crowley said he has nothing to apologize for in regards to the arrest of Henry Louis Gates Jr .
" I believe that Sgt. [ James ]
Crowley acted in a way that is consistent with his training at the department , and consistent with national standards of law enforcement protocol , " Commissioner Robert Haas said , referring to the officer who made the July 16 arrest at the professor 's home .
" I do not believe his actions in any way were racially motivated , " Haas said at a news conference .
Gates was arrested for disorderly conduct after an exchange with the officer , who was investigating a report of a possible break - in at the house .
The police department will create a panel of " independent , notable professionals " to provide an analysis of the incident , he said .
The controversial arrest of Gates was criticized Wednesday by President Obama , who said the Cambridge police department " acted stupidly . "
" My response is that this department is deeply pained and takes its professional pride very seriously , " Haas said .
Cambridge authorities dropped the charges against Gates on Tuesday .
In a statement , the International Association of Chiefs of Police expressed disappointment in Obama 's remarks .
" Police chiefs understand that it is critically important to have all the facts on any police matter before drawing conclusions or making any public statement , " said Russell B. Laine , association president and chief of the Algonquin , Illinois , police department , in the statement .
" For these reasons , the IACP was disappointed in the president 's characterization of the Cambridge Police Department . "
Haas ' comments followed a statement earlier Thursday from Crowley , who said he would not apologize for his actions .
" That apology will never come from me as Jim Crowley .
It wo n't come from me as sergeant in the Cambridge Police Department , " Crowley told Boston radio station WEEI .
" Whatever anybody else chooses to do in the name of the city of Cambridge or the Cambridge Police Department , which are beyond my control , I do n't worry about that .
I know what I did was right .
I have nothing to apologize for . "
The mayor of Cambridge said she will meet with the city 's police chief to make sure the scenario that led to Gates ' arrest does not happen again .
" This suggests that something happened that should not have happened , " E. Denise Simmons , Cambridge 's mayor said on CNN's " American Morning . "
" The situation is certainly unfortunate .
This can't happen again in Cambridge . "
Obama defended Gates Wednesday night , while acknowledging that he may be " a little biased , " because Gates is a friend .
" But I think it 's fair to say , No. 1 , any of us would be pretty angry ; No. 2 , that the Cambridge police acted stupidly in arresting somebody when there was already proof that they were in their own home ; and , No. 3 ... that there 's a long history in this country of African - Americans and Latinos being stopped by law enforcement disproportionately . "
The incident , Obama said , shows " how race remains a factor in this society . "
Crowley also said he is exercising caution and his previous actions clearly show he is not a racist .
In fact , Crowley taught a racial profiling course at the Lowell Police Academy , said Deborah Friedl , deputy superintendent of the police department .
Last year was his fifth year as a co-instructor of the course , Friedl said .
" He seems to be a highly regarded £ instructor at the academy .
He consistently received high praise from students , " she said .
Gates told CNN Wednesday that although charges had been dropped , he will keep the issue alive .
" This is not about me ; this is about the vulnerability of black men in America , " Gates told CNN 's Soledad O'Brien .
Gates said the Cambridge mayor had called him to apologize about the incident .
Simmons , Cambridge 's first black female mayor , confirmed to CNN that she apologized to Gates .
Gates said he'd be prepared to forgive the arresting officer " if he told the truth " about what the director of Harvard 's W.E.B. Du Bois Institute for African and African American Research said were " fabrications " in the police report .

Crowley wrote in the Cambridge police report that Gates refused to step outside to speak with him , and when Crowley told Gates that he was investigating a possible break - in , Gates opened the front door and exclaimed , " Why , because I 'm a black man in America ? "
The report said Gates initially refused to show the officer identification , but eventually produced a Harvard identification card , prompting Crowley to radio for Harvard University Police .
" While I was led to believe that Gates was lawfully in the residence , I was quite surprised and confused with the behavior he exhibited toward me , " Crowley said , according to the report .
Gates was arrested for " loud and tumultuous behavior in a public space " and was released from police custody after spending four hours at the police station .
He said Wednesday that he and his lawyers were considering further actions , not excluding a lawsuit .
Gates said that although the ordeal had upset him , " I would do the same thing exactly again . "

TEHRAN , Iran ( CNN ) -- Iranian pro-government Basij militia members dispersed crowds of protesters here Thursday -- sometimes with force -- witnesses said .
Protests by Iranians , such as this one on June 15 , have been defended by the reformist figures .

An estimated 2,000 to 3,000 people crowded the streets in different locations of the city , and headed toward Tehran University , the site of a student uprising in 1999 .
Several protesters were hit on the arms and backs by the Basij , pro-government militia members , while elsewhere riot police released tear gas into crowds .
Iran 's state - funded Press TV described the crowd size near the university in the hundreds .
Some of the protesters shouted " Allah u Akbar , " or " God is Great " and " Ya Hussein , Mir Hussein " referring to opposition candidate Mir Hossein Moussavi , the witnesses said .
Police blocked roads leading to Tehran University , while some protesters set trash cans afire so smoke would counter the effects of the tear gas .
When crowds tried to gather between 4 p.m. and 5 p.m. in Revolution Square , hundreds of security forces were waiting for them , witnesses told CNN .
Watch scenes of protesters and street clashes »
Most of the security forces were uniformed officers wearing helmets and holding batons and shields , though many wore plain clothes .
The forces ordered bystanders to move along , the witnesses said .
There were at least five reports of clashes during this time .
Over the next two hours , the crowds grew to around 3,000 , but witnesses said security forces grew too .
Many of the protesters left Revolution Square and marched to side streets and neighborhoods a few kilometers away .
Many held up victory signs and clapped .
The contents of several Dumpsters were set afire .

Witnesses said they heard several pops that sounded like gunshots and saw security forces fire what appeared to be pepper spray towards the crowds on several occasions .
Some of the chants heard Thursday were familiar refrains that have been repeated often in recent days :
" Death to the Dictator ! "
" Death to Khamenei ! "
But a new phrase entered the lexicon on Thursday that referred to Mojtaba , the son of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamanei : " Mojtaba bemire , rahbariroh nagiri , " they chanted : " Die , Mojtaba , so you do n't become the supreme leader ! "
During the past week , rumors have surfaced that Mojtaba has taken over the pro-government Basij militia and that his father is grooming him to be the next supreme leader .
Thursday marked the first time protesters chanted against him .
By nightfall , most of the demonstrators headed home .
At 10 p.m .
Tehran time two sources told CNN the chants of " God is great ! " were louder than usual in their neighborhoods .
The demonstration took place on the 10th anniversary of a student uprising that posed a major threat to the Islamic regime .
On Thursday , the protesters used the anniversary to resume demonstrations against the outcome of the contested June 12 presidential election .
Iranian - American journalist Jason Rezaian said Iranians have been scared since last month 's bloody crackdown on those who protested the accuracy of election results .
Incumbent Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was declared the winner by a landslide over reformist candidate Moussavi , his chief rival , who declared the election rigged .
Moussavi 's supporters took to the streets by the thousands in the aftermath of the vote until the protests turned bloody as security forces cracked down .
Iranian state - run media said 20 people have been killed and more than 1,000 have been detained .
On July 9 , 1999 , known in the Iranian calendar as the 18th of Tir , 200 students protested the closing of a reformist newspaper , Salaam , which supported moderate President Mohammed Khatami .
Hard - line activists entered dormitories in Tehran University , broke windows , set fires and attacked students .
Six days of protests ensued .
According to Human Rights
Watch , more than 25,000 people participated , making the demonstrations the biggest threat to the Islamic regime since its inception in 1979 .
CNN 's CNN 's Reza Sayah and Moni Basu in Atlanta , Georgia , contributed to this report .

There are still a lot of funny and interesting pictures and videos on the main page of Izismile .
Do n’t miss it .
Take a look .
Clearly , then , the U.S. Army and Marine Corps should be studying the Sri Lankan civil war for valuable lessons about how to win a counterinsurgency , right ?
Actually — no .
In fact , there are no useful pointers to be gleaned from the Sri Lankan government ’s victory .
The war was won using techniques like the following , which the United States could and should never employ .
The insurgents are using human shields ?
No problem .
Just keep killing the innocent bystanders until you get to the fighters themselves .
There is no comparison between the few civilians that have been killed by American Predator drones in the Afghanistan - Pakistan border region , and the many that were killed by the Sri Lankan government .
The Americans have carefully targeted select al - Qaeda members and , in the process , killed a few — at the most , dozens — of civilians among whom the fighters were surrounded .
By contrast , the Sri Lankan military indiscriminately killed large numbers of civilians — as many as 20,000 in the final months of fighting , according to the United Nations .
Bad media coverage is hurting morale and giving succor to the enemy ?
Just kill the journalists .
That 's what the Sri Lankan authorities did .
Precisely because insurgencies are unconventional , there are no easy - to - follow infantry advances and retreats , so the media holds the power to shape a narrative for the public .
Aware of the need for a compliant media to aid the war effort , the Sri Lankan government struck fear into the ranks of journalists .
There were hundreds of disappearances of top opinion leaders .
“ Murder has become the primary tool whereby the state seeks to control the organs of liberty , ” wrote journalist Lasantha Wickramatunga in a self - penned obituary that anticipated his own assassination in early 2009 .
Sources told me that he was killed by having iron rods with sharp points driven through his skull .
“ If Lasantha , with all of his connections , could be killed in broad daylight , then they could do this to anybody , ” one journalist in the capital of Colombo told me .
This journalist told me stories about reporters being beaten black and blue , leading to an atmosphere of extreme self - censorship — “ the worst and most insidious kind . ”
Another journalist told me : “ Lasantha ’s fate really scared us .
People like me decided it was more important to stay alive than to report the news . ”
No journalist I met in Colombo was willing to cross the line and publicly attack the government .
The international community disapproves of your methods and cuts off military aid because of the human rights violations you 've committed ?
Again , no problem .
Get aid from China , whose assistance comes without moral lectures .
That ’s just what the Sri Lankan Government did .
In return , the Chinese got the right to help construct a deep water port in Sri Lanka , close to world shipping lanes .
Bills , bills , bills .
No , not the kind we get and pay every month–we actually tend to read those .
I mean the bills that Congress votes on .
You know , the ones they do n’t write and ca n’t be bothered to read .
It ’s not new behavior , but given the amounts of money Congress is playing with these days ( billions and trillions of taxpayer dollars ) , it behooves us to think very carefully about how well our elected officials are serving those who elected them .
Consider the following : Democratic Leader Laughs at Idea That House Members Would Actually Read Health - Care Bill Before Voting On It
House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer ( D - Md. ) said Tuesday that the health - care reform bill now pending in Congress would garner very few votes if lawmakers actually had to read the entire bill before voting on it .
“ If every member pledged to not vote for it if they had n’t read it in its entirety , I think we would have very few votes , ” Hoyer told CNSNews.com at his regular weekly news conference .
Hoyer was responding to a question from CNSNews.com on whether he supported a pledge that asks members of the Congress to read the entire bill before voting on it and also make the full text of the bill available to the public for 72 hours before a vote .
And this : Democratic Senator Predicts None of His Colleagues ‘ Will Have the Chance ’ to Read Final Stimulus Bill Before Vote
Sen. Frank Lautenberg ( D - N.J. ) predicted on Thursday that none of his Senate colleagues would “ have the chance ” to read the entire final version of the $ 790 - billion stimulus bill before the bill comes up for a final vote in Congress .
“ No , I do n’t think anyone will have the chance to [ read the entire bill ] , ” Lautenberg told CNSNews.com .
As well as this :
And even this :
Also recall that we even have representatives who believe that the money used to fund the government is not actually our money at all :
Cavuto : “ Where do we draw the line with our money ? “ Knollenberg : “ It is not your money . ”
Our Congress is not doing the job it was elected to do .
At best , the behavior is hubristic demagoguery ; at worst , it is the very epitome of taxation without representation .
Did n’t we fight a war over that a few hundred years ago ?

The shift of Microsoft Office 2010 from a primarily desktop to cloud - based application suite was a fairly radical one for Microsoft , which is looking for a strategic advantage over Google and other companies that have launched online productivity products .
Once released , Office 2010 will allow Microsoft Live subscribers to access stripped - down versions of OneNote , Excel , Word and PowerPoint for free .
Microsoft is also planning to offer the application suite as both a hosted subscription service and an on - premises application for an as - yet - undisclosed price .
Microsoft will demonstrate Office 2010 , which has now hit the technical preview engineering milestone , at the Worldwide Partner Conference in New Orleans from July 13 - 16 .
Other flagship software being rolled out at the event includes Windows 7 , Windows Mobile 6.5 and Windows Server 2008 .
However , the release of Office 2010 as a free Web - based product does bring up the question of revenue .
According to a recent Wall Street Journal article , Office sales made up the majority of the $ 19 billion that Microsoft 's business division earned in 2008 ; the piece further quotes analysts who estimate that nearly a quarter of those sales were due to consumers .
If consumers can now access the application for free , what does that mean for Microsoft 's bottom line , not to mention its market share ?
" They 're using this as a weapon against Google , " Tom Austin , an analyst with Gartner , said in an interview with eWEEK .
" But as Microsoft does that , and puts their collaboration capabilities in the cloud , they 're going to increase revenue but put pressure on their margins . "
That increased revenue would come from selling those collaboration capabilities , along with e-mail , to enterprise - based customers .
" Microsoft will make more money than they do today , " Austin suggested .
" But they 'll have a challenge to maintain the same level of products .
Microsoft is going to position themselves as more functional than Google , but with an offering that 's less functional than the full Office . "
Microsoft 's proposal of a hybrid model for Office 2010 could also give it greater appeal to the enterprise , potentially dissuading business customers from jumping ship to Google or another company 's offerings .
" The really interesting thing about this whole battle is the hybrid provisioning model where you can deploy [ Office ] from the server , and rely on things coming from the Microsoft cloud , " Austin said .
" In the end , I do n't think companies will go with the hybrid model , but the choice could be appealing to executives ; if it 's on - premises and something blows , you can fix it yourself . "
The ability to store documents and other business - related data locally may prove to be a deciding factor to much of the enterprise when deciding between Web - based productivity suites .
" Google and Zoho do n't have an internally based Web - based hosted access , " Sheri McLeish , an analyst with Forrester Research , said in an interview with eWEEK .
The ability for users to keep their information locally on a desktop or server " may be particularly appealing to enterprises that want to retain content . "
" On the business side , it 's about integration and interoperability .
Costs are a factor but not an overriding one ; the bigger issues are around support and minimizing risk , " McLeish said .
The enterprise 's uptake of cloud - based productivity tools has been slower because of the perception that it 's safer to keep a company 's intellectual property and business processes close at hand : " It 's easier for companies to provision their employees with a desktop with the same tools .
" The challenge for Microsoft is not to cannibalize itself , and balance their product portfolio to ensure its value , " she added .
Microsoft might see a dip in revenue as a certain percentage of consumers migrate to the free options offered through Microsoft Live , but " they were probably going to lose at least some of those people anyway . "
In addition to Office 2010 , Microsoft will likely move other aspects of its business onto the Web in a bid to challenge Google and other companies .
Soon after Google announced plans for the Google Chrome OS , an operating system intended for mininotebooks ( known popularly as " netbooks " ) , rumors circulated that Microsoft would find a way to release its own stripped - down operating system , a project code - named Gazelle .
However , Microsoft has given no official word on when Gazelle might reach a commercial stage , even as the Chrome OS is scheduled to make its big rollout in the second half of 2010 .
By that point , analysts predict , the battle between Microsoft , Google and other companies over Web - based applications and platforms will likely have become even more intense .
" 2010 is an exciting year for productivity tools , " McLeish said .
" It 's a wide - open playing field . "
I 'm not sure which piece of unpopular Irish news is being buried by which : the announcement of a second referendum on the Lisbon treaty , or the shuffling through of a law creating penalties for blasphemy , an offence that has never properly existed in the Irish state .
While there is certainly a store of resentment in the population at being asked to vote again ( that is : vote properly , you morons , as the government is barely holding back from saying ) on the Lisbon treaty , there is a certain sense of bafflement at the new blasphemy legislation , smuggled in under the guise of defamation law reform .
Nobody wanted this law : no one can think of a single thundering priest , austere vicar , irate rabbi or miffed mullah ever calling for tougher penalties for blasphemy .
Certainly there were the frequent , and frequently ignored missives from Armagh , warning the Irish not to abandon God for 4x4s and Nintendo Wiis .
And there was widespread dismay when popular comic Tommy Tiernan pushed the Bible - baiting a bit too far on the Late Late Show .
But never did anyone suggest we needed tough blasphemy laws .
Until the justice minister , Dermot Ahern , decided we needed to fill the " void " left by our lack of one .
Technically , Ahern is correct that Bunreacht na hÉireann requires that blasphemy be a criminal offence .
However , no one ever bothered to formulate what the exact offence might be , and we muddled on for quite a long time without anyone worrying about this ( perhaps , as a friend pointed out to me , because all blasphemous material was grabbed by the all - powerful censors long before it could ever get to court ) .
In 1999 , there was an attempt to prosecute a newspaper for a cartoon mocking the church , but the judge in that case noted that he could not prosecute , because there was no definition of what legally constituted blasphemy .
Well now there is .
And it concerns itself with what might or might not cause " outrage among a substantial number of the adherents of [ a ] religion " ( note , not just Christianity , as was the case with English blasphemy law : this is , at least , equal opportunities idiocy ) .
As Michael Nugent of Atheist Ireland has pointed out :
The proposed law does not protect religious belief ; it incentivises outrage and it criminalises free speech .
Under this proposed law , if a person expresses one belief about gods , and other people think that this insults a different belief about gods , then these people can become outraged , and this outrage can make it illegal for the first person to express his or her beliefs .
So Irish law has now enshrined the notion that the taking of offence is more important than free expression .
If something might cause a motivated group to be " outraged " , rather than , say , cause them to live in fear , then it is illegal , with a fine of up to € 25,000 payable .
Note the ease with which a prosecution could be brought , and the punitive nature of the fine : this is not legislation that simply serves to tie up a few loose ends .
The minister claimed that his only alternative to this legislation was to have a referendum .
This again , is technically true : any constitutional changes in Ireland require this .
But the minister dismissed the notion of organising a referendum as being too costly in these straitened times .
Yet today , we are told there is to be another Lisbon referendum in October .
Would n't it have been sensible to hold both the Lisbon referendum and a referendum on the abolition of the concept of blasphemy from the constitution on the same day , cutting down on costs ?
Would n't it , minister ?
The British Government has reacted to Israel 's bombardment and invasion of Gaza last January by barring further exports of components used in naval gunships which took part in the three - week operation .
Britain has officially told Israel 's embassy in London that it is revoking five licences for exports of equipment used in Saar 4.5 vessels because they violate UK and EU criteria precluding military sales which could be used for " internal repression " .
Israel used naval vessels to bombard Gaza targets from the Mediterranean to augment the ground and air offensive after Operation Cast Lead was launched against Hamas on 27 December last year .
David Miliband , the Foreign Secretary , told the Commons in April that there were " credible " reports that the Saar - class Corvette vessels had been used in " a naval fire support role " .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The Saar vessels ' 76 mm guns are almost certain to have used British - made components because the Government had previously granted export licences specifically for them .
It had also allowed exports of cabling for Saar - class ships and also components for radar which Mr Miliband acknowledged could be used for " fire control against surface targets " as well as its primary role in air defence .
The cancellation of the five licences follows a review started by the UK Government three months ago , in the aftermath of the Israeli offensive , of the 182 licences currently in force for arms exports to Israel .
The Israeli military acknowledges killing 1,166 Palestinians during the offensive , including at least 295 civilians , 49 of them women and 89 of them children under 16 .
Palestinian and other human rights groups put the total killed at up to 1,417 , with a much higher proportion of civilians .
The revoked licences appear to involve the only military equipment directly exported from the UK to Israel identified as having been used during Operation Cast Lead .
But Mr Miliband acknowledged in April that other British - made components had also been exported to US manufacturers of military equipment that was subsequently sold on to Israel .
These included equipment for the avionics systems – specifically cockpit display units – for F16 aircraft , widely used during Operation Cast Lead for aerial bombing of targets in Gaza .
They also included parts used in the fire control systems of Apache helicopters , as well as navigation units and engine assemblies .
Apaches were also regularly used in lethal air attacks during the Gaza operation .
There was a row in the British Cabinet at the peak of the Palestinian intifada during 2002 over the export of F16 avionic components .
But although the then Blair government barred direct sales of F16 components to Israel , it continued to license the sale of parts to the US manufacturers on the grounds that it would disrupt Anglo - US relations not to do so .
Richard Burden , chairman of the Britain Palestine All - Party Commons Group , yesterday welcomed the decision to revoke the Saar licences and Mr Miliband 's April announcement of a review of " all extant " military export licences in the light of Operation Cast Lead .
But he added that the criteria needed to be applied to indirect exports as well .
" The vast majority of arms imports to Israel come from the US and unless any new policy addresses that issue it will simply not be effective . "

I ’ve screwed up a lot of startups on faith .
One of the key tenets of entrepreneurship is that you start your company with insufficient resources and knowledge .
Faith - based Entrepreneurship
At first , entrepreneurship is a Faith - based initiative .
There is no certainty about a startup on day - one .
You make several first order approximations about your business model , distribution channels , demand creation , and customer acceptance .
You leave the comfort of your existing job , convince a few partners to join you and you jump off the bridge together .
At each startup I could n’t wait to do this .
No building , no money , no customers , no market ?
Great , sign me up .
We ’ll build something from scratch .
You start a company on a vision ; on a series of Faith - based hypotheses .
Fact - based Execution
However , successfully executing a startup requires the company to become Fact - based as soon as it can .
Think about all the assumptions you ’ve made to get your business off the ground .
Who are the customers ?
What problems do they have ?
What are their most important problems ?
How much would they pay to solve them ?
What ’s the best way to tell them about our product ?…
Ad infinitum .
These customer and market risks need to be translated into facts as soon as possible .
You can blindly continue to execute on faith that your hypothesis are correct .
You ’ll ship your product and you ’ll find out if you were wrong when you run out of money
Or you can quickly get out of the building and test whether your hypothesis were correct and turn them into facts .
In hindsight , when I was young , this where I went wrong .
It ’s a lot more comfortable to hang on to your own beliefs than to get ( or face ) the facts .
Because at times facts may create cognitive dissonance with the beliefs that got you started and funded .
Customer Development
This strategy of starting on faith , and quickly turning them into facts is the core of the Customer Development process .

I recently received a Request for Tender ( RFT ) from a large financial services company for the supply of specialist IT skills across a range of disciplines and technologies .
In general , the RFT was fairly standard in the information being sought , although I was surprised , and somewhat perturbed , to see the following question near the end of the questionnaire :
“ Would your organisation be prepared to participate in eNegotiations as part of this procurement process ? ”
For those not familiar with eNegotiations , a good overview can be found at http://www.tradeinterchange.com.au/leftnav_educational/reverse_auctions.htm.
In essence , eNegotiations are online ‘ reverse auctions ’ , where the purchaser seeks the lowest price for a particular commodity from the vendors participating in the auction , typically during a one - hour timeframe .
During that hour , the bidders usually see the ‘ current winning bid ’ and have the option of become the new ‘ winning bidder ’ by lower their previous best price .
This process may seem to create significant economic value for the purchaser , until one asks the questions “ what am I actually buying ? ” and “ what will I actually get from the winning supplier ( s ) ? ”
One of the core tenets of reverse auctions is that the goods and services being purchased are for all intents and purposes ‘ commodities ’ ( i.e. a physical substance … which is interchangeable with another product of the same type ) .
Sure , there is usually a minimum qualitative bar that organisations participating in the auction must exceed , but after that , it ’s all price , price , price .
Which begs the question : is one Project Manager / Enterprise Architect / [ insert skill set ] really interchangeable with the next ?
To illustrate my concern with this question , let ’s just change the context to another provider of professional services – the legal profession .
Suppose you have just been wrongly accused of a traffic violation and you need a lawyer .
Do you look for the cheapest lawyer you can find , or do you try to find one with a good track record of getting the charge dismissed ?
Sure , you do n’t want to pay too much for the advice , but what is the main driver in your thought process – getting a cheap deal or getting the right outcome ?
I would suggest the latter is usually the main consideration in most people ’s minds .
Which brings me back to the financial services organisation ’s intention to use reverse auctions to get the cheapest price for specialist , professional services .
As professionals ( and the services they provide ) do not even come close to the definition of commodities , the likely outcome is that the lowest - cost provider will prevail in the auction process , but the ‘ winner ’s curse ’ will be that they will most likely have bought the professionals with the poorest past performance .
So given that financial services organisations usually demonstrate considerable acumen in business dealings , why would they seriously consider treating IT professionals as commodities in the procurement process ?
Unfortunately , the answer is probably an indictment of the IT industry in general .
With IT projects continuing to suffer from late deliveries , bloated software , project cancellations and budget blow - outs , executive management is increasingly viewing IT spend as a ‘ cost of doing business ’ , rather than a means of creating competitive advantage .
This being the case , anything that can reduce this overall cost will , by inference , increase bottom line returns .
The IT industry needs to take on the challenge of changing this mindset in the executive management community .
Otherwise , the software profession will become increasingly marginalised , which will bring real costs to the wider community , in particular the potential loss of the productivity dividend that has underpinned much of the economic growth the developed world has experienced in the past few decades .
The next article in this series will present some thoughts on how the IT industry can improve it ’s reputation in the executive boardroom .
Behold , the splendor of Fayetteville , NC !
Move to Fayetteville , NC soon !
Especially if you 're a soldier .
They love soldiers .
I mean love them .
Creepily .
It 's my understanding that if you 're in the Army you can't just up and choose to move wherever you like , so one would think that an entire bizarre ad campaign devoted to convincing military people to move to your town would be a waste of time .
But maybe " one " is not a patriot !
Fayetteville , NC is " The World 's First Sanctuary For Soldiers , " a title that they clearly just made up .
Why move to lovely Fayetteville , NC ?
Plenty of reasons !
Let 's examine a few :
" 2- Multitude of recreational opportunities " = Drugs .
" 4- Climate - You can play golf 12 months a year " =
Unless you 're in the , whatsit , Army .
" 5- Small town feel with conveniences of a larger city " =
' Fayetteville 's per capita violent crime rate is 64 % higher than the national average and the property crime rate is 75 % higher than the national average . '
" 6- There 's always something happening - great events & things to do " =
Drugs .
"8- Easy access to other parts of the state - especially being within a couple hours to the beach and the mountains " =
Located in North Carolina 's undistinguished south - central region .
" 10 - Knowing my friends and neighbors go out of their way to defend my rights " =
Gun nuts .
" 16 - We are the most patriotic community in the world " =
Gun nuts .
" 17 - The business possibilities that exist in such a growing market " =
Drugs .
" 21 - The fourth Friday of each month is exciting and fun downtown to be able to meet friends , have a good meal , get some exercise and view some of the great art displayed in several of the local museums " =
The other 29 days of each month are reserved for watching NASCAR on one 's couch .
Fayetteville is also home to the terrifyingly - named " Army 's Army , " a bunch of volunteers who have " pledged their moral , physical and spiritual support to those in the military . "
As you can see by the attached genuine Fayetteville teevee ad , if you are an Army dude and you come to Fayetteville , you will get mad pussy , all of it officially sanctioned by the City of Fayetteville .
If you 're not in the Army , fuck you .

Blogger Calculated Risk took a look at the Federal Reserve 's latest estimate of the equity Americans have in their homes and found it overly optimistic on its face .
And not by a little .
The Fed ’s quarterly tally of U.S. households ’ aggregate balance sheet , issued Thursday , as usual included an estimate of homeowner equity -- the market value of houses minus mortgage debt owed .
In the quarter ended March 31 , the Fed ’s data put net equity at a record low of 41.4 % of market value , down from 42.9 % the previous quarter and down dramatically from 58.5 % at the end of 2005 .
Still , a 41.4 % equity stake , after the unprecedented plunge in housing prices , might seem like a decent average cushion against more homeowners deciding to just walk away from a declining investment .
But the Fed ’s figure , as Calculated Risk notes , is simple math -- too simple .
The Fed subtracts estimated household mortgage debt ( $ 10.46 trillion ) from the total estimated market value of homes ( $ 17.87 trillion ) to get $ 7.4 trillion in equity .
That market - value total of $ 17.87 trillion , however , includes the estimated 32 % of homes that have no mortgage debt at all ( i.e. , those owners , most likely older folks who 've been in their homes for decades , have 100 % equity ) .
The more telling number , CR notes , is the remaining equity of people who have mortgages .
Crunching Census Bureau data , CR estimates that the average net equity of mortgage - encumbered homes is just 20.4 % , or less than half the overall equity cushion as figured by the Fed .
Go here for the full post explaining the calculations .
Of course , any aggregate number is going to include people who still have a lot of equity and the millions of others who are underwater in their homes .
But the 20.4 % estimated equity average for mortgaged homes is a much thinner cushion than the Fed 's overall equity figure suggests .

A small setback like being wrong about literally everything is not going to stop abstinence - only zealots from attacking sex ed .
Quick , what ’s the definition of insanity according to Albert Einstein ?
It ’s trying the same thing and again again and expecting a different result .
And this sums up what I try to explain in my latest essay for BusinessWeek.com on the constant hot topic in the culture wars , contraception .
Since the dawn of sex education , the social conservatives who generally set the agenda for school districts kept trying to bombard teenagers with moralistic dogmas about the “ evils ” of sex outside of marriage .
In all that time , they never managed to start paying attention to the fact that our bodies are wired for sex and our teenage years are actually a transition to sexual maturity , which means that teens will experiment with sex regardless of what we tell them and how much we seem to mean it .
Trying to stop some 40 million years of evolution with a pious message that will fall flat in reality , is like standing in front of an oncoming tsunami and expecting it to stop and turn back into the ocean because you give it an angry glare .
And not only does the abstinence - only crowd propose we do just that , but they also tend to counter all the evidence that their approach is n’t working by telling us to just keep glaring with more anger .
As we realize that sex is a natural part of our lives and a good sex life outside of moralistic legalities is actually healthy and normal , social conservatives incessantly complain about how our culture is sliding into a spiral of moral decay , coming up with ever more fanciful gloom and doom tales that are less reflective of reality than their vivid paranoia .
But where their denial of reality turns into a public menace is their insistence on trying to badmouth contraception .
In their bizarre view , pre-marital sex should be awkward , messy and downright dysfunctional .
But when teenagers are able to use condoms or birth control pills as an important safety measure against STDs and unwanted pregnancies , they panic because they can no longer control the sex lives of others in search of personal validation for their ideology .
The abstinence - only activists then cast contraception as enablers of moral decay , things which help teens get away with trying to have a normal sex life .
It ’s basically like saying that a car with seat belts , airbags and crumple zones encourages people to drive recklessly .
And their effort in infesting sex education classes with pseudoscience and religious overtones is helping to reduce the number of teens using contraception , opening the door to more pregnancies and infections .
They ’re slowly but surely achieving the exact opposite of their goal , then proclaiming the woefully ineffective curriculum they advocate is the only way to fix the problem they created in the first place .
In the real world , outside of the noxious and often hypocritical moralistic haze , we have two options .
We could give teenagers the tools to protect themselves and recognize that we should be teaching them what sex really is and what it entails .
Or we could scare them , lie to them and pretend they ’re not going to go out and have sex even though they do anyway .
If you ’ve ever spend any time in rural areas , you ’d note that places without a lot to do and filled with religious , abstinence - only zealots , also tend to have plenty of teen pregnancies and quite a few sexually active young people .
The only difference from an urban setting is that the sex is never discussed so the moralists can pretend it ’s not happening right under their noses while they ’re powerless to stop it .
" We will be delivering that at the end of Part 7 , Part 2 , "
" Were looking at various options of how we do it . "
" We may use some of the [ Benjamin Button ] techniques , "
" We 're still in the exploratory stage . "
" Seeing the sixth film again , it does strike me we are doing something very very different , "
" We 've just done this amazing scene in the forest , we 're being chased by the Snatchers .
And I 've never done anything like it , nothing even close .
I 've never really done any serious stunts or any real action , and it 's so exciting .
It 's really dynamic . "
" We 're way away from Hogwarts .
It 's a bit like three refugees being pursued across the landsape by these terrible Death Eaters . "
" The first one 's very verite and documentary and edgy and on the road .
The second part , part two , is a big opera , a great big epic , with huge battles .
And very oddly moving , because it concludes the whole saga really .
They 're two very different films . "
" It was n't something we were really looking forward to , "
" It 's quite a strange thing to think about doing . "
" I think Rupert and I felt the pressure of this kiss .
This is like 10 years worth of tension and hormones and chemistry in one moment and we had to ace it . "
We 've all spent so long looking forward tothat it almost seems perverse to already be pestering the cast and filmmakers about the final two films .
But at today 's press conference , director David Yates and stars Daniel Radcliffe , Rupert Grint and Emma Watson offered up some tidbits about where they 're headed with the last two films -- . for , even though you should really read the damn book already .
Yates answered a question about the book 's epilogue , in which we see Harry , Ron , Hermione and Ginny as adults , seeing their own children off on the Hogwarts Express .
Yates promised .
While Yates said they probably wo n't be using " Benjamin Button " technology , producer David Heyman promised that Emma Watson , Rupert Grint and Daniel Radcliffe would be playing their older selves , not some stand - in adult actors .
Heyman said , maybe as a hedge in case David Fincher comes a calling .
As for what else they 're doing with the seventh film , they 're obviously keeping mum on plot details , except to say that this film will be very , very different from the ones that have come before .
Radcliffe said , and Watson followed it up by talking about some of their recent work on the set .
Yates compares the first part of the seventh film to a road movie .
But , as anyone who has read the book knows , the tone will shift a good bit in the second half .
And how about the one part of the seventh film that everyone 's looking forward to -- Ron and Hermione 's big kiss ?
Grint and Watson admitted sheepishly that they filmed the scene a few weeks ago , and did everything they could to get it over with as quickly as possible .
Grint confesses .
And Watson said they both understood the gigantic importance of the scene .
We 'll have lots more from thepress conference next week , including Daniel Radcliffe shouting at Michael Gambon ( a.k.a. Dumbledore ) in the other room , his comparison of his own lips to those of a horse , and confessions of who can actually stand to watch the earlier films .
Plants and trees can both cool your home and help cut down on your A/C bill , all the more so if you know their optimal positioning spots .
Fortunately if you do n't , Bob Vila —yes , Bob Vila — does .

For those looking to optimize their energy use during the summer , southfacing trees and plants are n't the way to go .
Instead , position your greenery to the east or west of your home to block low , early , and late day sun .
Decidious trees are a good bet in colder climates .
Bob adds :
Trees on the southern exposure have to shade only a small angle of high summer sun .
For that reason , fast - growing , or columnar trees may be used .
It is interesting to note that a tree 25 feet distant from a building must be over 50 feet tall to provide shade on the south side in summer .
It takes a long time to grow a tree that tall .
But if it 's planted 10 feet from the building , it needs to be only 25 feet tall .
In summer you 'll want trees on the western exposure to protect the house from the hot afternoon sun .

Tight pants , short shorts , fedoras , pierced septums — these trends will no longer separate one hipster from another .
So they ’re shaving and bleaching their eyebrows !
What else would they do ?
They ca n’t even shave half their heads anymore — Alice Dellal and Cassie have done that .
So : eyebrows .
What purpose do they serve , really ?
All they do is keep a person from looking creepy .
And if you do n’t look creepy , you must not be fashionable .
“ I get a lot of stares , ” said [ eyebrow - less ] Mr. Toro , who was n’t immediately recognized by his friends that evening , his face had changed so much .
“ But it ’s cool because they are perplexed looks instead of something hateful . ”
Tight pants , short shorts , fedoras , pierced septums — these trends will no longer separate one hipster from another .
So they ’re shaving and bleaching their eyebrows !
What else would they do ?
They ca n’t even shave half their heads anymore — Alice Dellal and Cassie have done that .
So : eyebrows .
What purpose do they serve , really ?
All they do is keep a person from looking creepy .
And if you do n’t look creepy , you must not be fashionable .
“ It ’s unifying , ” she said .
“ There is an asexual element to no eyebrows .
We are much more accepting of the ‘ other ’ nowadays .
Removing eyebrows removes a degree of expression , which makes one look less human and more cerebral , maybe even mechanical .
It ’s an exercise in modernity . ”
And , evidently , poetry .
Of course the eyebrowless look has been in fashion magazines and on runways for years .
It ’s the signature look of Rick Owens ’s shows .
Prada also erased eyebrows for fall .
Givenchy bleached Adriana Lima ’s eyebrows for the fall campaign , which helps distance her from her sexpot Victoria ’s Secret image .
Models including Kristen McMenamy and Karen Elson are known for the look .
But why is it appearing on the streets ?
On normal ( but not really ) people ?
The Times has the answer :
Could no eyebrows be a reflection of economic downturn ?
Can one be too poor to have them ?
Having no eyebrows is certainly a way to express oneself without buying a product .
“ The economic troubles we are facing now open people up to be more daring and willing to don cutting - edge looks , ” [ Pat ] McGrath offered .
Of course it ’s the economy .
Except now that the trend has been highlighted with a substantial article in the “ Thursday Styles ” section , it ’s no longer cool .
Hipsters will have to find something else that does n’t cost any money but will cause strangers to stare at them .
Something strange enough that they ’ll feel united for being brave enough to do it together .
Like wrapping garbage on their heads with Saran wrap .
Or better yet , plucking out all their eyelashes !
Where Have All the Eyebrows Gone ? [ NYT ]
The Alternative PHP Cache ( APC ) is a tool that offers a massive performance gain to almost any PHP application simply by turning it on .
This extension to PHP provides both opcode caching and user caching , placing files and data into memory for fast retreival , and , if used correctly , eliminating some of the bottlenecks of the file server or database .
Turning APC on is a great way to get a performance boost , but there are ways to help improve APC ’s performance .
The very first thing that APC does when it ’s turned on is begin caching the opcode output from all of your PHP files .
Essentially , it takes the compiler ’s output , stores it in memory , and then retrieves it later on if that file is needed .
Also by default , APC checks the file on the file system to determine if it has changed since the last time APC cached the opcodes .
When APC does this , it executes a file - system - level stat ( ) call , which in the scheme of the calls performed is expensive .
This call basically helps APC determine if it should execute the opcodes that you have stored in memory , or if it should read and compile the file .
This behavior is on by default but can be disabled .
To disable it , you must add the following line to your php.ini file :
apc.stat=FALSE
This will not prevent APC from caching the file if the file is not yet in memory ; it will simply keep APC from checking for an updated file each and every time it executes it .
There are some obvious benefits to this .
First , you get a performance boost .
This method is used by Facebook to improve the performance of its servers .
Clearly your production systems are not updated on an exceptionally regular basis , meaning that you do n’t have to worry about the files becoming stale in memory .
As with all things , there are also some drawbacks .
First , a restart of the webserver or a call of apc_cache_clear ( ) is required before the APC cache will be cleared and any changes will be reflected .
This means that you may want to run APC with apc.write_lock in your INI file to keep your servers from crashing .
Also , this will not improve poorly written or poorly executed code ; bad code will still run slowly , no matter how many boosts you give it .
This will only help well - written code run faster .
APC is also only effective if the memory is not completely full , so running APC on heavily - visited sites with relatively little memory wo n’t earn you much of a boost at all .
Finally , if you implement this on a low - traffic website you ’re unlikely to see any improvement at all ; the higher the traffic , the more this will benefit the web server .
As with all things that promise performance improvements , you are encouraged to profile your code and benchmark the improvement before deploying to a production environment .
Warning :
Do not run this in a development environment ; otherwise you will be unable to see your changes reflected !
This is a production feature only .

Dreams from the Monster Factory : A Tale of Prison , Redemption and One Woman 's Fight to Restore Justice to All by Sunny Schwartz , with David Boodell Scribner , 204 pp. , $ 24.00
America ’s prison system is in a dire state .
Some 2.3 million people in this country are now behind bars , five times more than in 1978 .
Our incarceration rate is now higher than that of any other country in the world .
Many , if not most , inmates probably should not be there .
Sixteen percent of the adult prison population suffers from mental illness and should be in treatment ; a similar fraction is made up of children under eighteen .
Although there is little evidence that blacks are more likely to use drugs than whites , they are six times more likely to be imprisoned on drug - related charges .
1
Of those , most have no history of violence or drug dealing , and were arrested mainly for possession of drugs .
2
Sexual and other forms of abuse in prison are common , reported by some 20 percent of inmates .
These “ monster factories , ” as the lawyer and author Sunny Schwartz calls them , do little to break the cycle of violence in society and may even accelerate it .
Roughly two thirds of those released from US jails and prisons end up back inside within three years .
Some studies suggest that the experience of imprisonment can be so brutal and humiliating that it actually makes men , in particular , harder and meaner , so that the crimes they commit the next time around are even worse than what got them incarcerated in the first place .

Senator Jim Webb of Virginia is currently sponsoring a bill that would create a commission to review America ’s entire criminal justice system and make recommendations for reform .
If the bill passes , its commissioners should bear in mind a small experiment that took place in the San Francisco County Jail in San Bruno , California , some years ago .
This project , the subject of Sunny Schwartz ’s brief , absorbing memoir Dreams from the Monster Factory , is important not just because it dramatically reduced recidivism , but also because it could help break the tired stalemate between liberals and conservatives over punishment versus rehabilitation .
In addition , Schwartz ’s book is revealing about the criminal mind and its thought processes , and thus contains valuable lessons for those at risk of incarceration , and for those close to them .
Schwartz , now in her fifties , began working in the San Francisco county jails in 1980 as a student intern .
She volunteered to spend two days a week writing reports on prisoners ’ complaints about sentencing or jail conditions and forwarding them through the seemingly impenetrable bureaucracy of the California state justice system .
After graduating from law school , Schwartz worked briefly for an AIDS service organization and then , …
A few days ago , Digg disabled ‘ shouts ’ , which is the ability to share a certain article with your Digg.com friends .
Many Digg users were frustrated , as this means they have to rely on Twitter and Facebook to share their Diggs .
I ’m not a power - digger , and never cared much to be one .
But , after reading a couple of articles about Digg putting an end to the “ shouts ” feature , it got me thinking :
What the hell are they doing ?
Now , allow me to say what ’s on my mind …
Starting with a little history …
More than a year ago , Digg noticed that the top diggers with many “ friends ” to whom they shout articles to dominated most of Digg ’s first page content .
To solve this issue , they changed the algorithm to look for ‘ diversity ’ in votes .
Diversity here – as I understand it – is to have different people digg up different articles , and not the same group of people voting on every article the gets promoted to the front page .
Say , one article was dugg by X , Y and Z .
If X , Y and Z digg another article as a group , their vote would be depreciated .
Now , this makes sense and in general would reduce group voting power over Digg ’s front page .
But , as it turns out , this does not and did NOT provide a solution .
Power diggers where still in control of the first page after this change .
Why ?
Well , here is how I see it : A power digger would have thousands of “ friends ” .
Do you think that every shout of an article would be seen by the exact set of diggers receiving the shout ?
Probably not !
We ’re talking about thousands of diggers while only 50 to 100 votes in a short period are usually required to deem an article popular .
The end of “ shouts ” …
So , this failure led to the end of “ shouts ” – but is this going to solve this problem ?
I ’m voting for : No .
Proving my point is DiggShout.com as an example ; it gathered an active community in under 24 hours .
DiggShout is a community of Diggers wanting to publish and promote their articles .
In a similar way Digg ’s original shout worked , but this one is totally uncontrolled by Digg or Kevin Rose !
Same goes for Reg Saddler – @ Zaibatsu on Twitter – according to ReadWriteWeb , he ’s already using Twitter to redirect users to help Digg up stories he finds interesting .
He ’s got 80 k+ followers at the time of writing .
In other words , there is still a threshold , and once a user breaks it , he can manipulate – to some extent – the front page once more !
It does n’t really make a difference where this community is , whether it ’s on Digg ( no more ) , Facebook or Twitter .
I think if ending shouts is an attempt to get rid of the advantage “ shouts ” gave power - diggers , then it ’s not going to work as soon as people get used to using Twitter and Facebook to distribute their stories , instead .
Replies , rationalizations and suggestions that I just had to say out loud …
In reply to Greg Finn , quoting : “ After the shout - pocalypse I believe that Digg will be a better place from a content perspective .
Average stories wo n’t be artificially inflated ; articles will be back to being judged based on their content … not on who has motives behind it . “ .
I do n’t think so , Greg , Twitter and Facebook are similar in fashion to the ex “ friends system ” of Digg .
So , even if shouts are stopped on Digg.com , shouts will continue elsewhere , as I explained above .
In reply to Muhammad Saleem in his discussion about Digg dropping shouts and I quote : “ they need a better mechanism that still enables people to share things without being penalized , and at the same time they need a system that does n’t get abused .
Because the system can still be abused . “ .
The system can still be abused even after the shouts are removed , we agree on this point .
Quoting M.S. again : “ the only option that could work is for Digg to come up with more ground rules , but even that is a tall order . “ .
I do have some ideas which I find hard that Kevin Rose and Jay Allison seem to be ignoring , or just not getting .
If you skip to minute 11 of the video embedded below , you will see the discussion of some recommendations a user under the name SigmaEcho posted to Diggnation .
The one that I think makes sense the most is allowing each article to appear randomly on the first page – instead of only on the Upcoming section of the site .
It was completely disregarded although this strategy is what makes StumbleUpon a brilliant and non-playable system .
How ?
Well , direct votes up ( from the site or direct URL ) do not make an article rank more , rather the random views through the SU toolbar is what counts .
A user who came to a page randomly is nearly never biased towards the site ’s owner or content submitter .
This article should give a better explanation of this concept .
Another concept is what Reddit seems to be doing .
They have some sort ( it ’s not very clear , really ) of automatic voting down happening .
I ’m guessing this is happening if a user never visits a page he votes up , or maybe it ’s linked to karma scores .
I have n’t found a solid information source to understand how it really works , but there is an idea Digg ’s R&D should “ Research and Develop ” .
That ’s what I had in mind .
Just felt like I had to say it out loud .
I hope you enjoyed this post .
Do n’t forget to Digg and Retweet it , he he :-) !
If you too have something in mind to say , please use the comments below .
The world is vast .
Quite often we met with travellers around us ; the usual conversation about where they came from and where they ’re going next .
Down on the Dubai Beach Houses , the surfers enjoy the wave ; on the middle of the jungle , hikers enjoy the Scariest Pool ; and in the middle of the city , the visitors enjoy the magnificent Tokyo Underground Temple .
But I am still in here , enjoying the silence of the room .
Then I started reading the quotes you ’ll find below .
Some made me laugh .

Guestblogger Marina Gorbis is executive director at Institute for the Future .
l find many things remarkable about psychiatrist George Vaillant 's longitudinal studies of 268 Harvard men , not least of which is their time span — 72 years !
To see someone transformed from a teenager to an old man is usually the stuff of fiction , not academic research .
It turns out though that real lives are not that different from fiction , what with so many unpredictable twists and turns .
What struck me most was the depth of personal transformations many of Vaillant 's subjects ' lives take .
For example , starting out as a promising well - adjusted student with a loving family and later coming to resent your kin , seeing them as cold and detached ; veering from a happy marriage to an affair with a much younger woman and eventual divorce ; finding God , abandoning God , all in the span of one life .
These transformations are so stark , some of the study participants barely recognize themselves when presented with vignettes of their past selves .
As Joshua Wolf Shenk writes in the June issue of Atlantic Monthly :
" One of the men in the study at age 50 declared , " God is dead and man is very much alive and has a wonderful future . "
He had stopped going to church , he said , when he arrived at Harvard .
But as a sophomore , he had reported going to mass four times a week .
When Vaillant sent this–and several similar vignettes –to the man for his approval to publish them , the man wrote back , " George , you must have sent these to the wrong person . "
Vaillant writes , " He could not believe that his college persona could have ever been him .
Maturation makes liars of us all . "
The stories reported in the study are complex yet familiar — they are not so different from stories of our own lives or those of our parents , grandparents , or others we know .
I have come to view my own life as a progression of different personas — a young girl in Ukraine , a young professional in Silicon Valley , a mom of a teenager .
At each stage , I was a different person with a different outlook on the world , different circumstances and sets of aspirations .
Reminders of my past selves are contained in a few photographs tucked away in a shoe box that I occasionally bring out , a box of letters to my family in Odessa , and , more recently , increasingly growing compilations of videos , e-mails , online photos , etc .
Reinventing ourselves as we go through life is a natural part of human experience .
It is what we do as we mature , encounter new circumstances , build new relationships .
It is an inherent part of the immigrant experience as one changes homes , learns new language , and internalizes new cultural norms .
But such reinventions and transformations are not the exclusive domain of immigrants — we are all subject to them to a greater or lesser degree as a part of living .
A key part of the process of reinvention of self is the acquisition of new reference points that serve to give us a sense of our new identity — new friendships , new relationships , new places .
An equally important part of this process is the shedding of old ones .
This is what is so interesting about high school reunions .
We realize that the people in the room who were so important to us during our teenager years , whose acceptance and approval defined so much how we thought about ourselves , matter so little to us twenty years later .
Indeed , it is hard to believe they once mattered so much at all .
They simply no longer serve as reference points to who we are today .
Almost ten years ago when doing research on technology and identity , my colleague Kathi Vian wrote : " We create our identity through reference points .
We know who we are in reference to others …
Identity is a conception of self that we create based on various reference points in our life . "
Meaning that we know we are tall because there are people around us who are shorter , we know we are smart because someone tells us we are , and we know we are shy or outgoing by comparing ourselves to those around us .
What is interesting about the technology environment we live in is that for the first time in our human history we are able to create persistent and mirror - like references points of our lives that keep former identities in constant view .
Videos and photographs taken from birth , snippets of life documented on Facebook , streams of thoughts on Twitter , inner wonderings revealed in blogs — these are all new reference points for creating and shaping our identities , our senses of self .
And unlike previous reminders , often tucked away in shoe boxes , desk drawers , and attics , these are much more sensory - rich , pervasive , and easily accessible , to us and others .
Sociologist Amitai Etzioni raises an alarm about existence of these persistent trails and reference points .
In an article titled " Second Chances , Social Forgiveness , and the Internet " he writes :
By computerizing local public records , the Internet casts the shadow of people 's past far and fast ; like a curse they cannot undo , their records now follow them wherever they go .
True , even in the good old days , arrest records , criminal sentences , bankruptcy filings , and even divorce records were public .
Some were listed in blotters kept in police stations , others in courthouses ; anyone who wished to take the trouble could go there and read them .
But most people did not .
Above all , there was no way for people in distant communities to find these damning facts without going to inordinate lengths .
In the Internet era , in contrast , a person 's conviction of graffiti vandalism at age 19 will still be there at age 29 when he is a solid citizen trying to get a job and raise a family , and the conviction will be there for anyone to see .
Same is potentially true for a high school prank captured on someone else 's Facebook page or Youtube channel .
While this is of concern , I wonder if as a result of pervasiveness of such information we may actually see greater social forgiveness and tolerance .
After all , the more people see that even those they admire do stupid things once in a while , particularly when they are young , would n't our tolerance level go up also ?
And has n't it happened already ?
The more we find out about personal indiscretions of various politicians and celebrities , the more inured the public has become , it seems .
We are finding out that many of our heroes are fallible .
Maybe , along with everything else , the Internet is democratizing human fallibility .
What I do wonder about , however , is how will personal transformations be achieved in this era of persistent and vivid reference points from the past ?
I see these transformations as an integral and necessary part of going through life , a part of creating new selves as one matures , learns , and acquires new life experiences .
What tools and practices will we develop to shed the old reference points as a part of such transformations ?
In other words , what is the new equivalent of the old shoebox or cobwebbed attic in the Internet era ?
Central Banks , should they exist , should be able to do what is right for monetary policy , which includes regulation of credit . �
In a fiat money world , where credit exists as electronic entries , credit is money .
But wait , what if central bank independence is compromised from within ? �
What if voluntarily becomes the lap dog of the President , Treasury , or Congress ?
It takes a bold man to stand up to the powers that be , and the Fed has had its share of them . �
Marriner Eccles opposed Truman . �
William McChesney Martin , Jr. stood up to Presidents and Congress for his long term as Chairman . �
Paul Volcker blew cigar smoke at representatives and Senators as he restored sound money to the US amid screams of pain in the economy .
Central bank independence does n’t mean squat unless the central bank uses it !
In the name of independence , for fear that the President or Congress would restrict the central bank , many Fed Chairmen have given in to the powers that be :
Ben Bernanke , rescued entities that he should not have rescued , and established lending programs that use the national credit to benefit a minority of participants .�
These actions should have been taken by Congress , if done at all , so that the voters could decide whether it was right to do it or not . �
Bernanke validates the idea that the government keeps the Fed around to do what it cannot do constitutionally .
Alan Greenspan threw liquidity at every little and big problem , and was slow to withdraw liquidity , pushing the US slowly but surely into a liquidity trap , which Ben Bernanke was saddled with .
G. William Miller and Arthur F. Burns , who facilitated the inflation of the ’ 70s , at the behest of Nixon and Carter .
Daniel R. Crissinger and Roy A. Young , who facilitated the loose monetary policy of the ’ 20s .
Central bank independence means risking your own tenure for the good of the institution .�
Marriner Eccles and Paul Volcker did not get reappointed because they offended the President .���
Central bank independence does not mean compromising in order to protect against micromanagement .�
Independence means being a man , and telling the President and congressmen that you will do what is right to preserve sound money , regardless of the consequences .
The Fed as Systemic Risk Regulator
I have suggested in the past that the Fed should regulate systemic risk as an aspect of its mandate only because they are the biggest creator of systemic risk through loose monetary policy . �
I am not suggesting this on the basis of competence — that is ridiculous . �
But on the basis of modifying the behavior of the Fed to make it more resistant to loosening rates early because of systemic risk concerns — that makes sense , because it will increase the emphasis on a sound currency .
Now , many economists are pleading with Congress to be gentle on the Fed because an independent Fed is critical to sound economic policy .�
That would be true if the Fed were willing to take politically unpopular actions that were in the best interests of the economy . �
Sadly , that is not true of the present Fed . �
They do what the politicians want , and give the politicians cover , because the politicians can point at the Fed as the actor , via the rubric of “ Central Bank independence . ”
I say that the Fed needs more accountability and transparency to Congress , and ultimately to the American . �
The quasi-public , quasi - private nature of the Fed needs to be changed to public or private . �
Section 13.3 of the Federal Reserve Act , which allowed for the most egregious bailout actions , should be repealed .
If bailouts need to be done , let Congress do them , and let them take the heat for their actions .
Not only should the Fed be audited as any large public or private organization , but if they are a public organization they should respond to the FOIA requests from major news organizations ( Bloomberg , Fox Business , etc. ) without hiding behind technicalities of protecting business secrets .�
The insurance industry regularly reveals detailed data on their operating companies , with little seeming harm . �
The banks can afford to do the same .
Power without accountability should be foreign to our republican form of government .�
Control of our currency rightfully belongs to Congress , and Congress should tighten controls on the Fed so that its degree of independence is limited to the ordinary matters pertaining to a central bank — preserving the soundness of the currency . �
Its competence there has been limited ; but hey , at least focus on the basics would restore confidence in an institution that no longer has the confidence of the American people .
“ Central Bank independence ” is a nice phrase , but to the economists who petitioned Congress to preserve the status quo , I would simply ask this :
How and from what should the central bank be independent ?�
To whom and in what ways should it be accountable ?

From the WSJ : Pick - a- Pay Loans : Worse Than Subprime
For the third straight month , option adjustable - rate mortgages are generating proportionally more delinquencies and foreclosures than subprime mortgages ...
As of April , 36.9 % of Pick - A - Pay loans were at least 60 days past due , while 19 % were in foreclosure , according to data from First American CoreLogic , a unit of Santa Ana , Calif . - based First American Corp .
In contrast , 33.9 % of subprime loans were delinquent , with 14.5 % of those loans in foreclosure , the figures show .
Wells Fargo , who holds more Option - ARMs on its books than any other institution , states in their last 10 - Q filing : Based on assumptions of a flat rate environment , if all eligible customers elect the minimum payment option 100 % of the time and no balances prepay , we would expect the following balance of loans to recast based on reaching the principal cap : $ 4 million in the remaining three quarters of 2009 , $ 9 million in 2010 , $ 11 million in 2011 and $ 32 million in 2012 ...
In addition , we would expect the following balance of ARM loans having a payment change based on the contractual terms of the loan to recast : $ 20 million in the remaining three quarters of 2009 , $ 51 million in 2010 , $ 70 million in 2011 and $ 128 million in 2012 .
In short , Wells expects $ 56 million in Option ARMs to recast due to the loan balance reaching 125 % of the value of the original loan and another $ 269 million to recast based on the terms of the loan .
Given that we ’re talking about a portfolio of over $ 100 BILLION of these loans , this means ESSENTIALLY NO LOANS WILL RECAST due to the negative amortization limits or contractual terms before 2012 .
Both assumptions seemed suspect , yet , they are in fact true .
Looking at page 55 of the Golden West 10 - K from 2005 we read : ... most of our loans are scheduled to have a payment change without respect to any annual limit in order to reamortize the loan over its remaining life at the end of the tenth year or when the loan balance reaches 125 % of the original amount .
We term this reamortization a “ recast . ”
Historically , most loans in our portfolio have paid off before the loan ’s payment is recast .
History does n’t look like it will be a good guide going forward but this at least clearly spells out what we are facing .
If recasts do n’t happen contractually for 10 years this means that the $ 49 billion of Golden West Option ARMs originated in 2004 will recast in 2014 , and the $ 51 billion originated in 2005 will recast in 2015 .
We knew this day was coming .
By the way , the Healdsburg Housing Bubble has a nice analysis of the Credit Suisse Reset chart , and makes a strong argument that many of the recasts will be later than the chart indicates : Reset Chart from Credit Suisse has a Major Error
There is much more in HBB 's post , but this suggests that the problem will presist for some time ( much longer than shown by the Credit Suisse chart ) .
I am the happy owner of an Android phone .
I love it .
But what I love even more , is rolling some sweet Python on my precious .
In case you have a vanilla phone like I do , you will need to follow these steps :
download and install the Android SDK for your platform
add the SDK tools to your system path , for instance on Windows run this in a shell :
> set PATH=%PATH%;path_to_android_sdk\tools
activate USB debugging on your phone ( Parameters > Applications > Development > USB Debugging )
) setup your system to detect your device as explained here ( on Windows , it means installing the usb driver from the SDK )
check that your phone is detected correctly by running adb get - state ( if everything is ok , the result should be ‘ device ’ )
check out the Android Scripting Environment svn repository on your computer ( see this page )
Your system is almost configured , let ’s install the necessary applications on the phone :
install the Android Scripting Environment on your phone
( optionally ) install the Text - to - Speech library ( by Charles Chen ) on your phone if you want to use it in your scripts , via the Android Market
run ASE on your phone , type menu and start a Python shell , you will notice a line like ‘ export AP_PORT = “ 49508 ” ‘ .
setup port forwarding on your system with the value you just noted :
> set AP_PORT=49508 > adb forward tcp : %AP_PORT % tcp: %AP_PORT %
go to the ASE directory on your computer containing the android .py module
> cd path_to_ASE \python\ase
run your favorite Python 2.6 interpreter and enjoy the magic :
> python Python 2.6 ( r26:66721 , Oct 2 2008 , 11:35:03 ) [ MSC v.1500 32 bit ( Intel ) ] on win32 Type " help " , " copyright " , " credits " or " license " for more information . >>> import android >>> droid = android .
Android ( ) # now your phone is ready to acknowledge your awesomeness >>> droid.speak ( ' hello , my master ' ) {u'result ' : None , u'id ' : 2 , u'error ' : None} # or alternatively , if you do n't have the TTS library installed : >>> droid.makeToast ( ' hello , my master ' ) {u'result ' : None , u'id ' : 1 , u'error ' : None}
Now you have all the information you need to start exploring the API and roll more interesting examples .

Reports across the Web are pointing to a build 7600 for both Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 .
This is significant because the bump in the build number would suggest that Microsoft has christened this build as the Release to Manufacturing ( RTM ) build .
The RTM is expected to be given out to Microsoft partners sometime later this month and launched on October 22 , 2009 , the day General Availability ( GA ) .
The build string is " 7600.16384.090710 -1945 , " which indicates that it was compiled just a few days ago : July 10 , 2009 , at 7:45 pm .
Microsoft only increments the build number when it reaches a significant goal , and the only one left is the RTM milestone .
The last builds that were leaking were all 72xx builds , so such a large bump is suspicious , but at the same time it is something Microsoft would do to signify that this is the final build .
Below are two screenshots ( Ars received them via an instant message ) , one of Windows 7 build 7600 and one of Windows Server 2008 R2 build 7600 .
For whatever reason , both these screenshots were taken by going to the About Calculator option in the Calculator application .
As you can see , Aero is not enabled in either of the screenshots :
Earlier this week there were reports that Microsoft had discovered some show - stopping bugs that would delay the RTM , but if build 7600 is legitimate , then Microsoft has obviously found a way around the issues .
This build is in the process of being leaked into the wild , but we recommend exercising caution with build 7600 as Microsoft has not confirmed ( or denied ) its existence .
Microsoft was rumored to be aiming for compiling the RTM build on July 13 , 2009 .
If 7600 is indeed the RTM build , we can expect an official announcement as early as tomorrow , at the kickoff of the Microsoft Worldwide Partner Conference , which is taking place in New Orleans .
Of course , for all we know , build 7700 might end up being the RTM , so let 's all hold our horses until Microsoft gives the official word .
Thanks to GeekSmack for letting us know about this leak .

The Dhongria Kondh say their way of life is threatened
The idea that there could be any connection between one of India 's most remote and inaccessible areas and the Church of England seems improbable , at first glance .
High in the monsoon mists in eastern India , witch doctors in the Niyamgiri hills still make sacrifices to the gods and tribes believe the hills are sacred .
It is a world away from the quiet corridors of Church House - the headquarters of the Church of England in London .
But campaigners say that the lives of indigenous people in India are under threat because of a mining project involving a UK company , in which the Church of England has a £ 2.5 m ( $ 4.1 m ) stake .
Destroying wildlife
The church has been condemned by campaign groups such as ActionAid and Survival International for investing in the Vedanta company , which is about to start mining bauxite - used for making aluminium - to feed what could become one of the world 's biggest refineries nearby .
We do n't need a foreign multinational to move into our area and promise jobs and development that are not required
Dongria Kondh activist Sitaram Kulisika
Anglican Church in India mine row Tribe takes on global mining firm
The company , Vedanta , is also accused of forcing tribal people off the land , damaging the environment and destroying wildlife .
All this on the face of it is highly embarrassing for the Church , which is why its Ethical Investment Advisory Group spokesman Edward Mason chooses his words carefully as he explains that there are no plans at present to withdraw the investment in Vedanta .
" For certain sensitive industries such as mining companies we have a three - year monitoring and engagement process , " he said .
" Where we have concerns that standards do not conform to norms of corporate behaviour we prefer to talk to them and bring about change that way . "
The church acknowledges that the allegations are " serious " .
ActionAid has brought over a member of the Dongria Kondh tribal community to London , to make the case against the mine at Vedanta 's annual general meeting in London on Monday .
A single share has been bought to enable Sitaram Kulisika to speak at the meeting .
He argues that the mining plans will endanger his community 's livelihood .
Please turn on JavaScript .

Advertisement " Our people have been living in the hills for generations , " he says .
" We do n't need a foreign multinational to move into our area and promise jobs and development that are not required . "
The Dongria Kondh survive by gathering fruit , growing small crops of millet and selling jungle plants in the towns at the foot of the hills .
The modern world has yet to reach the Niyamgiri hills - there 's no electricity , no school , no television , no telephones .
' Servants '
Mr Kulisika is accompanied by ActionAid 's head of indigenous people 's rights , Bratindi Jena , who is equally passionate about the damage she says is being caused by the mining project .
" If you assess the cost benefit analysis of this project there are few benefits , " she says .
" Companies like Vedanta want to make tribal people servants in their own homeland .
[ These people ] know what they want out of their relationship with Mother Earth - not foreign - backed companies . "
Several UK - based aid agencies are campaigning against the project , as well as the prominent environmentalist Bianca Jagger .
But Vedanta says it has the support of the Orissa state government and the law on its side .
" Before we went ahead with this project we consulted exhaustively to assess its environmental and social impact , " a spokesman said .
" The campaigners seem to have conveniently forgotten that this is a joint venture with the Orissa government and that it was approved by the country 's Supreme Court last year - the highest judicial body in the land .
" They also seem to forget that we are talking about a part of India urgently in need of investment .
This is one of the poorest parts of the country where maternal and infant mortalities are too high and where illnesses such as malaria are rampant .
This project offers people a much brighter economic future . "
The company accuses groups like ActionAid and Survival International of focusing their campaigns solely on the concerns of the tribal community and ignoring the need of other people in the area for jobs and the improvements in education and healthcare that it says the project will bring .

General Electric ( GE ) is working on line up of household appliances that will radically alter energy consumption .
By 2015 , if a home owner went all in with GE products from solar panels , to baby wind turbines , with smart appliances and meters , the home could be a net zero energy provider .
The whole system is going to connected via a home energy manager device which will be like a " cybernetic brain " GE 's VP Steve Fludder says .
The energy manager will work with all the products to manage energy use at peak times , so the system does n't run out of juice .
That will cost $ 200 - $ 250 .
The new smart appliances that interact with the energy manager are only supposed to cost $ 10 or so more than current appliances .
The biggest hold up for the project , according to Greentech Media , is getting utilities on board , who are not known for being the fastest moving bunch .
Keep quiet under all circumstances , the circular advises those planning to march in Thursday 's unauthorized demonstrations in Iran cities .
" The heaviest weapon to carry is one rose in the hand , " it says .
As Iranians prepare for what could be another violent day of confrontations Thursday between demonstrators and security forces , including pro-government plainclothes Basiji militias , supporters of opposition candidate Mir-Hossein Mousavi have distributed instructions to try to keep any anticipated violence to a minimum .

Jon Stewart has now earned the wrath of Rush Limbaugh for getting Bill Kristol to admit on The Daily Show that government run healthcare works .
Limbaugh said that Stewart is a sell out for using the military as healthcare example , because liberals like Stewart hate the military .
Ugh , so now Rush is going after Jon Stewart .
Here is the audio courtesy of Media Matters :
Advertisements
Limbaugh first did n’t know what The Daily Show was , and then called it that comedy show that young people think is real news .
Limbaugh said , “ The thing that gets me about this , I know Jon Stewart is a state run lib Democrat , and if he is having to resort to pointing to the military as something that works to sell a program , that ’s a huge sellout , because these people hate the military . ”
In Rush ’s mind , Jon Stewart is a liberal Democrat , which I am sure is a relief to Bill Clinton after the years of nightly beatings he took from Stewart during the last couple of years of his term .
Secondly , Comedy Central is state run media , really ?
I did n’t realize South Park was a government run media project .
Rush implies that Stewart is some sort of agent of left who is selling Obama ’s policies to the young .
Stewart is n’t selling anyone ’s programs .
He can be very critical of both political parties , which is why his show is so successful .
It is n’t a liberal or a conservative program .
It is a half an hour of current events comedy .
Limbaugh would be wise to pay attention to Stewart , because it is his audience that supported Obama in such large numbers in 2008 .
Unlike Limbaugh ’s old , angry , white man listenership , Stewart ’s viewers will be shaping elections for years to come , so dismissing his program as a comedy show that young people think is real news is dumb thing to do .
Stewart is n’t a sellout for pointing out the holes in the Republican healthcare argument .
A sellout is someone like Rush Limbaugh who goes on the air everyday and acts as a propagandist for the Republican Party .
Limbaugh is the very definition of a sellout .

I do n't know all of the facts on the Gay Pride Parade issue but it 's clear that my friend Diane has been treated very unfairly .
The truth is that , for better or worse , the Conservative Government has provided grants for this kind of thing in the past .
It was the Liberals who initiated them but it was Conservative Ministers who attended and bragged about the government 's support for the Gay Games .
That 's because half the conservative caucus has a libertarian bent and the other half comes from the more conservative side .
So you can either scrap all grants for all parades , or you can fund the thing like you always have and devote your efforts to fixing the three or four other things that really do make a difference , none of which involves parades , costumes and nudity .
My ideal is to let everyone raise their own money to hold their parades and the police can be there to make sure that most of the people , keep on most of their clothes most of the time .
That 's never been a problem at the Rodeo Day parade in my town but then again it 's usually cold in Alberta at the beginning of June .
Whatever .
The bottomline is that after all the years Diane has contributed to building the conservative movement in Canada she deserves better then to be ratted out by a colleague on an issue that is a complete loser for the party .

- video encodings still in process -
Here are some cooking lessons for those that like their greens .... seriously !
Pundits are roasting Apple over a scuffle raised by Mozilla and Opera to define the free Ogg Theora video codec as the official way to present video on the web in the new HTML 5 specification .
The problem : HTML is n't supposed to define content codecs , and even if it were , Ogg Theora , commercially abandoned nearly a decade ago , does n't have what it takes to deliver video on the increasingly mobile web .
While the tech media has largely portrayed the disagreement as either a huge roadblock for HTML 5 or a war between free software advocates and big corporations , the reality is that specifications like HTML 5 are not intended to enforce political views but rather to foster interoperability .
At issue is the video format specified in the new HTML 5 , a situation that is new because the HTML specification has never defined a simple system for embedding video in the same way that web developers can place ordinary graphics within their pages .
While web browsers use the " img " tag to recognize and display graphical elements in any number of formats , from GIF to JPEG to PNG , there has never been an equivalent way to simply place video or audio files within HTML .
Instead , web developers have have to post their video as an embedded file , which various browsers may or may not know how to display properly .
This conspicuously missing link in seamless audio and video playback on the web has a history that parallels QuickTime and the development of the ISO MPEG video standards themselves , the same industry standards that Mozilla , Opera and some open source advocates are railing against .
It also , of course , involves Microsoft .
The QuickTime Plugin
Displaying video that works properly across all browsers has been a tricky feat , as competing multimedia playback plugins usually only support specific container files ( used to store the media data ) and codecs ( used to compress the audio and video data ) .
Web developers originally used MJPEG ( Motion JPEG ) , a simple video format that plays video using a series of JPEG stills and uses a basic raw WAV file for audio .
That is the only format that works across browsers , but is n't very efficient in terms of quality versus download size .
Apple 's QuickTime predated the web as a system for playing back video in a variety of different codecs , including MJPEG , and could support new codec components from third parties .
When the web began to take off in the mid 90s , Apple provided a QuickTime plugin for Netscape and other browsers that enabled them to play audio and video directly within the browser .
This initially made QuickTime the way to deliver video on the web , particularly in a world where Macs made up a disproportionate ratio of both web users and web developers .
After realizing the significance of the open web and its potential to marginalize its Windows monopoly , Microsoft targeted Netscape for death and took aim at QuickTime as well .
Microsoft licensed the NCSA 's SpyGlass browser code that Netscape was built upon and produced Internet Explorer , which it then bundled with Windows for free to destroy any market for Netscape 's browser .
Microsoft 's War on QuickTime
Copying and killing QuickTime proved to be harder .
Microsoft had already failed to match QuickTime 's performance with its own Video for Windows product in the early 90s , and then found itself in hot legal water after it intentionally stole Apple 's QuickTime code in an effort to make VfW a viable competitor on Windows in the San Francisco Canyon scandal .
After years of failing to unseat QuickTime as the standard for video playback on Mac and Windows systems , Microsoft stepped up its efforts to take over web video in the late 90s by simply making Internet Explorer ignore the QuickTime plugin users had installed .
In the Microsoft Monopoly trial that centered around the company 's abuse of Netscape , Apple executives testified that while Netscape worked fine with the QuickTime plugin , successive versions of Internet Explorer increasingly failed to properly send video to QuickTime , creating the impression for consumers that QuickTime did n't work correctly .
In the trial , Apple presented a chart of 22 media file types , all of which were passed to QuickTime by Netscape 4 on Windows 95 .
In Internet Explorer 3 however , only 15 were passed to the QuickTime plugin ; in IE 4.0 only 11 were passed , and under Windows 98 , only 4 .
Microsoft 's lawyers only claimed that nobody could prove the company was breaking compatibility with QuickTime on purpose and maliciously .
At the same time however , Microsoft representatives were threatening to destroy Apple 's business within video authoring unless the company agreed to scuttle QuickTime playback on Windows and grant Microsoft competition - free access and control over video playback on Windows .
Unlike other companies that played along with Microsoft 's threats , Apple turned down Microsoft 's famous demand to " knife the baby " and took on the company head to head in video playback .
Vigorous competition against Microsoft resulted in the release of QuickTime 3 against a variety of technology announcements by Microsoft that largely failed to materialize .
Microsoft 's promised , cross- platform Active Movie never arrived , and the intent to deliver a new Windows Media container file also never gained real traction .
Instead , in 1998 the ISO adopted QuickTime 's container as the basis for the forthcoming MPEG 4 suite of multimedia standards , a high profile rejection of Microsoft 's plans .
Microsoft pushes Flash against Adobe
While fighting Apple on the QuickTime front in video , Microsoft was also embroiled in a fight against efforts by Adobe and Sun to promote PGML , based on Adobe 's PostScript , as an interoperable , open standard for presenting vector graphics on the web .
Microsoft teamed up with Macromedia to submit its own competing VML standard .
The W3C standards body eventually worked out a compromise that drew from both , creating a new standard called SVG ( Scalable Vector Graphics ) .
Rather than supporting the new SVG standard , Microsoft continued to push VML in Internet Explorer , resulting in market confusion and no real adoption of SVG .
On top of that , in order to help scuttle any adoption of Adobe 's free SGV web plugin , Microsoft began bundling Macromedia 's proprietary Flash player with Internet Explorer 5 in 1999 , giving the Flash vector graphics plugin the same broad audience over the Windows monopoly that it had leveraged in reverse to kill QuickTime by breaking compatibility with certain movie formats .
Microsoft 's anti-compeitive suppression of QuickTime subsequently resulted in a new application for Flash : video presentation .
Because the plugin was widely installed , it could be used to package up proprietary video for opaque playback in the browser .
Rather than linking to a standard video file for browser playback using a video plugin , web developers began to package their videos up as a closed Flash movie file for playback by the Flash player plugin Microsoft was widely distributing with Internet Explorer .
Anyone who did n't use Internet Explorer could download the Macromedia Flash plugin , just like downloading the QuickTime plugin .
The difference was that because web video was now locked up in the Flash format , it could n't be played back using alternative players in the way that QuickTime - compatible movies can be played back by alternative media software .
Additionally , Macromedia 's
Flash player really only worked well on Windows , effectively tying Flash content to Internet Explorer .
Apple takes back media with the iPod
Having failed to take over web video itself , Microsoft had at least managed to attach web video to a format that worked best on Internet Explorer .
The company then turned its attention to taking over standard video formats used in publishing music and video .
Microsoft hoped to replace DVD 's ISO MPEG - 2 standard with a high definition , heavily DRMed Windows Media format on the same disc , called iHD .
Microsoft also pushed into the music business to replace MPEG MP3 with Windows Media Audio , enticing the studios with promises of pirate - proof DRM there as well .
However , Microsoft failed to deliver its promised Windows Media DRM technologies on time , resulting in an opening for Apple 's iPod and the iTunes music store .
Apple adopted the ISO 's standard MPEG AAC ( advanced audio codec ) , which enabled sophisticated data compression and supported studio - demanded DRM .
The success of the iPod trampled Microsoft 's WMA as a commercial audio distribution format , and iTunes for Windows even managed to make AAC the new standard on both Macs and Windows , quite the coup for company that had been written off as a 2 % also ran in the desktop wars .
Apple then did the same thing in video , promoting the state of the art MPEG H.264 standard for video compression in iTunes video with hardware video decoding support on the iPod for efficient playback .
Having failed to gain any real traction in pushing WMV playback into DVDs as a quasi- standard , Microsoft managed to rubber stamp its own WMV codec through its SMTPE pet standards body in the US , resulting in it being renamed VC - 1 .
It then got VC - 1 licensing mandated as part of both the Blu - Ray and HD - DVD specifications , although only the ill fated HD - DVD ever really used it .
Meanwhile , iTunes continued to popularize H.264 in the same way Apple had helped launch AAC among consumers .
Apple takes on WMV and Flash
Not content with simply encouraging the use of interoperable , open standards , Apple also took up the task of removing dependancies upon non-standard codecs designed to tie content to Windows exclusively .
Microsoft had refused to support the latest version of WMA and WMV on the Mac , and Macromedia had done little to make its Flash plugin work well on Macs , Linux , or in other browsers besides Internet Explorer .
To ensure that commercial content could continue to play back everywhere , including its own Mac and iPod hardware , Apple refused to support Microsoft 's proprietary WMA and WMV playback on the iPod , channeling iPod demand into creating a music market that only rewarded interoperable formats from raw WAV audio to published standards such as MP3 and AAC .
It did the same with iPod video , supporting only MPEG - 4/ H.264 formats at the expense of WMV , Real Video , and other proprietary formats .
With the iPhone , Apple did something parallel to Flash : it similarly refused to support video playback of Flash movies , officially citing that this was only because Flash , now owned by Adobe , did n't work well enough to include it .
While that was true , the real reason for killing Flash on the iPhone was to push web developers back toward publishing standard video formats rather that wrapping their video content up in a proprietary Flash binary .
Somewhat ironically , Microsoft itself has now taken aim at Adobe 's Flash by introducing its own copy originally called Sparkle , along with the Silverlight runtime .
With Internet Explorer now facing increased competition and plummeting market share , Microsoft 's ability to assassinate competitors ' plugins as it did with QuickTime and its power to coronate others , as it did with the Flash plugin , have weakened .
HTML 5 and the Ogg Theora option
Meanwhile , the browsers taking away Microsoft 's control of the market , including Opera , Mozilla 's Firefox , Apple 's Safari , and Google 's Chrome , are working together to solve the problem of having no standardized way to present video .
HTML 5 defines simple ways to embed video files so that the client browser can display them .
Microsoft 's strategy seems to be to wait and see how those efforts develop , and perhaps attempt to derail them before they obsolete any real need for Flash or Microsoft 's own anti-interoperable , web - standards hostile , belated clone of Flash in Silverlight .
Apple already convinced Google to serve up its YouTube videos as H.264 in addition to Flash binaries , initially to support playback on the iPhone .
Google has also demonstrated a version of its YouTube website delivering video using HTML 5's native support for publishing H.264 video without Flash .
The remaining problem is that two browser companies that depend upon free distribution of their software are opposed to licensing the H.264 codec .
Instead , they wanted the W3C to designate Ogg Theora as the official video codec of HTML 5 .
Ogg Theora is based upon VP3 video technology originally proprietary to On2 , and subsequently abandoned after it became obsolete .
Flash video is based on On2's VP6 , and Skype 's proprietary video conferencing uses VP7 .
In the face of interoperable standards published by the ISO , On2's proprietary codecs are increasingly in the same boat as Microsoft 's WMV / VC - 1 , without Microsoft 's remaining clout .
The open source community has embraced the obsolete VP3 , abandoned by On2 back in 2001 , as a viable alternative to today 's H.264 .
For software developers , using Ogg Theora allows them to avoid paying royalties in order to share in the patent pool contributed by MPEG 's member companies .
This has also resulted in adoption of Ogg Theora by video game developers and organizations like Wikipedia .
Ogg Theora vs. H.264
However , hardware makers like Apple and Nokia are opposed to HTML 5 being tied to Ogg Theora for a number of more practical reasons .
First , the cost of licensing H.264 is n't significant to these companies in the way it is to smaller software developers , and particularly the browser vendors who hope to distribute their software for free .
While Apple also distributes Safari for free , most of its users are buying Macs or iPhones to run it .
In contrast , Mozilla 's entire Firefox business model revolves around Google paying it around $ 50 million a year to direct search queries its way .
Larger companies like Google similarly have no cost - related preference for using Ogg Theora .
Second , since companies like Apple , Google and Nokia are already invested in H.264 , the prospect of having to support an old obsolete codec is not at all desirable .
Google has noted that there 's no way the company could serve up YouTube 's billions of streams using the much less efficient Ogg Theora codec , saying it would consume the world 's Internet bandwidth due to its less sophisticated compression .
Ogg Theora also lacks the hardware acceleration available for H.264 , making it completely unattractive for use in mobile devices from netbooks to smartphones .
Opera and Mozilla do n't make mobile hardware , so they do n't care about this .
Mozilla does n't even have a viable mobile browser .
Opera 's mobile business largely centers on Opera Mini , which is n't really a web browser but actually an applet that displays pre-rendered web pages served by Opera 's web proxy servers to less powerful phones that can't run a real browser .
All of the advanced new mobile devices use a WebKit - based browser , from Safari on the iPhone and iPod touch to the Palm Pre , BlackBerry Storm , and Google Android devices .
Apple has also voiced concerns that Ogg Theora may be encumbered by unknown patents .
That risk is n't significant to Mozilla and Opera , both of whom could simply abandon the format for something else in the same way that the web temporarily abandoned commercial support for GIF after Unisys tried to sue everyone for using it .
However , for a company like Apple that has built a business that requires selling media content and supporting hardware acceleration in mobile devices , it 's not possible to randomly drop a codec technology when a submarine patent threat appears .
Apple also has a bankroll to attract patent trolls that Mozilla and Opera both lack .
A problem that lacks any need for a solution
The real problem with the squabble over the future of HTML 5 is that the standard does n't need to specify an official codec .
There 's no official codec for graphics ; web developers can use JPEG , GIF , PNG , or any other format .
If users can't see the image , they might need to load a helper plugin .
There is no problem related to lacking an official graphics format .
The same is true with video .
In fact , despite all the outrage being trumpeted by Mozilla , there 's no reason the browser needs to license support for a video codec anyway .
If users are smart enough to download Firefox , they can also download QuickTime and watch H.264 video on Apple 's licensing dime , or they can download one of the free H.264 capable codecs available for FOSS platforms , including the GPLed x264 , the engine used by VLC , FFmpeg , and HandBrake .
Further , there 's no real reason web developers need to only serve one codec .
It 's easy in HTML 5 to offer up video as H.264 , Ogg Theora , and even as a Flash binary so that anyone can watch it .
As far as saving organizations like Wikipedia from having to license MPEG , there 's no real problem for users to download a package of open source codec components for QuickTime or their media system playback of choice that enable Ogg Theora playback on non-mobile systems .
This whole imagined war over the official video codec of HTML 5 simply a non-issue .
What is an issue is HTML 5 adoption .
In addition to promoting interoperable video , HTML 5 also enables rich application support including client side databases for fat client sophistication and offline support .
HTML 5 is designed to replace the need for a proprietary plugin like Flash or Silverlight just to present web content with sophisticated client - side interoperability .
[ digg- reddit- me ] There ’s been a lot of commentary and puzzlement in the opinionsphere about exactly how Obama is trying to sell his health care reform .
Part of the problem is that our system is messy – and Obama does not feel it is feasible to try to start anew .
So , instead , Obama is seeking to accomplish two goals with his reform : to “ bend the curve ” of overall spending on health care ; and to provide some form of health insurance to those Americans without it .
The problem is that each of these problems seem to be inherent parts of our status quo – as the health insurance industry has sought to drive down medical costs not by incentivizing cheaper effective treatments as in most industries , but by purging the sick from its coverage .
Ezra Klein describes this business model most vividly :
Private insurance is a bit like a fire department that turns a profit by letting buildings burn down .
But , as medical professionals swear an oath to provide aid to those who need it , hospital emergency rooms and the government then are forced to pick up the slack .
Thus , the health insurance model does not reduce the cost of health care but merely pushes these costs onto the rest of us .
This is at least part of the reason America pays about $ 6,500 more for health care per person – as David Leonhardt writes :
We may not be aware of this stealth $ 6,500 health care tax , but if you take a moment to think , it makes sense .
Over the last 20 years , health costs have soared , and incomes have grown painfully slowly .
The two trends are directly connected : employers had to spend more money on benefits , leaving less for raises .
In exchange for the $ 6,500 tax , we receive many things .
We get cutting - edge research and heroic surgeries .
But we also get fabulous amounts of waste — bureaucratic and medical .
One thing we do n’t get is better health than other rich countries …
This is n’t the only thing causing health care costs to rise so quickly – but it is the most obviously flawed compenent of our system and one of the drivers of the escalating costs and declining level of care .
And it is very unclear what benefits – if any – our health insurance model provides .
It is an industry which seems designed purely to create profits for a select few and disburse costs to the population at large .
Obama has done rather well in making this case – in attacking the status quo .
But the question is :
What is he offering ?
Matt Yglesias suggested , “ Health care security ” and I think that ’s about right .
Obama expressed the same idea :
Reform is about every American who has ever feared that they may lose their coverage …
At the same time , as Ezra Klein points out , most people are currently satisfied with their health care – and want more choices rather than less .
Klein suggests :
The answer , put simply , is that you do n’t institute rapid change .
You do n’t take what people have .
But you give them the option to trade up to something better .
As the theory goes , if the current system really is so inefficient , and your alternative really is so much better , then the lure of lower costs and better quality will persuade Americans to switch to the new system of their own accord .
The policies to address these issues are there – in some form in the plans being discussed .
The measures that deal with these should be strengthened .
And the positive case for health care reform should be simple , always repeated the words choice and security :

With the number of electric vehicles increasing , as a result of the fact that more people are becoming aware about the environmental issues , new ideas are generated by different talented designers who look forward to supply electric cars with clean energy .
One of such designers is Neville Mars who came up with the idea of designing a striking EV charging station which resembles an evergreen open space of solar trees .
You can find more inventions that harness solar energy here at www.InfoNIAC.com - check the links at the bottom of the story .
The photovoltaic forest has two functions : first of all solar tree harness solar energy to charge electric vehicles and secondly the shades of solar trees cover vehicles from the hot sun while they charge , reports EcoFriend .
Every solar tree features a set of photovoltaic leaves installed on poles and the base of each tree carries a power outlet .
Thus whenever a person parks a car under a solar tree they can instantly connect the vehicle to the socket to charge the car .
This is a truly inspiring idea to use a forest - like parking lot that exploits renewable energy .

IMF / WORLD BANK DESTROYING COUNTRIES
The World Bank - IMF is owned and controlled by NM Rothschild and 30 to 40 of the wealthiest people in the world .
For over 150 years they have planned to take the world over through money .
The former chief economist of the World Bank , Joe Stiglitz , was fired recently .
He pointed out to top executives that every country the IMF / World Bank got involved in ended up with a crashed economy , a destroyed government , and sometimes in flames with riots .
Jim Wolfensen , the president of the World Bank would not comment on his dismissal .
Before Joe Stiglitz was fired he took a large stack of secret documents out of the World Bank .
These secret documents from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund reveal that the IMF required nations :
1. to sign secret agreements of 111 items
2. in which they agreed to sell off their key assets - water , electric , gas , etc .
3. in which they agreed to take economic steps which are really devastating to the nations involved
4. in which they pay off the politicians billions of dollars to Swiss bank accounts to do this transfer of a countries fixed assets
If they do not agree to these steps they are cut - off from all international borrowing .
Today if can't borrow money in the international marketplace , no one can survive , whether you are people or corporations or countries .
If that does not work they overthrow the government and plant lies about the former government and / or even rewrite history .
The Argentina Plan
Inside documents from Argentina show the secret Argentine plan .
This is signed by Jim Wolfensen , the president of the World Bank .
Argentina has had six presidents in five weeks because their economy is completely destroyed .
This happened because they started out in the end of the 80s with orders from the IMF and World Bank to sell - off all their assets , public assets , like their water system .
Then they taxed the people .
They created big government and big government handed it off to the private IMF / World Bank .
They pay off the politicians billions in Swiss bank accounts .
The Enron Connection
The water system of Buenos Aires was sold off for a song to a company called Enron .
A pipeline was sold off , that runs between Argentina and Chile , was sold off to a company called Enron .
Then the globalists blow out Enron after transferring the assets to another dummy corporation . .
They come in , pay off politicians to transfer the water systems , the railways , the telephone companies , the nationalized oil companies , gas stations - the politicians then hand it over to the IMF for nothing .
The Globalists pay them off individually , billions a piece in Swiss bank accounts .
The plan is total slavery for the entire population .
Enron is a dummy corporation for money laundering , drug money , etc .
IMF Planed Riots
The IMF / World Bank are systematically tearing nations apart , whether it 's Ecuador or Argentina .
It 's not privatization .
They steal it from the people and hand it over to the IMF / World Bank .
They hand it over , generally to the cronies , like Citibank grabbed half the Argentine banks .
British Petroleum grabbed pipelines in Ecuador .
Enron grabbed water systems all over the place .
The problem is that they are destroying these systems as well .
You can't even get drinking water in Buenos Aires .
It is not just a question of the theft .
You can't turn on the tap .
It is more than someone getting rich at the public expense .
And the IMF just got handed the Great Lakes .
They have the sole control over the water supply now .
The IMF and the World Bank is 51 % owned by the United States Treasury .
Indonesia is in flames .
Every country IMF / World Bank meddling in they destroyed their economy and they ended up in flames .
They even plan in the riots .
They know that when they squeeze a country and destroy its economy , you get riots in the streets .
And they admit that it an IMF riot .
Because you have riot , all the capital runs away from your country and that gives the opportunity for the IMF to then add more conditions .
California Utilities & Enron
It is really an imperial economy war to implode countries and now they are doing it here with Enron .
They are getting so greedy - they are preparing it for America .
The chief investigators of Enron for the State of California said that that it's not just the stockholders that got ripped off .
They sucked millions , billions of dollars out of the public pocket in Texas and California in particular .
Where are the assets ?
See , everybody says there are no assets left since Enron was a dummy corporation - from the experts I 've had on and they transferred all those assets to other corporations and banks .
You did pay California 's electric bills according to the investigations , they are telling me that they were pumped up unnecessarily by 9 to 12 - billion dollars .
And I do n't know who they are going to get it back from now .
Well they actually caught the Governor buying it for $ 137 per megawatt and selling it back to Enron for $ 1 per megawatt and doing it over and over and over again .
Enron's Auditor - Lord Wakeham
The men who designed the system in California for deregulation then went to work for Enron right after .
Lord Wakeham , who was on the audit committee of Enron , is the head of NM Rothschild .
There is n't anything that he does n't have his fingers in .
He 's on something like fifty Boards .
And he was supposed to be head of the audit committee watching how Enron kept the books .
In fact , they were paying him consulting fees on the side .
He was in Margaret Thatcher 's government and he's the one who authorized Enron to come into Britain and take over power plants in Britain .
Enron owned a water system in the middle of England .
This is what Lord Wakeham approved and then they gave him a job on the board .
On top of being on the board , they gave him a huge consulting contract .
Lord Wakeham is supposed to be in charge of the audit committee to see how they were handling their accounts , but he is also the head of the board to regulate the media .
Lord Wakeham is trying to pass laws in England where you can't own your own water .
He can't be touched because he regulates the media .
Rothschild and the Illuminati
Burrow into NM
Rothschild , you 'll find it all there .
The IMF / World Bank implosion , four points , how they bring down a country and destroy the resources of the people .
First you open up the capital markets .
That is , you sell off your local banks to foreign banks .
Then you go to what 's called market - based pricing .
That 's the stuff like in California where everything is free market and you end up with water bills no one can pay .
Then open up your borders to trade - complete free marketeering .
Its like the opium wars .
This is n't free trade ; this is coercion trade .
This is war .
They are taking apart economies through this .
China has a 40 % tariff on the USA , but the USA has a 2 % on them .
That 's not free and fair trade .
It 's to force all industry into a country that the globalists fully control , and they control China .
Wal - Mart
The Illuminati owns Wal - Mart and Wal - Mart has 700 plants in China .
There is almost nothing in a Walmart store that comes from the United States of America , despite all the eagles on the wall .
They have big flags saying " Buy American " and there 's hardly anything from America in their stores .
What 's even worst is they will hire a factory and right next to it will be the sister factory which is inside a prison .
You can imagine the conditions of these workers producing this lovely stuff for Walmart .
Briberization
Sell off the water company and that 's worth , over ten years , let 's say about 5 billion dollars , ten percent of that is 500 million .
A Senator from Argentina said that he got a call from George W. Bush in 1988 saying give the gas pipeline in Argentina to Enron .
Enron was going to pay one - fifth of the world 's price for their gas and he said how can you make such an offer ?
The answer was that if they only pay one - fifth that leaves quit a little bit for you to go in your Swiss bank account .
This is the same George W. Bush who said he did n't get to know Ken Lay of Enron until 1994 .
Now they are having these white - wash hearings .
Bill Clinton , to get even with Bush 's big donor , cut Enron out of the California power market .
He put a cap on the prices they could charge .
They could n't charge more than one - hundred times the normal price for electricity .
That upset Enron .
So Ken Lay personally wrote a note to Dick Cheney saying get rid of Clinton 's cap on prices .
Within 48 hours of George W. Bush taking office , his energy department reversed the clamps on Enron .
Step Two
Argentina is an example of step two of the IMF .
A fifth of the population of Argentina is unemployed , and they said cut the unemployment benefits drastically , take away pension funds , cut the education budgets .
Now if you cut the economy in the middle of a recession ( created by the IMF ) , you absolutely demolish the nation .
You do n't start cutting the budget in a recession , you start spending money to stimulate the economy .
You do n't raise taxes , you cut them .
But they tell these countries you 've got to cut , and cut , and cut .
And why , according to the inside documents , it 's so you can make payments to foreign banks - the foreign banks are collecting 21 % to 70 % interest .
This is loan - sharking .
If fact , it was so bad that they required Argentina to get rid of the laws against loan - sharking because any bank would be a loan - shark under Argentine law .
Part 3 and Part 4 .
Bush Administration Signals End to Open Government
Christians cannot comment on Government in USA
Congress has decided to silence you , me , and any other Christian who dares express a moral view that may impact a political campaign !
The U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate have both passed a so - called " campaign finance reform " bill ... and now President Bush has said he will sign it into law !
In spite of all the propaganda in the media , this legislation actually silences Christian and conservative organizations - banning them from commenting on key moral issues during election campaigns ... while allowing the liberal media to speak out freely .
This new law is a SLAP IN THE FACE to our right to free speech .
It is absolutely , blatantly UNCONSTITUTIONAL !
* This legislation effectively strips church and conservative leaders and organizations of religious free speech during elections .
* For me or any other conservative spokesperson to comment and inform you with a Christian perspective would be illegal ... and the threat of jail a reality !
* Even your own pastor cannot inform you on key political and moral issues when it comes time to vote !
So where will you get all your information about the political and moral views of candidates ?

The Beatles are among the most influential popular music artists of the second half of the 20th century , affecting the culture of Britain and America and the postwar baby boom generation , and the entire English - speaking world , especially during the 1960s and early 1970s .
Certainly they 're the most successful , with global sales reaching past 1.2 thousand million records sold as of 2003 .
Their influences on popular culture extended far beyond their roles as recording artists , as they branched out into film and even semi-willingly became spokesmen for their generation .
The members of the group were John Lennon , Paul McCartney , George Harrison and Ringo Starr ( Richard Starkey ) , all from Liverpool , England .
The effect of the Beatles on Western culture ( and by extension ) on the rest of the world has been immeasurable .
Originally a high - energy pop band ( typified by the early singles " Twist and Shout " and " Please Please Me " ) , as the Beatles progressed their style became more sophisticated , influenced in equal measure by Bob Dylan and Chuck Berry .
Their popularity was also aided by their attractive looks , distinctive personalities , and natural charisma ; particularly on television where they appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show and others .
This was the beginning of Beatlemania in which the committed pop-music band found itself turned into a worldwide phenomenon with worshipful fans , hysterical adulation , and denunciations by others such as Frank Sinatra .
None of this had much to do with music and was regarded by the band members with intermittent awe and resentment .
History
Lennon met McCartney on July 6 , 1957 at St. Peter 's Church garden fete .
Lennon was in a skiffle group called The Quarry Men who were performing at the event .
McCartney joined the band , and brought Harrison along soon after .
In 1958 , The Quarry Men recorded a demo of two songs ; the first was an original Harrison / McCartney tune called " In spite of all the danger " ; the other was a cover of Buddy Holly 's " That 'll Be The Day " .
A number of songs that were later recorded for Beatles records , were originally written at this time including " I'll Follow The Sun " , " Michelle " , " When I 'm 64 " , and " One After 909 " .
Paul McCartney
After a brief split , the Quarry Men regrouped in 1960 as The Fabulous Silver Beetles , later shortened to The Beatles .
The name was a tribute to Buddy Holly 's band , The Crickets , combined with beat music , a common British term for rock and roll at the time .
In another tribute , they had sometimes called themselves the Foreverly Brothers .
The reformed band consisted of Lennon , McCartney and Harrison , plus Pete Best on drums and Stuart Sutcliffe on bass .
In late 1960 , they embarked upon a tour of Hamburg , West Germany , only to return to Liverpool when Harrison was deported for being under the age of 18 .
In March 1961 , the Beatles played their first gig at Liverpool 's ' Cavern Club ' before returning to the lucrative Hamburg scene with a now legal Harrison .
During their stay in Germany they were hired by Bert Kaempfert to record backing for the singer Tony Sheridan .
A single , " My Bonnie " , was released in Germany on the Polydor label in August 1961 , credited to Tony Sheridan and the Beat Boys .
It was the Beatles ' first commercial release .
In the Spring of 1961 , whilst still in Hamburg , Sutcliffe decided to leave the band in order to concentrate on his art studies .
McCartney , who had been playing guitar , replaced him on bass .
In their early days , the Beatles composed and rehearsed their songs at 20 Forthlin Road , Liverpool , the home of Paul McCartney , and now a National Trust property open to the public .
On December 10 , 1961 , Brian Epstein agreed to become the band 's manager , after receiving requests for the band 's music two months earlier in his record store and watching them perform at the Cavern Club .
Epstein arranged for the Beatles to audition for Decca Records on January 1 , 1962 .
Decca , in one of the most embarrassing business decisions in music history , rejected the band , on the grounds that guitar music was " on the way out " .
The Beatles then signed with EMI 's Parlophone label in early 1962 .
George Martin , who was at first unimpressed by the band 's demos , fell in love with the band when he met them in person .
Not only did he feel as though they had musical talent , but he felt that their wit and humor made them extremely " likeable . "
He did have a problem with Best however , whom he criticized for not be able to keep time .
The Beatles let Best go , and immediately asked Starr , whom they had met and even performed with previously , to join the band permanently .
Martin , unaware of this personnel change , hired session drummer Andy White to play drums on the Beatles ' first studio session on September 11 , 1962 .
George Harrison
The Beatles recorded their first full length album , live in the studio , on February 11 , 1963 in one 12 hour session .
On February 22 , 1963 the Beatles ' second single , " Please Please Me " went straight to No. 1 . Meet the Beatles , the first Beatles album in the United States , was released on January 20 , 1964 .
On February 7 , 1964 The Beatles travelled to New York for a number of U.S. television appearances and performances .
Upon arriving at JFK airport , The Beatles noticed thousands of kids screaming and awaiting the plane 's arrival .
They assumed that there must have been someone important on the plane with them and were a bit shocked to learn that the crowds were actually there for them .
On February 9 , 1964 The Beatles performed on The Ed Sullivan Show for the first time .
To this day it remains one of the highest rated television programs of all time , with 73 million people tuning in .
The Beatles made four more live appearances on the show in months to come .
Two days later , on February 11 in the Washington , DC Coliseum , The Beatles made their first live stage appearance in the United States .
On April 4 , 1964 , The Beatles set a record that has yet to be broken when they occupied all five top positions on Billboard 's Top Pop Singles chart ( they first appeared on Billboard on January 18th that year ) .
Their single " Ca n't Buy Me Love " was at number one .
In August of that year , The Beatles ' first motion picture was released , A Hard Day 's Night .
They started filming their second film , Help ! on February 23 , 1965 in the Bahamas .
The psychedelic years
In early 1965 , Lennon and Harrison were dosed with LSD by their dentist .
In the ensuing years , the Beatles met with psychedelic counterculture icon Timothy Leary , experimented extensively with LSD and released two heavily LSD - influenced albums , Revolver and Sgt. Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band .
On June 12 , 1965 , The Beatles were individually awarded the order of Member of the British Empire ( MBE ) by the Queen .
Since it was unusual for rock stars to receive the MBE , some previous recipients complained and protested , and a small number went so far as to return their own honours , complaining they had been " devalued " .
Lennon would return his own in 1969 with the note :
" Your Majesty , I am returning my MBE in protest against Britain 's involvement in the Nigeria - Biafra thing , against our support of America in Vietnam and against " Cold Turkey " slipping down in the Charts .
" With love ,
" John Lennon "
Ringo Starr
On August 15 , 1965 , The Beatles started their second North American tour at Shea Stadium , which was the first rock concert to be held in a venue that size .
The concert also set new world records for attendance ( 55,600 + ) and for revenue .
On March 4 , 1966 , in an interview for the London Evening Standard with Maureen Cleave , John Lennon made the following statement :
" Christianity will go .
It will vanish and shrink .
I need n't argue with that ; I 'm right and I will be proved right .
We 're more popular than Jesus now ; I do n't know which will go first - rock ' n ' roll or Christianity .
Jesus was all right but his disciples were thick and ordinary .
It 's them twisting it that ruins it for me . "
The statement , was part of a two page interview and went virtually unnoticed in Britain .
In July of that year , Lennon 's words were reprinted in the United States fan magazine Datebook leading to a backlash by conservative religious groups mainly in the rural South and Midwest states .
Radio stations banned the group 's recordings , and their albums and other products were burned and destroyed .
Spain and the Vatican denounced Lennon 's words and South Africa banned Beatles music from the radio .
On August 11 , 1966 Lennon held a press conference in Chicago in order to address the growing furor .
On June 5 , 1966 , The Beatles returned to The Ed Sullivan Show , this time with a taped appearance , where they introduced their two new music videos , " Rain " and " Paperback Writer " .
In later years , The Beatles would appear on the show to introduce more music videos for the songs " Hello Goodbye " , " Penny Lane " , " Strawberry Fields Forever " , " Two Of Us " , and " Let It Be " .
On July 2 , 1966 , The Beatles became the first musical group to perform at the Nippon Budokan Hall in Tokyo .
The performance ignited a lot of protest from local citizens who felt that it was inappropriate for a rock and roll band to play at Budokan .
By the end of July , the band headed to the Philippines for a series of shows .
The Beatles , while relaxing in their hotel room , read in the newspaper that they would visit the Malacanang Palace of President Ferdinand Marcos .
This came as news to the Beatles , who were tired from the tour and did n't plan on using their one day off to visit the President .
They spent a relaxing evening in the hotel , and awoke the next morning to death threats and newspaper headlines like " Imelda stood up ! " and " The Beatles snub the First Lady ! " .
Epstein attempted to make a televised apology for the incident , but none of the local stations would air it .
The following day , armed guards attempted to keep the band from leaving the country until they paid a fee of some kind .
The Beatles , who had n't been paid for their shows in the country , paid out of their own pockets .
The Beatles literally had to fight their way to the airplane .
Decades later with the fall of the Marcos regime , the members of the band took some pride that they stood up to the Marcos ' in some small way .
Events like in the Phillipines , added to the fact that the fans screamed so loud at their concerts that they could n't even hear themselves perform , led to the band deciding to quit touring altogether .
The band performed their last concert ( at least on a large scale ) at San Francisco 's Candlestick Park on August 29 , 1966 .
The Studio Years
With the distractions of touring behind them , The Beatles began recording Sgt. Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band on November 24 , 1966 .
The album took so much time to record ( for a Beatles record anyway ) that the press started to suggest that the Beatles had " lost it " and had run out of creativity .
Three early tracks , " Strawberry Fields Forever " , " Penny Lane " , and " Only A Northern Song " , were left out of the " Sgt. Pepper " LP but saved for later albums , the latter song becoming part of the " Yellow Submarine " film .
Nonetheless , " Sgt. Pepper " 's release on June 2 , 1967 , was a high point both for the band and for all of rock music , for it was the first - ever concept album ( built around a particular theme ) and helped to launch what we know today as the " Classic Rock " format .
On June 25 , 1967 The Beatles performed " All You Need Is Love " for the Our World television special .
It was the first television special to air worldwide .
Singing backup for the Beatles were a number of artists including Eric Clapton , and members of the Rolling Stones and The Who .
Manager Brian Epstein died of a drug overdose on August 27 , 1967 , while the Beatles were in Bangor , Wales , attending a weekend conference given by the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi .
The death was officially ruled accidental , although it has often been speculated that it was a suicide .
Epstein had managed every aspect of the Beatles ' career , and his absence was immediately noticeable .
The Beatles ' business affairs began to unravel .
In January 1968 , The Beatles launched Apple Corps. , a disastrously mismanaged entertainment company that included a recording studio , a record label ( Apple Records ) , a film division and clothing store .
In addition to Beatles records , Apple released albums by James Taylor , Mary Hopkin , Billy Preston , Badfinger , Ravi Shankar and other artists .
Towards the end of the 1960s , members of the band began to pursue their own musical interests and were writing together less and less .
This became more and more obvious on releases like 1968's The Beatles ( a.k.a . " The White Album " ) , and Let It Be .
The Beatles was largely written during the band 's visit to India , where they had several meetings with the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi .
With the exception of Harrison , the Beatles eventually rejected what they were hearing from The Maharishi - even occasionally writing songs that made fun of him ( like " Sexy Sadie " , originally titled " Maharishi " , and a number of unreleased songs from the Let It Be sessions ) .
In January of 1969 , The Beatles began rehearsals for a new album project ( at the time entitled Get Back ) .
The rehearsals at Twickenham Film Studios and recording sessions at Apple Studios were filmed for what would eventually become the Let It Be movie .
Many ideas had been thrown around for the Get Back album , including the idea of recording it live during a surprise concert performance on top of a submarine , in an amphitheatre , or in a dance hall .
None of these happened , but they did end the project with a live performance on top of the Apple Corps .
building in London , which was cut short when a local bank manager called the police to complain about the noise .
This impromptu concert , held on January 30 , 1969 , was to be the Beatles ' last public performance .
Eventually the band gave up on the project and turned the results of the sessions over to producer Phil Spector .
The Beatles professed themselves happy with Spector 's re-working of the recordings to make a releasable album ; Paul McCartney later indicated he was not happy because Spector had added things like an orchestra and a choir to the stripped - down performances ( although he signed the release authorisation at the time ) .
The original intent of the record had been to bring the band full circle , and record what was essentially a live studio performance - just as their first album had been .
The Beatles began recording their final album in July of 1969 , entitled Abbey Road which proved to be a relatively smooth and peaceful production of the acclaimed album .
Lennon announced to the other Beatles that he was leaving the band soon after that album 's release but was persuaded to remain quiet in public .
In September of 1969 , Russell Gibb , a radio DJ in Detroit , Michigan , announced that Paul McCartney was dead .
Other DJs , television news reporters , newspapers and magazines picked up on the story and began to look for clues .
This snowballed into what is commonly referred to today as the Paul Is Dead hoax .
People that believed the rumors , claimed that McCartney had died in a car accident and was replaced by a look - alike named William Campbell .
Numerous clues were supposedly hidden in album artwork , lyrics , and recordings themselves ( fans even went so far as to play Beatles records backwards -- for instance , the words " number nine , number nine " on the song " Revolution # 9 " on The Beatles ( a.k.a .
" The White Album " ) became " turn me on , dead man , turn me on , dead man " when played counterclockwise ) .
Another key clue apparently was the cover of the album Abbey Road in which Paul held a cigarette with his right hand , indicating his becoming reduced to ashes .
Paul is left handed .
The entire details behind the hoax could fill several volumes of Beatles biographies .
The band officially broke up in 1970 .
The last Beatles studio session that included all four band members took place on August 20 , 1969 .
The song they worked on had an ironic title ... " The End " .
The final Beatles session was on January 4 , 1970 .
EMI released Let It Be in May of 1970 , and the film of the same name shortly after ( for the main purpose of fulfilling the group 's contract with United Artists ) .
After the Breakup
On December 8 , 1980 , John Lennon was murdered in front of his New York City apartment by a mentally deranged fan , Mark David Chapman , thus forever crushing any hope of a Beatles reunion .
His death was mourned by millions of fans around the world .
Singer Michael Jackson bought the publishing rights for most of the Beatles ' music , on August 10 , 1985 , for $ 47 million .
McCartney , who had been attempting to purchase the rights himself , had told Jackson that he should get into publishing .
McCartney did not expect Jackson to purchase the Beatles music .
" I wrote a couple of letters and I said , Michael , do n't you think that - even if I was just a writer on the payroll - after 30 years of being reasonably successful to this company that you now own , do n't you think I could have a raise ? " said McCartney .
" And he said ' Oh Paul , that 's just business ' .
He wo n't even answer my letters , so we have n't talked and we do n't have that great a relationship .
The trouble is I wrote those songs for nothing and buying them back at these phenomenal sums ... I just ca n't do it . "
This is an example of how future royalties of an entertainment work are difficult to value and how creators should be cautious in making business decisions .
In 1988 , The Beatles were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame .
Both Lennon and McCartney were also inducted separately in later years .
On November 30 , 1994 , Apple Records released a 2 CD collection of early Beatles performances on the BBC , entitled Live At The BBC .
In February of 1994 , the three surviving Beatles reunited to produce and record additional music to a few of Lennon 's old unfinished demos , with Jeff Lynne co-producing .
The first new song , " Free As A Bird " , premiered November 19 , 1995 as part of The Beatles Anthology series of television specials on the ABC network in the US and ITV in the UK .
The song was also included on a CD with the same title , which was released on November 21 , 1995 .
The following year , a second " new " track was released , entitled " Real Love " , on March 4 , 1996 .
That song was also included on the second Anthology collection which was released on March 18 , 1996 .
A third Anthology collection followed on October 12 , 1996 , but did not include any new material .
At least one other song , entitled " Now And Then " , was worked on during these sessions , but remains unreleased .
In 2000 , The Beatles released a best of collection , entitled " 1 " .
The CD included 27 number one hits by the band and , within five weeks , became the best selling album of the year .
Later that year , The Beatles released the Anthology book , which included interviews with all four band members and others involved , plus rare photos .
The book went straight to the top of the New York Times bestsellers list .
George Harrison fought a long battle with lung and brain cancer throughout the 1990s , finally succumbing and passing away on November 29 , 2001 .
In 2002 , the Let It Be film was being restored and prepared for release on DVD sometime in 2004 .
It is expected that the DVD will include additional footage , not seen in the original film .
The album Let It Be ...
Naked , featuring stripped - down ( but intended ) versions of the original album , was released in November , 2003 .
In January , 2003 , following an investigation by The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry and London detectives , police raids in England and the Netherlands recovered nearly 500 original Beatles studio tapes , recorded during the Let It Be sessions .
Five people were arrested .
The tapes have been used for bootleg releases for years .
In March , 2003 , the Anthology television series was released on DVD with additional bonus material .
Several individuals who played an important role in the history or promotion of the band have at various times been called , or called themselves , the " fifth Beatle " .
The following individuals were real members of the band before the Beatles achieved international success :
* Pete Best -
Their drummer before being replaced by Ringo Starr .
* Stuart Sutcliffe - A bassist ( apparently very shy ) who left the group in Hamburg for the love of Astrid Kirchherr and died from a brain hemorrhage on April 10 , 1962 .
His life , and his friendship with John Lennon , was fictionalized in the 1993 movie Backbeat .
* Chas Newby - bassist in Germany , 1960 .
Left the band to return to college .
* Tommy Moore - drummer for the Silver Beetles for one month in 1960 .
Quit the band , claiming to have had " just about enough of Lennon " .
* Norman Chapman - drummer for the Silver Beetles for a few weeks in 1960 .
Left when conscripted into the Army for two years service in Kenya and Kuwait .
The following individuals have played a role in the studio when Beatles records were recorded :
* George Martin -
Their producer , who translated their musical ideas into studio productions , and also did some piano work on , for example " In My Life "
* Jeff Lynne - co-producer for The Beatles Anthology and 1994 -1995 sessions
* Geoff Emerick - studio engineer
* Mal Evans - roadie and assistant
* Neil Aspinall - assistant , road manager
* Andy White - drummer on the Beatles ' first single , " Love Me Do "
* Billy Preston - Organist on " Let It Be " , electric piano player on " Get Back " and " Do n't Let Me Down " , first met them in their Hamburg days while touring with Little Richard
* Eric Clapton - Lead guitarist on " While My Guitar Gently Weeps "
* Alan Civil - French horn soloist on " For No One "
* David Mason - piccolo trumpet soloist on " Penny Lane "
Others have been associated with the Beatles in several ways .
These include :
* Allan Williams - original manager
* Brian Epstein -
The manager who took them from Hamburg to the world stage
* Tony Barrow - press officer 1963 - 1968
* Derek Taylor - assistant to Brian Epstein , press officer 1968 - 1971
* Alf Bicknell - Chauffeur until 1966 , body guard
* Murray the K - A disc jockey in New York , the first to claim to be the fifth Beatle
* Dick James - publisher
* Magic Alex - head of Apple electronics
* Klaus Voormann - German bassist and artist ; a friend of Stu Sutcliffe 's girlfriend Astrid Kirchherr member of the Plastic Ono Band , drew the cover for Revolver .
* Jimmy Nicol - temporary drummer on the Beatles ' 1964 overseas tour
* Roy Orbison -
In 1963 the American rock and roll star headlined a European tour with the Beatles .
Recognizing their unique sound and extraordinary talent , and the reaction of the crowds to their performances , Orbison was instrumental in encouraging the fledgling group to come to the United States .
Studio Style Evolution
By 1966 the influence of the peace movement , psychedelic drugs and the studio technique of producer George Martin resulted in the albums Revolver and Sgt. Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band , still widely regarded as classics .
Particularly notable , along with the use of studio tricks such as sound processing , unconventional microphone placements , and vari-speed recording , was the Beatles ' use of unconventional instruments for pop music , including string and brass elements , Indian instruments such as the sitar , and early electronic instruments .
At the height of their fame in the mid-sixties , bolstered by the two films Help ! and A Hard Day 's Night , the band discontinued touring .
The increasingly sophisticated arrangements of their songs were difficult to perform in front of thousands of screaming fans who typically made such noise that the music could not be heard anyway .
By then , the stress of their fame was beginning to tell and the band was on the verge of splitting at the time of the release of The Beatles ( the " white album " ) , with some tracks recorded by the band members individually , and Starr taking a two - week holiday in the middle of the recording session .
By 1970 the band had split , with each of the members going on to solo careers with varying degrees of success .
In the Movies
The Beatles also had a limited film career , beginning with A Hard Day 's Night ( 1964 ) .
Directed by the up and coming American Richard Lester , it was a gritty black - and - white documentary - like account of a short period in the life of a rock - and - roll band .
In 1965 came Help ! , a Technicolor extravaganza shot in exotic locations with a thin , if not almost transparent plot regarding Ringo 's finger !
The critically slammed Magical Mystery Tour ( the concept of which was adapted from Ken Kesey 's Merry Pranksters LSD - orientated bus tour of the USA ) was aired on British television in 1967 , but is now considered a cult classic .
The animated Yellow Submarine followed shortly after , but had little input from the Beatles themselves .
The voices of the characters in the movie were not those of the Beatles .
However , the real Beatles appeared in a live - action epilogue at the film 's conclusion .
They also contributed five new songs for the film , including a holdover from the " Sgt. Pepper " sessions , " Only A Northern Song " .
Nonetheless , it was acclaimed for its boldly innovative graphic style and clever humour as well as the soundtrack .
It did much to restore the reputation of the group for appearing in superior film musicals .
Finally , the documentary of a band in terminal decline , Let It Be was shot over an extended period in 1969 ; the music from this formed the album of the same name , which although recorded before Abbey Road , was ( after much contractual to - ing and fro-ing ) their final release .
Achievements
Throughout their relatively short time recording and performing together , The Beatles set a number of world records - most of which have yet to be broken .
The following is a partial list .
* The Beatles are the best selling musical group of all time , estimated by EMI to be over one billion discs and tapes sold worldwide .
* The most multi-platinum selling albums for any artist or musical group ( 13 in the U.S. alone )
* The Beatles have had more number one singles than any other artist or musical group ( 22 in the U.S. , 23 in Australia , 23 in Holland , 22 in Canada , 21 in Norway , 18 in Sweden ) .
Ironically , the Beatles could easily have had even more number ones , because they were often competing with their own singles .
For example , The Beatles ' " Penny Lane " and " Strawberry Fields Forever " were released as a " double A " sided single , which caused sales and airplay to be divided between the two songs instead of being counted collectively .
Even so , they reached number two with the singles .
* The Beatles have had more number one albums than any other act ( 19 in the U.S. , 15 in the U.K. )
* The Beatles spent the highest number of weeks at number one in the albums chart ( 132 in the U.S. and 174 in the U.K. )
* The most successful first week of sales for a double album ( The Beatles Anthology Volume 1 ) , which sold 855,473 copies in the U.S. from November 21 to November 28 , 1995 ) .
* In terms of charting positions , Lennon and McCartney are the most successful songwriters in history , with 32 number one singles in the U.S. for McCartney , and 26 for Lennon ( 23 of which were written together ) .
Lennon was responsible for 29 number one singles in the U.K. , and McCartney was responsible for 28 ( 25 of which were written together ) .
* During the week of April 4 , 1964 , The Beatles held the top 5 positions on the Billboard singles chart .
No one had ever done anything like this before , and it is doubtful that the conditions will ever exist for anyone to do it again .
The songs were " Ca n't Buy Me Love " , " Twist and Shout " , " She Loves You " , " I Want to Hold Your Hand " , and " Please Please Me " .
* The next week , April 11 , 1964 , the Beatles held 14 positions on the Billboard Hot 100 .
Before the Beatles , the highest number of concurrent singles by one artist on the Hot 100 was nine ( by Elvis Presley , December 19 , 1956 ) .
* The Beatles are the only artist to have back - to - back - to - back number one singles on Billboard 's Hot 100 .
Boyz II Men and Elvis Presley have succeeded themselves on the chart , but the Beatles are the only artist to three - peat .
* The Beatles ' " Yesterday " is the most covered song in history , appearing in the Guinness Book of Records with over 3000 recorded versions .
* The Beatles had the fastest selling single of all time with " I Want To Hold Your Hand " .
The song sold 250,000 units within 3 days in the U.S. , one million in 2 weeks .
( 10,000 copies per hour in New York City alone for the first 20 days )
* The Beatles have the fastest selling CD of all time with " 1 " .
It sold over 13 million copies in 4 weeks .
* The largest number of advance orders for a single , at 2.1 million copies in the U.S. for " Ca n't Buy Me Love " ( it sold 940,225 copies on its first day of release in the U.S. alone )
* " Sgt. Pepper`s Lonely Hearts Club Band " is the best selling album of all time in the U.K. ( over 4.5 million copies sold )
* With their performance at Shea Stadium in 1965 , The Beatles set new world records for concert attendance ( 55,600 + ) and revenue .
* The Beatles broke television ratings records in the U.S. with their first appearance on the Ed Sullivan show .
* On June 12 , 1965 , The Beatles were awarded the order of Member of the British Empire ( MBE ) by the Queen .
* On July 2 , 1966 , The Beatles became the first musical group to perform at the Nippon Budokan Hall in Tokyo .
The Music
Unlike their contemporaries the Rolling Stones , the Beatles were seldom directly influenced by blues .
Though they drew inspiration from an eclectic variety of sources , their home idiom was closer to pop music .
Chuck Berry was perhaps the most fundamental progenitor of the Beatles ' sound , the Beatles covered " Roll Over Beethoven " and " Rock And Roll Music " early in their carrers on record ( with most other Berry classics heard in their live repetoire ) .
Chuck Berry 's influence is also heard , in an altered form , in later songs such as " Everybody 's Got Something to Hide Except Me And My Monkey " ( 1968 ) and " Come Together " ( 1969 ) .
A significant and acknowledged musical influence was the Beach Boys , who were in turn spurred on by the work of the Beatles .
The song Back in the USSR contains an overt allusion to the Beach Boys , but many other songs exhibit the kind of attention to vocal harmony for which the Beach Boys are also famous .
Individually , the four Beatles drew further inspiration from different sources .
John Lennon 's early style owed a huge debt to Buddy Holly and Roy Orbison ( " Misery " 1963 and " Please Please Me " from 1963 ) .
After becoming acquainted with the work of Bob Dylan , Lennon became influenced heavily by folk music ( " You 've Got To Hide Your Love Away " and " Norwegian Wood " from 1965 ) .
Lennon played the major role in steering the group toward psychedelia ( " Strawberry Fields Forever " and " I Am The Walrus " 1967 ) , and renewed his interest in earlier rock forms at the close of the Beatles ' career ( " Do n't Let Me Down " 1969 ) .
Paul McCartney is perhaps best known as the groups romantic balladeer , beginning with " Yesterday " ( 1965 ) he pioneered a modern form of art song , exemplified by " Eleanor Rigby " ( 1966 ) and " She 's Leaving Home " ( 1967 ) .
Meanwhile , Paul maintained an affection for the driving R&B of Little Richard , in a series of songs which John Lennon dubbed " potboilers " , from " I Saw Her Standing There " ( 1963 ) to " Lady Madonna " ( 1968 ) .
" Helter Skelter " ( 1968 ) , which is the closest the Beatles ever came to heavy metal music , is a McCartney composition .
George Harrison derived his early guitar style from 1950's rockabilly greats such as Carl Perkins , Scotty Moore ( who worked with Elvis Presley ) , and Duane Eddy .
" All My Loving " ( 1963 ) and " She 's A Woman " ( 1964 ) are prime examples of Harrison 's early rockabilly guitar work .
In 1965 , George Harrison broke new ground by recording with an Indian sitar on " Norwegian Wood " .
Many of his following compositions were based on Indian forms , most notably " Love to You " ( 1966 ) , " Within You , Without You " ( 1967 ) , and " The Inner Light " ( 1968 ) .
Indian music also influenced the band as a whole , with the use of swirling tape loops , droning bass lines , and mantra - like vocals on " Tomorrow Never Knows " ( 1966 ) and " Dear Prudence " ( 1968 ) .
George returned to Western musical forms in his later compositions , where he emerged as a significant pop composer in his own right .
His later guitar style , while not displaying the virtuosity of Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton , became distinctive with its use of clear melodic lines and subtle fills ( " Something " , " Let It Be " ( 1969 ) ) in contrast to the increasingly distorted riffs and rapid fire guitar solo work of his contemporaries .
Ringo Starr 's contributions to the Beatles ' sound are widely underestimated .
While he is mostly appreciated for his gentle comic baritone ( " Yellow Submarine " ( 1966 ) ) , steady drumming , and everyman image , he was likely responsible for the group 's occasional interest in surprisingly authentic country sounds ( " What Goes On " ( 1965 ) , " Do n't Pass Me By " ( 1968 ) ) .
In their later music the pace of the songs tends to be moderate , with more of the interest usually ( but not always ) coming from the melody and the orchestration than the rhythm .
Penny Lane ( 1967 ) is a good example of this style ; it is a song you might emulate if you wanted to create a recognizably " Beatlesque " sound .
Their earlier songs were often a bit faster paced .
Throughout their career , their songs were rarely riff - driven .
" Day Tripper " ( 1965 ) and " Hey Bulldog " ( 1968 ) are among the exceptions .
Song Influences
As stated above , a lot of Beatles songs had some psychedelia in them ( " Yellow Submarine " , " Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds " , " I am the Walrus " from 1967 ) but these also link to The Goon Show and the work of Lewis Carroll and Edward Lear .
Both " Penny Lane " and " Strawberry Field (s ) " are places in Liverpool , but the song In My Life ( 1965 ) also invokes such ideas .
The song " Being For the Benefit of Mr Kite " ( 1967 ) is based on a Music Hall poster and the song " All Together Now " ( 1968 ) is based around children 's rhymes .
A handful of Beatles ' songs both musically and lyrically border on the dadaist or absurd ( " Everybody 's Got Something To Hide Except Me and My Monkey " , " You Know My Name ( Look Up The Number ) " , and " Why Don't We Do It In The Road " , from 1968 ) .
While romantic themes permeate the Beatles ' work , in contrast to the Rolling Stones , The Who , and The Doors , songs with overtly sexual themes are rare in the Beatles catalogue .
" Norwegian Wood " very obliquely refers to sexual infidelity , and " Lovely Rita " ( 1967 ) alludes to casual sex .
" Happiness is a Warm Gun " ( 1968 ) is a rare Beatles ' song that deals with erotic imagery .
The " Ballad Of John and Yoko " ( 1969 ) also raised some eyebrows with a sexual pun ( " were only trying to get us some peace " ) , as well as the use of Christ as an expletive in the chorus .

DEAR PRUDENCE
The Beatles song _Dear Prudence_ MP3 was written for Mia Farrow 's sister , Prudence .
When the Beatles were at a spritiual retreat in India , they were playing around with Mia .
Her sister would n't come out and play with them .
Hence , " Dear Prudence , wo n't you come out to play ? "

_Sgt. Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band_ ( 1967 )
Paul McCartney listened to composer Karlheinz Stockhausen , a messiah in the world of electronic music but to the mid-60s pop star an unknown commodity .
It was the German 's 1956 ' plick - plop ' piece t - _ Gesang der Junglinge_ , a boy 's voice construed and converted with a panoply of electronic sounds , that inspired McCartney to utilize his Brennell tape recorders for less conventional purposes , as Stockhausen himself had done the previous decade .
McCartney , an advocate of all things melodious , had undergone a reformation of thought , no longer subscribing to the ingrained belief that rhythm , time signatures and even melody were essential .
[...]
The Beatles ' musical language expanded incredibly in their consummate masterpiece , _Sgt. Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band_ ( Parlophone : June 1 , 1967 ) .
The album was a potpourri of rock ' n ' roll , Western classical music , Indian classical music , early 20th - century vaudeville music , and modern electronic music employing compositional techniques such as indeterminacy and playing tapes backwards , as pioneered by the composer Karlheinz Stockhausen whose photo appeared on the album cover along with a host of other celebrities .

The Wailers have often been called the " Jamaican Beatles " throughout the 60's and the 70's .
The comparison does n't end here as they also covered two Beatles songs .
The earliest one is _ And I Love Her_ MP3 , released in 1965 , originally on the Beatles ' _A Hard Day 's Night_ LP from 1964 .
Bob Marley sings lead on that track , but it is Peter who sings on the other Beatles rendition , this time a cover of _ Here Comes The Sun_ MP3 released in 1971 .
The original version can be found on the Beatles ' _ Abbey Road_ album from 1969 .
REPORTER : I 'd like to direct this question to messrs .
Lennon and McCartney .
In a recent article , _Time_ magazine put down pop music .
And they referred to _Day Tripper_ as being about a prostitute ...
PAUL : Oh yeah .
REPORTER : ... and _Norwegian Wood_ as being about a lesbian .
PAUL : Oh yeah .
REPORTER : I just wanted to know what your intent was when you wrote it , and what your feeling is about the _Time_ magazine criticism of the music that is being written today .
PAUL : We were just trying to write songs about prostitutes and lesbians , that 's all .
" Christianity will go , " he said .
" It will vanish and shrink .
I need n't argue about that ; I 'm right and I will be proved right .
We 're more popular than Jesus now .
I do n't know which will go first -- rock ' n ' roll or Christianity .
Jesus was all right , but his disciples were thick and ordinary .
It 's them twisting it that ruins it for me . "

When I find myself in times of trouble
Hybrid children come to me
Pray for father roaming — roaming free
And in my hour of darkness
It is standing right in front of me
He is the thing that should not let it be
Let it be , let it be
Hybrid children watch the sea
He is the thing that should not let it be
Crawling chaos underground people
Living in the world agree
The wretch is fearless with insanity
And though he has been sleeping
There is still a chance that he will see
That this thing should not let it be
Not dead which eternal lie
With stranger eons death may die
These are words of wisdom — let it be
I wake up to the sound of music
Let the metal come to me
Death to the one that will not let it be

Chron.com 's Anna -Megan Raley had a posting last week dealing with what five changes you would make to baseball were you to become the commissioner .
Then she lists the changes that would be made by Roy Oswalt , and Oswalt provided a somewhat decent list : decrease interdivisional matchups , shorten spring training , dump the DH , stop awarding home - field advantage in the World Series on the basis of who wins the All - Star Game , and improve the World Baseball Classic .
But me being me , and me loving baseball and hoping someday to grow up and become the commissioner , I thought I would give this list a crack .
So here are the five changes I would make if I were to become the MLB Commissioner .
1 . The most valuable asset for each team is its players .
So no more idiotic things like hills , flagpoles in play , unpadded walls , and stands / walls that jut out at weird angles for no purpose other than it looks cool on television .
Because of age , Wrigley Field and Fenway Park are grandfathered in , but every other stadium , including Minute Maid Park , must come into compliance .
MLB will even supply a bulldozer to Drayton McLane if Oswalt refuses to loan his out .
Some of the more uneducated fans , like McLane , may not like this , but are these stupid things really worth an injury to a player that does n't have to happen ?
2. MLB and Fox have been concerned for several years over the ratings of the All Star Game and the ratings of the World Series .
Thus interleague play will be eliminated so that the All Star Game will actually be meaningful again .
That should also hopefully bring back a little meaning to the World Series .
This , in turn , should help improve television ratings .
3 . Home field advantage for the World Series will no longer be determined by who wins the All Star Game .
Instead I 've got an idea that is going to blow the minds of everybody associated with baseball management : home field advantage goes to the team to finish with the best regular season record .
I know , that 's kind of strange sounding , but I think it might just work .
4 . The rules regarding the allowable time between pitches will be enforced .
There are several reasons behind this move .
It will speed up the game .
It will mean less time for Fox 's patented Andy Pettitte nostril shot .
It give Fox less time to pimp its awful programming with those candid shots of the star of Fox 's soon - to - be - newest flop who just happens to be sitting in the front row right behind the dugout .
This will also provide less time for Milo Hamilton to go off on some tangent about his lunch .
5 . And I 'm enforcing this by caveat .
No ballpark combo should cost more than what is being charged for a combo at James Coney Island .
If a fan can get two chili and cheese Coneys with fries and a soft drink for no more than about eight bucks , including tax , then that fan should not have to pay nearly twenty bucks for the same thing at the ballpark .
And if a fan can get a 20 - ounce Coke for $ 1.50 at the convenience stand a couple of blocks from the stadium , then that fan should not have to pay nearly five bucks for the same thing at the stadium .
The same goes for the costs of bottled water , beer , and every other item that is sold at an outrageously jacked - up price at the ballpark .

No list of theories of causes of the financial crisis that almost destroyed the fabric of the world economy ( as opposed to the slow - motion disaster unfolding now ) would be complete without listing hubris , that most Greek - mythical of faults .
Hubris clearly is n’t the only reason .
There was greed – we all know that .
There were various incentives that distorted the system as a whole .
There was an enormous imbalance between East Asian countries and America that assisted in producing unmooring our financial industry .
There was government intervention .
There was a shift in the animal spirits .
There was a profound miscalculation of risk .
There were assets bubbles , Goldman Sachs , deregulation , new financial instruments , and a subservience of politics to finance .
But how can one explain how far out on this limb all of these venerable institutions went – how they thought they would be able to leverage themselves 33 to 1 – how they took on so much risk they almost brought down the financial system built over centuries in a week .
Bankers did n’t take to calling themselves “ Masters of the Universe ” because they were being ironic .
No – at the heart of this crisis – and reasserting itself now as they try to restore “ normalcy ” to their profession – was hubris .
Michael Lewis – who worked on Wall Street as a young man – described this hubris brilliantly in an essay published in the immediate aftermath of the financial collapse for Portfolio .
He described how countless warning signs were ignored – because the money and the success had gone to the heads of these titans of Wall Street .
( He steers away from the more high profile Cassandras from Nassim Nicholas Taleb to Nouriel Roubini to Brooksley Born . )
After all , how had they gotten so much money if they did n’t know what they were doing ?
Lewis , unable to make that “ logical ” leap himself , had left Wall Street in the late 1980s , expecting the whole house of cards to fall at any moment :
To this day , the willingness of a Wall Street investment bank to pay me hundreds of thousands of dollars to dispense investment advice to grownups remains a mystery to me .
I was 24 years old , with no experience of , or particular interest in , guessing which stocks and bonds would rise and which would fall .
The essential function of Wall Street is to allocate capital — to decide who should get it and who should not .
Believe me when I tell you that I had n’t the first clue …
In [ the past two decades ] , I had been waiting for the end of Wall Street .
The outrageous bonuses , the slender returns to shareholders , the never - ending scandals , the bursting of the internet bubble , the crisis following the collapse of Long - Term Capital Management :
Over and over again , the big Wall Street investment banks would be , in some narrow way , discredited .
Yet they just kept on growing , along with the sums of money that they doled out to 26 - year - olds to perform tasks of no obvious social utility .
The rebellion by American youth against the money culture never happened .
Why bother to overturn your parents ’ world when you can buy it , slice it up into tranches , and sell off the pieces ?
At some point , I gave up waiting for the end .
There was no scandal or reversal , I assumed , that could sink the system .
Michael Osninski – who wrote programs creating derivatives – explained his rationalization for why he was able to make so much money :
[ E]ven then , I was wondering why I was making more than anyone in my family , maybe as much as all my siblings combined .
Hey , I had higher SAT scores .
I could do all the arithmetic in my head .
I was very good at programming a computer .
And that computer , with my software , touched billions of dollars of the firm ’s money .
Every week .
That justified it .
When you ’re close to the money , you get the first cut .
Oyster farmers eat lots of oysters , do n’t they ?
Everyone seeks to claim credit for the successes that they benefit from – so , as the money flowed into Wall Street and all together people who did n’t quite understand what they were doing worked together and together inflated the prices of assets they did n’t know enough about to value – everyone got rich .
Contributing to this sense of unreality – and this hubris – was the culture that grew up around these people .
They learned how to manipulate the programs written by the lowly programmers that created derivratives and other complex assets – and created a language that was opaque to those outside the club – of super senior risk , of CDS , CMS , and sundry other financial products .
They sealed off their world from outside inspection , blocked regulation at every turn – and came to believe they understood the system .
Though many must have understood their ignorance going in – as Lewis did – their success washed away their concerns .
A gambler does n’t need to know how roulette works if everyone who is playing the game is winning .
But hubris always leads to a downfall – and so , in the fall of 2008 2009 , the house of cards created by these “ Masters of the Universe ” collapsed – and with it , the life savings of millions who trusted the brash bankers .
In the end it seems , no rational analysis or argumentation could convince these titans of Wall Street that their success was based on luck rather than knowledge or skill .
And they ignored or marginalized who demonstrated otherwise – until it was too late .
Too many seemed to have believed their own hype .
It was as if they truly thought they were “ Masters of the Universe . ”
And now that the financial system has gotten back on its feet – and as the rest of the economy is still suffering – this hubris , which seemed to have fallen with the stock market , has reinflated .
As a top Goldman Sachs official said commenting on the high levels of risk the firm was taking on – and the best - ever profits they were generating from that :
Our model really never changed , we ’ve said very consistently that our business model remained the same .
The near - collapse of the financial industry is apparently no match for the hubris of bankers .

The Compassionate Use of Medical Cannabis Pilot Program Act ( SB 1381 ) had passed the Senate 30 - 28 last week and soared through the House Human Services Committee .
It was waiting for a final reading and a vote on the House floor over the weekend , but tax legislation took top priority .
Sen . William Haine , D - Alton , who sponsored the bill in the Senate , keeps a positive outlook regarding the bill 's chances when legislative sessions resume .
" It was dramatic that the bill got out of the Senate , " Haine said .
" We had a busy spring .
This bill was one of hundreds .
It had one of the highest profiles because it surrounded the whole debate on drugs and marijuana and came with a lot of baggage . "
Still , Haine says medical evidence bodes well for patients and advocates and remains steadfast on his conviction that his restrictions will keep abuse from being a problem , any more than other prescription drugs are abused .
" Many of these questions were asked on the floor , about the potential for abuse , " he said .
Haine spoke out against misinformation that marijuana is not a helpful drug or that this legislation will contribute to marijuana abuse .
" I have full confidence that the men and women at police departments around the state can enforce this without any trouble whatsoever , " he said .
" The 30 senators who voted for it voted for it in spite of similar comments around the state , ( which are ) based on fear .
The scientific evidence is many doctors find it good for patients . "
Haine said that the break between now and a possible vote in November ( during a veto session ) or January ( when the General Assembly reconvenes ) will mean more time to think on the issue .
He encourages members of the Senate to contact doctors to learn more about it from a medical perspective .
Jamie Clayton , a longtime AIDS patient living in Grafton , said now is the time for education .
" We 've got to keep it on people 's minds and we 've got to talk about it , " he said .
" I would hate to just stop .
I think it 's going to be important that we focus on this during the summer .
Maybe now 's the time we need to look into education . "
Clayton said he is disheartened that some people still are n't pulling for options for patients like himself , who are in severe pain or are dying from diseases like AIDS or cancer .
" We 're fighting for our lives , " he said .
" I should have died in 1996 but I did n't ; I 'm still here .
We 're not giving up and we 're not going away . "

Writing a Technical Book
IronPython in Action with Manning Publications
Stating the obvious IronPython in Action is a book on the Microsoft open source implementation of Python for Mono and the .NET framework .
It is written by Michael Foord and Christian Muirhead .
It covers application development , scripting and embedding IronPython in .NET applications - with chapters on WPF , Silverlight / Moonlight development and a Python tutorial .
Christian and I are both experienced Python programmers who have been developing full time with IronPython for Resolver Systems since about IronPython version 0.7 .
Introduction
Any day now I will get the first quarter sales figures for IronPython in Action .
That will mark the book having been actually in the hands of readers for three months and also be about two and a half years since I first contacted Manning about the possibility of writing an IronPython book for them .
As I always suspected , in retrospect I greatly enjoyed the process and challenge of writing a book .
It has however left me with a strong suspicion that the three laws of optimizing code can be neatly modified for technical book writing : Do n't No really : do n't
If you absolutely have to , go read the contract section at the end of this article
How it all started I started working with IronPython in 2006 when I joined Resolver Systems .
As IronPython was still very new ( version 0.6 or 0.7 ) there were very few people within the Python community using it seriously so I started to write a tutorial series .
I enjoy writing , and there were no books on IronPython so I decided to see if a publisher would be interested .
I have a contact who works with O'Reilly and got in touch with them .
Having reviewed ( and been impressed by ) a few Manning books I also contacted them .
After initial discussion O'Reilly never came back to me - so it gave me some satisfaction to later hear of them hawking around the IronPython mailing list trying to find someone to write a book for them .
My original idea was to write a book on IronPython and Windows Forms as that was what I was spending most of time working on ; but Manning wanted a much more general book on developing with IronPython that would fit into their " in Action " series .
I first exchanged emails with Mike Stephens in June 2006 .
Over a period of six months I worked through turning a vague idea into a full book proposal .
Writing a Manning proposal is a lot of work , including writing a complete table of contents down to the sections and sub-sections .
Early on whilst writing the proposal I roped my colleague Christian Muirhead in .
I was to write thirteen of the fifteen chapters whilst he was to handle the two chapters on ASP.
NET and databases and webservices .
An overview We finally started writing in the backend of December 2006 .
The book was complete , including index , front matter and all the edits , in January 2009 .
It was in the shops for people to buy in early April 2009 .
That 's a long time .
Perhaps the main reason it took so long is that I was working full time throughout , with a 2 hour commute in each direction .
If I was lucky and got a seat on the train then about an hour of that I could work on the book but getting a 3G modem with internet connection put paid to using the time productively ...
( Eventually my pattern became that I would work late into the night and then use the time on the train to catch up on my sleep . )
Because of working for Resolver Systems the time I had for the book was after returning home and weekends .
Often in the week I would get home after 8 pm and between eating , dealing with essential email ( and essential RSS feeds ) and being exhausted I would get maybe a couple of hours an evening to work on the book .
Inevitably my most productive times were the weekends .
IronPython in Action swallowed most of my weekends for the better part of two years .
There were various reasons why it took so long .
Some of these are down to me , some unavoidable due to unforeseen events like the release of IronPython 2 and Silverlight , and some due to the Manning processes .
Writing a book , particularly one on a hot new technology , has an inevitable tension between wanting to get the book to market as quickly ( and therefore as cheaply - man hours on the editing cost bucks ) and producing as high quality a book as possible .
Some publishers manage to get books out very quickly , and often it shows .
In the brave new online world perhaps this is the right way to go - it used to be possible to earn a living from writing technical books alone , but very few people do that now .
In March 2009 I was at PyCon 2009 .
Although the book was complete it was not quite out yet , we missed PyCon by a couple of weeks .
I mentioned to Guido ( yes I 'm a fanboy ) that I 'd finished writing the IronPython book .
On hearing that it was for Manning he made the telling comment that they had a reputation for taking a long time to actually get books published .
Although things did n't go perfectly with Manning I think we could only realistically have completed the book six months faster .
This would have got us in time for the Christmas 2008 market , so it 's a real shame that we did n't , but even so I am convinced that the tortuous process Manning puts its authors through does result in a higher quality book .
I 'm proud of what we 've achieved with IronPython in Action - it is a fantastic book , and the we includes the whole team of folk from Manning who were involved .
As Christian and I wrote in the acknowledgements : " Writing this book has been a labor of love for the past two years .
One thing that has astonished us is the sheer number of people involved in such an endeavor and how many individuals have helped us . "
What follows is a look at the process I went through , including some necessarily negative comments .
Please bear in mind that my overall impression is still positive and that much of what I say was specific to IronPython in Action and not what every author for Manning will experience .
The Process After the proposal comes the writing .
With Manning the writing is divided into various stages .
From memory it goes something like : Write a chapter
Editor reviews the chapter and makes comments - the author responds to the comments making changes where necessary
When a third of the book is complete the manuscript so far goes out to review ; by a bunch of folk that Manning have found and a bunch of people who the author finds
As their reviews come in the author makes any changes necessary in response
When the whole book is complete it goes through a technical review from an appropriate expert
The book then goes through copy-editing and typesetting
Proof - reading
Completing front matter and indexing Technical review , copy - editing and proof - reading all involve changes that the author (s ) must check and respond to .
All changes / questions / comments from the editor , technical reviewer and copy - editor are done using the Word change tracking system .
Change tracking is where Word shines .
All the changes must be individually accepted or rejected by the author and the comments responded to .
This can be arduous but it does leave the author in control - all changes are just suggestions and it is up to the author which to accept and which to reject .
During the early stages every completed chapter is made available to readers ( who pay ) through the early access program .
Feedback from the author 's forum during this time is also folded back in to the book .
The manuscript is managed through Manning 's web application called Gregor which is a big document management system .
Not too painful to use but Gregor is written in Java and it shows ...
Bumps in the Road Version Control
To manage the writing process I created a private subversion repository that Christian and I had access to .
All the documents , images and source code were managed there .
This worked great for us .
Once the book was completed I moved the source code to a public repository : IronPython on Google Code .
The first bump in the road was the Manning template system .
Whilst I was writing IronPython in Action the manuscript was to be done as Word documents using a custom template for styles and one document per chapter .
I did try opening some chapters in Open Office but it was n't a pretty sight I 'm afraid .
The Manning style guide is a small book in itself and after completing the first draft of chapter 1 my editor of the time ( I switched editors around chapter 3 ) pointed out a style rule I had n't applied .
After applying the rule he then came back and pointed out another one .
This went round in circles for a while until he was finally ready to review the chapter .
It took a month from me first completing the draft to it actually getting reviewed .
The second bump was a big one .
Before the first third of the book ( part 1 ) was complete I had a conversation with Marjan Bace , the Manning head honcho , which really threw a spanner in the works .
The first part of the book , or at least the chapters after the introductions to Python and .NET , were focussed around the example Windows Forms application that I had originally envisioned being the backbone of the book .
He worried that the book was too example focussed and needed to be driven by the principles rather than the code .
Of course he was right , and going back and rewriting / reorganising three chapters greatly improved the final result .
It cost nearly two months of time and it would have been much nicer to have fixed this during the proposal phase rather than after having written a huge chunk of the book .
Another bump in the road was the Word templates that Manning use for their styles .
First of all Word uses fixed locations for the templates , meaning that opening a chapter on a new machine would break the template .
Even worse , at some stage during the writing I switched first my laptop and then my home desktop from a Windows box to a Mac.
Mac Office 2008 is actually a very capable application which I prefer to the Windows version of Microsoft Office .
Although Manning has a template for Mac Office it was for a version prior to 2008 - and Office 2008 lacks VBA scripting support .
The Manning template has custom support for indexing ( etc ) implemented in VB .
Whether it is a bug in Office 2008 or a side - effect of the Manning template I found that actually doing the indexing on the Mac would crash every few entries .
Infuriatingly frustrating and a massive productivity killer .
Another delay was entirely my own fault .
After every third of the book it goes to external reviewers .
Although mutually contradictory they came up with a lot of useful comments on the book as it progressed .
Each time it would take about a month from the review copies going out to all of the reviews coming in .
Instead of using that time to plough ahead on the next chapters I mainly used it to catch up on my blogging ...
My bad .
These delays probably cost us two months .
IronPython 2 and Silverlight .
Halfway through the book Microsoft announced IronPython 2 , the Dynamic Language Runtime and Silverlight .
I had to go back and reorganise - losing one of the introductory chapters and adding a chapter on Silverlight .
Chunks of the introduction needed rewriting and lots of other places updating .
Worse , IronPython 2 and the Silverlight version with DLR support were only in alpha and whilst writing I had to track changes from Silverlight 1.1 through to Silverlight 2 RTW and from IronPython 2 alpha to IronPython 2 final .
API changes , particularly in the embedding API meant frequent changes to examples .
Thankfully in the Silverlight chapter the changes usually meant removing ugly workarounds for bugs in the pre-release versions .
On the other hand if I 'd been much quicker with the getting the book out it would have out of date within days ...
The book was basically finished around August 2008 .
All chapters were complete and it had been through the final third review .
At this time my editor was telling me that we were on track for being in the shops in November .
We started working through the myriad next stages , albeit slowly .
I kept asking if we were still on track for a November release until in October , despite the assurances of my editor , it became obvious it just was n't going to happen .
It turned out that Manning had a bit of a schedule collision and did n't have the capacity in copy - editing / layout to get the book the attention it needed .
This delay cost us another three months .
The final delay was minor but annoying .
The Manning instructions for producing print ready images are fairly lengthy and I just could n't get Open Office Draw to export the diagrams correctly in an acceptable format .
As I 'd specifically stated up front that I would n't have anything to do with typesetting and layout I finally gave up and insisted that they produce print ready images .
Manning found someone in their typesetting department who was willing to install Open Office and things moved more swiftly .
Was it worth it ?
There are some positives to writing a book :
The money .
Our advance was $ 5000 split 80/20 between Christian and myself .
If the book pays off the advance we will make more on royalties .
Based on the amount of time we put into the book this works out at something slightly below slave labour rates .
Never write a technical book for the money .
No really .
Spend your evenings in McDonalds if you need extra cash .
A different set of people will read the material than if I had put it up for free on the web .
It was a challenge .
I 've never written a single work of this length before and I like a challenge .
Without the pressure and commitment of a contract I would never have produced the comprehensive guide to developing with IronPython that IronPython in Action became .
Taking on and completing a task of this size is very satisfying .
I learned an enormous amount , particularly through the editing process .
My writing has improved a great deal .
I enjoy IronPython and I think Python is a fantastic programming language .
I want Python to be more accessible and I enjoy sharing things I know .
Writing a book on IronPython seemed to be a good way of achieving these things whilst putting something back into the communities that have given me so much .
It looks bloody good on your CV and brings recognition as being an expert in the field ...
If points three , four and five ( suitably modified of course ) on this list are n't your main reason for wanting to write a book then I would n't bother .
There are several negatives of course :
The money is terrible .
Less people will read my work than if I had put it on the web .
Some of my articles are read by tens of thousands of people in a year .
Even the less popular ones are read by thousands .
I 'll consider myself lucky if the book is read by ten thousand people in total .
The counterbalance to this is that people will buy and read the book who would never read it if it was on the web .
Those who do read it will probably read at least a significant chunk of it whereas if it was on the web many people would only read individual pages or perhaps chapters .
It is a considerable amount of effort .
A lot .
I entered it with no preconceived idea of how long it would take and a determination to complete .
This is a mindset I can recommend .
The ideal ( at least to my mind ) is to have the book available for free on the web under a decent free license ( preferably Creative Commons ) as well as being published .
There are plenty of precedents for this ;
Dive into Python , A Byte of Python , The Django Book , anything by Cory Doctorow to name a few .
If I do write another book ( and despite my misgivings I have a couple of really good ideas ) I will probably pre-empt this by making as much of the book as possible available online before approaching a publisher and make keeping it free a contract term .
I do n't believe this would hurt sales .
Quite the opposite : obscurity is a greater enemy than giving away your stuff .
What I learned at school today
Here are some of the things I learned or should have learned .
Most of these I guess I will have to relearn if I ever put myself through it again :
The most important thing I learned was do n't sweat the small stuff .
This warrants repeating .
Do n't sweat the small stuff .
Many times
I knew the gist of what I wanted to say in a passage but could n't find the words .
I would go round and round over a single sentence for fifteen minutes or more .
This happened a lot .
I learned to just write something and then come back to it later .
Often what I had been unhappy about when writing read fine when I came back to it the next day .
If I was really stuck I would just leave a placeholder ( like XXXX or something easy to search for ) and come back to it another time .
Letting yourself get stuck drags out the writing process and makes it mentally exhausting .
Far better to just write what you have and move on ; you 're going to be going back over it later anyway .
I can learn anything .
This is a lesson I 've had to learn many times throughout my programming .
For several of the chapters or sections , for example the Silverlight and WPF chapters , the subject matter was completely new to me ( when Silverlight came out it was new to everyone of course ) .
That feeling of being out of your depth when you start a new topic is now familiar to me and I do n't let it worry me ; given time I can learn anything .
Some of the subjects I had to learn I had the familiar completely - out - of - my - depth - and - do n't - know - where - to - start feeling .
This was particularly true when trying to negotiate the relationship between XPS and the FlowDocument classes .
As usual a combination of research and just - giving - up - and - writing - some - damn - code won through .
It is this feeling , and in particular this time spent , that technical books can circumvent for their readers .
We do the research so that you do n't have to .
There will always be mistakes , both typos and technical errors .
The book went through umpteen stages of review , editing , corrections and changes .
Of course whilst every change may correct a mistake it is also an opportunity to introduce new mistakes .
So far the errata I have collected have been very minor , thanks largely to the number of review stages and some helpful folk who assiduously reported every typo and ambiguity they found during through the early access program .
Get a co-writer , or two , if you possibly can .
Even though Christian only wrote two of the chapters and one of the appendices it made a huge difference having someone to share the burden .
Having someone write half the book would have been much more sensible .
A good technical editor makes a huge difference .
My gratitude and thanks to Jeff Bleiel for his input , questions and suggestions .
The editor is there to help you - to explore ideas and possibilities .
It is perfectly acceptable to say no to those suggestions and it is important to keep your own voice .
I had one big conflict with Manning which I eventually gave in on - my only big regret .
Although the book has two authors the parts written by me and the parts written by Christian are clearly delimited .
My natural style is to use ' we ' to refer to me and the reader , and to use I when speaking of myself .
For example I would talk about how we are about to investigate a new subject .
For books with more than one author Manning prefer to stick to ' you ' for the reader and ' we ' for the authors .
This is less conversational and also a fiction as no single part of the book was written by a ' we ' ...
Consistency is important , and it is n't a big deal , but it would have been more true to my own voice to have insisted on my style .
Presentation is important .
The copy -editing ( and applying the dreaded Manning styles consistently to the manuscript ) made a massive difference .
What Christian and I had produced actually looked like a professional book after copy -editing .
Be principle driven rather than example driven .
Focus on the principles that code illuminates and not the code itself .
This applies to the structure of the chapters as well as the content .
You do n't need to include the full code of every example you work through , particularly if you are incrementally building something .
Instead make the full examples available for download and explain that the code shown is incomplete .
Some readers prefer every code example to be fully executable on its own , but for any non-trivial example showing it in full will double the amount of code shown .
It also repeats the same boilerplate and buries the important part of the code .
Some people will complain , but it is still better to only include in the book the code you need to illustrate the points you are explaining .
Create your examples using a test driven approach or be extremely disciplined about testing .
When you refactor or change your examples having comprehensive automated tests makes it less painful .
I did n't do this and regretted it several times .
The ideal is to keep your examples in separate files and test directly from them .
This does n't play well with using Word documents for the Manuscript .
Word and code examples are just a bad match anyway .
Manning are fixing this and switching to a DocBook based XML , including a way of including sections of external files as code examples .
There will be some markup for styling , but even hand - crafting XML will be less painful than fighting Word styles .
Omit unnecessary words .
Omit unnecessary words .
Words used for emphasis are usually superfluous ; very , actually , basically - I 'm talking to you .
Whenever you use ' it ' or ' this ' to refer to a concept it is possible that the subject is ambiguous .
Many occurrences of ' it ' should be replaced with the subject they refer to ; repetition is better than ambiguity .
Omit unnecessary punctuation .
Quotes and exclamation marks should be used sparingly .
Parentheses should be used sparingly , a rule I frequently break .
Dashes to break sentences should be rarely used .
I am terrible in my use of commas and semicolons .
I cause pain to non-native ( and some native ) readers of English .
I have improved a bit , but still do n't see the problem in many cases .
sigh
This is one area where copy - editing was particularly important .
The big up - front design employed by Manning for sketching out the book section by section , their proposal process , really did n't work for me .
The overall structure chapter headings and some of the section headings were useful , but the detail changed so much in the process of writing that much of the initial effort creating a detailed proposal was a waste of time .
Next time I would detail maybe one chapter and only outline the structure of the rest of the book .
YMMV .
Having a completed book under my belt will make it easier to elicit a second contract even if I refuse to jump through all the preliminary hoops next time ...
Some people like extensive footnotes , some do n't .
You can't please everyone .
Some people prefer real - world application sized examples and some people prefer recipe style examples .
With a decent sized book you can please everyone .
I found that the hardest parts are the introductions and the conclusions .
This makes the start of the book horrible to write .
Manning have a foreword not written by the author , followed by ' about this book ' , ' introduction ' , ' part 1 introduction ' , ' chapter 1 introduction ' .
That 's four introductions in a row .
Creating the index sucks big time .
Having someone who knows the subject ( i.e. the authors ) create the index is important if it is to be relevant ; but it is such a mind - numbingly painful process that I 'm not convinced it is much better than an automated attempt .
The publisher wo n't do much marketing for you .
Podcasts , interviews and reviews will be your marketing lifeblood once the book is published .
Having a book website helps .
A website also has the advantage that you can link to the book at Amazon , or directly with the publisher using affiliate links .
If people buy the book through your affiliate links it can almost double the amount you make on that sale ...
The Manning Early Access Program ( other publishers have an equivalent ) where the unedited early chapters are available to readers who buy the book , was invaluable .
Early feedback and typo corrections are the two big benefits .
Your early reviewers wo n't be able to help themselves but complain about grammar and punctuation even if asked not to .
Grammar and punctuation are mainly fixed in copy - editing , which is one of the last stages - so it is n't the feedback you want from your early stage reviewers .
Your reviewers will contradict each other wildly of course .
Pick out the comments they agree on or the ones that particularly strike a chord .
The technical review , which with Manning is a separate stage to the other reviews , is also invaluable .
We were extremely lucky to get Dino Veihland ( core IronPython developer ) as the technical reviewer .
I did n't agree with all the comments and changes he suggested , but it was all helpful .
After the book is finally published the only indication you have of how well it is selling is watching the Amazon rankings like a hawk .
It gets boring after a few weeks , but you can pay a small amount of money to Rank Tracer and have them monitor it for you - or you could hack up some scripts .
I have read two different blog entries from authors ( links long lost to the vagaries of the web I 'm afraid ) , one saying that a good technical book should hover around the 20 000 rank and the other saying that a good technical book should hover around the 100 000 rank .
After three months IronPython in Action is still hovering somewhere between the two .
It is hard not to feel competitive about other books on the same subject , even if rationally you know you should n't ...
White Sandals
White sandals are excellent for people that are living in areas that get extremely hot , based on the fact that the color white does not absorb a ton of heat .
If you happen to be living in an area that gets a huge amount of heat , such as areas that go into the triple digits frequently , it would make a lot of sense to really think about the color of the sandals you are considering purchasing .
It would not be a wise decision to go with black sandals , or any other color that is going to be very dark , as dark colors absorb a ton of heat .
This is not something you are going to want to be dealing with if you step into your sandals and find that they are scalding hot .
Many times people bring their sandals to the beach with them and put them on to walk across the scorching sand .
If you have brought black sandals with you , you might be in for some trouble , so it may be a good idea to simply get yourself some nice white sandals .
When it comes to buying white sandals , there are a ton of options .
A lot of people like white sandals that are split at the toe , although there are also a great deal of individuals who get blisters from these types of white sandals .
This is going to happen in most cases if you have not been wearing white sandals for a while , but if you plan on wearing your white sandals for the rest of the year , or for a long period of time , it may be worth it .
There are also sandals that have a strap going over the foot , which are really comfortable for kicking back and relaxing in the home as well .

Switch and bait
As I mentioned previously on this blog , I had a somewhat unfortunate experience a few months back .
I was working in my office , when a work - study knocked on my door with a brand new MacBook Pro , which he told me had been sent over from my school ’s technology program .
I was nonplussed , and told him that he must be wrong , that I had n’t ordered one etc , but he insisted , and indeed my name was on his work - order form .
So I finally acquiesced , on the grounds of gift - horses , and the wisdom of not inquiring too closely into the dental conditions thereof , and unpacked it .
2 hours later , I was completely hooked – more rational and altogether nicer than my Windows box , while much smoother than my Ubuntu installation .
I would have wanted to take it home and marry it , if I was n’t married already .
3 hours later , I discovered that of course it had been a mistake , and that it was in fact intended for a colleague with a vaguely similar name ( the person preparing the work order had not unreasonably gotten confused ) .
And I had to give it back .
Hence my proposal ( copyright Henry Farrell 2009 , but if Apple want it , they can have it in return for a rolling program of hardware replacement to be negotiated ) for a new TV ad series , building off of the classic series from the early 2000s , and entitled ( in honor thereof ) Bait and Switch .
Deliver Apple computers to a number of unsuspecting Windows users , selected from various advertising friendly demographics .
Give them a few days to get used to their new machines .
Then tell them that it is a mistake , and that they will have to give them back and return to Windows .
And film their reactions , consternation , refusal etc .
I imagine it would make for great television ( perhaps I am speaking from the zeal of the new convert ) .
Second , and more seriously , having been bait - and - switched myself , I have finally taken the plunge and bought a MacBook Pro for the new book that I hope to start writing .
Good software recommendations and general tips are gratefully appreciated .
I already know about ( and have bought ) TextMate , and plugged in MultiMarkdown thanks to Kieran ’s earlier tutelage ( he was the first person I emailed when I thought I had been given a new Apple free , gratis and for nothing ) .
I ’m also probably getting Scrivener , for aforementioned project .
But any other recommendations for productivity software etc would be gratefully appreciated .
Israel ’s housing minister called for strict segregation between the country ’s Jewish and Arab populations last week as he unveiled plans to move large numbers of fundamentalist religious Jews to Israel ’s north to prevent what he described as an “ Arab takeover ” of the region .
Ariel Atias said he considered it a “ national mission ” to bring ultra-Orthodox Jews — or Haredim , distinctive for their formal black and white clothing — into Arab areas , and announced that he would also create the north ’s first exclusively Haredi town .
The new settlement drive , according to Atias , is intended to revive previous failed efforts by the state to “ Judaize , ” or create a Jewish majority in , the country ’s heavily Arab north .
Analysts say the announcement is a disturbing indication that the Haredim , who have traditionally been hostile to Zionism because of their strict reading of the Bible , are rapidly being recruited to the Judaization project in both Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories ( OPT ) .
Atias , of the ultra-Orthodox party Shas , is drawing on a model already successfully developed over the past decade in the West Bank , where the Haredim , the group with the highest birth rate in Israel , have been encouraged to move into separate settlements that have rapidly eaten into large chunks of Palestinian territory .
Several mayors of northern cities in Israel have appealed to Atias to help them “ save ” the Jewishness of their communities in a similar manner by recruiting Haredim to swell the numbers of Jews in the north .
Atias revealed his new drive on Thursday as he spoke at an Israeli Bar Association conference in Tel Aviv to discuss land reform plans .
He told the delegates : “ We can all be bleeding hearts , but I think it is unsuitable [ for Jews and Arabs ] to live together . ”
His priority , he said , was to prevent the “ spread ” of Arab citizens , who comprise one - fifth of the country ’s population and are mostly restricted to their own overcrowded communities in two northern regions , the Galilee and Wadi Ara .
Referring to the Galilee , where Arab citizens are a small majority of the population , he said : “ If we go on like we have until now , we will lose the Galilee .
Populations that should not mix are spreading there . ”
Atias also revealed that mayors of several northern cities where Arab citizens had started to move into Jewish neighborhoods had asked him how they could “ salvage ” their cities .
One , Shimon Lankry , the mayor of Acre , where there were inter-communal clashes last year , met with the minister only last week .
“ He told me , ‘ Bring a bunch of Haredim and we ’ll save the city , ’ ” Atias said .
“ He told me that Arabs are living in Jewish buildings and running them [ Jews ] out . ”
The Haredim have a birth rate — estimated at eight children per woman — that is twice that of the Muslim population and are increasingly seen as a useful demographic weapon to stop the erosion of Israel ’s Jewish majority .
Atias ’s comments brought swift condemnation from Israel ’s Arab lawmakers .
Mohammad Barakeh , the head of the Communist Party , told the popular Israeli website Ynet : “ Racism is spreading throughout the government and Minister Atias is the latest to express it . ”
The key initiative proposed by Atias is the development of a large Haredi town of 20,000 homes based on an existing small community at Harish in the Wadi Ara , a region close to the West Bank .
Harish was established in the early 1990s by the housing minister of the time , Ariel Sharon , as part of a huge settlement drive inside both Israel and the OPT .
Harish and a dozen communities known as “ star points ” were built on the Green Line — the pre-1967 border between Israel and the West Bank — as a way to erode its political significance .
Most of the communities , however , were located in densely - populated Arab areas and failed to attract Israelis .
Until recently the settler population had spurned settling in Israel and has been drawn instead either to Palestinian areas close to Jerusalem or to frontier communities deep in the West Bank .
Cesar Yehudkin of Bimkom , a group of Israeli town planners critical of government planning policy , said the goal of Harish was to occupy a large swathe of land in Wadi Ara to prevent the “ natural growth ” of Arab localities .
“ Harish is an attractive option for rapid development because the infrastructure for a large town is already in place , ” he said .
Atias told Israel ’s Bar Association that Harish was a vital way to stop “ illegal Arab expansion ” and that the Haredim “ are the only ones willing to live there . ”
The Israeli media revealed two weeks ago similar plans by Shimon Gapso , the mayor of Upper Nazareth , a Jewish town established 50 years ago in the Galilee region to restrict the growth of the neighboring Arab city of Nazareth .
He announced that 3,000 homes are to be built next year for the Haredim to increase Jewish dominance of the city , which has seen a steady migration of Arabs from Nazareth and its surrounding villages desperate for a place to live .
Tight planning restrictions on Arab communities mean that there are few places for Arab citizens to build legally and they are excluded from hundreds of Jewish rural communities through vetting committees , Yehudkin said .
Gapso , who is identified with the Yisrael Beiteinu Party of the foreign minister , Avigdor Lieberman , has complained about the “ demographic threat ” posed by Arabs moving into Upper Nazareth .
He recently told the Israeli media : “ As a man of Greater Israel , I think it more important to settle the Galilee than Judea and Samaria [ the West Bank ] … I urge the settlers to come here . ”
Some 600 ultra-Orthodox families have already signed up to live in the new Upper Nazareth neighborhood , which has the backing of Eli Yishai , the interior minister and leader of Shas .
In a related Judaization drive , Nefesh B’Nefesh , one of the main organizations bringing Jewish immigrants to Israel , announced in December a program to offer financial incentives to new immigrants to settle in northern Israel .

A version of this article originally appeared in The National , published in Abu Dhabi .
Gordon Brown faced another fierce attack from a minister who quit government today as he prepared for a showdown with his own MPs .
Jane Kennedy said she was not re-appointed as an environment minister because she refused to give a pledge of loyalty to the Prime Minister .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
She said she told him in a " frank and honest " phone call this morning " I could not offer him the support he was asking for " .
And she hit out at " smears " of colleagues by people associated with No 10 .
She added that if Mr Brown stayed on to the bitter end it would spell " the bitter end of the Labour Party " .
Outside her constituency office in Liverpool , Ms Kennedy said : " He did not re-appoint me .
My view was I was sacked .
His view is that I resigned .
In the end it was my choice to go . "
Mr Brown 's spokesman flatly denied the premier had asked her , or any other minister , for a loyalty pledge as another day of Whitehall drama unfolded .
Tonight Mr Brown was due to address a meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party at the Commons , with Labour MPs reeling from disastrous European Parliament election results .
It was their worst electoral showing for nearly 100 years after finishing third in vote share behind the Tories and Ukip .
MPs were also dismayed that the far - right BNP gained two MEPs .
With all the results from 11 regions across the UK in , Labour had managed just 15.8 per cent of the popular vote to Ukip 's 16.5 per cent .

The Tories topped the poll with 27.4 per cent of the popular vote , the Liberal Democrats finished fourth with 13.8 per cent .
Despite victories in the North West and Yorkshire , the BNP had a smaller share of the vote than the Greens , with 6.2 per cent to their 8.6 per cent .
Today 's results are Labour 's worst in a nationwide poll since the 1910 general election , when their leader was George Nicoll Barnes and their vote share was just 7 per cent .
Mr Brown completed an unremarkable reshuffle of ministers of state before attending tonight 's meeting of Labour MPs .
Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman insisted : " I do actually think that Gordon Brown and the Government have got the best strategy for helping the economy through these difficult times , and I know people are blazing angry with us at the moment .
" They told us to our face but they want us to do better , they want us to sort out the economy and they want us to sort out what they regard as the aberration of expenses . "
But former lord chancellor Lord Falconer - the most senior figure so far to break cover - repeated his call for a new leader to re-unify the party .
" I think unity will only come with a leader that the mainstream votes for , " he said .
Birkenhead MP Frank Field repeated his calls for Mr Brown to go , saying : Labour cannot win with the present Prime Minister .
" I was one of the seven who would not support his coronation after Tony Blair was shoehorned out of Number 10 .
But even I did n't think a Brown administration would be as inept as this one . "
There will be particular dismay that Labour 's vote has fallen so far that it opened the door for the BNP to take seats in Yorkshire and the Humber and in the North West , where the party 's leader Nick Griffin was elected .
Health Secretary Andy Burnham said it was " deeply uncomfortable " to see the BNP polling in such large numbers .
He said they had been the beneficiaries of an " anti-politics mood " which hit all the main parties in the wake of the MPs ' expenses scandal .
" It is a sad moment in British politics , " he said .
Speaking as he arrived at an international trade conference in London , Business Secretary Lord Mandelson said : " I think what 's interesting about these results is Labour voters have not switched en masse to the Conservatives , Liberal Democrats or other parties .
" In the main , what they seem to be doing is registering a protest by withholding their vote and staying at home .
" I can understand why they 're doing this .
" They are furious about the MPs ' expenses and allowances at Westminster and , frankly , they 're furious , too , about what they see as disunity amongst Labour MPs at Westminster .
" It is simply not possible for people to say ' I resign today , but you should vote Labour tomorrow or the day after ' . "
The Tories topped the popular vote in Wales for the first time , and leader David Cameron headed to the principality to congratulate party workers .
Mr Cameron , speaking outside his home in west London , said : " I am very pleased with these results .
Together with the local elections , I think they show an enormous gap opening up between Labour and Conservative - almost getting twice as many votes as Labour last night .
" Now what we need is obvious , the next election should be a general election , and just as Labour has lost the trust of the British people , I want the Conservative Party to work hard to win that trust .
" Just as Labour has failed , we have to work hard to show how we can succeed . "
He added : " One of the reasons we want a general election is that the British public are angry that they are being locked out of passing judgment on this whole expenses scandal .
The longer we put off an election , the greater that anger will be . "
Ukip leader Nigel Farage brushed off suggestions that his own party 's second place was a result of Labour 's unpopularity rather than voter enthusiasm for Ukip .
Mr Farage told BBC Radio 4's Today programme : " According to all the experts , this is the second fluke in a row that we have produced . "
Senior Liberal Democrat Simon
Hughes said his party had held its ground while there had been a " significant loss " for Labour .
WASHINGTON  Congressional Republicans are finding much to dislike in Democratic health care proposals , illustrating the immense difficulty Democrats face in fashioning an overhaul that can attract enough Republican support to be portrayed as bipartisan .
Republicans ’ primary objection is the Democrats ’ push for a public health insurance plan that would serve as an alternative to private coverage .
Republicans say such a plan would cause the private insurance market to unravel .
There is also the potential 10 - year price tag of $ 1 trillion or more for the overhaul , coupled with the prospect of new taxes or fees to offset the cost .
And Republicans see elements of the Democratic plans as government intrusion into personal health care decision making .
Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio , the House Republican leader , said he was unaware of any House Republican inclined to support the Democrats ’ proposed legislation .
Oh , how the mighty Madoffs have fallen .
Fresh off getting booted from her huge Upper East Side penthouse , the wife of Ponzi - scheme king Bernard Madoff is eyeing a bland new apartment that ’s tiny — very tiny — in comparison to their old digs .
Read More on Ruth Madoff in Gimme Shelter
Ruth ’s real - estate broker recently took a look at a cozy little condo for sale in The Trafalgar House , a 15 - story building at 120 E. 90th St. , sources told The Post .
The only unit listed for sale there is a one - bedroom , one - bathroom that takes up just 481 square feet — 3,529 square feet less than her former four - bedroom duplex atop 133 E. 64th St. , which federal authorities seized July 2 .
The fixer - upper is in serious need of renovations .
The hardwood floors are crying out to be refinished and repaired , the ceiling is missing large chunks of plaster , the walls are scuffed , the paint is peeling paint , and the cramped kitchen features orange linoleum on the floor and yellow Formica counters .
And the view from the window is mostly of the back of a neighboring building .
But on the bright side , the price is a lot less than the $ 7 million or more Ruth ’s old apartment could fetch when it ’s sold off by the government to help pay back some of the thousands of investors from whom her husband swindled $ 65 billion .
The Trafalgar apartment has an asking price of a mere $ 465,000 .
Taxes and common charges would total just $ 779 per month .
That ’s certainly affordable for Ruth , 68 , who was left with just $ 2.5 million after cutting a deal with the feds to surrender all her other assets just before Bernie , 71 , was sentenced to 150 years in prison .
“ All that ’s needed is a little TLC to transform the apartment into a lovely living space , ” says the Web site of the listing company , Trump Sales and Leasing .
Trafalgar residents were less than enthusiastic after hearing Ruth may be moving in .
“ Oh , my God , that would be so horrible , ” one resident was overheard saying .
“ We do n’t want that tension in here . ”
Although she apparently will not be prosecuted in connection with her hubby ’s heinous fraud , Ruth has become a pariah since Bernard ’s arrest .
In recent weeks , a number of Upper East Side buildings have refused to accept her as a resident , given her notoriety .
And on June 30 — two days before she vacated her penthouse — US Marshals seized her $ 3 million Montauk , LI , house as part of her asset - forfeiture agreement .
Ruth ’s lawyer , Peter Chavkin , scoffed when asked about her interest in buying an apartment in The Trafalgar .
“ Given her economic circumstances , it ’s completely ridiculous to even suggest that she would be looking to buy something , ” he said .

3 Reasons Why Murdering an Abortion Doctor Isnâ€™t Being Called â€ œTerrorismâ€ 
Dr. George Tiller , one of the few late - term abortion providers in the country , was murdered inside his church on Sunday , and the only suspect is Scott Roeder , a man The New York Times said â€œhad professed an anti-government , anti-abortion philosophy .â€ U.S. Attorney General Eric
Holder called the murder an â€œabhorrent act of violence , â€  but he hasnâ€™t used the word â€œterrorism .â€ 
Not once .
Why ?
As a bit of context , if youâ€™re new to this website , the FBI labels the animal rights and environmental movements as the â€œnumber one domestic terrorism threat ” even though those activists have never harmed a human being .
At the very worst , underground groups like the Animal Liberation Front and Earth Liberation Front have released animals from fur farms , destroyed SUVs and set fire to empty buildings .
When animal rights activists or environmental activists are arrested , though , the government immediately sends out press releases and holds press conferences trumpeting the arrest of â€œeco - terroristsâ€  and â€œdomestic terrorists.â€ 
So it ’s pretty startling that government has n’t used the T - word , considering that weâ€™re talking about murder , and , as James Ridgeway notes over at Mother Jones , Roeder was also arrested in 1996 with ammunition , gunpowder , a blasting cap , and a fuse chord in his car .
He was sentenced to two years of supervised probation .
( By contrast , the SHAC 7 received years in prison for running a website ) .
What gives ?
Why hasnâ€™t the murder of an abortion provider been labeled â€œterrorismâ€ ?

Blackwater may owe the government more than $ 55 million — and one restaurant - quality deep fat fryer .
According to a federal audit reviewing the private security firm ’s work in Iraq , Blackwater failed to meet the terms of contracts worth more than $ 800 million .
The audit , released on Monday , found that the company ( which recently renamed itself Xe ) regularly came up short on the staffing requirements outlined in two of its State Department task orders , issued under the multibillion dollar Worldwide Personal Protective Services ( WPPS ) contract .
For instance , the audit notes , the firm did n’t supply enough personal security specialists for 16 of 19 months under a task order to provide guards in Baghdad and Ramadi — meaning that visiting dignitaries and other officials under the firm ’s watch were potentially underprotected .
“ The contract states that all positions must be filled 100 percent of the time and that Blackwater is to be assessed deductions when this level is not maintained , ” the audit , a joint effort by the State Department ’s Inspector General and the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction , notes .
Though Blackwater ’s “ muster sheets ” — schedules showing the number of personnel available for duty — ” indicated that Blackwater did not provide the required manning for protection details in accordance with the contract terms , ” the State Department failed to invoke a contract provision that would have penalized the company for failing to maintain the agreed upon staffing levels .
In the WPPS contract , the State Department pointed out that understaffing on high - threat protection contracts had proved a “ major problem ” in the past .
And the agency included a clause in the contract to discourage this from happening again .
“ If manning falls below a minimum or the correct number of personnel are not deployed on time , a large reduction in the award price will be made in addition to not being able to invoice the hours / days not worked . ”
Government auditors determined that Blackwater should have been docked $ 55 million for its persistent manpower shortages .
And the audit concluded “ insufficient manning exposed the Department to unnecessary risk that could have been avoided by full staffing . ”
Blackwater / Xe spokeswoman Anne Tyrrell says the company is still reviewing the audit , but disputed the allegation that the firm had not met its contractual obligations .
“ The government contracting officer determined that Blackwater was compliant with the terms and conditions of the contract at the time they were reviewing and therefore did not apply any deductions or penalties , ” she says , adding that “ Blackwater only billed for services provided . ”
According to the audit , though , this is far from clear .
Due to inadequate monitoring by the State Department ’s diplomatic security division , “ There is no assurance that personnel staffing data was accurate or complete and that correct labor rates were paid . ”
The audit recommends that the State Department seek a legal opinion on “ whether charging deductions for past inadequate staffing would be appropriate ” — and the agency has agreed to do so .
Blackwater was also called out for $ 127,364 in “ unallowable travel costs ” expensed by contractors assigned to Baghdad and Hillah .
As of February , the State Department had been able to recoup $ 56,457 , but $ 70,907 remained outstanding .
“ We have not been informed of what the report is referencing but would work with the Department of State to reach a resolution if it became necessary , ” says Tyrrell .
Given that Blackwater raked in over $ 1 billion before being booted from Iraq in May , these costs may appear somewhat trivial , but they represent the larger free - for - all in Iraq , when , after the invasion , contracts — along with duffle bags full of cash — were going out the door without proper oversight .
On other parts of the review , Blackwater fared well .
Auditors found the firm ’s equipment , along with the vetting and training procedures for its personnel , were well within the terms stated in its task orders .
As for the manpower discrepancies , auditors lay blame primarily on the federal government ’s contract management and accounting practices , which they found to be ill - suited to the task at hand .
“ Department officials in Iraq did not establish or perform measures to confirm the accuracy of labor costs used as the basis for contract billing .
Monthly invoices from the contractor were paid without adequate review of support documentation . ”
And , while the audit commends State Department officials for keeping tabs on the guns and vehicles the government provided to Blackwater , the same ca n’t be said of the agency ’s monitoring of other federal property issued to the company : “ … Department oversight of all other government - furnished property was inadequate , and contractor lists were incomplete and inaccurate and therefore unreliable . ”
Due to this lax oversight , a handful of items — including binoculars , body armor , and walkie - talkies — have apparently gone MIA .
Also unaccounted for : a Fagor brand deep fat fryer .
“ No word on the fryer yet , ” says Tyrrell , who ’s currently investigating its whereabouts .
I 've been watching a little bit of TV lately , and occasionally see ads for Cialis and other ED and " male enhancement " drugs .
If you did n't know what they were talking about , you would n't know what they were talking about .
This is just a little different .
Spam email makes the purpose of the product very very clear , even if the grammar and syntax are hopelessly garbled .
The audio of this is probably not safe for work , in case your boss is paying attention .
1 . Use a plain white candle
2. Cheap is better
3 . Hold the candle about a foot away from the sub 's body .
4 . Wax external areas only .
5 . Always have water or a fire extinguisher available
BDSM
for your version of An Owned Life .
here are some safety tips for making the most out of your wax play experience .
Follow these to enhance the pleasure while reducing the risk of injury .
Many people are allergic to the perfumes and dyes in colored / scented candles .
Avoid this by purchasing white unscented candles .
More expensive candles burn at hotter temperatures .
We are seeking pleasure not burns .
The candles that are available at your local Dollar Store burn at a level that will cause him / her to feel it without causing injury .
Wax cools as it falls from the candle .
Holding the candle about a foot above the intended target will allow the cooling process to occur .
Again , this will avoid injury to the sensitive areas .
It would seem like common sense but must be mentioned .
Never place wax on the eyes , mouth , nostrils , or anywhere else where it can penetrate the body .
Safety is the top priority and we do not want to impede one 's breathing in any way .
Many see this as excessive but when playing , especially on a bed , there is a lot that is flammable .
Take the necessary steps to ensure that something tragic does not result from a scene that goes awry .
Enjoy yourexperience to the fullest .

The following manifesto was issued by a group of anarchists during their trial in Lyon , France in 1883 .
Over 60 suspected anarchists were charged with belonging to the International Workers ’ Association ( the First International : Anarchism , Volume One : From Anarchy to Anarchism ( 300 CE - 1939 ) , Chapters 5 & 6 ) , which had been banned following the suppression of the Paris Commune ( 1871 : Anarchism , Volume One , Chapter 7 ) .
The signatories included Peter Kropotkin , Emile Gauthier , Joseph Bernard , Pierre Martin and Toussaint Bordat .
The picture above shows Kropotkin cross-examining the Lyon chief of the French secret police .
Despite the lack of any real evidence , the accused were convicted as charged .
Kropotkin and three co-accused were sentenced to 5 years ’ imprisonment , 10 years of police surveillance , deprivation of their civil liberties for 5 years and fines of 1,000 francs each .
The others received lesser sentences .
Kropotkin ’s experience in prison is recounted in his book , In Russian and French Prisons ( 1887 ) .
Manifesto of the Anarchists
What is anarchy and what are the anarchists ?
Anarchists are citizens who , in a century where freedom of opinion is preached everywhere , have believed it to be their right and duty to appeal for unlimited liberty .
Throughout the world there are a few thousand of us , maybe a few million , for we have no merit other than saying out loud what the crowd is thinking .
We are a few million workers who claim absolute liberty , nothing but liberty , every liberty .
We want liberty ; we claim for every human being the right to do whatever he pleases and the means by which to do it .
A person has the right to satisfy all his needs completely , with no limit other than natural impossibilities and the needs of his neighbours , which must be respected equally with his .
We want freedom , and we believe its existence incompatible with the existence of any power whatsoever , no matter what its origin and form , no matter whether it be elected or imposed , monarchist or republican , inspired by divine right , popular right , holy oil , or universal suffrage .
History teaches us that every government is like every other government and that all are worth the same .
The best are the worst .
In some there is more cynicism , in others more hypocrisy , but at bottom there are always the same procedures , always the same intolerance .
There is no government , including even the ones that appear the most liberal , which does not have in the dust of its legislative arsenals some good little law about the [ First ] International to use against inconvenient opposition .
Evil , in the eyes of anarchists , does not dwell in one form of government more than any other .
Evil lies in the idea of government itself .
The principle of authority is evil .
Our ideal for human relations is to substitute free contract , perpetually open to revision or cancellation , in place of administrative and legal guardianship and imposed discipline .
Anarchists propose teaching people to do without government as they are already learning to do without God .
Anarchists will also teach people to get along without private ownership .
Indeed , the worst tyrant is not the one who locks you up ; it is the one who starves you .
The worst tyrant is not the one who takes you by the collar ; it is the one who takes you by the belly .
No liberty without equality !
There is no liberty in a society where capital is monopolized in the hands of an increasingly smaller minority , in a society where nothing is divided equally , not even public education , which is paid for by everyone ’s money .
We believe that capital is the common patrimony of mankind because it is the fruit of the collaboration between past and present generations , and that it ought to be put at the disposal of everyone so that no one is excluded and no one can hoard one part of it to the detriment of others .
In a word , what we want is equality .
We want actual equality as the corollary of liberty , indeed as its essential preliminary condition .
From each according to his abilities ; to each according to his needs .
That is what we want ; that is what our energies are devoted to .
It is what shall be , because no limitation can prevail against claims that are both legitimate and necessary .
That is why the government wishes to discredit us .
Scoundrels that we are , we claim bread for all , knowledge for all , work for all , independence and justice for all .

Palin 's favorite plumber unclogs his anti-gay drain
by Jeremy Hooper
With campaign '08 long in the rearview mirror , is campaign footnote " Joe The Plumber " ( nee Samuel Wurzelbacher ) ready to jump on Carrie Prejean 's gravy train ?
Well check out this comment from Christianity Today and decide for yourself :
Christianity Today :
In the last month , same - sex marriage has become legal in Iowa and Vermont .
What do you think about same - sex marriage at a state level ?
Joe :
At a state level , it 's up to them .
I do n't want it to be a federal thing .
I personally still think it 's wrong .
People do n't understand the dictionary — it 's called queer .
Queer means strange and unusual .
It 's not like a slur , like you would call a white person a honky or something like that .
You know , God is pretty explicit in what we 're supposed to do — what man and woman are for .
Now , at the same time , we 're supposed to love everybody and accept people , and preach against the sins .
I 've had some friends that are actually homosexual .
And , I mean , they know where I stand , and they know that I would n't have them anywhere near my children .
But at the same time , they 're people , and they 're going to do their thing .
Q & A : ' Joe the Plumber ' [ Christianity Today ]
( H/t : Joe the My God )
And now this proudly gay writer is going to scare the crap out of Joe in 5 , 4 , 3 , 2 ...
My father 's a plumber !
So do n't be too sure , Mr. The Plumber , that " gay person " and " your children " are necessarily different things .
Scientists are pretty sure that a proximity to plungers could be some sort of homo - stimulant .
Your thoughts
" they know that I would n't have them anywhere near my children . "
- WTF is that supposed to mean ?
Posted by : Jeff Chang | May 4 , 2009 7:15:52 PM
Another jackass who thinks if he claims to have gay friends it 'll exhonerate him of any charge that he 's a bigot .
He wo n't even let them NEAR his kids ?
What kind of friend is he to them ?
If I had a " friend " who said that to me , we would n't be friends any longere .
Posted by : Bill S | May 4 , 2009 7:25:38 PM
My dad is an electrician , but he has always had a serious " plumber 's crack " problem !
Does that count ?
Ya know , I can almost overlook the " wo n't let gay friends around my kids " crack .
( no plumber 's crack pun intended )
Because this guy is so obviously ignorant that he 's only repeating the lies that the lying liars have fed him .
And none of the lying liars actually ever say " all gay people are pedophiles " because that 's just too big of a lie , even for them .
But they do always lump homosexuals into the same group .
And , the lying liars know that by lumping us into a group with pedophiles , that the morons like Joe the Ignorant are going to draw the mental conclusion that " all gays are pedophiles " .
The fact of the matter is that his kids are at much higher risk around heteros than around gays .
But , it 's probably also true that the twice divorced , alleged wife - beater 's kids are better off now that they are n't around him .
It 's pretty ( absolutely ? ? ) certain that the ex-wives have come to the conclusion that they 're better off now since they 've kicked the moron to the curb .

" I would n't have them anywhere near my children . "
Another d-bag compares gays to pedophiles or predators .
Fantastic .
I still do n't understand how an unlicensed plumber who owed ( owes ? ) back taxes could become so popular .
It mystifies me .
Posted by : KZ | May 4 , 2009 9:07:08 PM
Calling someone queer ( i.e. " strange and unusal " by joe 's difinition ) is n't a slur ?
I 'm trying to wrap my head around that one still
Posted by : dragon88 | May 4 , 2009 10:19:06 PM
Is their some agency that rents out gay friends ?
You hide behind the bible as an excuse to deny gays rights ?
take 1 , he 'll show you dont hate anyone .
Call homosexuals pedophiles ?
better take 4 .
Posted by : Penguinsaur | May 5 , 2009 12:24:30 AM
He must have a very strange definition of friend .
Our children are now grown , but I would have never wanted them anywhere near him .
Posted by : Mike in the Tundra | May 5 , 2009 3:09:49 AM
Who the hell is friends with someone they would n't let near their kids ?
Posted by : RainbowPhoenix | May 5 , 2009 6:21:38 AM
Fair enough .
If I had kids , I would n't let him anywhere near them either !

Where are all these fabled homosexuals that do n't mind schlepping through town with people that do n't consider them human ?
I mean , shit , everyone seems to have one of those nowadays .
It makes the discriminative stances so much fluffier .
I guess .
Posted by : Chris | May 5 , 2009 11:22:55 AM
The comments at CT are overall negative , too .
Some who support him claim trolls , but with the overwhelming amount saying , " Why did you interview this loser ? " right from the beginning , I do n't think so .
They also show that not all Chrstians are the uninformed bigots that NOM portrays us to be ( Though some there do n't quite have it right yet ! ) .
Posted by : Bonnie_Half - Elven | May 5 , 2009 12:53:53 PM
who cares ?
i mean really .
should gays be allowed to marry ?
no ... why ?
because marriage is a religious institution and the christian church ( the majority in the usa ) says it is a sin .
however .... a gay couple should have the same right as a married couple via a civil union , imho .
either way :
gay or straight , doesnt matter , only pedophiles stalk children .
homosexuality is n't a disease that you catch on contact , it is a choice someone makes .
just because a person is gay does not mean they are not a good person , a threat to a child , or any bs like this .
typical small minded attitdue being demonstrated by a lowly blue collar moron .
Posted by : telvndar | May 5 , 2009 1:11:02 PM
" because marriage is a religious institution " Okay , one more time : No , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , * no * it 's NOT .
What gay activists are seeking is CIVIL marriage .
The religious component will be left to the churches , just as it always has been with opposite - sex couples .
Nobody -- * NOBODY * -- is seeking to change this .
For a legally recognized marriage , religion is 100 % an option .
The civil marriage license is not .

Why bring Governor Palin into this ?
Some of you have too much hate for Republicans .
Personally I support Joe the Plumber 's comments .
I wish he had said that he does not let his kids be around blacks .
That would have been much better .
I wish all Whites would be like that .
Anyway for those of you who are scared of Joe the Plumber or Gov.
Palin you should n't be .
Most of us regular people just want to avoid gays and yes we also want you to stay away from our kids .
But we 're not out to hurt you people .
So try to have a nice day .
Posted by : Lyn | May 5 , 2009 5:09:45 PM
Posted by : G - A - Y | May 5 , 2009 5:58:58 PM
Lyn ,
So , you " regular people " are really just nice folks , and do n't mean to hurt anyone ?
Because I am not going to lie , you " regular people " that want to avoid us and keep your kids away from us out of some irrational fear of I - do n't - even know - what are pretty hurtful .
So , if you are n't out to hurt anyone , you failed .
Miserably .
As for Wurzelbacher 's comment that " I 've had some friends that are actually homosexual .
And , I mean , they know where I stand , and they know that I would n't have them anywhere near my children , " I have to quote Jon Stewart , who put it very well : " I feel very confident in saying this -- your gay friends hate you . "
Posted by : fakeplants | May 5 , 2009 6:07:17 PM
Oh , and just to answer you on technical grounds , Lyn : Palin is mentioned because she felt the need to pepper our autumn of '08 with constant mentions of Joe .
In the annals of American history , there names are forever linked to some degree .
Posted by : G - A - Y | May 6 , 2009 10:12:27 AM
I will be thrilled when this guy finally goes away .
He 's a ridiculous caricature of himself at this point , and I hope he suffers a painful microphone - related injury the next time the Far Right props him up to speak .

Joe the plumber is n't a real plumber .
G.A. Y's dad is more of a voice of the working man than " Joe " the attention whore .
I know you know this already , but I feel like repeating it .
Also , my dad sells , fits and fixes washing machines and other household appliances for a living - and , like G.A. Y 's dad , he 's cooler than " Joe " will ever be .

My parents play him full blast as I cook in the afternoon .
Loud enough to be at a Who concert .
I normally mumble at the tv while I cook , not free to call him out to my parents .
Well today I did n't even know it was 4:00 , all I know was I was upstairs for 2 seconds and get screamed at by my mother that she was watching Glenn Beck and how horrible I was etc .....
At first I was like what the hell .
Then I got furious .
Here this woman finds a television show so important that she is going to go ape on her daughter .
I told her I did n't give a damn if she watched tin foil .
I did n't care if she believes that Obama and the Dems are going to make it where a home garden was illegal and that the are going to have secret garden police come and arrest them for them .
Or that we all should be picking up guns because a second civil war is comming over Bush being charged in Spain .
Then it got personal , stones were thrown by bothsides .
It ended with me being pushed by my father and my husband warning him about him touching me again .
That got us your out by Friday .
Of course I spent my spare money on what I was supose to .
You know like paying on some bills , replacing a flat , moving down here , gas to KC so we can get my husband 's school set up , etc .
We were finally making it where we could save enough money to move out in June .
So I find myself , with 2 kids and an ill husband with 89 dollars in the bank and moving out over my mom's wacked out addiction to Glenn Beck .
If my insane parents are an example of his viewership then he shoud be charged with contributing to the deliquincey of an mental case .
I am in no mood to spell I am sorry .
Gary McKinnon 's fight to be prosecuted in the UK casts a stark light on our extradition arrangements with America .
US prosecutors are threatening him with up to 70 years in a " supermax " prison – and this a man with Asperger 's syndrome who could hardly be less suited to such punishment .
But Britain 's extradition arrangements beyond those with the Americans make for equally unhappy reading .
The Extradition Act was passed in the aftermath of September 11 and much of its focus is on fast - track extradition of terror suspects .
But as with other aspects of the " war on terror " , the net result is damage to long - held principles of fairness and justice .
Extradition arrangements are important .
They ensure fugitives from justice do not escape prosecution for their crimes – and indeed this is required under human rights law .
But it is vital that safeguards are in place .
Liberty believes , as did the UK parliament for many years , that no one should be extradited unless and until the requesting country makes out a basic case against them in a UK court .
Failure on this front can result in an innocent person being sent halfway across the world – away from family , supporters and legal advisers – to face unsound , trumped - up or politically motivated charges , to say nothing of probable pre-trial imprisonment .
This can and does happen under the European arrest warrant .
Even more worryingly , the home secretary has made orders dispensing with the requirement of a prima facie case in respect of over 20 other countries outside the European Union , including Azerbaijan , Georgia , Moldova , the Russian Federation and Turkey .
Not only that , the European arrest warrant system , endorsed by parliament in the Extradition Act 2003 , allows a person to be extradited to an EU country for something that may not be an offence in the UK provided the conduct fits within a broad list of 32 offences .
While at first blush there seems no problem with extraditing someone for " murder " , we might think differently if another country 's laws define murder as including abortion .
Fast - track extradition is also provided for if the alleged offence is one of " racism or xenophobia " , however this is defined by the requesting country .
Many EU countries criminalise speech offences to an extent that the UK – with its history of a robust approach to freedom of expression – does not .
Yet a UK court cannot bar extradition on the basis that it is not a crime recognised by UK law .
More and more cases are appearing of unfair extradition practices that demonstrate the very real problems with the current system .
This is why Liberty has a new campaign , Extradition Watch , to fight the unfairness of the current system .
Fast - track extradition purely on the basis of administrative convenience and efficiency is justice denied .
There are very good historical reasons why extradition safeguards were developed and recent cases like those of McKinnon and Andrew Symeou ( a young Briton who faces extradition to Greece on extremely flimsy evidence ) show why these safeguards should still form part of UK law .
Liberty and others propose amending UK extradition arrangements to reinstate these traditional safeguards .
We are yet to learn what the courts will decide in respect of McKinnon 's last - ditch appeals .
But it is certain that any legislative reforms will be too late to apply to his case .
If this tragic case indicates the direction of travel for UK extradition law , we ignore the warning at our peril .

The Original DOS Module of AmigaOS
AmigaOS was architected in a very modular way .
“ Exec ” , the operating system kernel , was responsible for tasks ( and therefore scheduling ) , memory management and the messaging infrastructure .
It knew nothing about filesystems or user I /O .
The graphics library “ Intuition ” built on Exec , just like the DOS module , but they were independent of each other .
But the DOS module fell behind schedule , so Commodore decided to license “ Tripos “ .
Tripos
Tripos is , according to “ Introduction to Tripos ” , “ a multi- processing operating system designed for 68000 computers .
Although you can use it as a multi-user system , you normally run Tripos for a single user .
The multi-processing facility lets many jobs take place simultaneously .
You can also use the multi- processing facility to suspend one job while you run another . “
Tripos was very similar to the Amiga OS design and therefore fit well .
Tripos consisted of a kernel , a DOS library and a collection of user mode tools .
Since the “ Exec ” was already working well , and Intuition depended on it , there was no sense in replacing it with the Tripos kernel .
Instead , only the DOS part of Tripos ( including the tools ) was integrated into AmigaOS .
So the DOS API , the command line interface with its commands , the executable format ( “ hunk ” ) as well as the original Amiga filesystem were all basically identical to Tripos .
Comparing the Manuals
Commodore published a number of reference manuals about the Amiga operating system :
AMIGA ROM Kernel Reference Manual : Exec
Amiga ROM Kernel Reference Manual : Libraries and Devices
Amiga ROM Kernel Reference Manual : Includes and Autodocs
Amiga Intuition Reference Manual
The AmigaDOS Manual
While the former four books were all written from stratch describing new Amiga technology , the AmigaDOS Manual was basically just the Tripos manual set with “ Tripos ” replaced with “ AmigaDOS ” and all references to technologies that did n’t make it into the Amiga removed .
You can see from the tables of contents of the two books that The AmigaDOS User ’s Manual omitted the chapters about the Tripos kernel ( AmigaOS used “ Exec ” ) , the debugger ( AmigaOS had “ ROMWack ” ) , full screen support ( everything above simple character I /O was done by Intuition ) , floating point ( Amiga OS contained Motorola ’s “ MC68343 FLOATING POINT FIRMWARE ” instead ) and Installation .
What is interesting about the AmigaDOS Manual is that very limited adaption to the Amiga has been performed .
The previously quoted definition of Tripos can be found in the AmigaDOS manual as well : “ AmigaDOS a multi- processing operating system designed for 68000 computers . [ … ]
” While this would be true for AmigaOS , AmigaDOS was only a library and in no way a “ multi- processing operating system ” .
There are not many real differences between the two documents :
The AmigaDOS Manual replaced references to “ screen ” with “ current window ” and mentions the new logical devices “ LIBS : ” , “ DEVS : ” and “ FONTS : ” when talking about the filesystem layout .
There are also some smaller differences on the command line :
There is no MOUNT command ( AmigaOS detects disks and automounts ) , the “ C ” command has been renamed to “ EXECUTE ” as well as the “ PAR : ” device to “ PRT : ” .
The AmigaDOS Manual also contains a section about cross-development on a Sun or MS - DOS machine .
Now I am looking forward to your comments :
Did you any other interesting differences ?
In what way were Exec and the Tripos kernel different ?
Any other input ?
Thanks !
HORSE SPRINGS , N.M.  Wranglers at the Platt ranch were marking calves the old - fashioned way last week , roping them from horseback and burning a brand onto their haunches .
What they were emphatically not doing , said Jay Platt , the third - generation proprietor of the ranch , was abiding by a federally recommended livestock identification plan , intended to speed the tracing of animal diseases , that has caused an uproar among ranchers .
They were not attaching the recommended tags with microchips that would allow the computerized recording of livestock movements from birth to the slaughterhouse .
“ This plan is expensive , it ’s intrusive , and there ’s no need for it , ” Mr. Platt said .
Mr. Platt said he already did all he could to fight epidemics .
He does not bring any outside animals into his herds , and he happily staples on metal tags that identify animals to help with brucellosis control .
But as he drove his pickup from grasslands into dense thickets of piñon pine on this highland desert that requires 100 acres per cow , he explained why he thought the federal plan was wrongheaded .
Mr. Platt called the extra $ 2 cost of the electronic tags an onerous burden for a teetering industry and said he often moved horses and some of his 1,000 head of cattle among three ranches here and in Arizona .
Small groups of cattle are often rounded up in distant spots and herded into a truck by a single person , who could not simultaneously wield the hand - held scanner needed to record individual animal identities , Mr. Platt said .
And there is no Internet connection on the ranch for filing to a regional database .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke told lawmakers
Tuesday that the economy has started to show signs of stabilization , although he cautioned that improvement is uncertain and likely to be gradual going forward .
Bernanke also reiterated that the Fed will be able to keep inflation at bay by unwinding many of the various lending programs it has put in place to encourage banks to start lending again .
But he declined to give a time frame for when the Fed might begin its so - called exit strategy .
The head of the central bank , appearing before the House Financial Services Committee in his semi-annual testimony on the state of the economy , forecast a relatively sluggish recovery .
Bernanke said the unemployment rate would be higher than preferred levels until at least 2012 .
But he added that steps taken by the Fed to pump money into the economy have started to pay benefits .
" The pace of decline appears to have slowed significantly , and final demand and production have shown tentative signs of stabilization , " he said .
But at the same time he cautioned that even with improvements , " financial conditions remain stressed , and many households and businesses are finding credit difficult to obtain . "
Bernanke repeated the Fed 's recent forecast that the economy would grow in the second half of this year , and picking up steam over time .
He said he expects employers to start adding jobs either later this year or early next year but said it would take time for labor markets to return to normal .
" I want to be clear we have a very long haul here , " he said .
" Unemployment will stay high for quite some time .
It 's not going to feel like a very strong economy . "
But Bernanke stopped short of endorsing some proposals for Congress to pass an additional round of economic stimulus -- at least at this time .
" Less than a quarter of the first stimulus has been spent .
It 's early to make a judgment about that , " he said about a second stimulus package .
The chairman 's comments were somewhat more cautious than the central bank 's economic forecast that was prepared for the June 24 meeting and released to the public last week .
San Diego State University finance professor Dan Seiver said part of the reason for caution is the desire of Fed policymakers to continue to pump credit and cash into the economy as long as possible .
Talk of a strong recovery ahead would only raise pressure on Bernanke to lay out plans to raise rates and unwind its other programs .
" He does n't want to tighten up until it 's clear we 're really out of the ditch ,
Seiver said .
Some lawmakers questioned the steps taken by the Fed to try to fix the economy and argued that the economy had not yet taken a turn for the better for most Americans .
" So far there has been very little bang for the taxpayer 's buck , " said Rep. Spencer Bachus , R - Ala. , the ranking Republican member of the House Financial Services Committee .
Rep. Melvin Watt , D - N.C. , praised the Fed 's steps in the last year , saying that it had been a " sturdy " hand .
But he said that despite signs of improved economic activity , " unfortunately my constituents are not yet feeling it . "
This is not an exit
Bernanke also said the Fed is confident it will be able to employ a smooth " exit strategy " to remove the programs that were put in place to help the economy , without causing a shock to the financial system or a spike in prices .
Many investors and economists have been looking for the Fed to spell out such an exit strategy in recent weeks .
Bernanke said that many of the programs will naturally wind down as the financial system settles down , since they are pumping money into the system at higher than normal market rates .
He said slow growth and a weak labor market will also continue to keep inflation in check .
David Wyss , chief economist for Standard & Poor 's , noted that the size of the Fed 's balance sheet is more than double what it was a year ago .
But he also pointed out that the balance sheet has shrunk about 8 % from the peak levels in December , a sign that the Fed is quietly unwinding some of its programs .
" The Fed has allowed [ the special programs ] to run down as the market has returned closer to normal , " said Wyss .
" They have n't been buying as much long - term Treasurys as they announced they might .
They have n't needed to .
Yields came down anyway . "
Partly due to inflation fears , the yield on the U.S. 10 - year Treasury rose to about 4 % last month as investors sold long - term bonds .
Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions .
But yields have since fallen to about 3.5 % .
Seiver said that the Fed wo n't be able to quietly unwind its positions simply through market forces though .
He thinks the central bank will have to get more aggressive in pulling credit and cash out of the market or risk feeding inflation pressures .
" There 's still a lot of excess liquidity sitting out there .
At some point the Fed will have to drain that , " he said .
" The problem will be that it will probably happen before the political powers think it 's time for tightening , like next fall , right before the congressional election .
If they start tightening then , there will be a lot of screaming . "
Talkback :
Do you think Ben Bernanke is doing a good job of managing the economic crisis ?

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - U.S. foreclosure activity for May ebbed from April ’s record , but mortgages still failed at a staggering pace as President Barack Obama ’s rescue programs had not had time to fully take root , RealtyTrac said on Thursday .
Foreclosure filings dipped 6 percent in the month but increased 18 percent from May 2008 , marking the third highest month on record .
“ There were almost one million foreclosure filings in a three - month period , and that ’s simply unprecedented , ” Rick Sharga , senior vice president at RealtyTrac in Irvine , California , said in an interview .
Temporary freezes on foreclosure activity ended in March .
Failures of many seriously delinquent loans that were put on hold during those moratoria have been thrust back into the foreclosure cycle .
One in every 398 households with loans got a foreclosure filing in May .
Filings , which include notices of default and auctions , were reported on 321,480 properties last month .
Stemming foreclosures is seen critical to bolstering home prices , consumer confidence and the recessionary U.S. economy .
Bank repossessions , known as real - estate owned or REOs , rose in May and should spike in coming months because the moratoria ended , Realty Trac said .
OBAMA PLAN NEEDS TIME
The administration ’s plans to ease loan modifications and refinancing were detailed in early March and have n’t been implemented long enough to derail foreclosures .
The hurdles are high .
Unemployment reached a nearly 26 - year peak in May and mortgage rates have leaped a percentage point from their spring lows to more than 5 - 1/ 2 percent .
“ One of the cures to this problem is enough buying activity to eat up the inventory of distressed properties , ” Sharga said .
“ If mortgage rates go up to where people decide to wait out the market again , that ’s just going to add to the inventory numbers and put more downward pricing pressure on all homes . ”
RealtyTrac forecasts about 4 million foreclosure filings will be made this year on about 3.1 million households with loans .
Last year , there was a record 3.1 million filings on about 2.4 million households .
In a more typical year , Sharga said there would be around 800,000 filings on 550,000 households .
The sign for a foreclosed house for sale sits at the property in Denver , Colorado March 4 , 2009 .

“ When you have a glut of inventory and downward pricing pressure that does tend to push properties into foreclosure , ” said Sharga .
States where sales and prices soared most in the five - year housing boom earlier this decade remained the hardest hit .
Nevada stayed at the top of the foreclosure rate rankings by state , with one in every 64 housing units getting a foreclosure filing .
California , Florida and Arizona , Michigan , Georgia , Colorado , Idaho and Ohio were the other states with the highest foreclosure rates .
Ten states , led by California , accounted for almost 77 percent of total number of foreclosure actions in May .
“ We need to give the administration ’s programs a little bit of time to gain traction , ” Sharga said .
“ If unemployment continues to worsen , all bets are off on foreclosure rates . ”

Surely Phelps -- 14 - time Olympic gold medalist and endorsement juggernaut -- was being only himself , only human , when he was photographed in November hitting a bong at a party at the University of South Carolina .
The swimmer promptly issued a sniveling apology , copping to " regrettable , " " inappropriate " and " youthful " behavior ( does n't the latter want to excuse the former ? ) .
Phelps , 24 , has more or less cheerfully dined on PR ashes ever since , in interviews with Matt Lauer , among others .
Interestingly , the apology from the world 's fittest stoner infuriated proponents of legal weed , who saw the episode as a missed opportunity to advance the cause .
After all , if Aqua - Man smokes bud , how bad can it be ?
This is the greatest Olympian of all time , a man chandeliered with gold medals on the cover of Sports Illustrated .
His achievements mock the moral hysteria that traditionally rains down on marijuana .
The Subway ad itself is nothing special .
It 's a compare - and - contrast between Phelps ' glamorous life as a sports superstar and that of Jared Fogle , Subway 's former - fatty mascot .
Jared prefers the low - fat sweet - onion Chicken Teriyaki sandwich , while metabolic dynamo Phelps dares to eat the foot - long Meatball Marinara with Jalapeño , containing 1,060 calories and more than 3,000 milligrams of sodium .
Eating these will not make you an Olympic swimmer .
A floating island , maybe .
Culture deconstructionists will pick the spot apart for oblique references to the scandal .
Phelps ' chin whiskers are kind of bro-ish , for instance .
He does look a trifle baked ( could be the chlorine ) .
AdWeek 's Eleftheria Parpis wrote that " you can almost hear all the blunts lighting up in support as Sly & The Family Stone 's ' Thank You ( Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin ) ' kicks in . "
And it really is too bad that the sandwich franchise 's website is : http://www.subwayfreshbuzz.com/
Even so , the Phelps - bong scandal seems to have been safely put to bed , and now that it has , it 's worth asking , what have we learned ?
The consequences to Phelps -- actually , the lack of consequences -- suggest that something bigger than mere endorsement dollars is in play .
It seems Phelps has moved the weed needle .
Yes , USA Swimming , the sport 's national governing body , suspended Phelps for three months , time he used to whip himself into shape after his post -Olympic bacchanal .
( The organization also withheld its monthly stipend , an amount that probably would n't put gas in Phelps ' Bentley . )
Yes , Kellogg declined to re-up with Phelps , but tellingly , other endorsement deals remained intact : Speedo , Omega , Subway and Mazda China .
Subway did n't hesitate to stand by its man ( though it did postpone the current ad campaign six months to let the agita die down ) .
Mazda required Phelps to record a minute - long mea culpa directed at the people of China -- mortifying but harmless .
In June , Phelps inked a deal with H2O Audio , maker of high - end waterproof headphones .
In other words , there were no serious consequences .
To the extent that endorsement opportunities are a rough metric of how well someone in public life is liked , admired , respected , the bong - heard - round - the - world scandal might as well never have happened .
With the benefit of hindsight , Kellogg execs might well be kicking themselves .
You could ascribe the missing fallout to Phelps ' incredible personal magnetism or -- far more likely -- to the fact that advertisers saw little downside to being associated with bong - meister Phelps .
Nor should they .
Across the board , marijuana is being steadily decriminalized and de-stigmatized .
In a Field Poll in May , 56 % of Californians favored legalization , slightly ahead of the roughly half of Americans who favor such a move .
Thirteen states have legalized medical marijuana , and three more are considering it .
In a dozen states , possession of less than an ounce of marijuana is not illegal .
One hundred million Americans have smoked pot , and about 14 million use it regularly , according to federal government studies .
U.S. Atty . Gen. Eric Holder has said the federal government would no longer raid California medical marijuana dispensaries .
Ethan Nadelmann , of the legalization - advocacy group Drug Policy Alliance , told the Associated Press last month : " This is the first time I feel like the wind is at my back and not in my face . "
I 'm sure , given the choice , Phelps would prefer not to be a milestone on the road to the marijuana 's mainstreaming .
Still , what we 're witnessing is the death of a certain kind of shame .
Advertising -- and that 's what celebrity - athlete endorsements are -- is a highly sensitive antenna of culture .
Because it strives to reach , hold and please the greatest number of people , it represents a special threshold of cultural acceptance , the floorboards of the norm .
The return of brand Phelps says more about us than it does about him .

Nixon buffs today have the chance to trawl through more secretly taped conversations and telephone calls by the disgraced president .
The latest batch - some of it barely audible - cover January and February 1973 .
The period , at the start of Nixon 's second term , covers the conviction of burglars whose break - in at the Democratic headquarters precipitated the cover - up that eventually brought down Richard Milhous Nixon .
The new material , released by the Nixon presidential library , include a conversation between Nixon and Charles Colson , his special counsel who was never charged in connection to Watergate .
The two men discuss the state of mind of Howard Hunt , who was jailed for his role in the burglary , the death of his wife in a plane crash and the course of the Watergate trial .
The latest release also includes new discussions involving the president and his aides about using executive privilege as a defence against future investigations .
The tapes should be of interest to historians of the Vietnam war as they include conversations between Nixon and Henry Kissinger , his national security adviser .
The two men discuss how to deal with an increasingly awkward South Vietnamese ally , President Nguyen van Thieu , as the US seeks a peace deal with North Vietnam .
On 9 January , Nixon 's birthday , Kissinger sent word from Paris that so much progress had been made in negotiations that he believed a settlement was imminent .
The tapes provide a glimpse of Nixon 's reaction .
Altogether , about 154 hours of tape recordings from the Nixon White House were released today , along with 30,000 documents .
The famously paranoid Nixon started secretly taping conversations and telephone calls in several locations , including the Oval Office , his office in the Old Executive Office building , the cabinet room , and Camp David in 1971 .
There are 2,217 hours of tapes containing conversations through to July 1973 available to the public .
Kmart stores are offering unemployed Michigan residents some relief at the cash register .
The company announced today a new program giving a 20 percent discount on regularly priced store - brand groceries and drugstore merchandise to people without jobs .
To participate , people need to have a state driver 's license or identification card , and a state - issued unemployment benefits enrollment verification , such as an Unemployment Insurance Agency debit card or check stub .
Kmart will give them a Smart Assist savings card to qualify for the discount on purchases .
The program is available for up to six months , the company said on its Web site .
Cards will be issued until January 2010 .
The program excludes sale and clearance merchandise .
I ’m sure you ’ve come across this kind of movie .
The one where right from the beginning you know it will be know no -holds barred .
The gritty , in - your - face , relentless , gasp - for - air kinda films that can come from many genres , be it horror , action , suspense , or what have you .
Wanton and careless disregard for life is often a common trait throughout .
Violence , gore , cursing , and multiple headshots , yeah they ’re here too .
And you normally have a single character whose extreme attitudes and behavior are admirable .
Think classics from the Schwarzenegger oeuvre , such as from his Commando days .
Other classics include The Good , The Bad , and The Ugly , Scarface , Dirty Harry , and many of John Woo ’s earlier works such as The Killer or Hard Boiled .
I ’ll grant you , these are n’t always the best movies from an artistic standpoint , but they can be highly entertaining .
And here are some of the best examples from the last decade .
Sure , there are better action movies out there .
And sure there are better overall movies .
But these kind of movies make you think the individuals are just Jack Bauer / Chuck Norris - style badass .
Rambo ’s heyday may have been in the 1980s , but the latest installment does n’t disappoint with this one man killing machine .
For example , Stallone rigs a nuclear bomb and then outruns the blast radius and also single handedly ends the Burmese civil war with a truck mounted machine gun .
If you ever wanted to see a guy ’s head turn into a scrambled egg , then this is for you .
Sometimes , you just like to watch a badass do his thing .
Gibson plays Porter , who ’s basically just a total bad ass , does n’t care about anything or anyone and is hell bent on revenge .
I guess that ’s what happens when you ’re shot by your wife and best friend and are left to die .
Teaming up Christopher Walken and Denzel Washington in a movie is never a bad thing .
Having it happen in this extremely violent movie about kidnapping and corruption in Mexico City only sets itself up for Denzel to kick ass .
Exiled reminds you a bit of those Sergio Leone spaghetti westerns , except set in Macau circa 1998 .
Plenty of gunfights are present , and it shows Hong Kong still leads the trend in innovative action film - making .
Michael Mann directed Collateral , and you can see that this is the same man that brought us awesome movies like Heat .
Tom Cruise stars in this one as Vincent , an ice cold contract killer ready to burst forth at a moment ’s notice with lightning quick reflexes to bring about sudden violence .
As an utterly ruthless hitman , Cruise is excellent as he picks people off in the Los Angeles night .
This is the kind of movie that will get your pulse running out of control .
In addition to extreme graphic violence , this film uses the f- bomb at least 315 times , features a chick killing people at point blank , a shot of someone getting their nuts blow off , and a final shootout at a hockey rink with glow in the dark paint .
It has it all : drug addicts , hookers , mobsters , wife beaters , pedophiles , crooked cops , and pimps
Zack Snyder know how to make entertaining films , and this Romero remake launched his film career that we now enjoy .
Would you like to see fast zombies ?
Check .
Head shots ?
Check .
Dismemberment ?
Check .
It is chock full of bizarre creepiness , like when a zombie baby gets shot , plus it adds on Ving Rhames and plenty of guns .
Any movie that kills of Ben Affleck ca n’t be all bad .
If you had n’t had the opportunity to watch Smokin ’
Aces yet , then do yourself a favor and get that popcorn popping !
The sole point of the movie is a bunch of hitman attempt to pour pour boxes of bullets into one man , played by Jeremy Piven .
In addition to the gun play , it also adds touches of grim humor and a dash of eye candy .
Sounds like a fine recipe .
Nothing says badass like an old - fashioned western .
They do n’t make that kind of film much anymore , but Kevin Costner and Robert Duvall team up for one of the better modern incarnations .
There ’s only one gunfight in the picture , but it is worth the wait and it makes you hearken back to stuff from Sam Peckinpah or Clint Eastwood .
Come see Tom Hanks wipe out almost an entire mob by himself .
Irish mob movies do n’t get much better than this 1930s gangster flick .
For an added bonus , Jude Law ’s performance as the psychopathic hitman Harlen Maguire was chilling .
Gene Hackman makes every movie seem better than it is .
So I could n’t leave him off this list .
Teamed up with a David Mamet script , a man never shy about a few f- bombs , Heist is the story of clever criminals who must worry not only about the authorities but about the treachery of other clever criminals .
There ’s not a ton of violence , but there ’s some ultra cool about a man who can con a con man while working though some on Mamet ’s trademark badass dialogue .
An extremely volatile and dangerous Englishman about an ex-con seeking revenge on the man that caused his daughter ’s death .
Stamp plays the Englishman Wilson , a man that just will never let up .
Anyone unfortunate enough to get in his way is pretty much toast as well .
Ryan Phillippe and Benicio Del Toro team up as two petty criminals who decided to kidnap a surrogate mother for cash .
Though as the movie states , the longest distance between two points is a kidnapper and his money .
As you might imagine , things do not go as planned .
The two modern day antiheroes are forced to engage in violence , and that violence is often fearsome , difficult , and wholly unpleasant .
Keira Knightley and Mickey Rourke play bounty hunters in this Tony Scott flick full of raunchy strong language and gun violence .
In fact , Knightley ’s character is based on a real life model turned bounty hunter .
There ’s something pretty sexy about a girl who can kick some ass .
If you can get past the choppy , dizzying editing you can see Knightley play a cocky badass .
A film which relies solely on its style and its visual slickness , it pits zombies vesus the yakuza among other face offs .
Do n’t be worried hwoever , there are plenty of swords slicing , bullets blazing , or good old fashioned martial arts .
The movie is totally campy , very bloody and gory , and in the end remains fairly memorable .
Taken is admirably in - your - face , satisfyingly blunt and a blur of fighting , fear , chasing and excitement at serious pace .
Liam Neeson has set the bar high for ass - kicking fathers with his “ very particular set of skills ” .
The Boondock Saints is the ultimate triumph of style over substance .
But it still was a bad ass movie if you ’re willing to make a suspension of belief here and there .
It ’s about two Irish lads who realize what they were put on earth to do , to punish the evil people of the world .
In nomine Patri . Et Fili .
Spiritus Sancti .
Before he was Bond , Daniel Craig was the man with no name in Layer Cake , a unique and remarkable experience that weaves a complex web of multiple stories .
Craig is the cocaine dealer who ’s simply a business man dragged into a mess with crazy Serbians , a double crossing cockney gangster boss , and some of the seedier individuals of the criminal underworld .
Jason Statham pretty much lives on this type of movie , and the Transporter is him at his action - packed best .
You get car chases , roundhouse kicks , and generally absurd action while Statham drips attitude as the jack - of - all - trades Transporter .
You do n’t understand how serious this is .
They killed my dog .
Never mess with someone who can drop you with his gun from miles away .
Mark Wahlberg is Bob Lee Swagger , a one man wrecking crew and special forces operative who is an expert with his sniper rifle .
Directed by Antoine Fuqua , watch Wahlberg single handedly kill dozens of people , including a few head shots along the way .
Besides some of the finest swearing and gunfire in contemporary British cinema , you have a character that will feed individuals to pigs .
There ’s no one single badass character , but guys like Boris The Blade and Bullet Tooth Tony make a nice badass ensemble .
If you like to see people getting owned , but want to sprinkle in a little Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley while you ’re at it then this is for you .
People are getting killed left and right , and you ’ll have to wait until the end of the movie how they are all connected .
The strength of Battle Royale is one awesome idea .
The film focuses on what happens when a group of high school students are sent to an abandoned island to kill each other .
And you thought your high school years were rough !
In the end , there can be only one , so it ’s literally survival of the fittest .

KANDAHAR , Afghanistan 
Nine civilians , including five children , were killed Friday when a roadside bomb struck their vehicle on the way to a religious shrine in southern Afghanistan , officials said .
The explosion occurred in the Spin Boldak district of Kandahar Province , as members of a family drove to visit the shrine in the remote Wanaka area .
Separately , the British Defense Ministry in London said on Friday that a British soldier was killed Thursday in the southern province of Helmand  the latest British death as a debate in Britain intensifies about the quality of equipment available to British troops as they face roadside bombs and other attacks by the Taliban .
That statement embarrasses Mr. Earle today .
“ Did I ever believe that Townes was better than Bob Dylan ? ” he asked wearily .
“ No . ” For Mr. Earle , Van Zandt was both an inspiring and bedeviling model , a man who put his art above all other considerations but who sometimes seemed to regard success itself as inherently compromising .
Though far from a superstar , Mr. Earle has earned two gold albums and two Grammy Awards , and he views such recognition as a valuable reward for hard work .
“ I do n’t think Townes was a victim , ” Mr. Earle stated .
“ Part of him did n’t consider himself worthy of anything . ”

In a way , however , Van Zandt ’s reward was the legend that followers like Mr. Earle helped foster .
To this day he is the subject of tales that are told and retold , embellished and laughed over , whenever anyone who met him has a willing audience .
There was the time , for example , when Van Zandt , frustrated that Mr. Earle was fooling with a .357 Magnum during a get - together , picked up a pistol himself , put a couple of bullets in the chamber and spun it around , pointed the gun at his own head and pulled the trigger twice .
The gun did n’t fire , but Van Zandt had made his point about bravado .
Such stories established Van Zandt as a doomed romantic figure .
Throughout his life he wandered among Tennessee , Colorado and his home state of Texas , often calling no particular place his home .
His live performances could be riveting .
On good nights he seemed to disappear into chronicles of existential joy and agony like “ To Live Is to Fly , ” “ Waiting ’ Round to Die ” and “ Tower Song , ” gently delivering irreducible truths summed up in lines like , “ Everything is not enough / And nothing is too much to bear . ”
On bad nights he would fall off his stool onstage , too drunk or high to get through a set .
With “ Townes ” Mr. Earle attempts both to pay a debt and to extricate his idol ’s songs from the mythology surrounding his life .
Mr. Earle , who first made his mark in the 1980s with smart country - rock albums like “ Guitar Town ” and “ Copperhead Road , ” has endured devastating struggles with addiction , was jailed for drugs and weapons possession and nearly died .
The romance of Van Zandt ’s problems long ago lost whatever allure they may once have had for him .
Mr. Earle ’s house here , which he purchased last year with his wife , the country singer Allison Moorer , includes a sleek electric wine cooler left by the previous owners .
Mr. Earle displays it prominently by the counter in his kitchen .
You wo n’t be served a hard drink here .
Bottles of seltzer and diet soda stock the cooler .
Mr. Earle ’s rule is that if you bring an alcoholic beverage into the house , you must carry the container out when you leave .
“ I do n’t underestimate my disease , ” he said .
Hail — Hail Arthurdale , Land of beginning again .
~ The Arthurdale Song
The West Virginia town of Arthurdale sits on a plateau 1,800 or so feet above sea level , nestled comfortably high and isolated among the Appalachian Plateau of Preston County .
Like almost every small American town it is virtually unknown to all but the few who either live or have lived within her borders .
There is nothing unusual in that — except in this case there is .
For a time from the initial birth of the town in 1934 , Arthurdale was the epicenter of the New Deal , the Roosevelt Administration ’s showpiece for what could be done for the common man .
It was the first and most lavishly appointed of all the Subsistence Homesteads , a rather small New Deal program with the big goal of redistributing " excess " population from one area to another , the hoped for end result would be a " new American , " living a communal life that would be a vast improvement on our country ’s traditional individualism .
Arthurdale had the personal attention and fervent support of none other than Eleanor Roosevelt , who devoted the rest of her life — and a large part of her fortune — to the town ’s residents .
Having such a high - profile celebrity booster would prove to be a two - edged sword .
Subjected to intensely negative media coverage and a popular curiosity that rivaled anything today ’s top celebrities endure from the paparazzi , for a few years the town ’s name was on the lips of millions and mentioned repeatedly in the pages of newspapers and magazines from coast to coast .
Sightseers , their license plates bearing the mark of every state in the Union , flocked up the winding mountain roads to have a look for themselves in such numbers one of the town ’s initial residents later complained , " got so a man could n’t set down … without some stranger peeking in at the window or walking in to ask some fool questions . "
But fame is fleeting , and today the town lay mostly forgotten , even the I - 68 thruway which runs about 10 miles to her north does not see fit to mention Arthurdale on any road sign , but there I was driving up the mountain roads to see her for myself , going to peek in at the window to ask my own fool questions .
Night At The Museum
I ’m going where there ’s no depression , To the lovely land that ’s free from care I ’ll leave this world of toil and trouble , My home ’s in Heaven , I ’m going there
~ No Depression ( 1936 )
As part and parcel to researching a book I ’m writing on the town , I had arrived to attend a most illiberal of events — the annual New Deal Festival , held each year at Arthurdale .
Despite the name , it is not so much a celebration of the era of FDR than it is a celebration of his likeable wife , Eleanor .
As the town ’s most prominent , enthusiastic booster she will always be Arthurdale ’s First Lady , and compared to the litany of rogues , mountebanks , and tyrants that litter mankind ’s history , she ’s not a bad choice at all .
Why a small , obscure town has such fond memories of her and a litany of scatter - brained government interventions is easy to understand if you are aware of the town ’s history , for if it was n’t for the New Deal — and Eleanor Roosevelt in particular — Arthurdale would n’t even exist .
I had imagined that Arthurdale would be like every other historic site I ’d ever visited .
There would be a museum , a few history buffs like myself , and some old buildings to take pictures of , each one preserved to a greater or lesser extent .
The first night of the festival was a combination Arthurdale High School reunion and celebration of the town ’s 75th anniversary .
I had bought tickets for the event with the hope of meeting one or two actual people who lived in the town and who could shed a little light on her history .

Admittedly I had assumed beforehand that my chances of finding any such people would be virtually nil , but that would make a fine introduction to the book , something along the lines of " so obscured by the passage of time that not even the people who live there now have any idea of what transpired . "
I could n’t have been more wrong .
To this very day , the town is heavily populated with the direct descendants of the original homesteaders , their children and grandchildren , all of them very attached to the town — and each other — and all impressively knowledgeable about what transpired there .
As outsiders among a group of people long acquainted with each other , my wife , son , and I stuck out like sore thumbs , and we were asked by the evening ’s master of ceremonies — in a very kind , non-threatening manner — exactly who we were and why we were there .
Taking the microphone , I told them the who and the why ( writing a book ) and was shocked by the outpouring of genuine kindness and offers to provide any information I felt I needed .
Invitations to move down there , look through family pictures and listen to their stories , and even a completely unexpected offer that opened the town museum ’s archives piled up so quickly it was a task to keep up with all the names and information .
They all had one thing in common ; the openhearted decency characteristic of the country dweller , a decency that always takes the city dweller by surprise .
Their sense of community is notable , as it is something that cannot be legislated but earned only by that rare combination of loyalty to each other and the passage of time .
Say what you will about the federal selection process that initially populated Arthurdale , the people who make up the town , both then and now , made for a good marriage .
The people strike a New Yorker as very religious ( admittedly not a hard thing to do ) ; I have never attended a town gathering that included a prayer to open and close the ceremonies .
I ’d hazard a guess that the number of churches in Preston County rivals the number of churches in my home city .
Right outside the window of the elementary school cafeteria where the reunion was being held , I could see the town church , a beautiful stone structure that the town residents built with their own hands — just as they had built every original structure within Arthurdale ’s borders .
During the opening invocation , the prayer included a line that " we thank the Lord for our heritage " and their heritage , due to the town ’s unique birth , is intimately and happily entwined with that of the New Deal .
If my forebears had been plucked from the poverty stricken hellhole of a moribund coal - mining camp , as theirs were , and placed into a picture - postcard - worthy town set amongst gently rolling fertile hills , I ’d likely feel the same way .
I had never been to an actual " living museum " in my life ; Arthurdale fits the bill .
Imagine going to research an old story — say ancient Rome — only to arrive and find a few Caesars still alive , and arrayed around them are their descendants , many still laying their heads in the very same homes their ancestors did .
I was taken completely by surprise .

A Most Successful Failure
Friends of the subsistence homestead are very skeptical if this new pattern of life can develop without a great deal of social control .
~ M.L. Wilson , Director , Subsistence Homestead Division ( 1933 )
Any group of individuals with shared life experiences have a collective memory , and the people who live in Arthurdale are still , to this day , deeply sensitive to anything critical written about their home town and its history .
During my time there a number of people asked politely and openly that I please not call Arthurdale a failure , that all I had to do was look around and see that the town was thriving .
75 years on , with the nation ’s focus long gone from Arthurdale , they still stand fearful of any negative press .
They need n’t be fearful at all .
Two of the people most involved with the town ’s early years , Eleanor Roosevelt and Elsie Clapp ( who ran the Arthurdale school system ) were , like me , New Yorkers , and they were , like me , outsiders .
Sometimes it takes an outsider to look into your window and tell you what they see , to give an impartial observation and , to be blunt , no person who can perform basic math can look at the colossal waste of taxpayer money that happened at Arthurdale from 1934 to 1947 and come to any other conclusion then that , as a subsistence homestead , Arthurdale was a cataclysmic failure .

Yet , it is not accurate to say that Arthurdale itself , as a going concern , is a failure because the town still exists .
In 1987 one of the original homesteaders — a woman named Elma Martin — was asked her opinion about the town ’s " success . "
She replied , " part of it was and part of it was n’t , " and that is the best , most accurate summation of the town ’s history ; she was a failure until she was n’t .
It can not be stressed enough that the failure of Arthurdale as a New Deal subsistence homestead had nothing at all to do with the people who were chosen to live there — they were allowed no authority to decide how things were to be run , what businesses they where to open , or even what curriculum the school would teach .
In Stephen Haid ’s outstanding dissertation on Arthurdale he noted " the perimeters for community decision - making existed only within the narrowest of limits . "
( Haid , 197 )
Diane Ghirardo wrote of the homestead projects , " in their day - to - day operation American cooperatives revealed a pronounced drive to implement drastic social changes through the cooperatives by means of paternalistic and ultimately authoritarian control . "
( Ghirardo , 138 )
In a 1987 interview , Mrs. Anna Houghton ( another original homesteader ) talked about the control over their lives by outsiders , stating " to say u2018 go ahead and run it your own way ’ and yet to have somebody else say u2018 well , this is the way it has to be done if you ’re gonna get any more money from me ’ is the problem of any administration , " and there we have the perfect description of the political control applied to Arthurdale from 1934 to 1947 .
Even Bushrod Grimes ( the town ’s first federal project manager ) complained about the " use of army tactics with the homesteaders . "
( APP 2178/1 )
On the other hand , the success of Arthurdale as a community has everything to do with the people who stayed on after the politicians packed up and left in 1947 .
It only began running under its own steam when the homesteaders themselves , the Luziers , McLaughlins , Bucklews and all the others , where able to act of their own free will , guided by their own wants and opinions instead of outsiders ’ wants and opinions .
Only then did the town became the success it is today .
It was the Allsopps and the Zinns and all the homesteaders in between , all derided as dirt poor , ignorant coal miners , who succeeded where all the big - brained intellectual titans of their time , combined with all the millions of dollars that the powerful could muster , utterly failed .
They made a successful go of it and 62 years after they bought control of their own destiny , drive into Preston County and try finding , in the opinion of my wife , a prettier town to look at .
It is they , the people of Arthurdale , who reminded us yet again what people can do when they are left to their own devices .
As generous with her money and time as Eleanor Roosevelt undoubtedly was , her money ( and the taxpayer funds she added to her own ) came with too high a price , and in the end what was truly needed for success was for she and her friends to simply stand aside and let the people of Arthurdale run the show .
It is a story that should n’t die .
~ Glenna Williams , original homesteader
Come Sunday morning , after a weekend walking among living , breathing history , I pointed the car east along I - 68 and headed back to New York City , noting again the disrespect shown to Arthurdale by the billboards and signs listing attractions deemed worthwhile , a category for which she is inexplicably considered unfit .
The town has slipped into that quiet , placid anonymity that the American small town excels at .
Most towns deserve no mention , Arthurdale , in contrast , deserves to have her name shouted from the hilltops .
Her story has much to teach us .
So now , three quarters of a century later , another outsider arrived among them , also in the midst of a depression , also from far off New York City , and if they have n’t grown tired of opinionated New Yorkers , I have to state mine that come next July ’s New Deal festival the people of Arthurdale should , as is their pleasure , honor Eleanor Roosevelt but that they should also , first and foremost , honor themselves .
The success of Arthurdale is their story , and no one else’s .

An acorn may not fall far from the tree , but the same cannot be said for a maple seed , with its distinctive wing shape .
As it falls , the heavier nut end of the wing causes it to whirl in the air , slowing its descent and allowing the wind to carry the seed , sometimes as far as a mile or more .
Studies have shown that the seed ’s whirling , called auto-rotation , gives it extra lift , but why this occurs has never been explained .
It took an aerospace engineer , David Lentink of Wagenigen University in the Netherlands , to figure it out .
Dr. Lentink , with Michael H. Dickinson of the California Institute of Technology and colleagues , report in Science that the wings generate a leading edge vortex  a spinning horizontal tunnel of air along the wing  as they descend .
This vortex is stable , Dr. Lentink said , because it has a low - pressure core that reduces the air pressure over the wing , causing the wing to be sucked up .
“ It really increases the lift , ” he said .

Dr. Lentink suspected that the seed might generate such vortexes ; many wings do , given the right conditions .
To prove it , he and his colleagues first created a model , a rotating robotic wing in mineral oil .
The model was dynamically scaled , meaning it matched the aerodynamics of a real seed in the air .

Nuclear plants like this one in Rockford , Illinois could become more commonplace in developing countries ( Image : Susan E. Benson / Rex Features )
For the first time in eight years , countries are contemplating giving nuclear stations carbon credits in the run-up to the crucial world summit on climate change in Copenhagen in December .
This could greatly boost prospects of a global nuclear expansion .
Draft text currently under negotiation at climate change talks by 182 countries in Bonn , Germany , includes an option to make nuclear facilities eligible for funding from 2012 under two schemes meant to help poorer countries develop low - carbon technologies : the Clean Development Mechanism ( CDM ) and Joint Implementation .
Nuclear power was excluded from these schemes under the Kyoto protocol in 2001 , after opposition from European and developing countries .
Now the nuclear industry is hoping to overturn that , and open the door for funding to flow to nuclear stations across the developing world .

“ The whole world will benefit if we can encourage developing countries to meet their rapidly increasing energy needs through low - carbon technologies like nuclear energy , drawing on international support , ” says Jonathan Cobb , from the World Nuclear Association ( WNA ) .
New figures from the association reveal that the amount of nuclear electricity generated globally in 2008 was the lowest for five years because of a number of decommissions .
The WNA is , however , expecting a “ new wave of nuclear build ” after 2012 .
‘ Safety and security issues ’
But , “ it ’s a survival strategy for the nuclear industry not the planet ” , according to Shaun Burnie , a nuclear energy consultant and former Greenpeace campaigner :
He estimates that carbon credits could cut the capital cost of building new nuclear stations by up to 40 % .
Climate change experts are cautious .
Kevin Anderson , director of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research at Manchester and East Anglia universities in the UK , has “ serious reservations ” about the CDM .
However , he thinks that nuclear power should be considered “ provided safety and security issues are satisfactorily addressed ” .
Robert Stavins , director of a project on international climate agreements at Harvard University , argues that a “ carefully designed ” provision to include nuclear power could be “ helpful ” in combating climate change .
“ But the promotion of nuclear power also brings with it a host of other environmental concerns , ” he says .
The United Nations - backed tribunal in Cambodia has heard how up to 200 children were among the thousands of prisoners processed and killed at the Khmer Rouge 's most infamous detention centre .
Sous
Thy , a former guard and bookkeeper at the S - 21 prison , says between 100 and 200 children were separated from their parents who were brought to the camp during the Khmer Rouge rule .
Although prison records were kept for adults , Sous
Thy says no such records were kept of the children .
They were bludgeoned to death in the Killing Fields on the outskirts of the capital .
This is the first time that a number has been put on the children killed at the camp , and the prison was just one of hundreds used by the communist government in the mid-1970s .
The court has also heard that prisoners were often drawn of their blood before being killed .
NEW YORK — Irene Prusik has been dead for six years .
But in April , someone showed up at the Department of Motor Vehicles in Brooklyn to renew her driver ’s license .
The explanation given by prosecutors rivals the Hitchcock classic “ Psycho ” :
It was her son , in drag .
Thomas Parkin , 49 , was charged today in the bizarre plot to impersonate his deceased mother so he could collect $ 117,000 in government benefits .
He and the man accused of being his accomplice , Mhilton Rimolo , pleaded not guilty to grand larceny , criminal impersonation and other charges .
Both men were ordered held on $ 1 million bail .
Their lawyers did not immediately respond to phone messages left on Wednesday .
District Attorney Charles Hynes said the scam , first reported in the Daily News , was “ unparalleled in its scope and brazenness . ”
Authorities claim that following his arrest , Parkin told them that because he held Prusik when she breathed her last breath , “ I am my mother . ”
Parkin , who lived with his mother , was accused of hatching the scheme after she passed away in 2003 at age 73 .
He managed to conceal the death by falsifying her death certificate , then collected $ 52,000 from her $ 700 - a- month Social Security checks over the next six years , prosecutors said .
Authorities say Parkin also got another $ 65,000 in rent subsidies by falsely claiming he had a disability and that his mother was still alive and was his landlord .
Parkin used his friend Rimolo to pose as the mother ’s nephew when going to cash checks and do other business , prosecutors said .
A security camera photo from the DMV office shows a frail - looking Parkin in a wig and dark glasses , Rimolo by his side , as he fills out paperwork .
The ruse began to unravel amid a dispute over the mother ’s home , which was sold at foreclosure in 2003 .
Parkin challenged the purchase by suing the new owner on his mother ’s behalf so he would n’t be evicted .
As the property dispute dragged out , both sides eventually contacted the district attorney to accuse each other of fraud .
By the time investigators arranged a meeting with the family in May , they already had proof Prusik was dead : a photo of her tombstone in a local cemetery .
The investigators played along as Parkin showed up for the interview “ wearing a red cardigan , lipstick , manicured nails and breathing through an oxygen tank , ” prosecutors said .

Ever miss your daily cup of coffee and subsequently get a pounding headache ?
According to reports from consumers of coffee and other caffeinated products , caffeine withdrawal is often characterized by a headache , fatigue , feeling less alert , less energetic and experiencing difficulty concentrating .
Researchers from the University of Vermont College of Medicine and Johns Hopkins School of Medicine sought to investigate the biological mechanisms of caffeine withdrawal in a paper published recently in the online edition of the scientific journal Psychopharmacology .
They looked at brain electrical activity and blood flow during caffeine withdrawal to examine what was taking place physiologically during acute caffeine abstinence , including the likely mechanism underlying the common " caffeine withdrawal headache . "
The group examined caffeine 's effects in a double - blind study , which involved the administration of caffeine and placebo capsules .
Each participant 's response to the caffeine or placebo was measured using three different measures — brain electrical activity via electroencephalogram ( EEG ) ; blood flow velocity in the brain via ultrasound ; and participants ' self - reports of subjective effects via questionnaires .
The team demonstrated that stopping daily caffeine consumption produces changes in cerebral blood flow velocity and quantitative EEG that are likely related to the classic caffeine withdrawal symptoms of headache , drowsiness and decreased alertness .
More specifically , acute caffeine abstinence increased brain blood flow , an effect that may account for commonly reported withdrawal headaches .
Acute caffeine abstinence also produced changes in EEG ( increased theta rhythm ) that has previously been linked to the common withdrawal symptom of fatigue .
Consistent with this , volunteers reported increases in measures of " tired , " " fatigue , " " sluggish " and " weary . "
Overall , these findings provide the most rigorous demonstration to date of physiological effects of caffeine withdrawal .
The researchers also discovered a provocative and somewhat unexpected finding — that there were no net benefits associated with chronic caffeine administration .
" In addition to looking at caffeine withdrawal , this rigorous design also permitted comparison of chronic caffeine maintenance with chronic placebo maintenance , which provides unique information about the extent to which there are net beneficial effects of daily caffeine administration , " said Stacey Sigmon , Ph.D. , research associate professor of psychiatry at the University of Vermont and first author on the study .
" In contrast to what most of us coffee lovers would think , our study showed no difference between when the participant was maintained on chronic placebo and when the participant was stabilized on chronic caffeine administration .
What this means is that consuming caffeine regularly does not appear to produce any net beneficial effects , based on the measures we examined . "

Mr Gatti had retired from professional boxing in 2007
The former world boxing champion Arturo Gatti killed himself and was not murdered , say Brazilian investigators .
Mr Gatti was found on 11 July , in a hotel in north - eastern Brazil where he had been staying with his wife and son .
Shortly afterwards , his wife , Amanda Rodrigues , was arrested on suspicion of strangling Mr Gatti with the strap from her handbag .
A court has now ordered her release after the investigation found that Mr Gatti probably hanged himself .
Police at the time had said there were inconsistencies in the statement Ms Rodrigues gave to them and that she had not explained how she stayed in the hotel room for 10 hours after he died .
Her lawyer , Celio Avelino , said it " would have been impossible for her to suspend and hang a man of that size " .
Mr Gatti was IBF super - featherweight champion in 1995 and WBC light - welterweight champion in 2004 , and retired in 2007 .

PAUL KRUGMAN , who won last year 's Nobel prize in economics for his work on trade , wrote in 1993 : “ What a country really gains from trade is the ability to import things it wants .
Exports are not an objective in and of themselves ; the need to export is a burden that a country must bear because its import suppliers are crass enough to demand payment . ”
This view does not dominate the public debate .
Most are thrilled by the idea of export growth , but cower at the prospect of more imports .
Such prejudice certainly prevailed in India in 1991 , when the IMF foisted tariff cuts on the economy as one of the conditions attached to a $ 2.5 billion bail - out package .
Pessimists fretted that a flood of imports would destroy Indian industry .
For a group of American economists * , however , that sudden trade liberalisation has provided an unusually clear lens through which to study the way that commerce affects the economy .
This is precisely because it was externally imposed .
That the government had to hew to the IMF 's diktats and slash tariffs across the board gave industries little scope to jockey for exemptions .
This made the researchers confident that tariff cuts , and not differences in industries ' ability to lobby the government , were responsible for changes in India 's trade patterns after liberalisation .
As part of those reforms , India slashed tariffs on imports from an average of 90 % in 1991 to 30 % in 1997 .
Not surprisingly , imports doubled in value over this period .
But the effects on Indian manufacturing were not what the prophets of doom had predicted : output grew by over 50 % in that time .
And by looking carefully at what was imported and what it was used to make , the researchers found that cheaper and more accessible imports gave a big boost to India 's domestic industrial growth in the 1990s .
This was because the tariff cuts meant more than Indian consumers being able to satisfy their cravings for imported chocolate ( though they did that , too ) .
It gave Indian manufacturers access to a variety of intermediate and capital goods which had earlier been too expensive .
The rise in imports of intermediate goods was much higher , at 227 % , than the 90 % growth in consumer - goods imports in the 13 years to 2000 .
Theory suggests several ways in which greater access to imports can improve domestic manufacturing .
First , cheaper imports may allow firms to produce existing goods using the same inputs as before , but at a lower cost .
They could also open up new ways of producing existing goods , and even allow entirely new goods to be made .
All this seemed to hold in India .
For example , its prolific film industry had continued to make some black - and - white films into the 1970s , in part because of the difficulty of importing enough supplies of colour film .
But proving whether the theory applies in practice requires more detailed data , not just about how much firms produced but what they produced , and how all this changed over time .
Most attempts at addressing these questions have foundered because such information is not available .
But with India , the researchers were helped , perversely enough , by highly restrictive industrial policies that the country had introduced in the 1950s .
These included rules that required companies to report to the authorities every little tweak to their product mix — a burden for firms , but a gold mine for researchers .
Happily , the economists found that the data backed up the theory : lower import tariffs did lead to an expansion in product variety through access to new inputs .
They found that about 66 % of the growth in India 's imports of intermediate goods after liberalisation came from goods the country had simply not bought when its trade regime was more restrictive .
These new inputs caused the price of intermediate goods to fall by 4.7 % per year after 1989 .
And detailed data linking inputs to final goods showed that the imports led to an explosion in the variety of products made by Indian manufacturers ; the average firm made 1.4 products before liberalisation , but by 2003 , this had increased to 2.3 .
The increases in variety were largest for industries where the input tariffs were cut most , and these industries also saw increased spending on research and development .
Overall , the new products that Indian companies introduced were responsible for 25 % of the growth in the country 's manufacturing output between 1991 and 1997 .
Slash and churn
But one aspect of India 's experience after trade liberalisation did not conform to what the researchers had expected .
Normally , as new products are introduced , some older ones stop being made .
This “ churn ” in the market is part of what makes people uncomfortable about lower trade barriers , because it may cause difficult adjustments for some workers or companies .
But the Indian variant of creative destruction seemed unusually benign .
The researchers found that firms rarely dropped products .
One reason for this may be the diversity of India 's economy : there is always a segment lower down the economic pecking order which is happy to buy products that richer consumers scoff at .
This may be unique to countries like India where many levels of development co-exist .
But Penny Goldberg , one of the authors , thinks that the methods used in the studies on India can be applied to many other countries where trade has been similarly liberalised and which have good data on firms , such as Colombia and Indonesia .
She notes that one of her co-authors , Amit Khandelwal , visited a Coca - Cola bottling plant in China , and noticed that all the machinery was either Japanese or German .
China , of course , is known as a big exporter .
But it may never have achieved this success without access to a range of imports .

Technology.am ( July 1 , 2009 ) —
The technological trends change very fast .
If you are not able to change with technology then new technology makes you outdated .
So , we have to keep an eye on the past and future trends of technology .
Initially an idea makes a concept which in turn takes shape and then we see the products based on that concept in the coming days , months or year .
Enlisted below are such concept laptops which may be a trend of our future .
Fujitsu ’s Turn Table PC
Aspiring DJs to scratch and spin digital media files on the Turn Table PC , a prototype of a combo system from Fujitsu that can serve as a notebook or as a digital turntable .
The design calls for a 20 - inch LCD screen that can be folded closed to use the turntable function .
Users control the turntable by a touch screen on the outside of the notebook ’s lid .
Also in the future tech department , Fujistu showed the Ultra Mobile , a handheld computer with a touch screen that includes a built - in digital camera , a digital music player , and support for wireless Internet access .
The same size as a CD jewel case , the Ultra Mobile uses a novel method to turn the system on and off : users rotate the front half of the machine –including the screen – 45 degrees , changing the computer ’s shape from a square to a star .

Toting extra keys inside for gaming , the half - pint lappy also packs in a finger print reader , so all your data ’s secure should it slip down the back of a stranger ’s sofa .
Compenion Laptop Concept
Felix Schmidberger design for a laptop for 2015 with OLED touch screen .
It consists of two sliding OLED screens , one of which can be used as a keyboard , where necessary .
Our opinion is that while this is the nicest looking concept we have seen , we suspect that innovation will outstrip this vision significantly by then .
Frog Concept Design
The Gelfrog converges style and function .
The final product is rugged , yet flexible enough to be used in the classroom , in the urban jungle , or on the nature trail .
Encased in a smart skin , the gelfrog displays image content from a mobile mirror , photo slide show , video projector and everything in between .

Through video capture capabilities and just - in - time data library access , the gelfrog is both a journal of student experiences and a window to new worlds .
Canvas Laptop Concept Designed By Kyle Cherry
It is a futuristic concept laptop that is supposed to provide a better quality for the designer and also its said that it will raise the productive rate of the artist .
It will feature a very thin touchscreen and the other components will look just about the same but they will be better adjusted .
OLPC Hinged Laptop
The OLPC engineers and partners were most interested in the designs that more closely resembled a traditional laptop .
Yet the machine also had to double as an e-book and be easily portable .
So as the designers continued to develop the concept through physical models , they evaluated how each possible architecture would perform in each mode and transform between them .

Thinkpad reserve edition
Lenovo have a dedicated website for the Thinkpad reserve edition .
When IBM handed all of their laptop division to Lenovo , many feared that the classic Thinkpad design would lose its way .
While the reserve edition smacks of the type of design common to limited editions it is nonetheless a very interesting machine .
Traveller Laptop by Nikita Golovlev
This is not a laptop purse , but we include it because it shows a foldable screen , something that we are surprised that has n’t been played around with more in concept designs .

Canova Dual Screen Laptop
The Canova dual screen laptop may look like two chunky light boxes hinged together , but its an idea that is repeated in many concept designs these days , and who knows , perhaps Apple are working on something like this .
That would surely blow away the Optimus Maximus keyboard .
HP Concept Laptop
In October 2006 HP ’s CTO of the HP Personal Systems Group , Phil McKinney showed several of HP ’s recent concept designs .
If this laptop prototype is anything to go by then HP have some much nicer designs on the way .
Samsung Amoled Concept
Its concept notebook by Samsung features a unique design which is thin and sleek and a touch - sensitive keyboard which lacks tactile feedback .
The Graphite Executive Laptop Concept
At the heart of the machine are two thin layers of metal .
These layers incorporate all of the electromechanical elements needed to drive the computational and software functionality .
This substructure element is also secured to the outer metal clamshell rings .
These rings help capture the smoked plastic enclosures that seal the unit completely .
Since the laptop sends and receives all information wirelessly , it can be seamless with no cracks , crevices , or plugs to allow moisture or debris inside .
Concept Foldable Laptop/ PDA
It has been a while since we featured a concept piece on TFTS , primarily because little of what we have come across of late has particularly inspired us – but that ’s certainly not the case when it comes to this concept PDA
unit which , from an aesthetic standpoint alone , certainly hits the mark .
LG notebook fuel cell system
Designed for notebooks , the fuel cell will also be able to power handheld devices such as portable media players and mobile phones , LG Chem said , by connecting to their USB ports .
Still , LG
Chem ’s prototype is n’t exactly compact , as the company ’s photos show .
It said the fuel - cell unit weighs under 1kg .
MacTab
It is the complement to MyBook in the high - end .
The incredibly thin wireless keyboard is used as a protection cover for transportation .
It stays in place with a combination of magnets and notches .
Vaio Zoom
Vaio Zoom notebook features a holographic glass screen that goes transparent and a keyboard that turns opaque when turned off .
Turn it on and the touchscreen holographic festivities begin .
Macbook 0801
Macbook 0801 concept laptop by Isamu Sanada is more like a black version of the now Macbook Air .
It also features an ultra - thin keyboard and a very sleek design .
A 16 - year - old mother who tried to strike a police officer with a baby stroller , with her child inside , was charged with aggravated assault in Lebanon , police say .
The incident began at 8:55 p.m. Tuesday with conflicting reports of 2 - year - old being taken by a woman in the area of Seventh and Lehman streets , police said .
A police officer in the 500 block of Lehman Street was told the child had been recovered , and another officer observed a female holding a baby in the area .
Police said they saw another female grab the baby , place it in a stroller and walk away quickly .
Police told the female to step to confirm her identity and relationship to the child , but were met with resistance and loud profanities , police said .
When a police officer tried to physically stop the female , she used the stroller to try to strike the officer in the legs , and used it as a tool to prevent her detention , police said .
The police officer realized the baby in the stroller was not secured properly and was attempting to keep the baby from falling out when the female lost control of the stroller , police said .
It started rolling toward Lehman Street , and another officer prevented it from reaching the street and regained control of the stroller , police said .
The 16 year - old girl who was determined to be the baby 's mother was charged with aggravated assault , recklessly endangering another person , resisting arrest and underage drinking , and was referred to Lebanon County Juvenile Probation Department , police said .
The baby was unharmed and was turned over to the custody of a grandmother .
One police officer received minor injuries in the incident .
A 17 - year - old Lebanon girl involved in the incident was charged with disorderly conduct and underage drinking and released .
PASADENA - Getting stuck is never fun , especially when you ’re over 30 million miles from Earth .
NASA ’s Spirit rover is mired in dirt on Mars and now scientists at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory are working hard to free the over - worked robot .
Spirit first ran afoul of the Martian surface on May 6 when it hit some patches of dirt that made its wheels spin in place .
Now the wheels ( two of which are not working properly ) are sunk in up to their hubcaps .
Like a remote Auto Club for robots , JPL engineers have built a sandbox filled with a mixture of materials that closely mimic the consistency of Martian soil as well as a rock to high - center the rover .
They 've driven a replica of the Spirit into the box and are working diligently to figure out the best way to escape the talcum - like trap – a technique used with Spirit 's twin rover , Opportunity , back in 2005 when it also became stuck .
The first Mars Exploration Rover landed on the red planet in January 2004 .
Initially , the mission was supposed to last 90 Martian days , but Spirit exceeded that by over 20 times .
Thanks to a recent dust storm , the fine dust that coated Spirit ’s solar panels was blown off and it has been operating at full power for months now .
If this latest obstacle can be overcome , Spirit can keep exploring even longer .
Read on to see how the JPL scientists created a little piece of Mars on Earth and get up close and personal with Spirit 's predicament .
Above : A JPL technician attaches a grounding strap to the rover before measuring the distance it traveled during the previous move .

The test - bed where the rover will attempt its escape is separated by a plastic sheet and positive pressure to keep the dust out of the other side of the lab .
You ca n’t see it , but behind the white plastic sheet the Mars Science Lab rover is being constructed .
In the photo above , it 's early on in the construction process and only a few loads of soil have been added .
The lab floor is covered with a fine gravel to provide a malleable base for the sandbox .

Originally NASA had planned to use some simulated Martian soil they had created for previous testing .
Unfortunately the huge pile of soil was left outside .
The rain and elements washed away the fine particulate matter leaving behind a blend too coarse to accurately simulate the type of soil Spirit is stuck in .
A box of volcanic rocks of terrestrial origin await being put into use as “ the one " – the Earth counterpart of the pesky rock that has Spirit in a jam .

To mimic the fine soil in which the Spirit is caught , a mixture of Lincoln Fire Clay – normally used to create sewer pipes – and other ceramics are mixed with food - grade amorphous silica .
Amorphous silica , also known as Fossil Shell Flour , is used as an anti-caking agent for livestock feed .
A cement mixer is used to combine the fire clay and silica to get the right consistency .

The Spirit rover has some specialized tools for exploring the surface of Mars including drills that can bore into rocks and take samples .
The terrestrial rock above displays marks from the drill .
Apparently there are rovers crossing the street at JPL , although the only rovers seen were inside the lab .
While our imaginations immediately think JPL +
Restricted Area = Alien Cover - up , the red tape is likely just to keep bystanders from breathing in too much dust .

Once the soil has been mixed for a few minutes it is transferred into a wheelbarrow and taken into the lab where it is dumped into the sandbox ; an engineer then smoothes out the simulated soil in preparation for the next load .

Inside the sandbox the rover struggles to get free .
Moving only fractions of an inch for every few meters the wheels turn , the rover will not have an easy time getting out of its predicament .
An engineer waits with a safety stop button in case anything goes horribly wrong , but the process is fairly uneventful .
The intricate rover , covered with gold foil , appears to strain its neck while attempting to look under its belly at the large rock on which it 's stuck .

The rover ’s wheels provide little traction in the fine , loose soil it is trapped in .
Like being stuck in sand in your car , spinning the wheels tends to just dig you in deeper .
The Spirit 's wheels are having trouble gaining traction in a patch of loose dirt .
The rover can communicate directly with earth using its aim - able , disk - shaped , high - gain antenna .
Photos : Dave Bullock / Wired.com
Since these photos were taken , engineers and scientists at JPL / NASA have tried out several other techniques for freeing Spirit , including a backwards motion and a crab - like walk with the wheels turned at an angle .
Once the team has a plan they 're confident with , they 'll transmit the directions to Spirit and watch what happens .
The engineers predict that they 'll have such a plan in a few weeks .
Even if Spirit remains trapped , it has already greatly exceeded its mission on Mars and sent back vast amounts of important data .
They were just about coming to terms with relegation , but now the kit has really hit the fan .
Just when the Geordies thought life could n't get any worse , along came the unveiling of Newcastle 's new yellow strip , which prompted more scoffing than Big Sam at a doughnut convention .
One fan likened it to a deckchair on Blackpool beach , while another described it as " a side - on view of a custard cream " .
The official club website preferred to describe the strip as a " stylish new change kit " , although it was unclear how many supporters had taken up the ' 20 % off ' introductory offer plastered all over the front page .
Mark Jensen , editor of fanzine The Mag , was a model of diplomacy as he admitted : " It 's certainly different ! "
Jensen told The Daily Telegraph : " My take on kits is as long as they 're not red and white , I 'm not really that bothered .
There 's certainly no chance of getting lost in the snow when we play Barnsley in December . "
Other fans were not so forgiving .
Joe on the Tyne Talk messageboard said : " I think I just threw up a bit " , while lostmekeys observed : " This from a guy who made a billion quid selling t- shirts . "
But while the photoshop whizzkids had a field day ( right ) and The Sun quickly trotted out their worst kits of all time feature , it seemed the players were quite happy with the ' yellow peril ' .
A statement from kit makers Adidas read : " The feedback from both the players and the club has been extremely positive - vibrant colours are very popular at the moment . "
And the kit also had the backing of Ryan Jenkins , a ( wait for it ) Sunderland fan .
He said : " It 's really appalling - I love it .
It looks like Norwich and Blackpool got into a fight and this was the leftovers .
Newcastle will have to call themselves the Toongerines . "
In the words of Coldplay 's Chris Martin : " Oh what a thing to do - and it was all yellow . "
Newcastle fans were n't the only ones getting shirty over their new strip .
Man
Utd supporters were demanding an inquest into their latest jersey , a month before it is due to hit the shops .
The traditional red shirt is emblazoned with a black chevron , apparently to mark the centenary of Old Trafford , although fans moaned it was more suited to rugby league .
On the bright side , at least Paul Scholes will be allowed six tackles next season .
Fans on United forum Talking Reds were struggling to find any positives .
Under the topic heading ' Who let a drunk person design the kit ? ' , Gavinio suggested the new design was the real reason Ronaldo left ( and with Real Madrid reportedly inserting a £ 1bn transfer clause into his contract , he 's unlikely to be back in a hurry - chevron or no chevron ) .
But while the two Uniteds got in a lather about their strips , spare a thought for poor old Stockport County , who may not have a kit for the coming season due to an ongoing debt problem .
Never mind , chaps , if the protests in Manchester and Newcastle grow any louder , you may have a couple to choose from come August .
Meanwhile over at Celtic there was a shirt problem of a different kind .
When six - year - old fan Matthew Smith asked to get the name of new goalkeeper Lukasz Zaluska on the back of his top , the staff in the club shop admitted they had never heard of the Pole .
Matthew said : " I told them he was joining in the summer from Dundee United and the shop manager had to go on the internet to find out how to spell his name . "
I must admit I 've never heard of him either , but it will come in quite handy next time I play Scrabble .
Over at Wimbledon ( yes it 's been a slow news week ) Roger Federer entered the fray wearing a gold - braided white military jacket with a giant matching handbag .
According to Nike , the outfit " retained the stylistic cues which make him stand out from the other players . "
I prefer the shortened version - ' Emperor 's New Clothes ' .
Andy Murray was doing his best to lose his moody tag by turning up for practice wearing a cricket helmet and Twittering about snack names for tennis players .
Prawn Borg , Egg Rusedski and Lleyton Chewit were among my favourites ( incidentally Lleyton backwards is , curiously , ' Not yell ' ) but Boris Double - decker might need a bit more work .
I 'll throw one in for the older viewers - Chilli Nastase anyone ?
But the revelation of the tournament thus far came from John Kettley on Radio Wimbledon , who confessed his ringtone was ... John Kettley Is A Weatherman .
Almost as funny as the ' Liverpool sign Bent ' viral doing the rounds ( above ) and the joke Twittered by Gavin and Stacey star Matthew Horne : " Earlier today I saw a Newcastle season - ticket nailed to a tree .
I thought ' I 'm having that !' ' cos you can never have enough nails , can you ? "
Before I go , a quick congratulations to John Terry , who has just been voted Daddy of the Year .
Word of warning though , JT - last year 's winner was ... Peter Andre .
And finally , you may have heard about the release of the BBC bigwigs ' expenses claims ( no I have n't , before anyone asks ) .
The one that particularly caught my eye was the invoice for £ 14.99 submitted by Deputy Director - General Mark Byford for a QPR history book .
Shocking I 'm sure you 'll agree - £ 14.99 for that ?!
I could have provided him with what he needed for free , using one sentence - League Cup winners 1967 .

I have been working with Apple ’s Push Notification service recently and decided to make a library to send notifications with Haskell .
It is very simple and has a few helpers to make notifications with an alert , sound , etc , .
ApplePush Hackage
ApplePush Documentation
When using the library , you must use an SSL tunnel , because Haskell ’s SSL support is incomplete .
I use stunnel4 , which works great , and offloads the SSL processing as well .
Here are some basic instructions on getting started with the library .
Stunnel setup
Download your certificate from Apple .
If you are using a Mac , export the certificate ( .cer ) into a directory .
Also , export your private key as a . p12 file .
Stunnel needs the certificate / key in one file , in the following format :
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY ----- YOUR KEY -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY ----- -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- YOUR CERTIFICATE
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
Run the following commands to convert and concatenate your certificate / private key .
openssl x509 - in cert.cer - inform DER - outform PEM - out cert.pem openssl pkcs12 - in key .
p12 - out key.pem - nodes cat key.pem cert.pem > certs.pem
Create a file called tun.conf , which will configure stunnel .
client = yes debug = 5 foreground = no pid = tun.pid [ service ] accept = 2195 connect = gateway.sandbox.push.apple.com:2195 cert = certs.pem
This will bind stunnel to the local port 2195 , and tunnel traffic via SSL to gateway.sandbox.push.apple.com:2195 .
Next run the following command to start stunnel .
stunnel tun.conf
ApplePush Haskell Library
Let 's update our cabal packages , and then install .
cabal update cabal install ApplePush
In addition to the library , an application , called applepushtest , is also installed so that you can test the library and your SSL tunnel setup .
Let 's try it out .
c10k : ~ chris$ ~/.cabal/bin/applepushtest Apple Push Test , Version 0.1 usage : applepushtest device_token ( hex )
You must pass a parameter , device_token , to the application .
This tells the library which device to send the notification to .
This token must be retrieved in your client application using registerForRemoteNotificationTypes :.
Once you have your token , run the following command .
c10k : ~ chris$ ~/.cabal/bin/applepushtest ( yourtoken ) Device Token : ( yourtoken ) Message > hey Message > whats up ?
Message > test !!
Message >
To use the library in your application , check out Main .hs for an example .
Flemish farmers decided not to join the protest .
The protest was timed to coincide with a European Commission report on the dairy industry .
The farmers are demanding a reduction in milk quotas , but the European Commission ( EC ) is not inclined to meet this demand .
The farmers ' protests caused severe traffic disruption across Brussels .
Four hundred tractors converged on the Belgian capital at times blocking intersections and arteries into the city .
Is now rather obvious .
The dollar goes down as well as up .
Last fall , demand for dollars rose -- in part because Americans pulled funds out of the rest of the world faster than foreigners pulled funds out of the US .
The dollar soared .
As the crisis abated though , demand for US financial assets fell and Americans regained their appetite for the world ’s financial assets .
Not surprising , over the last few months , the dollar has depreciated .
And since -- at least for now -- China ’s currency is tightly pegged to the dollar , the RMB also has depreciated .
Fairly significantly .
The real exchange rate index produced by the BIS suggests that , in real terms , the RMB is back where it was last June .
That is when China more or less gave up on its policy of letting the RMB appreciate against the dollar and went back to something that looks like a simple dollar peg .
Does the RMB ’s recent depreciation matter ?
I think so .
To start , China looks to be leading the world out of the current slump .
That normally would result in an appreciating , not a depreciating , currency .
As importantly , there is now plenty of evidence that a weak RMB does have an impact on the pattern of global trade .
A big impact .
The boom in China ’s exports that characterized this decade came after the dollar ’s 2002 - 2004 depreciation produced a significant real depreciation of China ’s RMB -- a depreciation that came just as a host of internal reforms pushed China ’s own productivity up .
The net result : a huge export boom .*
The average rate of growth in China ’s exports in the years that followed the RMB ’s depreciation was certainly far higher than the average rate of growth in the years when a a strong ( and rising ) dollar produced a strong ( and rising ) RMB .
Yes , the 1997 - 2002 period includes a US recession and the 2003 - 2007 period does n’t .
But the recovery started in 2002 , so looking at the 1997 - 02 period picks up a recovery as well as a recession .
And the 2003 -2007 period was also influenced by a US slowdown -- as for that matter is the 2003 - 2008 ** period .
The US economy , remember , started to cool at the end of 2006 .
I do n’t think that much stronger average US growth in 03-07 ( or 03-08 ) relative to 97-02 is the best explanation for the difference in the average rate of growth in China ’s exports over these two periods .
To be sure , the weak RMB is n’t the only driver of China ’s export success .
But the host of factors that make China an exporting powerhouse -- increasingly skilled labor , a growing network of firms that supply needed components , a lot of accumulated know - how in manufacturing , good infrastructure and the like -- normally would push the real exchange rate up .
It took the combination of all these ingredients and the RMB ’s real depreciation from 2002 - 2005 to generate the mother of all export booms .
And to me it is surprising that China ’s real exchange rate at the end of June 2008 is n’t any higher than it was in late 2001 or early 2002 .
In every other respect China is a very different place .
Lest we forget , in 2001 China ’s exports only totaled $ 270 billion .
That total was brought down by the US recession , but in 2002 , China ’s exports were still only $ 325 billion .
By 2008 they had reached $ 1425 billion .
They are falling now , but it was still a phenomenal increase -- and one that in my view was the product , at least in part , of a slew of Chinese government policies , including the decision to intervene heavily to limit the RMB ’s appreciation against the often depreciating dollar , that favored export growth over domestic demand growth .
As Simon Johnson observes , China itself made the decision to accumulate a huge pile of dollar and euro reserves , reserves that now clearly far exceed what China needs to guarantee its own financial stability .
Remember , when exports were booming , China was running a tight fiscal policy and limiting domestic lending - - and thus restraining domestic demand growth .
As the following graph -- from David Boucher of the University of Montreal -- shows , the loan to deposit ratio in China ’s banks was generally falling during China ’s export boom .
That was especially true from 2004 on , after Chinese policy makers opted to curb domestic inflation -- which picked up in 2003 -- by restraining lending rather than by letting the RMB appreciate .
China could have opted for a different macroeconomic policy mix back then -- one that might have limited the growth in China ’s current account surplus .
That in turn would have meant that China was less able to supply the US with financing , something that might have helped the US avoid a few of its own financial excesses .
UPDATE :
Don requested data on export and import growth .
Here is the data , shown as a y/y change in billions of dollars in a 3 m moving average of China ’s exports and imports v the real exchange rate .
Import growth failed to keep up with export from the end of 2003 to the end of 2007 , something that I attribute to the combination of the depreciation in China ’s RER from a level of 110 or above on the BIS index to a level consistently below 100 on the BIS index and China ’s fateful decision to make a nominal renminbi depreciation consistent with low inflation by restraining lending growth and tightening fiscal policy .
The moves in China ’s imports since 2007 were strong influenced by gyrations in the price of oil , and then the global collapse of trade .
Not surprisingly , China ’s trade surplus was rising during this period .
The following charts shows the y/y change in China ’s rolling 3 m trade surplus , also in dollar billion .
More recently , China ’s surplus moved up ( in q4 2008 ) and then fell ( in q2 2009 ) , which is presumably one reason why the IMF ’s forecasts of China ’s trade surplus -- as Menzie Chinn recently noted -- have n’t been all that stable .
* Exports are presented as a rolling 12 m sum , in $ billion .
** Technically , I looked at the average y/y growth in a 3 month moving average .
Adding 2008 to the data does n’t change much ; average export growth from 2003 to 2008 was 28 % .
Adding 2009 in will bring the average down , but sorting out cause and effect is a bit hard , as the RMB appreciated as the global economy slowed .
I would attribute most of the fall in China ’s exports to the slowdown , but that no doubt will be debated .
Opposition Leader Malcolm Turnbull is planning a broad reshuffle of his frontbench in a move the ABC understands is designed to regain some momentum .
His stocks are low at the moment and three opinion polls out this morning will be of no comfort .
Mr Turnbull needs some new momentum and Liberal sources have told AM Mr Turnbull is working on a broad frontbench reshuffle to announce over Parliament 's winter break to help provide that .
With senior Liberals questioning his judgement last week , putting it down to his lack of experience , it is believed he is looking at bringing some of the hard heads in the party much closer to the frontline .
Those more seasoned operators mentioned - Andrew Robb , Tony Abbott and Tony Smith - have all served in backroom roles before they entered Parliament .
Mr Abbott had a good week last week , leading the tactics inside Parliament and defending Mr Turnbull on the outside .
Sources say MPs and staff have all noted how good his performance was .
It is understood he may get his wish to move closer to the action in what is tipped to be a more combative role .
Mr Smith , who is currently in a junior economic portfolio may also be asked to step up - a reversal of fortunes for him after he voted for Brendan Nelson when Mr Turnbull took the leadership .
After last week , Liberal sources say they looked lean by comparison to the ruthless political machine they were up against .
Crushing poll results
The latest polls , taken at the end of last week and over the weekend , show potentially crushing news for Mr Turnbull .
While the Coalition 's ratings have fallen , Mr Turnbull 's have plummeted .
His approval in the Nielsen poll is down 11 points to 32 and his disapproval up by more to 60 .
In Newspoll his satisfaction rating has slumped by nearly half to 25 and his dissatisfaction rating has risen by a similar amount .
On the contrary , Labor 's stocks have risen across the board - in the Nielsen poll in the Sydney Morning Herald and The Age , the Galaxy poll in News Limited state papers and Newspoll in the Australian .
In both the major polls Mr Rudd is up and at 65 per cent or over as better prime minister , Mr Turnbull is down to 25 in the Nielsen poll and to 18 in Newspoll .
To add insult to injury in the Galaxy poll , only 7 per cent believe Mr Turnbull has been honest on the OzCar scandal .
Nearly five times more people believe Mr Rudd has been honest .
Overall the polls show Labor has widened its lead over the Coalition .
Newspoll has the ALP ahead by 56 per cent to 44 after preferences .
Mr Abbott has told AM Mr Turnbull 's performance in the polls is a result of " the firestorm of smear which the Labor Party directed against Malcolm Turnbull . "
Having lost a $ 20 bet to Deputy Leader Julia Gillard two weeks ago on Peter Costello 's future , Mr Rudd will be glad he did not put money on a prediction made to Rove McManus on Channel Ten about the effect of the OzCar affair .
" You know what happens when people throw mud , some of it sticks .
I 'm sure in the opinion polls we 'll see some damage , " Mr Rudd said .
" Now I 'm looking to get myself a car ; you know any good dealers in Queensland I could ...? "
McManus asked last night .
" Not off hand , but I 'm sure Malcolm Turnbull could email you some suggestions , " Mr Rudd responded .
Asked why he had not paid tax on the sale of the house he had designated as his second home for the purposes of his parliamentary allowances , Sir John said : “ It seemed to me that that was the house I had in order for me to get to London , so it was n’t unreasonable for me to use as my second home .
Amazing Hotel Lets You Sleep Among the Gods
When a travel agent offers you “ a peach of a hotel room , ” she ’s usually referring to the view or the size of the Jacuzzi .
But a hotel in China ’s Hebei province lends that expression a whole new meaning .
By conventional standards , the Tianzi Hotel , in Yanjiao , does n’t look like a place where you ’d spend a few nights on a business trip .
But that ’s just what it is : a colorful ten - story hotel in the shape of a familiar trinity of Chinese Taoist figures .
The giants are known as Fu , Lu , and Shou .
Their names translate as “ good fortune , ” “ prosperity , ” and “ longevity , ” traditionally considered the three attributes of a good life .
They in turn represent three important stars , which are said to embody these attributes .
The longevity concept gets a further boost from the peach in Shou ’s left hand .
Peaches , too , are a classic symbol of long life , but this one has a little something extra :
It ’s actually one of the hotel ’s suites , and the two holes in front are windows !
The Tianzi Hotel has been around since 2001 , and it reportedly landed some kind of Guinness Book record .
The question is , for what category ?
Fanciest Hotel Room that Looks an Awful Lot like a Peach ?
Largest Depiction of Three Mythical Figures that Also Features Room Service ?
Or maybe Scariest Hotel to Return To after Drinking Too Much at a Dinner with Clients ?

Help for Heroes takes to the road
By Victoria King
BBC News
The inaugural Band of Brothers bike ride last year raised £ 1.4 m On Sunday , 240 cyclists set out to pedal 350 miles across France .
The journey is a challenge for all those taking part , but especially for several of the riders who were wounded while serving in the Armed Forces in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The servicemen - and the rest of their two - wheeled colleagues - are trying to raise a large sum of money for forces ' charity Help for Heroes .
Their trip from Portsmouth will take them all the way to Paris and will hopefully beat last year 's total of £ 1.4 m .
Co-founder of Help the Heroes Bryn Parry told the BBC News website : " It 's so inspiring , cycling along beside these guys .
" They have shown unbelievable courage , but they do n't expect anything for it .
They do n't want sympathy , they just want opportunities .
They just want to be normal . "
' Breathing space '
Help for Heroes was created in 2007 and has so far raised more than £ 20 m , some £ 8 m of which has gone to build a new swimming pool and gym complex at Headley Court forces ' rehabilitation centre in Surrey .
I 'm trying to make people see that servicemen and women are the same people today as they were in 1944
Bryn Parry , Help for Heroes Bryn is hoping funds raised by the Band of Brothers bike ride will make a significant dent in the next £ 20 m - needed to build seven Hero Recovery Centres at garrison towns across the UK .
These " half - way houses " , as he calls them , will have space for 20 servicemen or women at a time and the first will open in Edinburgh in August .
" We want to give injured personnel some breathing space , " he said .
" When they 've been to Headley Court , but are n't ready to go back to their battalion or civilian life .
" It 'll be a really nice , warm environment .
Each person will have their own room , their own bathroom .
There 'll be carers on hand in case they need anything .
" Then every day each resident will have an individually tailored programme , depending on their personal ambition or injury .
" They might want to carry on in the military , say as a clerk , so they 'll go back into the garrison for re-skilling .
Others , who want to move on , will be given the chance to do work experience or take part in off - site training .
" The idea is that it will be a place of transit , where they can be helped back to life , whether it be civilian or military . "
Emma and Bryn Parry founded Help for Heroes in 2007 Reservist Trooper Adam Cocks is one of those cycling the route .
The 26 - year - old , from Parsons Green in south - west London , is a member of the Territorial Army .
He will take part in the ride using a hand bike - pedalling with his arms not his legs - because of injuries he suffered in Afghanistan .
Adam said : " I 've been training with the hand bike for about eight weeks , but the hills are still going to be an absolute killer .
" I 'm determined to get up them unaided though . "
While on operations in Afghanistan in 2007 , Adam 's vehicle struck a mine and his leg was severely damaged .
Since then he has endured eight operations and is still not able to use it properly .
" When I came back from Afghanistan I knew I wanted to do something for Help the Heroes , " he said .
" It 's such a great charity and produces real tangible results .
" I think the recovery centres are vital .
They 'll be a stepping stone and hopefully help people cope with the mental injuries as well as the physical ones . "
Pegasus Bridge Just a couple of weeks before the 65th anniversary of D - Day , the race has added poignancy because it takes in some key World War II battle sites .
Leaving Portsmouth , the riders were waved off by actor Ross Kemp , who has recently become a patron of Help for Heroes and has spent extended periods with British troops in Afghanistan .
Once on French soil , they will wind their way to Paris via a number of battlefield sites , paying tribute to the different Allied nations as they go .
Remembering the Americans , they will visit Omaha beach , scene of the D - Day landings .
On British Day , they will enjoy a spectacular fly - past before heading to Pegasus Bridge , where the first house to be liberated from the Germans in June 1944 still stands .
Adam , top right , organised a charity rugby match for Help for Heroes
There the cyclists will be accompanied across the bridge by pipers and a bugler sounding The Advance .
Days four and five of the trip will remember the Canadian , Polish and French efforts and will involve former members of the French resistance .
Bryn says he wants people to be proud of both the more distant and more recent contributions to Britain 's Armed Forces .
" I 'm trying to make people see that servicemen and women are the same people today as they were in 1944 , " he said .
" All those qualities - like determination , humour , valour , bravery - that we think of as belonging to a lost generation are still alive and well .
" One guy said to me on last year 's ride , ' Look , I 'm not disabled , I just have n't got an arm . '
It 's that sort of attitude . "

Ahmadinejad 's bag of tricks is eerily like that of Karl Rove - the constant use of fear , the exploitation of religion , the demonization of liberals , the deployment of Potemkin symbolism like Sarah Palin :
Ahmadinejad made an advertising movie of himself and his family which was very effective among the masses .
His simple life is similar to low income people .
This is despite the fact that during his first term some people acquired a lot of wealth because of Ahmadinejad ’s bad economic decisions , housing prices during the last four years tripled , industrial production decreased , many factories closed and unemployment increased .
Import of goods such as rice , tea , sugar , and Chinese goods mostly helped the importers who are Ahmadinejad ’s biggest supporters .
It ’s interesting that several of his ministers are very wealthy including his mister of the interior .
An increase in the price of oil and a $ 280 billion revenue allowed Ahmadinejad to not only raise people ’s salaries but also to give cash , goods and even gold coins to the people who came to greet him whenever he visited a town or a village ; just like the Qajar kings .
Many of the agencies under the supervision of the supreme leader helped him in this matter .
The armed forces , specially the Revolutionary Guards and the Basij are Ahmadinejad ’s supporters .
Their penetration in the villages and small towns , and the fact that they are often from the lower income classes , played a major role in Ahmadinejad ’s victory like the previous elections .
Think of this regime as Cheney and Rove in a police state setting , and you see what 's been going on .
( Of course , Rove and Cheney live within a democratic system utterly unlike Iran , and there 's no evidence they would violate democratic norms as Khamenei just did .
But their demagoguery , abuse of the state , dedication to conflict abroad , co-optation of the armed forces , and manipulation of rural and religious voters all have parallels in Red State Iran . )
We keep expecting to see some kind of shame or some attempt at rational dialogue .
They have nothing but contempt for that kind of talk .
If they 're going to lie , it 's gonna be a Big Lie .
Like this sham of an election .

Two friends of footballer Zakhe were raped and murdered for being gay
By Nikki Jecks
BBC News
The trial of three of the men accused of the rape and murder of one of South Africa 's leading sportswomen , the openly gay football star Eudy Simelane , starts in South Africa on Wednesday .
Thirty - one lesbian women have been reported raped and murdered in homophobic attacks in South Africa since 1998 .
But according to Triangle - a gay rights organisation - only two cases of " corrective rape " have ever made it to the courts ; there has been only one conviction .
" This is a sad fact in this country generally , women are very reluctant to come forward , " says Sharon Cox from Triangle .
If we do get sentences in these cases it will be a great step forward
Sharon Cox , Triangle " Corrective rape " is the term used to describe the rape of a lesbian woman by a man to either punish her , or " correct " her behaviour .
Ms Cox says rape is power is South Africa .
" The thinking is , all it takes is one good man to cure you of being a lesbian , " she told the BBC's Newshour programme .
Triangle says it deals with up to 10 new cases of corrective rape every week .
Support groups claim an increasingly aggressive and macho political environment is contributing to the inaction of the police over attacks on lesbians and is part of a growing cultural lethargy towards the high levels of gender - based violence in South Africa .
But with the possibility of convictions in the Eudy Simelane case , and another case ongoing in Cape Town , Ms Cox is hopeful of change .
" If we do get sentences in these cases it will be a great step forward for human rights , for women 's rights and for gay and lesbian rights . "
Gang rape South Africa has one of the highest rates of sexual violence in the world .
RAPE IN SOUTH AFRICA South Africa has the highest incidence of rape amongst Interpol states 1 in 4 men admit to rape Nearly 150 women are raped every day More than 54,000 cases of rape were reported in 2006 Based on reports by the Medical Research Council , Interpol More than 54,000 cases are reported to the police each year .
Among men in their early twenties it has become almost a game .
There is even a term for the man who leads the process - he is know as the " marhasimani " .
" A marhasimani is someone who goes to the club , buys a woman a few beers , then with his friends , he would take that woman and go away and have sex with her , " one young man told the BBC on the understanding of anonymity .
Another of the group sitting in a bar in the city of Kempton Park , north - east of Johannesburg , explains how it works .
He says the friends hide under the bed until the first man is finished and has left the room , then they take turns having sex with the woman , pretending to be the first man .
" The room is dark and the girl is not even going to notice if it's the second guy sleeping with her , " explains another friend in the group .
When they are challenged to admit that what they are doing constitutes gang rape , they all deny it .

It 's not about her , we bought her drinks , you know

More from BBC World Service
" It 's not about her , we bought her drinks , you know how drinks are expensive , " says one of them .
" We can't say it 's gang rape because , OK , I know sometimes we have to drug the girl and everything , but it does not happen all the time , " says another .
" Most of the time when it does happen , the girl is taking some drinks , but she is quite aware of what is happening . "
In a report earlier this year , the charity Actionaid spoke to 23 - year - old Zakhe , who had two friends raped and killed , and was threatened with rape herself .
" They tell me that they will kill me , they will rape me and after raping me I will become a girl .
I will become a straight girl , " she said .
At the heart of these different manifestations of rape are deep - rooted cultural stereotypes - that men have ownership over women and are of greater importance .
These are views based on traditional values and gender roles that have been enforced in homes and villages in the past and have been largely unchallenged .
Sense of entitlement Dumisani Rebombo is a former rapist who now speaks openly and with great remorse about his crime .
If you have silence in communities , I think that silence is very loud
Dumisani Rebombo
South African rapist : ' Forgive me '
He was just 15 when he raped a young woman in his village with two of his friends .
He admits giving in to peer pressure : " I did it to prove that I was a boy but also wanting to be accepted .
" It 's not something that I enjoyed Immediately I was engulfed with guilt and fear . "
Mr Rebombo now works for the Olive Leaf Foundation , an NGO working with men to prevent rape .
He believes that the problem is partly societal - that boys are raised with a sense of entitlement , and the belief that they can to do whatever they want with women .
" Boys are socialised to be tough , to be macho . "
The other problem he says is the lack of willingness for anyone to challenge these assumptions .
" You could have as many good men as bad , but if you have silence in communities , I think that silence is very loud . "

Forging Ahead Volume 62 Number 3 , May / June 2009 by Charles Stanish
Or , how I learned to stop worrying and love eBay
The auction site eBay is packed with objects purported to be ancient , like this " XTREME ! " Moche - style ceramic vessel .
A little over a decade ago , archaeologists experienced a collective nightmare -- the emergence of eBay , the Internet auction site that , among other things , lets people sell looted artifacts .
The black market for antiquities has existed for centuries , of course , with devastating consequences for the world 's cultural heritage .
But we could at least take some comfort that it was largely confined to either high - end dealers on one end of the economic spectrum or rural flea markets on the other .
The sheer physical constraints of transporting and selling illegal artifacts kept the market relatively small .
But the rise of online auction sites promised to drastically alter the landscape .
And so it did , just not in the dire way we had anticipated .
Back in the pre-eBay days , the cost of acquiring and selling an antiquity was high .
The actual looter was usually paid little , but various middlemen down the line added huge costs .
During my 25 years of working in the Andes , I have often seen this dynamic at work .
In years past , transporting an object was a big expense , even for portable artifacts , and the potential for arrest added to the total cost of doing business .
In addition , the expense of authentication , conservation , and occasional restoration of the pieces , made buying and selling quality antiquities a wealthy person 's vice .
Our greatest fear was that the Internet would democratize antiquities trafficking and lead to widespread looting .
This seemed a logical outcome of a system in which anyone could open up an eBay site and sell artifacts dug up by locals anywhere in the world .
We feared that an unorganized but massive looting campaign was about to begin , with everything from potsherds to pieces of the Great Wall on the auction block for a few dollars .
But a very curious thing has happened .
It appears that electronic buying and selling has actually hurt the antiquities trade .
How is it possible ?
The short answer is that many of the primary " producers " of the objects have shifted from looting sites to faking antiquities .
I 've been tracking eBay antiquities for years now , and from what I can tell , this shift began around 2000 , about five years after eBay was established .
It is true that fakes have been around for centuries .
In 1886 , the celebrated Smithsonian archaeologist W. H. Holmes described countless bogus antiquities in Mexico .
A few decades later , Egyptologist T. G. Wakeling noted that many ancient Egyptian artifacts were , in fact , fakes .
In the 19th century , American and European museums purchased large numbers of " Etruscan " ceramic vessels and sarcophagi that came straight from the kilns of rural Italian farmers .
But these were usually the really good fakes , labor - intensive pieces that required lots of work and skill .
Today , every grade and kind of antiquity is being mass - produced and sold in quantities too large to imagine .
In the pre-Internet days , no one thought that so many people would be willing to put down good money for a low - end piece of tourist art .
People who used to make a few dollars selling a looted artifact to a middleman in their village can now produce their own " almost - as - good - as - old " objects and go directly to a person in a nearby town who has an eBay vendor account .
They will receive the same amount or even more than they could have received for actual antiquities .
I have visited a number of these workshops in Peru and Bolivia .
Using local materials and drawing on their cultural knowledge , small manufacturers can produce pieces that are , in some cases , remarkably accurate reproductions of actual artifacts .
The really smart ones do not reproduce pieces at all but create an ever - so - slightly modified version of real artifacts that have the look and feel of an authentic ancient object .
Perhaps the ultimate achievement is the work of the famous Brigido Lara , who created tens of thousands of fakes in the 1950s and ' 60s , practically creating his own " ancient " culture in Veracruz , Mexico , in the process .
Forged Andean artifacts are becoming increasingly sophisticated , as illustrated by this exact reproduction of a Moche portrait vessel by artisan Walter Acosta .
( Charles Stanish )
The economics of these transactions are quite simple .
Because the eBay phenomenon has substantially reduced total costs by eliminating middlemen , brick - and - mortar stores , high - priced dealers , and other marginal expenses , the local eBayers and craftsmen can make more money cranking out cheap fakes than they can by spending days or weeks digging around looking for the real thing .
It is true that many former and potential looters lack the skills to make their own artifacts .
But the value of their illicit digging decreases every time someone buys a " genuine " Moche pot for $ 35 , plus shipping and handling .
In other words , because the low - end antiquities market has been flooded with fakes that people buy for a fraction of what a genuine object would cost , the value of the real artifacts has gone down as well , making old - fashioned looting less lucrative .
The value of real antiquities is also impacted by the increased risk that the object for sale is a fake .
The likelihood of reselling an authentic artifact for more money is diminished each year as more fakes are produced .
Another economic factor -- risk of arrest -- is also removed by eBay fakes , since you can't be arrested for importing forgeries .
Should you import what you think is an illegal antiquity but it turns out to be a fake , you run little risk of prosecution .
The risk from lawsuits or criminal charges is effectively removed from the sale of antiquities when they are not really antiquities , a fact that reduces the cost and risk to both buyer and seller .
Transport cost is also dramatically reduced by commerce on the Web .
One vendor on eBay advertises a Greek marble head dated to around 300 B.C.
For this " rare artifact , " the shipping costs from Cyprus are a whopping $ 35 to anywhere in the United States .
This is a far cry from the old days when a real illegal antiquity had to be couriered by a specialist who not only knew how to care for the piece , but how to doctor it up to avoid being arrested at customs .
The same is true for objects from just about every well - known ancient culture in the world .
Chinese , Bulgarian , Egyptian , Peruvian , and Mexican workshops are now producing fakes at a frenetic pace .
Even more remarkable than the growing demand for cheap fakes is the fact that the low - end market phenomenon is actually distorting the mid-range and lower high - end markets as well .
Again , this seems counterintuitive .
How could the selling of bad fakes and tacky tourist art as inexpensive antiquities distort the higher - end markets ?
Surely the sophisticated high - end buyers would not be affected by the rubes who pay $ 223 ( plus $ 30 shipping from Lima ) for a " genuine pre-Columbian Moche III Fineline " piece ( which , by the way , can also be bought for $ 15 from the woman selling pottery outside the tourist buses in the Peruvian city of Trujillo ) .
But the high - enders are indeed affected .
It was only a matter of time before a few workshops producing the cheap fakes started turning out reproductions that can fool even supposed experts like me .
A number of these workshops have swamped the higher - end market with beautiful pieces that require intensive study by specialists and high - cost tests to authenticate .
This manufacturing business never could have developed on such a scale without the Internet , and these forgers have forever transformed the antiquities market into something that we could not have imagined just a decade ago .
The daughter of a Peruvian artisan who specializes in reproducing ancient objects holds an example of her work .
( Charles Stanish )
The wealthier collector who up to now has been laughing about the naive folks who buy on eBay is in for a surprise , too : those dealers that provide private sales are some of the forgers ' best customers , knowingly or otherwise .
In fact , the workshops reserve their " finest " pieces for collectors using the same backdoor channels as before , but now with a much higher profit margin because they are selling fakes .
As a former curator myself , I know that an embarrassingly high percentage of objects in our museums are forgeries .
What fools the curator also fools the collector .
From the professional 's point of view , there are really three kinds of " antiquities " on eBay .
About 30 percent are obvious fakes or tourist art that can be detected by looking at the pictures , even the fuzzy ones .
These are easy to pick out because they are not intentional reproductions , but simple pieces manufactured for tourists and sold as such .
The creators of these pieces mix up iconography and choose colors and shapes for visual effect .
Such objects are clearly not ancient .
Another five percent or so are probably real , while the rest are in the ambiguous category of " I would have to hold it in my hand to be able to make an informed decision . "
This latter category has grown fast .
In the first years of eBay , I observed about a 50 - 50 real - to - fake ratio in Andean artifacts .
About five years ago , my informal assessment was that about 95 percent were obvious fakes and the rest were real or dubious .
This was the period when the workshops first went into high gear ; the market was flooded with low - end junk .
Now , the workshops are producing much higher - quality fakes , increasing the category of ambiguous objects now available .
I base these estimates not only on what I see on eBay , but also from my occasional work with U.S. Customs , in which I help authenticate objects .
Additionally , I am fascinated with antiquities dealers and " manufacturers " in South America .
I 've learned much by hanging around the men and women who produce these objects .
I know , for instance , of one fellow who makes grass - tempered reproductions of a 2,000 - year - old pottery style .
Having worked on archaeological projects for years , he learned to get the grass for his fakes from ancient middens near his house .
If fired properly , and if the organic residue in one of his pots were carbon dated , it would appear to be a very old piece indeed .
Looters on the north coast of Peru have discovered not only the famous 12th - 15th - century A.D. Chancay anthropomorphic vessels , but also the original molds used to make the vessels .
Thanks to publicly available archaeological reports , they also now use the original clay sources and minerals to make and paint the pottery .
They can create virtually perfect reproductions .
In an antiquities store in La Paz , I recently saw about four shelves of supposed Tiwanaku ( ca. A.D. 400-1000 ) pottery .
I told the owner that most were fakes and she became irritated and called me a liar .
So I simply touched one at a time , saying " fake , " " real , " " real from Tiwanaku , " " fake , " " fake made by Eugenio in Fuerabamba , " and so forth .
She paused for a moment , pulled one down that I said was real , and told me that it was also a fake .
I congratulated her on the fact that her fakes were getting better and she just smiled .
My mistake is an instance of what San Francisco State University archaeologist Karen Olsen Bruhns has identified as a very real problem -- the experts who study the objects are sometimes being trained on fakes .
As a result , they may authenticate pieces that are not real .
After dominating the online market , obvious fakes have given way to " artifacts " that even experts have trouble authenticating .
You can use thermoluminescence dating , which determines the amount of time elapsed since a clay object was fired , to definitively establish the antiquity of a pottery vessel , if it is old enough .
However , the cost of hiring a professional to take the sample and run the analysis is high for mid-range market , one sample can cost as much as $ 400 .
Since forgers commonly include fragments of ancient pottery in their work , multiple samples are necessary , making thermoluminescence dating prohibitively expensive for the low - end market .
Some eBay vendors are brilliant in this regard .
They state that they will return a buyer 's money if they have a letter from a recognized specialist that proves the piece not to be authentic .
However , this guarantee is nullified if you conduct any kind of " destructive " analysis on the object .
To the nonspecialist this seems reasonable .
However , the sampling of a few specks of clay from a vessel for thermoluminescence dating by a professional conservator is not even noticeable to the naked eye .
While standard procedure in the museum world , this is technically a type of destructive analysis .
It nullifies the guarantee , but it is the only way that a recognized specialist can possibly prove the authenticity of a piece of ancient pottery .
As a result , the guarantee is meaningless .
Well - made stone and metal reproductions are almost impossible to authenticate .
Some kinds of spectrographic analyses can rule out certain objects as fakes .
But if the ancient source materials are used by the producers , it is very difficult to prove definitively whether a piece is authentic or not .
The auctions on eBay are full of stone objects purported to be ancient .
With the advent of laser lathes and chemical techniques to forge patinas , anyone who buys an " Assyrian alabaster stone Mask 700 B.C. " or " Ancient Chinese Jade Carvings - Frog Arrowhead " thinking that they are real antiquities is , in my opinion , a thoroughly naive fool .
There is another looming factor that dealers rarely discuss .
As the sophistication in forgeries continues to increase , museums , law enforcement , and other institutions charged with protecting our cultural heritage will look for even more reliable means of authenticating objects .
A time will come when technology will outpace the looter and antiquities dealer .
The cost of these technologies will likely always fall over time , but the price of professional labor will always rise , adding another expense for dealers .
Like radiocarbon dates for organic objects , the application of these new techniques will become standard practice for all antiquities bought and sold .
This will also inject a new element of risk for the buyer that will dramatically add to the risk of illicit , high - end trafficking .
Who wants to spend $ 50,000 on an object " guaranteed " to be ancient by today 's standards , when someone can come along in five years with a new technology that definitively proves it to be a fake ?
So where does the illegal antiquities market go from here ?
Certainly , looting will continue .
There will always be the gamblers who do not act economically rational and will continue to look for a jackpot .
The highest - end dealers will be around for a long time , but with significantly higher marginal costs associated with their illicit trade .
But for most of us the Web has forever distorted the antiquities trafficking market in a positive way .
There have always been Moche , Chimu , and Nasca reproductions that were difficult to distinguish from the real thing , but in recent years I have seen many , many more .
The traditional workshops in the Peruvian towns of Piura and Ica have been around for decades and the quality of their high - end products continues to rise .
Workshops in new tourist destinations such as Puno and Ayacucho are popping up every year .
As the fakes increase in both quality and sheer numbers , the real antiquities and the obvious fakes available will decrease .
If you can sell a $ 15 Moche knockoff for $ 200 , imagine what you can do with a really good reproduction .
We can only hope , but it is just conceivable that online commerce will actually put a lot of antiquities looters and traffickers out of business by the sheer volume of sales and quality of products that fool even the experts .
What drives this new dynamic is the small fraction of people who actually believe that someone will sell you a real Moche Fineline pot for $ 200 ( actual price : about $ 15,000 ) and have it shipped from Peru by mail without any risk .
It is this money that provides the capital for the cottage industries to keep producing and fueling the cycle of ever - increasing quality and quantity of forgeries .
There is , in reality , no mystery to all of this .
It is the logical outcome of all buyers , sellers , and producers acting in their individual economic self - interest .
I suppose if people stopped believing that they can buy a pill that will help them lose weight without dieting or exercise , then it is possible that people will stop buying fakes online , and we will return to old - fashioned looting .
We just have to wait and see what surprises the Internet brings us in the future .

Relatives of 17 - year - old Hiyam Abu Ayish view her body in the morgue at Gaza ’s al - Aqsa hospital a day after she was killed in an Israeli attack , 3 July 2009 .
( Hatem Omar / MaanImages )
Moments later everything changed .
“ At 5:30 PM an Israeli shell landed on my brother ’s house , ” the father told visitors who had come to offer condolences for his daughter at the family ’s home on Friday .
The shell injured a nephew and Salim Abu Ayish rushed to render aid .
“ I asked Hiyam to bring me the car key from my bedroom , ” Salim Abu Ayish said .
As she went , he recalled , “ suddenly another shell struck my room , killing Hiyam instantly , as shrapnel rippled through her body .
I was injured with some of the shrapnel in my back and my neck . ”
Two Israeli army shells landed in the family houses of the Abu Ayish clan in the Johr al - Deek village , just north of the al - Bureij refugee camp and about 1.5 kilometers from the border with Israel .
The shelling caused critical injury to Husam Abu Ayish , Hiyam ’s 21 - year - old cousin and minor wounds to Hiyam ’s father and sister , Nawal .
For hours after the attack , the Israeli army denied any involvement and claimed the attack was the result of mortar shells fired by Palestinians .
But late on Thursday , the Israeli army changed its story , admitting that Palestinian civilians were hit “ accidentally ” by Israeli army fire directed at Palestinian gunmen in the area , according to Israeli media .
Taking a deep breath , and trying to be strong despite his agony , Abu Ayish remembered his daughter : “ She used to be humorous , active , well - mannered and smiling .
I never turned down her requests .
On Thursday , the day her soul went to heaven , she asked me to bring some watermelon , but her destiny was faster than me .
Two months ago , she asked me to bring her a necklace , and I did buy her one , ” he recalled .
“ Hiyam was more than a sister , ” recalled Emad , 24 , Hiyam ’s brother .
“ She was different from my other five sisters .
Just about an hour before she was martyred , she wondered when I would get married . ”
Emad remembers her saying , “ we want to celebrate your wedding , my brother . ”
Instead of such happy memories , Emad now has only pictures of his sister ’s wounded face , taken with his mobile phone .
“ Every time she visited our home , my children would get so cheerful as they enjoyed the laughter and fun she would bring to our house , ” recalled Saleh Abu Hajjaj , Hiyam ’s brother - in - law .
“ She was one of my best students , ” said Jamal al - Nabahin , a teacher at Qaysaria Secondary School for Girls where Hiyam had recently completed her 11th year certificate .
“ She was active and sometimes very funny .
Her death is a great loss , and may she rest in peace . ”
Mahmoud al - Aydi , the father of Raghda , one of Hiyam ’s friends and schoolmates , recalled that the two girls had been chatting on the phone shortly before the shells struck .
On hearing what had happened Raghda had “ fainted for three hours , ” according to Raghda ’s father , “ she could not believe Hiyam was killed . ”
Um Jihad , Hiyam ’s mother only uttered a few words , “ May God hold accountable those who killed my beloved daughter . ”
In December 2008 and January 2009 , Israel carried out a massive bombardment and invasion of the Gaza Strip .
The 22 days of Israeli attacks claimed the lives of 1,400 Palestinians , the vast majority of whom were unarmed civilians .
Before and after the attack , Israel has maintained a strict blockade on the coastal territory grossly hampering the daily lives of its 1.5 million residents .
“ We have nowhere to go to , ” said Hiyam ’s father , “ Even if we wanted to move , the siege has prevented us from building as there are no building materials available .
The situation is extremely difficult , and yet the world keeps silent about our continuing agony . ”

' Why I took up arms against Ethiopia '
The ONLF says these rocks conceal mass graves
By Yannick Demoustier and Jonathan Alpeyrie
BBC Focus on Africa magazine
Ahmed , 35 , is a member of the Ogaden National Liberation Front ( ONLF ) , one of a number of separatist groups fighting for the independence of the Somali - speaking Ogaden region in the east of Ethiopia .
The previous evening , he had participated in an attack against Ethiopian troops near the town of Babile .
" The assault lasted only a few minutes but we managed to kill nine government soldiers , " he said .
" We are no match for direct combat , so we must rely on quick surprise attacks . "
The armed resistance began in 1984 after the ONLF , then a political organisation , broached the idea of splitting from Ethiopia .
The central government responded by imprisoning Ogaden leaders and , according to academics and human rights groups , assassinating others .
' Point of no-return ' " In 1994 , as a student in Dire Dawa , I was not allowed take the final examinations because I was an Ogadenian , " said Ahmed .
" I was arrested two years later on false charges of belonging to the ONLF .
They kept me there for four years and I was beaten repeatedly , sometimes even subjected to electric torture .
While in detention , my father was killed by government soldiers . "
On his release in 2001 , he immediately joined the rebellion but his mother remains in jail in Jijiga .
Fearing for his family , Ahmed convinced his wife to flee with their two daughters .
" They are refugees in Kenya , I have n't seen them for three years .
" There comes a point of no -return when you know you do n't belong in this country , " he said .
' Human shields '
Over the past two years , the conflict has escalated following the ONLF 's April 2007 attack on a Chinese - run oil exploration field .
This resulted in the death of 74 people , including Ethiopian guards and Chinese workers .
The central government calls the rebels " terrorists " , however watchdogs have accused the government of human rights violations .
In this village , they crushed babies ' heads with stones and in another , they cut up bodies and scattered the parts to prevent remaining villagers from burying the dead
Ahmed
" This is a complete fabrication and these are unfounded allegations , " said Berhanu Kebede , Ethiopia 's ambassador to the UK .
" The Ethiopian government has no intention of harming civilians , it is the ONLF that uses civilians as human shields . "
Near the deserted village of Galashe , which Ethiopian troops allegedly stormed in January 2009 , Ahmed explains what lies beneath the numerous piles of rocks .
" There are about 50 bodies under each pile .
" The Ethiopian soldiers stayed here for a couple of months , they terrorised inhabitants , killing as many as 1,500 people . "
In Galashe and across Ogaden , civilians attest to the same horrors , the gang - raping of women , the burning of huts and killing of livestock .
But the Ethiopian ambassador denied this claim .
" This was recently the subject of an independent investigation and this has made it clear that no such crimes were committed .
" This is a vast area with a population of 4.5 million , who are mostly nomadic and you wo n't see graveyards because people bury their relatives anywhere they can , " said Mr Berhanu .
The government has closed off all access to the Ogaden region .
Ahmed believes the Ethiopian government is trying to cut them off from the local population which supplied the rebels with food .
Rebel alert One of Ahmed 's main tasks is to train the younger recruits .
" They are very angry but it is important that they remember to stay organised , especially when things appear calm , " he said .
The rebels say that they cannot live under Ethiopian rule but we are a federal state .
Berhanu Kebede
The Ethiopian government has been trying to find a political solution to the problem .
" We are approaching them through their elders to explain that the constitution provides enough political space for a peaceful resolution of the problem , but they must renounce the armed struggle and wage their political agenda peacefully , " said Mr Berhanu .
" The rebels say that they cannot live under Ethiopian rule but we are a federal state . "
Ethiopia remains one of the world 's most aid - dependent countries , receiving more than $ 2bn in foreign assistance every year .
Evidently , no aid reaches the Ogaden region despite the government 's insistence that hostilities have ceased .
" Why does the international community remain silent ? " said Ahmed .
" The UN must come to the Ogaden to see what [ Prime Minister ] Meles is doing to us . "

All shading , highlighting and touch - ups have been applied .
Fingers have been drawn wherever applicable , and the background was given slightly more detail ( although it is still more of an afterthought ) .
A few last minute tweaks to FreeBSD - tan 's design were made to reduce the amount of hair on her to something a little more manageable .
This image can now be consider finalized !
And in the spirit of the BSD license , the source is available to view and modify Again , special thanks to for laying the foundation for this picture .
Sorry it took so long , but at least now it 's finally complete .
^^======It 's amazing how much inspiration is bottled up after such a long wait .
^
^In any event , not only did I manage to fit in NetBSD - tan ( the eldest , at 167 cm ) , but I finally made use of C - chan 's first vector sketch of FreeBSD - tan ( the leader of the group , at 178 cm excluding heels ) .
I was thinking of drawing her from scratch , but why waste such a cute pose ?
Afterall , it was herself who originally proposed that option in order to cut down some time .
^.^FreeB -chan actually has a few minor modifications done to her pose -- apart from modernizing the face , I also removed her BSD mace so she can blend better in the picture .
She also has the long gloves that Bella added to the vector sketch afterwards .
As with OpenBSD - tan , no shading or detail work has been applied to either Net-chan or FreeB- chan.======At long last I 'm finally able to resume work on this picture , a LONG - overdue collaborative picture originally begun by C - chan and and resumed by me .
The next addition to this picture is OpenBSD - tan , based on the character design from an artist known as Space Coyote .
She is enjoying a small degree of amusement sizing up her little sister , who is a mere 156 cm compared to her own much more imposing 190 cm frame .
Despite what it may seem , she 's not holding the nightstick threateningly ( although all BSD - tans get into the occasional sibling brawls ) , but is rather supposed to be posing for a picture.======*sigh*
Leave it to C - chan to leave me with all his empty promises to fulfill .... ^ ^' This is actually a more finalized version of a very very VERY incomplete vector sketch of Dragonfly BSD - tan , based on a sketch created by Bella .
This was part of a four - piece collaborative project between Bella and C - chan , where Bella would supply the sketches for four different BSD - tans and C - chan would shade and color .
Sadly , for this and that reason , the project never got off the ground until yours truly stopped by .
^__~Taking over the project , I guess you can call this a Bella / C - quel joint project -- once done , it will probably be posted in the DeviantOS - tan club .
^
^As for the image itself , only the hands and magazine are left incomplete .
Therefore , the depiction of Dragonfly BSD - tan can be said to be 90 % complete .
( Note : in regards to the magazine , it should be stated for the uninitiated that Dragonfly BSD - tan is a huge and almost obsessive fan of AmigaOS - tan , for reasons not readily apparent except for Dragonfly BSD users . )

Abstract
Camera flashes produce intrusive bursts of light that disturb or dazzle .
We present a prototype camera and flash that uses infra-red and ultra-violet light mostly outside the visible range to capture pictures in low - light conditions .
This “ dark ” flash is at least two orders of magnitude dimmer than conventional flashes for a comparable exposure .
Building on ideas from flash / no - flash photography , we capture a pair of images , one using the dark flash , other using the dim ambient illumination alone .
We then exploit the correlations between images recorded at different wavelengths to denoise the ambient image and restore fine details to give a high quality result , even in very weak illumination .
The processing techniques can also be used to denoise images captured with conventional cameras .
Our camera and flash system offers dazzle - free photography by hiding the flash in the non-visible spectrum .
A pair of images are captured at a blur - free shutter speed , one using a multi-spectral flash ( F ) , the other using ambient illumination ( A ) which in this case is 1/100th of that required for a correct exposure .
The pair are combined to give an output image ( R ) which is of comparable quality to a reference long exposure shot ( L ) .

SemTech 2009 has come and gone , and it was great .
I was concerned — as were others — that the state of the economy would depress the turnout and enthusiasm for the show , but it seems that any such effects were at least counterbalanced by a growing interest in semantic technologies .
Early reports are that attendance was up about 20 % from last year , and at sessions , coffee breaks , and the exhibit hall there seemed to always be more people than I expected .
Good stuff .
Eric P. and I gave our SPARQL By Example tutorial to a crowd of about 50 people on Monday .
From the feedback I ’ve received , it seems that people found the session beneficial , and at least a couple of people remarked on the fact that Eric and I seemed to be having fun .
If this whole semantic thing does n’t work out , at least we can fall back on our ad - hoc comedy routines .
Anyways , I wanted to share a couple of links with everyone .
I think they work nicely to supplement other SPARQL tutorials in helping teach SPARQL to newcomers and infrequent practitioners .
SPARQL By Example slides .
I ’ve probably posted this link before , but the slides have now been updated with some new examples and with a series of exercises that help reinforce each piece of SPARQL that the reader encounters .
Thanks to Eric P. for putting together all of the exercises and to Leigh Dodds for the excellent space exploration data set .
SPARQL Cheat Sheet slides .
This is a short set of about 10 slides intended to be a concise reference for people learning to write SPARQL queries .
It includes things like common prefixes , the structure of queries , how to encode SPARQL into an HTTP URL , and more .
Enjoy , and , as always , I ’d welcome any feedback , suggestions for improvements , or pointers to how / where you ’re able to make use of these materials .

Two brothers have been charged by police after allegedly camming the new Bruno movie .
The pair aged 21 and 23 were approached by detectives acting on a tipoff .
The older brother managed to temporarily escape but the chase ended when his leg was broken after he " collided with a police vehicle " .
Two Martinsville brothers have been charged in connection with the camming of the newly released Bruno movie at a cinema in Manville , United States .
The police claim the pair had been recording first run movies and selling the copies on the Internet .
The prosecutor and police announced that Paul Epifan , 23 , and his younger brother Timothy Epifan , 21 , had both been charged with theft by deception .
Paul Epifan was also charged with pirating the movie .
According to the police on Friday July 10th at around 11:00 am , detectives from the very serious - sounding Somerset County Prosecutor ’s Major Crimes Squad and detectives from the Manville Police Department received information that the brothers were inside Reading Cinema Movie Theatre in Manville , camming the Bruno movie .
As the brothers left the cinema , detectives stopped them and announced that the par were under arrest .
Paul Epifan complied without a struggle , but according to the prosecutor Timothy fled and was pursued by police .
During the chase it ’s alleged that Timothy pulled a recording device from his waistband and attempted to delete its contents .
Then according to the police at least , Timothy then sustained a broken leg when he attempted to “ cross between two police vehicles ” , causing him to collide with one of them .
There is no mention of any police cars “ colliding ” with him .
On top of his other alleged crimes , Timothy Epifan was also charged with resisting arrest .
The pair will appear in court at a later date .

WASHINGTON 
It ’s become popular to pick your own personal litmus test for health care reform .
For some liberals , reform will be a success only if it includes a new government - run insurance plan to compete with private insurers .
For many conservatives , a bill must exclude such a public plan .
For others , the crucial issue is how much money Congress spends covering the uninsured .
My litmus test is different .
It ’s the prostate cancer test .
The prostate cancer test will determine whether President Obama and Congress put together a bill that begins to fix the fundamental problem with our medical system : the combination of soaring costs and mediocre results .
If they do n’t , the medical system will remain deeply troubled , no matter what other improvements they make .
The legislative process is still in the early stages , and Washington is likely to squeeze some costs out of the medical system .
But the signals coming from Capitol Hill are still worrisome , because Congress has not seemed willing to change the basic economics of health care .
So let ’s talk about prostate cancer .
Right now , men with the most common form  slow - growing , early - stage prostate cancer  can choose from at least five different courses of treatment .
The simplest is known as watchful waiting , which means doing nothing unless later tests show the cancer is worsening .
More aggressive options include removing the prostate gland or receiving one of several forms of radiation .
The latest treatment  proton radiation therapy  involves a proton accelerator that can be as big as a football field .
1968 Revisited The Truth about the Gunshot that Changed Germany
It was the shot that changed the course of German history .
On June 2 , 1967 , a West Berlin police officer shot and killed leftist demonstrator Benno Ohnesorg .
The event triggered a whole generation of leftist activism .
Would history have turned out differently if people knew then the killer was a member of East Germany 's secret police ?

Credit cards have long been a very good deal for people who pay their bills on time and in full .
Even as card companies imposed punitive fees and penalties on those late with their payments , the best customers racked up cash - back rewards , frequent - flier miles and other perks in recent years .
Now Congress is moving to limit the penalties on riskier borrowers , who have become a prime source of billions of dollars in fee revenue for the industry .
And to make up for lost income , the card companies are going after those people with sterling credit .
Banks are expected to look at reviving annual fees , curtailing cash - back and other rewards programs and charging interest immediately on a purchase instead of allowing a grace period of weeks , according to bank officials and trade groups .
“ It will be a different business , ” said Edward L. Yingling , the chief executive of the American Bankers Association , which has been lobbying Congress for more lenient legislation on behalf of the nation ’s biggest banks .
“ Those that manage their credit well will in some degree subsidize those that have credit problems . ”
The Future of Iraq , Part III
On my last trip to Iraq , I asked a number of Americans and Iraqis what they think about the future in that country .
Around half were optimistic and half were pessimistic .
This is the third installment in a four - part series .
Optimists were quoted at length in parts one and two .
I 'm giving equal time here to the pessimists .
The United States has basically won the war in Iraq .
No insurgent or terrorist group can declare victory or claim Americans are evacuating Iraq ’s cities because they were beaten .
America 's most modest foreign policy objectives there have been largely secured .
Saddam Hussein 's toxic regime has been replaced with a more or less consensual government .
I doubt very much that Iraq will seriously threaten the United States or its neighbors any time soon .
It is n't likely to be ruled by terrorists as it probably would have been if the United States left between 2004 and 2007 .
It ’s a relief .
A few years ago , I was all but certain the U.S. would withdraw under fire and leave Iraq in the hands of militias .
Even so , many have a hard time feeling optimistic about the future .
Iraq remains , in some ways , a threat to itself .
The reduction in violence and the winding down of the conflict allowed me to see the country a little more clearly than I could when I first visited Baghdad .
I ’m sorry to report that the city is still as run-down and dysfunctional as it was when what passed for daily life was punctuated by gunfire and car bombs .
Iraq is backward and messy not only by Western standards , but by Arabic standards .
“ A lot of people want us to stay or they will leave , ” U.S. Army Sergeant Nick Franklin told me .
“ They do n't care where they go .
They want to go to America , to Europe , or even to Jordan or some other Arab country .
They do n't care .
They just want out . ”
You might want out , too , if you lived there .
Violence has been drastically reduced , but sectarian tension remains just as bad , if not worse , as it is in Lebanon – and the possibility of renewed civil strife hangs over Lebanon like the Sword of Damocles .
Iraq is still violent compared with most countries , and the entire government and security forces are shot through with corruption .
Electricity still does n’t work half the time .
Sewage still runs in the streets .
Neighborhoods are still clotted with an appalling amount of garbage .
Police officers steal from citizens and often beat suspects up not during but before interrogations .
I asked several American soldiers if it was safe enough for me to walk the streets on my own without armed protection .
Few thought that would be wise .
“ I would n't try it , ” Sergeant Manuel Juarez said .
“ I would n't even think of it .
Who is to say that these Sons of Iraq guys do n't still have some ties to Al Qaeda ?
Once in a while we get reports about one of them being shady . ”
Sergeant Manuel Juarez
The Sons of Iraq work for the Iraqi government as low level security officers , basically as neighborhood watchmen .
“ Sons of Iraq is shady as hell , ” said another soldier who overheard our conversation and preferred not to be named .
“ I know as a fact that they 're shady as hell . ”
“ What do you know ? ” I said .
“ I do n't know anything , ” he said and looked away .
That was all he would tell me .
An armed Sons of Iraq member , Adhamiyah , Baghdad
We were in Adhamiyah , a mostly Sunni area north of the city center and east of the Tigris .
It was a stronghold of support for Saddam Hussein ’s regime , and a stronghold of support for Al Qaeda more recently .
American infantry soldiers at Forward Operating Base ( FOB ) Apache , next to the famous Gunner Palace , hosted me during my stay .
Staff Sergeant Christianson said he did n’t think I would be much safer when I later moved into the Shia parts of the city even though the Shias , overall , are friendlier toward Americans .
“ Hezbollah kills civilians as well as Americans with total disregard for Iraqis , ” he said .
He was referring , of course , to Hezbollah in Iraq , not to Hezbollah in Lebanon .
Iran ’s Revolutionary Guard Corps , though , is a patron and armorer of both .
A crucial difference between the two is that the Iraqi branch of Hezbollah , unlike the Lebanese branch , does n’t have anything that looks even vaguely like a “ political wing . ”
Its members do n’t build hospitals , schools , or anything else .
They just kill people .
Hezbollah in Iraq logo

“ Jaysh al Mahdi is much more careful and only tries to kill us , ” Staff Sergeant Christianson continued .
“ I do n't know why Hezbollah is so much more ruthless , but they are .
When we pull out of this country , this place is going to burn . ”
No one can know if it really will burn .
Many think it will , but not everyone does .
Certainly nobody I spoke to hopes that it does .
Even the relative optimists , though , are concerned that it might .
“ I sure hope this holds , ” Sergeant Pennartz said , “ because we 're going to pull out soon .
I think it 's a mistake .
This country is going to need help for years .
But at the same time I really really really do n't want to come back here .
That 's how a lot of us feel .
We do n't want to pull out , but we also do n't want to be here .
I just hope the peace holds so we do n't have to come back and fight for the ground we already won and abandoned .
Again . ”
An American Humvee , Adhamiyah , Baghdad
American soldiers have since withdrawn from most of Iraq ’s urban areas .
We ’ll have a better idea soon enough whether the optimists or the pessimists turn out to be right .
“ On the surface everyone will tell you Sunnis , Shias , we do n't care , we 're all Iraqis , ” Sergeant Pennartz continued .
“ But talk to them for a while and they 'll tell you what they really think .
Do you know what those Shias did ?
Et cetera .
Some Sunnis say Shias were never in Iraq until the Iran - Iraq war .
Some are totally ignorant and say they ’ll never live next to Shias .
It 's worse among the older generations , like back in the States . ”
I joined Lieutenant Eric Kuylman and his men on a foot patrol in Adhamiyah .
Our convoy of Humvees parked near a traffic circle and we stepped out to talk to people who lived in the neighborhood .
Lieutenant Eric Kuylman
The lieutenant approached a group of young men and asked if they lived in the area .
“ I'm from Fallujah , ” said the first in good English .
“ I go to college here and commute three hours each day . ”
“ It takes three hours to get here from Fallujah ? ” I said .
If Iraq were a normal country , it would only take an hour or so to drive in from there .
Lieutenant Eric Kuylman ( left ) speaks to Iraqi college students
“ The security checkpoints slow us down , ” he said .
“ Okay , ” Lieutenant Kuylman said .
“ You guys are n’t from around here .
I ’m curious , then , what you think of the area . ”
“ The security is good , ” the man said .
“ I had to quit college in 2006 because it was too dangerous .
But I was able to come back this year because it ’s safer .
I 'd like to see American forces here as guests , not carrying weapons or wearing armor . ”
“ Me , too , ” Lieutenant Kuylman said and laughed .
He was n’t indulging the man .
He was serious .
“ I hope you can leave Iraq soon , ” the man said .
“ Me , too , ” said the lieutenant .
We moved on and I asked our interpreter Tom what the Iraqis in Adhamiyah really think of the American military .
He ’s an Iraqi who grew up in Baghdad .
" Tom " is the nickname he uses to conceal his identity .
“ Eighty percent in this area do n't like Americans , ” he said .
“ Some want American forces to stay , but most want them to leave . ”
“ How would you characterize their negative feelings ? ” I said .
“ Irritation ?
Hatred ? ”
“ Both , ” he said .
“ It depends .
You have to understand that this was a favored area when Saddam Hussein was the president .
It was a Baath Party stronghold . ”
Adhamiyah , Baghdad
“ Do they credit Americans with improving security ? ” I said .
“ Yes , ” he said .
“ But they still want American forces to leave .
You heard what that guy just said . ”
The Sunnis of Adhamiyah have rational reasons to dislike Americans .
Sunni Arabs make up only 15 - 20 percent of Iraq ’s population , but they were favored under Saddam Hussein ’s regime .
Iraq ’s democratic elections have empowered the country ’s Shia majority – an ancient foe of the Sunnis – for the first time .
Rational anti-Americanism , however , is compounded by the conspiratorial and phantasmagoric anti-Americanism that persists in much of the Arab world .
One of Iraq ’s various insurgent groups recently tried to fire an improvised IRAM rocket at a joint American - Iraqi security station , but the trigger man botched the job and blew up the rocket on the launch pad .
He killed himself and destroyed nearby houses .
Most residents of the neighborhood think American soldiers dropped a bomb from a helicopter .

An Iraqi man walked up to Lieutenant Kuylman and me .
His friends followed .
“ I want to say something , ” he said in English .
“ Please do n't hand us over to the Iraqi Army .
We 've been working with you for over a year . ”
He belonged to the Sons of Iraq program and was worried about what might happen to him if he had to rely on the Iraqi Army for protection from terrorists instead of the United States Army .
Lieutenant Kuylman and Sons of Iraq member
“ Look , ” Lieutenant Kuylman said .
“ We 're not running away .
We are n't just going to abandon you . ”
It ’s true that the Americans are n’t running out of Iraq .
But they did recently withdraw from the cities and will no longer be available to provide security as they did during and after the surge .
Everyone in Iraq knew this was going to happen when I was there and recorded this exchange .
Lieutenant Eric Kuylman speaks to members of Sons of Iraq
From the look on the Iraqi man ’s face , he was not at all convinced by what Lieutenant Kuylman said .
He probably does n’t know what happened to the anti-Hezbollah South Lebanon Army in 2000 when Israel withdrew its armed forces from Lebanon , but he was clearly worried he and his men might suffer a similar fate .
Many South Lebanon
Army soldiers ended up in Israel as refugees when Hezbollah took over the area .

Sergeant Nick Franklin took me with him when he visited the home of an Iraqi woman named Malath who is in charge of a Sons of Iraq search unit .
She invited us to sit on couches in her living room .
Incense wafted in from the kitchen .
It smelled lovely , unlike Baghdad outside which often smells of rotting vegetables , diesel fuel , and piss .
“ This is your house , ” Malath said .
“ If this is my house , ” Sergeant Franklin said , “ where ’s my room ? ”
Everyone laughed .
Her house was much nicer inside than FOB Apache , where Franklin lived and where I was sleeping .
Her living room was cozy .
Peach - colored lights cast a soft glow on the wall .
Arabic music videos from Egypt and Lebanon played on the television .
Malath 's living room
“ You could even put me on the roof , ” Sergeant Franklin said .
The roof would be more comfortable than the cramped conditions back at the FOB .
Living conditions for American soldiers in Iraq are terrible .
Unlike Iraqis , they get 24 hours of electricity every day , which means they have air conditioning .
But every Iraqi house I have ever been in is vastly more comfortable over all .
Malath and Sermad
Malath 's colleague Sermad Mahmoud sat next to her on the couch .
Sergeant Franklin sat next to me on the other side of the room .
“ Malath ’s family is liberated , ” he said , which meant no male family members imposed a strict code of behavior on her .
“ She ’s not married , but she helps take care of her family ’s kids .
Her brother was recently killed .
Somebody poisoned him . ”
“ How 's things in Adhamiyah lately ? ” he said to Malath .
“ Quiet , ” she said .
And it was .
The only gunshots I heard were fired by Iraqi Police officers into the air .
A young boy , presumably Malath ’s nephew , brought us glasses of tea , fruit juice , and cigarettes .
Franklin and Malath engaged in idle chitchat for a while .
Socializing often makes up the bulk of meeting time when Americans and Iraqis get together to talk business .
Iraqis prefer it that way , and Americans yield to their expectations and culture .
I was given a bit of time to talk to Malath myself .
“ How have things changed in the past year ? ” I asked her .
“ Al Qaeda controlled this entire area in 2007 , ” she said .
“ The market had to close at 4:00 pm .
They came in from other provinces in Iraq .
The strangers came from places like Abu Ghraib and Fallujah .
When Americans created Sons of Iraq , we cooperated because we know the locals .
We know who is supposed to be here and who is from outside .
We helped them raid the bad houses .
It started to get better here in November of 2007 when Sons of Iraq started .
We used to find dead bodies in the streets every day in this neighborhood , but not anymore .
They used to kidnap people right in front of everyone .
Ninety percent of security is good now .
Citizens notify us about bad people in the area . ”
“ Is Baghdad ready to stand on its own ? ” I said .
“ No , ” she said , “ of course not , ” as if my question was frankly absurd .
None of the American soldiers in the room argued with her assessment , neither in front of her nor later after we left .
“ We wo n't be ready until young people replace the older generation in the Iraqi Army and Iraqi Police , ” she continued .
“ They need to replace the old Baath Party members who are still inside . ”
Paul Bremer dissolved what remained of the Iraqi Army after he was made the head of the Coalition Provisional Authority by the Bush Administration in 2003 .
He wanted to purge Iraq of its Baathists and old regime loyalists .
A large number of Baathists , though , were Baathists in name only .
They were n’t necessarily ideological .
Party membership was required of government employees , and a huge number of Iraqis worked for the government .
Bremer ’s dismissal and blacklisting of these people radicalized many .
Some joined the insurgency .
It was a bad call on Bremer ’s part , and he did it despite warnings from his advisors about what might happen if he went through with it .
He faced a formidable problem , even so .
What is to be done about Iraq ’s leaders and functionaries who cut their teeth in a totalitarian political system ?
Malath , like many others , thinks Iraqis will have to wait for them to retire or die .
“ There is also way too much fighting between Iraqi political parties , ” she said .
“ And there are too many parties . ”
“ How many parties are there ? ” I said .
“ There are more than 100 , ” Sermad Mahmoud said .
Sergeant Franklin cut in .
“ There are not more than 100 , ” he said .
“ That 's a total exaggeration .
I 'm not exactly sure how many there are , but it 's nowhere near that many . ”
Sergeant Nick Franklin
“ What should the American people know about Iraq that they do n't currently know ? ” I said , addressing my question to both Sermad and Malath .
“ Iraqi people are friendly and follow the old Iraqi traditions , ” Malath said .
I can vouch for this .
There should be no question that this is true .
“ And the government is so corrupt , ” she said .
“ We do n't like them at all . ”
I should point out here , again , that I was in the Adhamiyah sector of Baghdad , which is mostly made up of Sunnis .
Iraq ’s government is mostly run by Shias .
Iraqi Shias are much happier with the government than Iraq ’s Sunnis , and Malath is a Sunni .
Still , she is right about corruption in the government .
Most Sunni , Shia , and Kurdish politicians are corrupt .
“ What is the local opinion of the Iraqi Police ? ” I said .
Sergeant Franklin had told me earlier that most Iraqis in his area do n’t like or trust the police .
“ People here do n't feel comfortable talking to them , ” she said .
“ They are Shias from Sadr City , and they are corrupt . ”
She ’s right about that .
Shia officers were brought in from Sadr City to police Sunnis .
In Fallujah and Ramadi , the Iraqi Police were much more effective and more trusted because they worked in the same community they lived and grew up in .
“ How , exactly , are the Iraqi Police here corrupt ? ” I said .
“ If we ask them about detainees , ” Sermad said , “ they do n't answer unless we pay them to answer .
A guy was recently released from jail because he bought his way out . ”
Iraqi Police officer
“ When did Al Qaeda move in ? ” I said .
Adhamiyah was a stronghold of support for Al Qaeda in Iraq until somewhat recently .
“ They came in November of 2005 , ” Malath said .
“ They used young people and jobless people , and they lured them in with money .
There were no jobs .
It 's better now because the government opened a center for jobless people . ”
“ We helped the government do that , ” Sergeant Franklin said .
“ We started weekend training classes where people can learn a trade like carpentry or secretary work . ”
“ What was it like here in 2004 and 2005 , ” I said , “ before Al Qaeda moved in ? ”
“ There was a militia here called Al Jihad , ” Sermad said .
“ They came from Syria and Saudi Arabia .
Then Al Qaeda moved in .
They originally called themselves the Islamic State in Iraq . ”
“ Has public opinion here changed about American soldiers since Al Jihad and Al Qaeda came in ? ” I said .
“ Yes , definitely , ” Malath said .
“ Many people here like American soldiers now . ”
“ Can you describe the old opinion of American soldiers ? ” I said .
“ And what caused the change ? ”
“ Al Qaeda used to control people 's minds , ” she said .
“ They said Americans just wanted to control Iraq , and we believed them .
We know now that it is n't true .
Americans have been helping a lot . ”
“ So public opinion changed about Al Qaeda , as well ? ” I said .
“ Yes , ” she said .
“ I mean , we did n't like them before , but we agreed with them about some things .
And anyway we could n't talk about them before , not until Sons of Iraq was created . ”
Her nephew brought all of us more glasses of tea .
“ Iraqi elections have all been corrupt , ” she said .
“ How so ? ” I said .
“ Terrorist groups and outside organizations threatened people and assassinated their political enemies , ” she said .
“ Speaking of outside organizations , " I said , " what do people here think about Iran ? ”
“ Iran has lots of influence , ” Sermad said .
“ They support the militias , Jaysh al Mahdi , and the Badr Corps .
They support some of the Iraqi parliament members .
Iran is going to invade Iraq as soon as American soldiers withdraw . ”
“ He 's talking about a sort of generalized fear , ” Sergeant Franklin said .
“ They do n't necessarily believe that is going to happen , it 's just something they are afraid of . ”
“ The Iraqi parliament members will invite the Iranian Army , ” Malath said .
Malath and Sermad were being slightly hysterical .
Like many Iraqis , they inflated threats all out of proportion to their actual size .
Iraqis did the same thing when American soldiers first came .
The U.S. invasion was compared , in the minds of many Iraqis , to the vicious Mongol invasion in the 13th Century .
“ Do you think Prime Minister Maliki is an ally of Iran ? ” I said .
“ He did n't used to do the best thing for Iraq , ” Malath said .
“ He is better now , but only because Americans forced him to conduct the operations against Shia militias .
He used to say the Sons of Iraq was a Sunni militia . ”
Maliki can’t credibly say any longer that Sons of Iraq is a Sunni militia , although some Western journalists still have n’t figured that out .
Sons of Iraq is on the payroll of Maliki ’s government .
According to Major Mike Humphreys , 60 percent of its members in Baghdad are Shias .
“ I have one more question about a completely different topic , ” I said .
“ Okay , ” Malath said .
“ Is there any chance that Iraq will have normal relations with Israel in the future ? ” I said .
Sergeant Franklin leaned over and whispered to me .
“ Most Iraqis do n't think that far outside the box , ” he said .
I knew that already , but he was right to remind me .
Israel is about as removed from Iraq ’s problems as Sri Lanka .
“ Iraq has no issues with Israel , ” she said , “ but it depends on the next Iraqi president . ”
Then she paused and gave me a more honest answer .
“ Personally , I do n't want normal relations with Israel . ”
“ Why not ? ” I said .
“ Do you know about the situation with the Palestinians ? ” she said .
“ Of course , ” I said .
“ Everyone does . ”
“ I disagree , ” Sermad said .
“ We should have normal relations with Israel .
There is no reason we should n't . ”
Because of Israel ’s remoteness to Iraq ’s problems , the topic is n’t nearly as much of a red line there as it is elsewhere in the Middle East .
Every Iraqi Kurd
I have ever spoken to about Israel wants peace , normal relations , or even a strategic alliance .
Arab opinion is mixed , but Arab Iraqis do n’t seem to be afraid of arguing about it with each other .
Some Lebanese want normal relations with Israel , but they do n't feel comfortable saying so because anti-Israel opinion in some quarters there is ferocious .
The electricity went out all of a sudden .
The room went dark .
This was Iraq , and Iraqis still do n’t get anywhere near 24 hours of electricity .
There was a huge demonstration just south of Malath 's house shortly after we left .
Thousands of radical Shias streamed out of Sadr City and surged up the main road into Sunni Adhamiyah .
They screamed slogans in support of Moqtada al Sadr and what ’s left of his Mahdi Army militia .
*
American soldiers can't do much more in Iraq at this point .
General David Petraeus 's counterinsurgency program is finished .
He achieved a major breakthrough when he embedded infantry soldiers inside Iraqi neighborhoods and ordered them to place the security of the residents above their own .
Recently , according to the requirements of the negotiated Status of Forces Agreement , American soldiers have been ordered out of Iraqi cities and back onto the large bases outside .
Iraq 's urban areas – where most Iraqis live – will now have to stand or fall on their own .
Before the withdrawal , Lieutenant Eric Kuylman invited me to join him and his men again while they conducted a foot patrol in one of the older districts of Adhamiyah .
This was one of the last patrols I joined up with in that country .
We came across a rubble - strewn site where it appeared a building might have once stood .
Two soldiers swept for IEDs with a wand that whined like a metal detector in the airport .
Searching for IED s in rubble , Adhamiyah , Baghdad
An elderly Iraqi man nervously sidled up to Lieutenant Kuylman .
“ Is there a bomb in there ? ” he said .
“ Nah , ” the lieutenant said .
“ We just check empty lots like this just in case .
Do n’t worry about it .
There ’s no more reason to think there ’s a bomb in there now than there was five minutes ago . ”
The man watched as the soldiers continued sweeping the pile of rubble .
“ Hey , ” Lieutenant Kuylman said to the Iraqi .
“ I ’m trying to learn a few things about the neighborhood here .
Can you tell me who has been living in the area the longest ? ”
" I have been living in this house , " he said and gestured toward the dwelling behind him , " for forty years . "
" Can we speak to you in private ? " the lieutenant said .
" Of course , " the man said .
" You are welcome . "
He opened the door and beckoned us in .
" Thank you , " I said .
He shook my hand warmly with both of his hands .
“ Please , ” he said and gestured for us to sit on his couch .
His wife smiled and brought us tea .
I did n’t see any children or younger adults in the house .
The couple seemed genuinely friendly .
All Iraqis I ’ve met are at least superficially friendly , but these two seemed especially so .
“ I like to find the people who have lived in the neighborhood the longest , ” Lieutenant Kuylman said .
“ If there are any people you do n't feel comfortable with around here , I will go talk to them .
And I want you to feel comfortable telling me . ”
“ It 's quiet here , ” the man said .
“ And if there are any problem , we will solve them amongst ourselves . ”
“ Really ? ” Lieutenant Kuylman said .
“ Who 's the mediator ? ”
“ We have a guy who is like a sheikh , ” the man said .
“ He settles these problems between people .
Sheikh Zawi . ”
“ Ah , ” the lieutenant said .
“ I know him .
He 's a good guy . ”
The elderly couple had a huge hand - made Persian carpet in the living room .
It would fetch around $ 6,000 dollars in the United States .
“ When Americans come into our houses , ” the man said , “ people outside want to know what 's going on . ”
“ What do people think is going on ? ” I said .
“ That Americans are investigating or exchanging information , ” he said .
“ Our traditions require us to welcome Americans into our homes . ”
“ Does it cause a problem for you if we come into your house ? ” I said .
“ No , no , ” the man said .
“ Everyone here knows me and knows my personality . ”
An enigmatic response .
Adhamiyah is a predominantly anti-American neighborhood .
Was the man saying his anti-American credentials were solid , that no one would be concerned he was cooperating with the enemy ?
Or was I reading too much into it ?
Adhamiyah may be anti-American , but the people there are much more opposed to Al Qaeda and other insurgent groups than they are to the United States .
And the man did approach us in the street .
He introduce himself voluntarily and was concerned about bombs .
“ There are going to be a lot of changes all across Baghdad , ” Lieutenant Kuylman said .
“ We 're trying to push the Iraqi Army and Iraqi Police and get your system to work .
We 're here to help , but we try to make sure the Iraqi Army and Iraqi Police have first done everything they can before we step in . ”
Searching a car for weapons , Adhamiyah , Baghdad
“ I want to relay a message to you , ” the man said .
“ Hopefully the Iraqi forces will join us together .
No Sunnis .
No Shias .
When I go outside Adhamiyah , I do n't trust the Iraqi forces . ”
“ Why not ? ” I said .
“ You have to check the backgrounds of men in the Iraqi Army and the Iraqi Police , ” the woman said .
“ There are a lot of bad people trying to work for them . ”
“ Do you have any names for me ? ” Lieutenant Kuylman said .
She did n't have any names .
Neither did her husband .
All they had was a sense of dread and foreboding .
“ When I hear about the schedule for American forces leaving Iraq , ” the man said , “ I get scared .
I hope we get a nice life here in Iraq and that you can make it home safe . ”
Lieutenant Kuylman winced .
“ There might be some growing pains . ”
The woman flung her hands up toward the ceiling .

The Singer Solution to World Poverty
A contentious ethicist explains why your taste for foie gras is starving children .
By PETER SINGER Illustrations by ROSS MacDONALD
The Australian philosopher Peter Singer , who later this month begins teaching at Princeton University , is perhaps the world 's most controversial ethicist .
Many readers of his book " Animal Liberation " were moved to embrace vegetarianism , while others recoiled at Singer 's attempt to place humans and animals on an even moral plane .
Similarly , his argument that severely disabled infants should , in some cases , receive euthanasia has been praised as courageous by some — and denounced by others , including anti-abortion activists , who have protested Singer 's Princeton appointment .
Singer 's penchant for provocation extends to more mundane matters , like everyday charity .
A recent article about Singer in The New York Times revealed that the philosopher gives one - fifth of his income to famine - relief agencies .
" From when I first saw pictures in newspapers of people starving , from when people asked you to donate some of your pocket money for collections at school , " he mused , " I always thought , ' Why that much — why not more ? " '
Is it possible to quantify our charitable burden ?
In the following essay , Singer offers some unconventional thoughts about the ordinary American 's obligations to the world 's poor and suggests that even his own one - fifth standard may not be enough .
n the Brazilian film " Central Station , " Dora is a retired schoolteacher who makes ends meet by sitting at the station writing letters for illiterate people .
Suddenly she has an opportunity to pocket $ 1,000 .
All she has to do is persuade a homeless 9 - year - old boy to follow her to an address she has been given .
( She is told he will be adopted by wealthy foreigners . )
She delivers the boy , gets the money , spends some of it on a television set and settles down to enjoy her new acquisition .
Her neighbor spoils the fun , however , by telling her that the boy was too old to be adopted — he will be killed and his organs sold for transplantation .
Perhaps Dora knew this all along , but after her neighbor 's plain speaking , she spends a troubled night .
In the morning Dora resolves to take the boy back .
Suppose Dora had told her neighbor that it is a tough world , other people have nice new TV 's too , and if selling the kid is the only way she can get one , well , he was only a street kid .
She would then have become , in the eyes of the audience , a monster .
She redeems herself only by being prepared to bear considerable risks to save the boy .
At the end of the movie , in cinemas in the affluent nations of the world , people who would have been quick to condemn Dora if she had not rescued the boy go home to places far more comfortable than her apartment .
In fact , the average family in the United States spends almost one - third of its income on things that are no more necessary to them than Dora 's new TV was to her .
Going out to nice restaurants , buying new clothes because the old ones are no longer stylish , vacationing at beach resorts — so much of our income is spent on things not essential to the preservation of our lives and health .
Donated to one of a number of charitable agencies , that money could mean the difference between life and death for children in need .

Princeton 's New Philosopher Draws a Stir ( April 10 , 1999 )
Of course , there are several differences between the two situations that could support different moral judgments about them .
For one thing , to be able to consign a child to death when he is standing right in front of you takes a chilling kind of heartlessness ; it is much easier to ignore an appeal for money to help children you will never meet .
Yet for a utilitarian philosopher like myself — that is , one who judges whether acts are right or wrong by their consequences — if the upshot of the American 's failure to donate the money is that one more kid dies on the streets of a Brazilian city , then it is , in some sense , just as bad as selling the kid to the organ peddlers .
But one does n't need to embrace my utilitarian ethic to see that , at the very least , there is a troubling incongruity in being so quick to condemn Dora for taking the child to the organ peddlers while , at the same time , not regarding the American consumer 's behavior as raising a serious moral issue .
n his 1996 book , " Living High and Letting Die , " the New York University philosopher Peter Unger presented an ingenious series of imaginary examples designed to probe our intuitions about whether it is wrong to live well without giving substantial amounts of money to help people who are hungry , malnourished or dying from easily treatable illnesses like diarrhea .
Here 's my paraphrase of one of these examples :
Bob is close to retirement .
He has invested most of his savings in a very rare and valuable old car , a Bugatti , which he has not been able to insure .
The Bugatti is his pride and joy .
In addition to the pleasure he gets from driving and caring for his car , Bob knows that its rising market value means that he will always be able to sell it and live comfortably after retirement .
One day when Bob is out for a drive , he parks the Bugatti near the end of a railway siding and goes for a walk up the track .
As he does so , he sees that a runaway train , with no one aboard , is running down the railway track .
Looking farther down the track , he sees the small figure of a child very likely to be killed by the runaway train .
He can't stop the train and the child is too far away to warn of the danger , but he can throw a switch that will divert the train down the siding where his Bugatti is parked .
Then nobody will be killed -- but the train will destroy his Bugatti .
Thinking of his joy in owning the car and the financial security it represents , Bob decides not to throw the switch .
The child is killed .
For many years to come , Bob enjoys owning his Bugatti and the financial security it represents .
You should n't take that cruise , redecorate the house or get that pricey new suit .
After all , a $ 1,000 suit could save five children 's lives .
Bob 's conduct , most of us will immediately respond , was gravely wrong .
Unger agrees .
But then he reminds us that we , too , have opportunities to save the lives of children .
We can give to organizations like Unicef or Oxfam America .
How much would we have to give one of these organizations to have a high probability of saving the life of a child threatened by easily preventable diseases ?
( I do not believe that children are more worth saving than adults , but since no one can argue that children have brought their poverty on themselves , focusing on them simplifies the issues . )
Unger called up some experts and used the information they provided to offer some plausible estimates that include the cost of raising money , administrative expenses and the cost of delivering aid where it is most needed .
By his calculation , $ 200 in donations would help a sickly 2 - year - old transform into a healthy 6 - year - old — offering safe passage through childhood 's most dangerous years .
To show how practical philosophical argument can be , Unger even tells his readers that they can easily donate funds by using their credit card and calling one of these toll - free numbers : ( 800 ) 367-5437 for Unicef ; ( 800 ) 693-2687 for Oxfam America .
Now you , too , have the information you need to save a child 's life .
How should you judge yourself if you do n't do it ?
Think again about Bob and his Bugatti .
Unlike Dora , Bob did not have to look into the eyes of the child he was sacrificing for his own material comfort .
The child was a complete stranger to him and too far away to relate to in an intimate , personal way .
Unlike Dora , too , he did not mislead the child or initiate the chain of events imperiling him .
In all these respects , Bob 's situation resembles that of people able but unwilling to donate to overseas aid and differs from Dora 's situation .
If you still think that it was very wrong of Bob not to throw the switch that would have diverted the train and saved the child 's life , then it is hard to see how you could deny that it is also very wrong not to send money to one of the organizations listed above .
Unless , that is , there is some morally important difference between the two situations that I have overlooked .
Is it the practical uncertainties about whether aid will really reach the people who need it ?
Nobody who knows the world of overseas aid can doubt that such uncertainties exist .
But Unger 's figure of $ 200 to save a child 's life was reached after he had made conservative assumptions about the proportion of the money donated that will actually reach its target .
One genuine difference between Bob and those who can afford to donate to overseas aid organizations but do n't is that only Bob can save the child on the tracks , whereas there are hundreds of millions of people who can give $ 200 to overseas aid organizations .
The problem is that most of them are n't doing it .
Does this mean that it is all right for you not to do it ?
Suppose that there were more owners of priceless vintage cars — Carol , Dave , Emma , Fred and so on , down to Ziggy — all in exactly the same situation as Bob , with their own siding and their own switch , all sacrificing the child in order to preserve their own cherished car .
Would that make it all right for Bob to do the same ?
To answer this question affirmatively is to endorse follow - the - crowd ethics — the kind of ethics that led many Germans to look away when the Nazi atrocities were being committed .
We do not excuse them because others were behaving no better .
We seem to lack a sound basis for drawing a clear moral line between Bob 's situation and that of any reader of this article with $ 200 to spare who does not donate it to an overseas aid agency .
These readers seem to be acting at least as badly as Bob was acting when he chose to let the runaway train hurtle toward the unsuspecting child .
In the light of this conclusion , I trust that many readers will reach for the phone and donate that $ 200 .
Perhaps you should do it before reading further .
ow that you have distinguished yourself morally from people who put their vintage cars ahead of a child 's life , how about treating yourself and your partner to dinner at your favorite restaurant ?
But wait .
The money you will spend at the restaurant could also help save the lives of children overseas !
True , you were n't planning to blow $ 200 tonight , but if you were to give up dining out just for one month , you would easily save that amount .
And what is one month 's dining out , compared to a child 's life ?
There 's the rub .
Since there are a lot of desperately needy children in the world , there will always be another child whose life you could save for another $ 200 .
Are you therefore obliged to keep giving until you have nothing left ?
At what point can you stop ?
Hypothetical examples can easily become farcical .
Consider Bob .
How far past losing the Bugatti should he go ?
Imagine that Bob had got his foot stuck in the track of the siding , and if he diverted the train , then before it rammed the car it would also amputate his big toe .
Should he still throw the switch ?
What if it would amputate his foot ?
His entire leg ?
As absurd as the Bugatti scenario gets when pushed to extremes , the point it raises is a serious one : only when the sacrifices become very significant indeed would most people be prepared to say that Bob does nothing wrong when he decides not to throw the switch .
Of course , most people could be wrong ; we can't decide moral issues by taking opinion polls .
But consider for yourself the level of sacrifice that you would demand of Bob , and then think about how much money you would have to give away in order to make a sacrifice that is roughly equal to that .
It 's almost certainly much , much more than $ 200 .
For most middle - class Americans , it could easily be more like $ 200,000 .
sn't it counterproductive to ask people to do so much ?
Do n't we run the risk that many will shrug their shoulders and say that morality , so conceived , is fine for saints but not for them ?
I accept that we are unlikely to see , in the near or even medium - term future , a world in which it is normal for wealthy Americans to give the bulk of their wealth to strangers .
When it comes to praising or blaming people for what they do , we tend to use a standard that is relative to some conception of normal behavior .
Comfortably off Americans who give , say , 10 percent of their income to overseas aid organizations are so far ahead of most of their equally comfortable fellow citizens that I would n't go out of my way to chastise them for not doing more .
Nevertheless , they should be doing much more , and they are in no position to criticize Bob for failing to make the much greater sacrifice of his Bugatti .
At this point various objections may crop up .
Someone may say : " If every citizen living in the affluent nations contributed his or her share I would n't have to make such a drastic sacrifice , because long before such levels were reached , the resources would have been there to save the lives of all those children dying from lack of food or medical care .
So why should I give more than my fair share ? "
Another , related , objection is that the Government ought to increase its overseas aid allocations , since that would spread the burden more equitably across all taxpayers .
Yet the question of how much we ought to give is a matter to be decided in the real world — and that , sadly , is a world in which we know that most people do not , and in the immediate future will not , give substantial amounts to overseas aid agencies .
We know , too , that at least in the next year , the United States Government is not going to meet even the very modest Umited Nations - recommended target of 0.7 percent of gross national product ; at the moment it lags far below that , at 0.09 percent , not even half of Japan 's 0.22 percent or a tenth of Denmark 's 0.97 percent .
Thus , we know that the money we can give beyond that theoretical " fair share " is still going to save lives that would otherwise be lost .
While the idea that no one need do more than his or her fair share is a powerful one , should it prevail if we know that others are not doing their fair share and that children will die preventable deaths unless we do more than our fair share ?
That would be taking fairness too far .
Thus , this ground for limiting how much we ought to give also fails .
In the world as it is now , I can see no escape from the conclusion that each one of us with wealth surplus to his or her essential needs should be giving most of it to help people suffering from poverty so dire as to be life - threatening .
That 's right : I 'm saying that you should n't buy that new car , take that cruise , redecorate the house or get that pricey new suit .
After all , a $ 1,000 suit could save five children 's lives .
So how does my philosophy break down in dollars and cents ?
An American household with an income of $ 50,000 spends around $ 30,000 annually on necessities , according to the Conference Board , a nonprofit economic research organization .
Therefore , for a household bringing in $ 50,000 a year , donations to help the world 's poor should be as close as possible to $ 20,000 .
The $ 30,000 required for necessities holds for higher incomes as well .
So a household making $ 100,000 could cut a yearly check for $ 70,000 .
Again , the formula is simple : whatever money you 're spending on luxuries , not necessities , should be given away .
Now , evolutionary psychologists tell us that human nature just is n't sufficiently altruistic to make it plausible that many people will sacrifice so much for strangers .
On the facts of human nature , they might be right , but they would be wrong to draw a moral conclusion from those facts .
If it is the case that we ought to do things that , predictably , most of us wo n't do , then let 's face that fact head - on .
Then , if we value the life of a child more than going to fancy restaurants , the next time we dine out we will know that we could have done something better with our money .
If that makes living a morally decent life extremely arduous , well , then that is the way things are .
If we do n't do it , then we should at least know that we are failing to live a morally decent life — not because it is good to wallow in guilt but because knowing where we should be going is the first step toward heading in that direction .
When Bob first grasped the dilemma that faced him as he stood by that railway switch , he must have thought how extraordinarily unlucky he was to be placed in a situation in which he must choose between the life of an innocent child and the sacrifice of most of his savings .
But he was not unlucky at all .
We are all in that situation .
