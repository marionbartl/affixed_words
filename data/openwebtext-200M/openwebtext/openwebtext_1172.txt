( CNN ) --
Women were dismissed from the military for being gay at a greater rate than men last year , according to new statistics obtained by a California research group .
Women were dismissed from the military for being gay at a greater rate than men last year .
All the services kicked out a disproportionate number of women under the " Do n't Ask , Don't Tell " policy , according to Department of Defense data obtained by the Palm Center at the University of California , Santa Barbara .
The center studies gender and sexuality in the military .
The " Do n't Ask , Don't Tell " policy , implemented in 1994 , bans troops who are openly gay from serving in the military .
In the Air Force , a majority of those removed were women , the first time a service has had such a record since the implementation of the controversial law in 1994 , according to Palm Center senior research fellow Nathaniel Frank .

In fiscal year 2008 , the Air Force dismissed 56 women and 34 men .
In addition , the Army removed more women under the " Do n't Ask , Don't Tell " policy at a greater rate than men when compared with the ratio of women to men in each service .
Of those discharged under the policy , 36 percent were women , although women make up only 14 percent of troops in the Army , the data showed .

Water Hammer and Air in Pipes
Water Pipe Noise and Things that go Bump in the Night .
Is your sprinkler system making odd noises ?
That sound may be water hammer , but then again , there are other things that create noise in water pipes .
Air in the pipes can cause them to make sounds which are easily confused with water hammer .
In a few cases I have dealt with , the thumping turned out to be loose pipes striking each other .
What I will attempt to do in this tutorial is take you through a few steps to determine the source of the sound and then suggest some remedies .
I will start with the easy fixes ( that are , unfortunately , less likely to work ) and then move on to tougher ones ( which are more likely to work . )
Many years ago I was called in to consult on a large high school irrigation system that was having water hammer problems .
The water hammer was literally blowing apart the system .
Two guys were working full time just repairing the pipe breaks !
They had tried for months to fix it and numerous irrigation equipment salesmen had checked it out .
They had spent hundreds of dollars on adding additional equipment which was supposed to cure the problem , such as air vents , and a " huge water hammer arrester " .
But the problem continued .
We looked at the original plans for the system and the problem was almost immediately obvious .
The water was flowing through the system backwards !
Apparently someone decided to move the well location from one end of the property to the other .
They did n't bother to redesign the sprinkler system , they just ran the water through it from the other direction .
Unfortunately , that meant the water started out in the smallest pipe in the system .
I suggested they add a second pipe next to the small one that was restricting the flow .
They did , problem solved , no more water hammer !
They could have saved thousands of dollars in repair work and unneeded equipment .
The moral of the story is always look for the source of the problem before you try to fix it .
A quick disclosure before continuing - these explanations are intended for the average Joe .
All you physicists and engineers out there need to relax .
I realize these are not perfectly accurate scientific explanations .
There are other websites that dwell into the nitty - gritty details with lots of formulas that will make your day .
You 'll find one at http://www.lmnoeng.com/WaterHammer/WaterHammer.htm.
It has lots of formulas !
The majority of the people reading this do not want to deal with scientific theory and mathematical problems , they just want to know how to quiet things down so they can sleep at night !
Some of the solutions I mention in this tutorial may not meet plumbing codes in some areas .
Plumbing codes and standards vary from city to city .
It is always best to check with local building department officials before modifying the plumbing inside your home .
Identify the Problem
The first thing to check is the water pressure in your house .
You can buy a pressure gauge for this at most hardware and home improvement stores .
Attach the gauge to the cold water outlet for your washing machine .
( Some water will spill out of the washing machine hose when you remove it , so hold a towel under it . )
Turn off the water for anything in the house that uses water .
This includes all the faucets in the house , ice makers , reverse - osmosis type water purifiers , and make sure the toilets are n't filling .
Any water running in the house may cause an inaccurate reading on the gauge .
Turn on the water faucet that the gauge is attached to , and then read the water pressure on the gauge .
That 's all there is to it !
After the test turn off the water and disconnect the gauge .
( Some water will spill out of the gauge when you remove it so hold a towel under it when you remove it . )
The pressure reading you get from the gauge should be 60 PSI or less .
Pressures higher than 60 PSI can be the source of the noise problem .
But just as important , water pressures higher than 60 PSI can cause a lot of other plumbing problems too .
So if the pressure is higher than 60 PSI you need to fix that first .
The solution for high water pressure is to install a pressure reducing valve on the pipe that brings water into your house .
( Pressure reducing valves may also be called " pressure regulators " or " pressure regulating valves " depending on the brand of valve and where you buy it . )
If you already have a pressure reducing valve it is probably broken .
They tend to break or wear out after about 10 - 15 years of service .
You can try adjusting it to see if it is just set wrong , however be prepared for the need for an immediate replacement if you do this .
If one of the parts inside the pressure reducing valve is broken , the valve may jamb closed when you try to adjust it .
If this happens you will need to replace the valve immediately !
To adjust the pressure on the valve you turn the bolt that protrudes from the bell shaped part of the valve ( see photo below ) .
When selecting a new pressure reducing valve make sure you get a brass - body model similar to that shown in the photo below .
Warning : installing or replacing a pressure reducing valve involves a moderate to high level of plumbing skill , you may want to hire a plumber for this if you are not experienced with plumbing .
Typically it requires cutting pipes .
( Yes , the pressure on the gauge in the photo above is 112 PSI .
The pressure reducing valve on my house was broken when I took the photo .
So it happens to all of us . )
If the water pressure is less than 50 PSI , then the next thing to check is for loose pipes that may be bumping each other , making noise .
In the case of loose pipes the sound will usually become much louder as you approach the source .
In one instance a tutorial user wrote me to say that he discovered that the problem was a backflow preventer that wobbled when the irrigation system was running and bumped the side of the house .
So start by listening for a sound source and looking for anything loose .
It would be frustrating to spend tons of money trying to fix what you thought was a water hammer problem only to discover the fix was to stuff a 50 cent piece of foam between two pipes !
When water moves through a pipe it makes noise .
Although it might seem to be a smooth flow , the water inside the pipe actually churns and tumbles as it moves through .
The normal sound of water moving through pipes is a steady , even sound .
The best way to know what it sounds like is to go turn the bathtub water on full blast , then go to other rooms of the house and listen .
( Do n't let the tub overflow ! )
Some newer bathtubs do n't use enough water to make the pipes " sing " so you may have to turn on several faucets at the same time to create enough volume .
The sound you will hear is the normal sound of water flowing through the pipes .
If that is the sound you are hearing that is bothering you , then unfortunately , there is little you can easily do about it .
Water makes more noise as it moves faster through the pipes .
Replacing the pipes with larger pipes will reduce or even eliminate the noise you can hear .
But that is a huge undertaking .
A continuous thump , thump , thump noise , consisting of evenly spaced thumps when the water is running may be caused by a under - size water meter .
The noise may also be a tapping sound .
The noise may appear to come from the water heater as the tank amplifies the sound .
Check the water meter , you will likely hear the noise coming from it .
The solution is to install a larger meter .
A pipe that is changing temperature will clunk as it expands or contracts .
The noise results from the pipe suddenly shifting position .
This is common inside a house when hot water is turned on .
The hot water flows into the cold pipes causing them to expand .
But this temperature change related noise may also occur in less expected times and locations .
For example a water pipe that supplies irrigation water may pass through an attic or crawl space where it may get hot on a warm day .
When the irrigation comes on cold water is pulled into the pipe , causing it to contract and make noise .
The key to pipe expansion / contraction related noise is that the clanking noises are not uniformly spaced , they occur randomly .
The noise is generally noticeable but not loud .
The noise occurs soon after water is turned on someplace and stops after a minute or two as the pipes reach the new temperature .
Installing insulation on the pipes may help reduce the noise .
Loosening straps that hold the pipes in place may also reduce the noise by allowing the pipe to slide easier as it expands and contracts .
Often there is little you can do to completely eliminate this type of noise and it is something you will just have to live with .
Air in the pipes can cause an awful lot of noise !
It can be much worse to listen to than true water hammer .
The noise of air in the pipes is often a vibrating sound or a rapid ticking sound similar in pace to a machine gun firing .
( At least what one sounds like in the movies . )
Air in the pipes can be really difficult to get rid of .
Air tends to get trapped at high points of the pipe system where it is difficult to push out .
As the water moves in the pipes it breaks the pockets of air up into tiny bubbles .
Then the water flows past the bubbles , leaving the air still in the pipe .
These tiny bubbles moving around , and expanding and contracting , are that rapid vibrating sound you hear .
( Everyone who has been to Hawaii knows how annoying the sound of Tiny Bubbles can become after a few repetitions . )
Water hammer can also be the source of the noise .
Water hammer can be a big thump that shakes the house , or a series of banging noises starting with a loud bang followed by several " echoes " .
The best way to identify if the noise is water hammer is to ask yourself " when does it happen ? "
If the noise occurs when you open a valve or a faucet , it is probably air in the pipes .
If it occurs when a valve closes or the washer changes cycles , it is probably water hammer .
If it occurs when a pump starts , it could be water hammer , air in the pipes , or both .
Although opening valves can sometimes create water hammer , this typically only occurs with valves larger than 3 " in size , and even then it is reasonably rare .
In fact , in my 20 + years in the business I have never actually seen water hammer caused by a valve opening .
So here 's your noisy pipe checklist :
Noise when a valve closes = water hammer .
Noise unrelated to valve opening or closing = air in pipes or loose pipes moving around and striking objects .
Noise when a pump starts = water hammer and / or air in pipes .
Loud single thumps or multiple quick bumps , then no noise .
This tends to be water hammer .
Vibrating and prolonged noises tend to be air in the pipes .
A continuous , uniformly spaced tap , tap , tap noise when water is running may be caused by an under - size water meter .
As hot water flows into a cold pipe , or cold water into a hot pipe , the pipe will expand or contract and make noises .
This will create a clunking noise that goes away in a minute or two once the pipe fully changes temperature .
Air in the Pipes
There are only two ways I know of to get the air out ; push it out by increasing the water velocity ( speed ) , or open the pipe and release the air .
To push the air out you need to temporarily increase the water velocity to the point the water " sweeps " out the air bubbles .
To increase the velocity you need to turn on as many water outlets as possible .
That creates a high water demand and the water velocity goes way up .
As the water rushes through the pipe the trapped air is swept along with it and out of the pipe .
If the air is in the irrigation mainline ( a mainline is the pipe upstream of the circuit control valves ) you should be able to increase the velocity by manually opening two or more of the circuit valves at once .
Most electric irrigation valves can be manually opened by twisting a lever under the valve 's solenoid ( the thing the wires go into ) , or by partially unscrewing a bleed screw on top of the valve .
Do not remove the bleed screw , just slowly turn it until the valve opens .
Open all of the valves at the same time if you need to .
Let the water run for a while to give it a chance to push all the air out .
When you close the valves close them one at a time .
Closing them all at once can cause a pressure surge that can damage your irrigation system .
Do n't be surprised if the valves take a long time to close , this is fairly normal when more than one valve is opened at the same time .
If the electric valves wo n't close , slowly turn off the main water supply to the irrigation system , wait one minute , then slowly turn it back on .
They should now be closed .
If the noise only occurs when an individual sprinkler valve ( always the same valve ) is opened the air may be in the lateral pipe ( the pipe downstream of the valve . )
In that case you will need to temporarily remove some of the sprinkler heads on that valve circuit in order to increase the water velocity .
Remove the 3 sprinkler heads furthest from the valve and then open the valve to flush out the air .
If that does n't get it out try removing more sprinklers .
After the air is flushed out , put the sprinkler heads back on .
If that fixes the problem temporarily but it returns after the next time you irrigate , then the problem is that the water is draining out of the pipes through the sprinkler heads after each irrigation .
This is probably because one or more sprinkler heads are lower than the others .
When the water drains out , air gets back into the pipes .
To prevent this you need to install " anti- drain check valves " at the inlet of each sprinkler head .
The anti-drain check valve is a small spring - loaded check valve .
The check valve holds back the water so it does n't drain out .
It does not effect the performance of the sprinkler head noticeably .
Many sprinkler heads are available with this feature built - in to the sprinkler .
Some brands also have retrofit kits available that allow the check valves to be easily installed in existing sprinklers .
The built - in anti-drain check valves do not effect the performance of the sprinkler at all .
If the air is in your household pipes try turning on all the faucets in the house and then flush all the toilets .
Again , give it a few minutes to push that air out .
If you know where the water supply comes into your house turn off the faucets starting with the one closest to the water supply entry point , then close them one at a time moving away from the entry point .
As you come to a toilet when you are moving through the house turning off faucets , flush it again , then wait two minutes before closing the next faucet .
Do n't forget the faucets on the outside of the house !
If the above procedures did n't get the air out ...
Next try a water hammer arrestor .
This often does n't work with air problems , but it 's worth a try .
At your local hardware or home store look for a pre-packaged water hammer arrestor that attaches to a standard washing machine cold - water outlet .
The ones I have seen come in one of those clear plastic display packages , and look like a copper tube with hose connections .
Check the return policy of the store before you buy it , if you can , buy it someplace where they will take it back if it does n't work .
Make sure you keep all the packaging .
Install it per the directions on the package .
If it does n't work , remove it and return it .
If the air can't be pushed out , and the water hammer arrestor did n't work , you will need to find where the air is trapped in the pipe and " open the pipe " to release it .
Air rises above water , so the air is likely trapped in a high spot in the piping .
Try to visualize how your irrigation system is laid out .
Are there any obvious high points where air might be trapped ?
If you can identify a likely high point turn off the main water shut - off valve and open a faucet or valve to release the water pressure .
Then cut the pipe at the high point and install a tee on it with a small valve on the tee outlet .
A compression type tee may be easier to install .
A 1/2 " valve , or even a smaller one if you can find one , will work fine for the valve .
Do not use a gate valve !
Gate valves tend to leak easily .
Ball valves work good .
See the drawing below .
The valve needs to be on a short nipple , a few inches above the pipe as shown .
( Stop snickering , in the irrigation business a nipple is the name of a short length of pipe .
If you really like to giggle at odd names read the glossary . )
Close the faucet and turn the water back on .
The air will rise to the highest point which is the short upright nipple under the valve .
You can then open the valve just a little bit to let the air escape .
Some water is going to come out too , so be prepared for it to squirt !
After releasing the air put a plug in the outlet of the valve for safety .
Sometimes you will get all the air out and everything will be fine for a while , then without warning , the air noise will return .
This is because the water coming into your house or irrigation system sometimes has air trapped in it .
Have you ever filled a glass of water from the kitchen faucet and noticed it was a milky white color ?
But after sitting for a while it turns clear .
That white color most likely was caused by tiny bubbles of air in the water ( at least I hope it was ! )
This air can get in the water lots of ways , it is fairly normal and does n't by itself mean your water is polluted or not drinkable .
But this air does tend to rise out of the water when the water is sitting in your pipes , and it can form an air pocket in the pipe after a while .
This causes the wonderful air noise you enjoy so much to return .
If this happens often you can add a " continuous venting " type air vent in place of the valve in the drawing above .
The air vent needs to be the type that releases air while under pressure .
The type of air vents that are made for most irrigation systems will not work .
The type you want has a float connected to an arm that uses a lever to open and close a small valve that allows the air to escape .
The correct vent type is often called an " air eliminator " or " air relief valve . "
Look for that term " continuous venting " .
Most plumbing supply stores will have one .
A 1/4 " size one should work fine .
Water Hammer
True water hammer is essentially the sound of a " water wreck " occurring .
It happens when moving water suddenly changes speed .
Water hammer can be caused by a pump starting or a valve rapidly opening , however in the vast majority of cases it results when a valve closes .
Sometimes you can create it simply by closing a faucet very fast .
Many single lever household sink faucets will allow you to slam them closed fast enough to cause water hammer .
Closing the same valve slowly will not cause the water hammer .
However , more often the valve causing the problem is an automatic valve such as is used on an irrigation system .
Since most dishwashers and washing machines use the same type of valves as irrigation systems , you will sometimes get water hammer when the dishwasher or washing machine fill valve closes .
So for this tutorial I am going to focus on water hammer caused by closing valves .
Even though these so - called " electric valves " appear to be powered by electricity , they actually use water pressure as their major power source .
The electric solenoid on the valve operates a tiny " pilot valve " .
The water flow from this tiny valve is then used to open and close the bigger valve using hydraulic pressure .
This works well , but leaves a minor engineering problem .
It is very hard to get these valves to close slowly !
Engineers have made some great progress but they still have n't fully defeated what I call the 80/20 problem .
The 80/20 problem is that valves close slowly until they are about 80 % closed , then they tend to snap fully closed in a millisecond !
This causes the water in the pipes to suddenly stop moving .
Now we all know the story of Jack and Jill , and the reason Jack fell down is that water is heavy ( and perhaps Jack was paying too much attention to Jill , and not enough to his bucket , but I 'm getting off - track here . )
A column of water moving through the pipe at 7 feet per second carries with it a tremendous amount of weight and momentum .
While it's not a perfect example , the one commonly used is to think of the water in the pipe as a big freight train going through a long tunnel .
The valve closing is like blocking the end of the tunnel with thousands of tons of rock .
When the train slams into the blocked end of the tunnel there is going to be one horrific crash !
The faster that train is moving , the worse the crash will be .
Thus the problem with water velocity in the pipe .
The faster the water is moving , the worse the crash is going to be when the valve closes .
That crash is the cause of a big thumping noise when the valve closes .
Secondary thumps that follow are essentially " echoes " in the pipe .
Now that thumping sound would be bad enough , but a unique property of water makes the problem much worse than just an annoying noise .
Water is essentially non-compressible ( it compresses a little bit , but not much . )
So all the energy it carries with it when it slams into the closed valve has to go someplace .
So the energy creates a brief , but enormous , spike it the water pressure in the pipes .
This spike can easily double or triple the water pressure in your system .
The pressure spike occurs so fast that a standard pressure gauge will not even register it .
But this increased water pressure does n't just hang around the vicinity of the valve .
It passes as a shock wave back through the pipe at ( almost ) the speed of sound in water , seeking a way out .
This creates stress on the pipe , and if there is a weak point in the piping the pressure surge will find it .
So each time the water hammer occurs it is putting stress on the pipe , which weakens the pipe .
If you hear the noise in your house , then the pipe in the house is being damaged , even if the source of the surge is someplace else .
It shock wave travels through the water in the pipe .
So what kind of damage does it do ?
Consider a standard rubber balloon .
You blow up the balloon then let the air out .
You do this again and again .
Each time the balloon gets stretched a little more and weakens .
After being blown up many times the balloon simply bursts .
You did n't blow any more air into it than before , it just was weakened by the constant expanding and contracting .
The pipes in your home and irrigation system stress in a similar manner when exposed to these pressure spikes .
Where is the most likely weak spot where it will break ?
In my experience the first pipe to go is in the house , not the sprinkler system .
It is often the tube connecting a toilet or sink to the household water system , which is usually a hose or thin wall pipe .
The result is a flooded bathroom .
If you made an error in installing the irrigation system and forgot a clamp or did n't get a good strong glue joint you may see a leak there .
A small pinhole leak in plastic irrigation pipe or hose very quickly enlarges to the diameter of a pencil .
Points where the pipe changes direction also take a beating as the pressure surge wants to continue in a straight line rather than go around the bend .
There is one last frustrating problem with water hammer , which is that the sound you hear often appears to be coming from someplace other than the point where the water hammer was created .
This is because sound travels very well through the pipe and the water in it .
So you can't rely on your ears to find the source of the water hammer .
Water hammer is influenced by three variables , understanding these variables will help you find the source of your water hammer problem .
The first variable is the length of the pipe the water is traveling through .
We can't do much about the length of your pipes , assuming that you can't move your house closer to the water source .
But it is an important factor in creating water hammer , so it is useful to take a look at it , especially as it relates to the pipe size .
For example , in some situations you can force a high rate of flow through a small pipe without problems , provided the length of the pipe is short , say , a few feet .
The shorter the pipe , the smaller it can be .
Knowing this will help you when you try to identify the source of the water hammer .
So keep in mind that a small pipe may not be a problem if it is a very short length .
The second variable is time , or specifically how fast the water is being stopped .
When a closing valve is causing water hammer , time is how long it takes for the valve to close .
Most irrigation valves take several seconds to close .
Theoretically this would not cause a problem , as several seconds is very slow when dealing with water hammer .
The problem is that 80/20 ratio I mentioned previously .
The valve may take a few seconds to go from full open to full closed , but it has a tendency to snap closed when it gets down to that last 20 % .
Realistically the actual closing time of a typical irrigation solenoid valve is around 1 / 2 to 1 second as best I can tell .
But it varies greatly , even when testing the same valve .
For example , an irrigation valve closes much faster if there is higher water pressure present .
It also closes faster as you increase the flow through the valve ( increasing the flow creates a greater pressure differential across the valve , which causes it to close faster . )
So a valve that would not cause a water hammer problem at a low flow and low pressure , will cause all kinds of problems if you increase the flow through the valve and / or the water pressure .
The third factor that influences water hammer is the velocity of the water .
The faster the water is traveling in the pipe , the greater the water hammer .
It is this last factor which is easiest for us to correct in a sprinkler system , so most of the suggested solutions for water hammer will be aimed at reducing the water velocity .
Be aware that there are many " quick fix " devices that are supposed to fix water hammer problems for you .
My experience has been that air vents , air traps , and water hammer arresters seldom work with automatic irrigation systems .
Irrigation systems , particularly sprinkler systems , tend to have much more severe water hammer problems than that found in household plumbing .
These devices are made to stop water hammer that is caused by household uses and they will often cure the problem in those cases .
But I have never seen one fix water hammer caused by an automatic sprinkler system .
Now you need to do some detective work .
Take the time to do some research .
Listen for the water hammer noise .
What 's happening when , and especially just prior to , the time when the sound occurs ?
Water hammer is set off by something , it does n't just occur randomly .
Chances are a irrigation valve closes when the sound occurs .
Closing irrigation valves are the source most of the time .
Another frequent cause is the fill valve on a dishwasher or washing machine closing .
Once you know what happens , you can focus in on it as the potential source of the problem .
Solutions for Water Hammer Caused by Washing Machines and Dishwashers :
If the noise occurs when a washing machine or dishwasher valve closes the problem is that the appliance is demanding more water than one or more of the pipes supplying to it can safely handle .
We 'll try the cheapest solution first .
This is the cheapest solution but not really the best .
I would only use it as a temporary fix .
Try partially closing the shut - off valve for the appliance .
Start by closing it half way .
If that does n't get rid of the noise close it a little more , keep repeating until the noise stops .
Closing the valve reduces the flow to the appliance , and thus reduces the velocity in the pipes .
Unfortunately many dishwashers and washing machines use a fill timer rather than actually measuring if the washer is full .
Sometimes when you close the valve partially the washer does n't get enough water and the clothes or dishes do n't get clean .
So check to see if closing the valve is creating cleaning problems .
If it is , reopen the valve a little and try again .
There should be a short tube that leads from the shutoff valve to a appliance .
Often this tube is a piece of 1/2 " hose or a 3/8 " copper tube .
This tube should not be more than three or four feet long , if it is longer the tube may be part of the problem , so try replacing it with a larger tube .
The next trick to try is installing a AA - size water hammer arrester on the pipe at the shut - off valve .
While these devices are seldom useful for irrigation systems , they often do work with appliances because the water demand is not nearly as high as a sprinkler system .
You can get a water hammer arrester at just about any plumbing supply store .
At your local hardware or home store look for a pre-packaged water hammer arrestor that attaches to a standard washing machine cold water outlet .
The ones I have seen come in one of those clear plastic display packages , and look like a copper tube with hose connections .
Check the return policy of the store before you buy it , will they take it back if it does n't work ?
Make sure you keep all the packaging .
Install it per the directions on the package .
If you are installing it on a dishwasher fill , you will probably need some adapters to make it fit .
If it does n't work , remove it and return it .
Air chambers are pretty much worthless , none of the building codes recognize them any more for water hammer control .
An air chamber is just a long section of vertical tube with a cap on the top of it .
The idea is that air is trapped in the tube and absorbs the water hammer shock .
They may work for a while , but they become water - logged with time .
They also need to be huge , generally at least 3/ 4 " size and several feet long ..
So if someone suggests one , I recommend not wasting your time and money .
The last option is to tear out the walls or floors and install a new , larger pipe to the appliance .
Before you do that run a test .
Get a 3/4 " heavy duty garden hose .
It will cost a lot , but at least you can reuse it in the garden .
Hook up one end to the flush outlet on your water heater , and connect your appliance to the other end .
Then run the appliance , the water hammer should be gone .
If the water hammer is still there , then the pipe in the wall is not the problem .
Solutions for Water Hammer Caused by Irrigation Systems :
The easiest solution is to lower the water pressure for your entire irrigation system .
This does n't really get rid of all of the water hammer , but it will sometimes reduce it to a level you can live with .
Of course often when you lower the pressure enough to stop the water hammer the sprinkler system stops working too .
Lowering the pressure has two effects .
It lowers the water demand of the sprinklers , which in turn reduces the velocity in the pipes .
That actually reduces the water hammer .
Lowering the pressure also reduces the overall surge pressure when the water hammer occurs .
That simply reduces the severity of the water hammer , but does n't get rid of it .
To test if this will eliminate the noise , simply go to the main shutoff valve for the sprinkler system .
( If your sprinkler system does n't have a shut - off you will need to install one . )
Close it down until it is about 50 % closed .
Now run the sprinkler system .
If the water hammer is still there , close the valve a little more and repeat .
Continue this until the water hammer goes away .
When the water hammer is gone , check your sprinklers .
Are they still operating correctly ?
If they are operating correctly the water from any single sprinkler should be spraying almost all the way to the adjacent sprinkler head ( you need about 80 % overlap of the water between sprinklers to keep from getting dry spots . )
So if the sprinklers are 18 feet apart the water from each one should be covering an area at least 14.4 feet out from the sprinkler ( 18 x 0.80 = 14.4 ) .
If the water is not going far enough you will get dry spots , so this solution will not work .
If the sprinklers seem to be still working good leave the valve partially closed for a few days .
Do any other problems shown up ?
Like the showers do n't work in the house or dry spots show up in the lawn ?
If not you should go to the plumbing store and buy a good quality , brass bodied , adjustable pressure reducing valve .
Install it right after the shut - off valve that you partially closed .
Then open the shut - off valve fully and adjust the pressure reducing valve until the pressure is at a level where the sprinklers work right but the water hammer is n't a problem .
You should not leave the shut - off valve partially closed for more than a couple of weeks .
Most of those valves are not designed to be left permanently in a partially closed position .
Also the pressure reducing valve is designed to compensate for changes in the incoming water pressure to your house .
The shut - off valve can't do that .
If only one valve zone of the sprinkler system creates water hammer you can try partially closing the flow control stem on the irrigation control valve .
If that works , the flow control may be left in a partially closed position permanently , it will not harm the valve .
If you have an automatic sprinkler system you may be able to get rid of the water hammer by simply changing the order in which the valves operate .
Simply find out which valve uses the least water .
This will probably be the one with the least sprinklers , but not always .
Some sprinklers use more water than others .
Once you know which valve uses the least water , rewire the controller so that the valve that uses the least water is the last valve to run .
If you do n't know which one uses the least water just try all of them in the last position .
Since water hammer is directly related to flow , the valve that uses the least water is much less likely to cause water hammer when it closes .
The reason putting this low flow valve last works is because most irrigation valves close slowly .
So typically valve # 4 will not have completely closed when the next valve , # 5 , opens .
So when valve 4 snaps closed it creates a shock wave ( water hammer ) , but the wave passes harmlessly out of the system through valve circuit # 5 .
Do n't worry if you did n't understand how that works , just try switching the valve order on the controller and see if it gets rid of the water hammer problem !
( My thanks to Larry Welch for pointing this trick out to me ! )
The next step is to try a water hammer arrestor .
As noted before , this often does n't work with sprinkler related water hammer , but it 's worth a try .
At your local hardware or home store look for a pre-packaged water hammer arrestor that attaches to a standard washing machine cold water outlet .
The ones I have seen come in one of those clear plastic display packages , and look like a copper tube with hose connections .
Check the return policy of the store before you buy it , will they take it back if it does n't work ?
Make sure you keep all the packaging .
Install it per the directions on the package , try putting it on a hose bib close to the point where the irrigation system connects to the house water .
If you have a hose bib on the irrigation system mainline , that is an even better place .
Or you can tap into the irrigation mainline to install it .
If it does n't work , remove it and return it .
If the noises were caused by an irrigation valve , then it is likely that someplace between the water source and that valve the water velocity is too high .
Too much water is trying to squeeze itself through the pipe .
To get through the pipe the water moves faster ( higher velocity ) and the faster it goes , the worse the water hammer gets .
You have to reduce the speed of that water to get rid of the water hammer .
Here are some ways to do that .
The irrigation valve may be too small .
This is seldom the problem , but I mention it because it is possible .
If the valve is the same size as the pipe it is installed on ( say , 1 " pipe with a 1 " valve ) then it is extremely unlikely that the valve size is the problem .
If the valve is one size smaller than the pipe ( say , 1 " pipe with a 3/ 4 " valve ) then there is a very small chance that the valve is the problem .
It is normal to use a valve one size smaller than the pipe , so this is still is not very likely a problem .
If the valve is a couple of sizes smaller than the pipe then there is a reasonable possibility that a larger valve will fix the problem .
Also , cheaper valves often snap closed faster than more expensive ones .
So a cheap undersized valve might be a good possibility as the water hammer source .
It might be worth the effort of replacing the valve .
This next option was once a good one , but now it seldom works because very few of these old sprinklers are still around .
Really old sprinkler systems ( 15 years or more ) used sprinklers heads that had a much higher water demand than today 's sprinklers .
Typically these sprinklers were made of solid brass .
Thanks to engineering advances newer sprinklers have similar performance but use much less water .
You could try replacing the old sprinklers with the new , low - flow sprinklers .
Start by doing some research .
Note the sprinkler manufacturer 's name and the sprinkler model number of the existing sprinklers and do a search for that name and number on the Internet .
If the sprinkler is no longer made that 's a good sign .
If you can find it check with the manufacturer to find out what the GPM of the sprinkler is .
GPM is the gallons per minute of water the sprinkler uses .
Next check how far apart the sprinklers are installed from each other .
Take that number and multiply it by 0.80 .
So if the sprinklers are 18 feet apart you will get 18 x 0.80 = 14.4 Round up , so use 15 .
The replacement sprinkler will need to have a radius equal to that number , so in this case it will need a 15 foot radius ( not diameter ) .
Go to the store and look for sprinklers that cover that radius .
Then check the GPM demand of the new sprinklers .
If they use less water than your current sprinklers you can replace the old sprinklers with new ones .
It may get rid of the water hammer .
It may not .
But even if it does n't work you get a better irrigation system .
Note that if you are using pop -up sprinklers always use the ones with retraction springs .
I recommend at least a 3 " pop - up height to reduce maintenance problems .
Splitting valve zones is another method of getting rid of water hammer .
If only one of the irrigation valves is causing water hammer the easiest solution is to reduce the amount of water that valve is using .
That will reduce the velocity and the water hammer will stop .
To do that you need to reduce the number of sprinkler heads the valve operates .
The easiest way to do that is usually to install a second valve and connect half the sprinklers to it .
That 's likely going to mean doing some trenching and installing some new pipe .
So before you do that , you should run a simple test to make sure it will fix the problem .
Remove half the sprinklers controlled by the valve and put a cap on the pipes where they were .
Now turn on and off the valve several times to test for water hammer .
If possible test the valve multiple times at different times of the day over a period of a week .
If the water hammer only occurred at certain times of the day be sure to test at those times .
For example , often water hammer problems are much worse at night , so it 's a good idea to test a couple of times late at night .
If the water hammer is gone , it worked !
If the water hammer is still there you may need to remove even more sprinklers .
If you remove all the sprinklers and the water hammer is still there , that valve is obviously not the problem !
If the water hammer goes away when you reduce the number of sprinklers , then you will need to install a second valve and pipe to provide water to the sprinkler heads that were removed .
Make sure the second valve has the same number or less sprinkler heads as the original one .
You do n't want to create another water hammer problem !
You may even have to install 3 valve circuits where there was one originally .
If the water hammer occurs when several valves close you can split each of them into two or more valves as described above .
But you may find that it is easier to install a new , larger pipe to all of the valves .
Remember , when water hammer occurs due to a closing valve it is because the water is going too fast in a pipe someplace on the upstream side of the valves .
In order to understand this next procedure you need to be familiar with the relationship between your house plumbing and your sprinkler system and you need to know some terminology .
Your water comes to your neighborhood in large " water mains " ( pipes ) , usually located in the street , that supply the entire neighborhood with water .
These pipes are owned by the water provider .
" ( pipes ) , usually located in the street , that supply the entire neighborhood with water .
These pipes are owned by the water provider .
From the water main a smaller pipe known as a " gooseneck " carries the water to your property line .
This is also owned by the water provider .
" carries the water to your property line .
This is also owned by the water provider .
Often there is a buried valve known as a " corporation stop " at the point where the gooseneck reaches your property .
There may also me a water meter right after the corporation stop .
In northern climates the water meter and maybe even the corporation stop will be installed within the house ( usually in the basement ) to protect it from freezing .
The corporation stop marks the end of the water company 's pipe and the start of your private household pipe .

The corporation stop marks the end of the water company 's pipe and the start of your private household pipe .
The pipe from the corporation stop to the faucets in your house is the " house water supply pipe " .
This is usually a single pipe that branches off to all the faucets when it gets inside the house .
" .
This is usually a single pipe that branches off to all the faucets when it gets inside the house .
The pipe running from the house water supply pipe to the irrigation system valves is called the " irrigation mainline " .
The irrigation mainline connects to the house water supply pipe at some point .
Where is anyone 's guess , I 've seen just about every possibility over the years .
There should be a shut - off valve at the point the irrigation system connects to the house water supply .
Should be ... but often there is n't .
If there is n't you should consider adding one .
So now it 's time for more detective work .
( In this case detective work also means " hard work " . )
You need to check all the pipes the water passes through on the way from the water main to the valves to see if there is a " bottleneck " -- a section of pipe that is smaller than the others .
You will need to check all of the pipes previously mentioned ; the gooseneck , the house water supply pipe and the irrigation mainline .
You only need to check the pipes in a direct line between the water provider 's water main and the source of the water hammer ( most likely the irrigation valves . )
To understand this think of all the pipes as if they were roads .
Imagine you want to " drive " from the water main to the irrigation valve and you want to take the most direct route .
The water also will take the most direct route .
So the pipes you want to check are those on that direct route .
Do n't worry about any pipes that branch off to elsewhere .
The water wo n't take any side trips to see the local sights .
Like I said , this is going to take some detective work to figure out which pipes the water is going through and where they are !
This may require digging a lot of small " test holes " to find buried pipes and determine what size they are .
If you are lucky , you will find a section of pipe that is smaller than the others .
This is likely the source of the problem , replace it with a bigger pipe .
Remember , any of the pipes may be the one that is too small .
It could be the gooseneck , the house water supply pipe , or the irrigation mainline .
Here 's a quick tip : if the irrigation mainline hooks up to the location of a former hose - bib on the side of the house , the pipe leading to the hose - bib is almost always the problem .
Typically when the house is built , the plumber just runs a 1 / 2 " pipe to hose - bibs to save money .
A 1/2 " pipe is big enough for a hose to water the Petunias , but not big enough to supply a sprinkler system ! .
Unfortunately many do - it - yourself sprinkler installers do not know this , and some of those stupid " design your own sprinkler system " brochures you get at the hardware store even show people using a hose bib to connect the sprinkler system to .
A lot of sprinkler system repair guys have gotten rich thanks to those stupid brochures !
Stupid , stupid brochures !
OK , I need to calm down and get back on track .
There are numerous materials that pipe is made from .
The most common are copper , steel , galvanized steel , PVC , polyethylene , and a new product called PEX .
PVC is usually white ( sometimes gray ) colored plastic .
Polyethylene ( also Polybutylene ) is normally black .
Polyethylene , often called " poly " or " PE " , is more soft and flexible than PVC , and has a slightly " oily " feel .
You can scratch poly with a fingernail , but not PVC ( unless you 're using that " tough nails " stuff on them , in which case you can use them to rip out concrete . )
Copper is copper colored when new but often turns green if exposed to the weather .
Steel looks like , um ... , steel .
You know what steel looks like , right ?
A magnet sticks to steel but not copper .
PEX is a type of polyethylene , it is flexible like the Polyethylene , but much stronger .
It will normally say " PEX " on it , and be a color other than black .
Often it is white or blue .
and may look a lot like PVC , especially if it is old and dirty !
In the absence of the words PEX on the tube , check the diameter of the tube .
PEX is typically made to have the same outside diameter as copper tube .
Another way to tell is to look for the fittings that connect plastic ( non-threaded ) pieces together .
PVC pipe will be glued together , PEX tube will use barbs with clamps , or compression fittings .
If still in doubt , go to a plumbing supply store and check out actual samples to compare with what you have .
To determine the size of the pipe , grab a piece of string about 6 " ( 152 mm ) long .
Strip away any insulation on the pipe , so you can get at the pipe and wrap the string around it .
Measure how many inches of string it takes to go around the pipe once .
The string length is the circumference of the pipe ( yikes , bad memories of high school geometry ! ) .
Using the circumference we can calculate the diameter of the pipe , which allows us to calculate the pipe size , zzzzzzzzzz .....
Let 's forget all those calculations !
Based on the string length use the table below to find your pipe size .
For Copper and PEX Tube & Pipe
2.75 " ( 70 mm ) = 3/4 " pipe
3.53 " ( 90 mm ) = 1 " pipe
4.32 " ( 110 mm ) = 1 ¼ " pipe
5.10 " ( 130 mm ) = 1 ½ " pipe
For Steel Pipe or PVC Plastic Pipe
3.25 " ( 83 mm ) = 3/4 " pipe
4.00 " ( 102 mm ) = 1 " pipe
5.00 " ( 127 mm ) = 1 ¼ " pipe
6.00 " ( 152 mm ) = 1 ½ " pipe
For Flexible Polyethylene Pipe
2.96 -3.33 " ( 75 - 85 mm ) = 3/4 " pipe
3.74-4.24 " ( 95 -108 mm ) = 1 " pipe
4.90 - 5.57 " ( 124-141 mm ) = 1 ¼ " pipe
5.70 -6.28 " ( 145 -160 mm ) = 1 ½ " pipe
So what if you did n't find a pipe that was smaller than the others ?
In this case all of the pipe may be restricting the flow .
To fix it you may need to replace all of the pipe .
But I would suggest that you start with the pipe that would be easiest to replace .
After you replace it test for water hammer .
If it is gone , great !
If not , go to the next section of pipe .
Chances are you can't replace the gooseneck , since it does not belong to you .
Fortunately it is often a short length running just from the water main out in the street to your property line .
If it is very short like this the water hammer may well go away or be greatly reduced without replacing it .
There are two ways to fix the small pipe problem .
One way is to remove the small pipe and install a larger one in it 's place .
If you replace the existing pipe I suggest that the new pipe be two sizes larger than the old one , just to be safe .
Using a pipe two sizes larger will not harm anything and it will not reduce your water pressure .
See the discussion of pipe sizes at the bottom of this page .
The other way to reduce the velocity in the small pipe is to simply install a second pipe next to it and run the water through both pipes .
Using this second method results in half the water going through each pipe , so the velocity in both of them is much lower .
This is usually cheaper to do than replacing the pipe .
The second pipe should be equal in size or larger than the original pipe .
Tap the new pipe in as close as you can to the ends of the existing small pipe .
This will leave you with a short section of small pipe on either end , which will cause some flow restriction .
However it probably will not be enough to cause water hammer .
The restriction caused by this short section of small pipe would be similar to that found when the water passes through a standard valve , which also restricts the flow .
Now one last thing .
Since we are essentially guessing that the small pipe is the source of the problem , I can't promise you that replacing it will get rid of the water hammer .
Unfortunately there is not an easy way to test this method without actually installing the new or second pipe .
If the pipe you are thinking of replacing is buried , before going to a lot of work digging up pipes , try a test installation with the new pipe on top of the ground .
Then test for water hammer .
If that fixes the problem , then you can dig a trench and put the new pipe in the trench .
For reference , here are the common pipe sizes available in the USA : 1/2 " , 3/4 " , 1 " , 1 1/4 " , 1 1/2 " , 2 " .
Impact of changing to a Larger Pipe Size :
Did someone tell you that using a larger pipe will reduce your water pressure or make things " not work right " ?
One of my ( many ) pet peeves is that a lot of people in the industry will tell you that you need smaller pipes because " the smaller pipe squeezes the water and creates more pressure " .
No , no , no !
It does n't work that way !
Using a larger pipe size will not reduce the water pressure or hurt your irrigation system or your house water system .
There is a common misconception out there that if you use a bigger pipe the water pressure will be reduced and the sprinklers and your washing machine will stop working .
This is not true and I am on a personal campaign to kill this ugly myth !.
So please forgive me for ranting a little .
It is a lie !
An old sprinkler installer 's tale .
Anyone who tells you this does n't know what he or she is talking about .
Now every time I write this I get flamed by someone in the industry who does n't agree .
Instead of flaming me , I challenge you to simply prove me wrong !
Do a little research .
Look up the Bernoulli principle and you will see that it says that if flow is constant the water pressure decreases as the pipe gets smaller .
You can even try it yourself using a fun , online interactive toy built by physicist Mark Mitchell located here .
( Warning this page loads slow and requires JavaScript .
But it is worth the wait ! )
The bottom line is that you can't " squeeze " more pressure out by using a smaller pipe .
Let 's face facts , misunderstanding this is probably the problem that got the small pipe there in the first place .
So you already have problems because someone bought into that lie , do n't repeat the error !
It 's so important I 'm going to repeat it .
You can't hurt your system by using a larger pipe .
But if the new pipe is n't big enough , you will still have water hammer and that will hurt your system .
Remember , this is a very common myth .
I have even heard from readers who tell me that the tech support people at a major sprinkler manufacturer have been spouting this little untruth .
I sure hope that it was n't true .
If you talk to someone at a tech support line and they tell you this myth , please ask them nicely to check their facts .
They need to stop spreading these false theories or more people are going to wind up with water hammer problems .
Now with all that said , there is a rare reason for using a smaller pipe .
I would n't mention it but some other expert will call me on it if I do n't .
Sometimes the water is going through the pipe so slowly that silt and other stuff in the water settles out and slowly plugs the pipe .
The higher velocity in a smaller pipe keeps stuff from settling out .
But this is a very , very , very unusual situation .
If you are having water hammer problems there is almost zero chance of this being an issue for you .
Your problem is high velocity , not low velocity .
“ There could be 60,000 to 100,000 homes that are worthless and have to be ripped completely down and rebuilt , ” said Arnold Levin , a Philadelphia lawyer and co-chairman of the plaintiffs ’ steering committee .
While tainted Chinese imports like toothpaste , pet food and baby formula have been quickly removed from store shelves , drywall is installed throughout homes and does not lend itself to a quick fix .
This month , the Consumer Product Safety Commission , whose investigation into Chinese drywall is the largest in its history , will release the results of a study to determine why the drywall is causing the problem , and what kind of remediation programs might be effective .

Already , the commission has sent six investigators to Chinese gypsum mines and to meet with the government there .
The Chinese government ’s counterpart to the federal safety commission sent two of its experts here to inspect affected homes .
The commission is also making sure that no more Chinese drywall comes into the country .
“ Our ports are on alert , ” said Inez Tenenbaum , chairwoman of the commission .
“ They are not letting any in .
The market , too , has corrected .
No one wants Chinese drywall . ”
Even President Obama is being pressed by members of Congress to raise the issue on his November trip to China  the loudest cry coming from Senator Bill Nelson , Democrat of Florida , who has traveled to China on his own to learn more about the drywall problems .

I got a question about how to stay away from CRUD based service interfaces when the logic itself is like that , and I ’ve found that this shift in thinking really needs more examples , so I ’ve decided to put this out there :
For instance , in an HR system , the process of interviewing candidates – would n’t you just insert , update , and delete these Appointment objects ?
If I were to put on my domain - driven hat , I would describe those requirements differently – interview appointments have a lifecycle : proposed , accepted , cancelled , etc .
It seems that only a user of the role HR Interviewer should be able to make appointments for themselves , so the service layer code would probably look something like this :
using ( ISession session = SessionFactory .
OpenSession ( ) ) using ( ITransaction tx = session .
BeginTransaction ( ) ) { ICandidateInterviewer interviewer = session .
Get<ICandidateInterviewer >( message .InterviewerId ) ; ICandidate candidate = session .
Get < ICandidate >( message.CandidateId ) ; interviewer . ScheduleInterviewWith ( candidate ) .
At(message.RequestedTime ) ; tx.Commit( ) ; }
The “ ScheduleInterviewWith ” method accepts an ICandidate and returns an IAppointment .
IAppointment has a method “ At ” which accepts a DateTime parameter and returns void – just changes the data of the appointment .
The state of the appointment at creation time would probably be proposed .
The appointment object would probably be added to the list of appointments for that interviewer – that ’s what will cause it to be persisted automatically .
Later , when the candidate accepts the meeting , we could have the following method on ICandidate – void Accept ( IAppointment ) ; that would obviously check that the candidate is the right person for that interview , the appointment ’s current state ( not cancelled ) , etc – finally updating its state .
What part of this looks like create , update , delete ?
If that ’s what your service layer to domain interaction looks like , do you now know what your messages will be looking like ?
CRUD seems to be what most of us are familiar with .
Moving to domain - driven thinking takes time and practice , but is well worth it .
Contrast this with a more traditional O/R mapping solution :
using ( ISession session = SessionFactory .
OpenSession ( ) ) using ( ITransaction tx = session .
BeginTransaction ( ) ) { ICandidateInterviewer interviewer = session .
Get<ICandidateInterviewer >( message .InterviewerId ) ; ICandidate candidate = session .
Get < ICandidate >( message.CandidateId ) ; Appointment a = new Appointment ( ) ; a . Interviewer = interviewer ; interviewer .
Appointments .
Add(a ) ; a. Candidate = candidate ; candidate .
Appointments .
Add(a ) ; a. Time = message .
RequestedTime ; session .
Save (a ) ; tx.Commit( ) ; }
As you can see , we ’ve got simpler , more expressive , and more testable code when employing the domain model pattern , than using “ just ” O/R mapping .
I ’m not saying that the domain model pattern does n’t need O/R mapping in the background for it to work .
But that ’s just it – the persistence gunk needs to be in the background and the business logic needs to be encapsulated .
So , while I ’ll agree with Dave that the Domain Model is more lifestyle than pattern , I would argue against these conclusions :
If this post had a point , it ’s only to share the idea that Domain Model is a big , big thing .
It ’s probably overkill in a lot of cases where you have simple applications that have very simple purposes .
As you just saw in the example above , there is no “ overkill ” to be seen .
The domain model in the example was n’t “ a big , big thing ” .
The domain model .
Use it .
Why not have a better lifestyle ?
Is the U.S. Preparing to Bomb Iran ?
A weapons order buried in a Pentagon funding request may provide a clue .
Oct. 6 , 2009  --
Is the U.S. stepping up preparations for a possible attack on Iran 's nuclear facilities ?
The Pentagon is always making plans , but based on a little - noticed funding request recently sent to Congress , the answer to that question appears to be yes .
First , some background : Back in October 2007 , ABC News reported that the Pentagon had asked Congress for $ 88 million in the emergency Iraq / Afghanistan war funding request to develop a gargantuan bunker - busting bomb called the Massive Ordnance Penetrator ( MOP ) .
It 's a 30,000 - pound bomb designed to hit targets buried 200 feet below ground .
Back then , the Pentagon cited an " urgent operational need " for the new weapon .
Now the Pentagon is shifting spending from other programs to fast forward the development and procurement of the Massive Ordnance Penetrator .
The Pentagon comptroller sent a request to shift the funds to the House and Senate Appropriations and Armed Services Committees over the summer .
Click here to see a copy of the Pentagon 's request , provided to ABC News .
The comptroller said the Pentagon planned to spend $ 19.1 million to procure four of the bombs , $ 28.3 million to accelerate the bomb 's " development and testing " , and $ 21 million to accelerate the integration of the bomb onto B - 2 stealth bombers .
' Urgent Operational Need '
The notification was tucked inside a 93 - page " reprogramming " request that included a couple hundred other more mundane items .
Why now ?
The notification says simply , " The Department has an Urgent Operational Need ( UON ) for the capability to strike hard and deeply buried targets in high threat environments .
The MOP is the weapon of choice to meet the requirements of the UON . "
It further states that the request is endorsed by Pacific Command ( which has responsibility over North Korea ) and Central Command ( which has responsibility over Iran ) .
Is the U.S. Preparing to Bomb Iran ?
The request was quietly approved .
On Friday , McDonnell Douglas was awarded a $ 51.9 million contract to provide " Massive Penetrator Ordnance Integration " on B - 2 aircraft .
This is not the kind of weapon that would be particularly useful in Iraq or Afghanistan , but it is ideally suited to hit deeply buried nuclear facilities such as Natanz or Qom in Iran .
DeSmuME is the best Nintendo DS Emulator for Mac OS X that I have found , it ’s pretty full featured with save states , touchscreen emulation , movie creation , and more .
My only complaint is the layout of the emulator being vertical , which is true to the DS , but it makes playing games sort of obnoxious particularly when you increase the screen size .
If they enabled side - by - side screens for this DS emulator so I could play it fullscreen , I ’d be even more enthralled with an already good app .
If you ’re looking for a Nintendo DS Emulator for your Mac , look no further .

Why we moved away from “ the cloud ” to a “ real ” server
By David Mytton ,
CEO & Founder of Server Density .
Published on the 8th September , 2009 .
Up until the end of August , our server monitoring service , Server Density , was hosted in “ the cloud ” .
We had no physical hardware and were using virtualised instances provided by Slicehost and The Rackspace Cloud .
This allowed us to start very small and cheap and expand as the service grew – we were paying for what we used , something which is ideal for the first stages of a startup .
Everything worked very well and we had few problems .
Progression
Back in Feb 2009 we started out with a 256MB Slicehost instance for only $ 20 per month .
By the end of August we had a 2GB Slicehost instance and an 8 GB Rackspace Cloud instance , costing $ 130 and $ 345 respectively .
We also had a 256MB Rackspace Cloud instance for a VPN we used to access the servers through at $ 10 per month .
The total expenditure was therefore $ 485 per month .
The Rackspace Cloud options only became available after we had been using Slicehost for several months and given they were half the price , we decided to expand our database server using them rather than Slicehost .
The reason for the price difference is Slicehost include a data transfer allowance whereas you pay per GB with The Rackspace Cloud ; since most of our transfer is incoming , that allowed us to save substantially .
Slicehost is also owned by Rackspace and they run in the same data centre which meant we were able to use the internal network to communicate between our Slicehost and Rackspace Cloud instances .
There was no disruption to the service as we kept our application serving with Slicehost and the database with The Rackspace Cloud .
The disk space problem
The problem we were facing was disk space .
Since we store a lot of historical monitoring data , we needed a large amount of storage .
The only way we could increase our available storage was to increase the instance size .
This was not scalable and so we set about looking at the alternatives .
From a technical interest point of view , as well as scalability , we wanted to move to Amazon EC2 .
It would have been very cool to deploy on top of a virtualised environment that we could load balance , implement a failover system and make use of the Elastic Block Storage for our data storage needs .
Although we needed little instance storage , our database needs to run 64bit and so we would have had to go with the large EC2 instance .
Our pricing calculations looked like this :
Large EC2 Instance : $ 292
Transfer In : $ 15 ( 150GB )
Transfer Out : $ 4 ( 20 GB )
Elastic Block Storage : $ 90 ( 360 GB inc backup )
Elastic Block Storage Requests : $ 30 ( 300 million , based on tests )
The total cost of which is $ 431 , but we also wanted their support services which are priced at $ 100 , so a total of $ 531 USD per month .
The Elastic Block Storage requests per second is a big variable that is hard to predict .
We ran our database on an instance for 24 hours and estimated that we would be using at least 10 million i/o requests per day .
Hardware is cheap
There are also technical complexities in that you have to provision EBS storage before you use it , and if you need to resize then you have to take a snapshot and rebuild from that .
We would have had to build our own infrastructure management system .
This would have to handle the starting and failover of EC2 instances , backups and provisioning additional storage .
In order to have no downtime when storage was being re-provisioned , we would need a second instance to replicate the database on .
Aside from the extra server costs , all of this would have taken development time away from our efforts of improving the product itself .
We had the choice of working on infrastructure that makes no difference to the customer experience ( but which would have been technically interesting and fun to develop ) verses tangible progress with our product :
With six years of experience running my own software company I can tell you that nothing we have ever done at Fog Creek has increased our revenue more than releasing a new version with more features .
Nothing .
The flow to our bottom line from new versions with new features is absolutely undeniable .
– Joel Spolsky
And that ’s the hidden cost – development time – something that is particularly important for a startup .
As Jeff Atwood says , “ Hardware is Cheap , Programmers are Expensive “ .
Given the situation , the move we made was to get a physical server with Rackspace .
Although there was a cost increase compared to the existing solution , it was not much more expensive than the move to Amazon EC2 would have been , and there were no development costs .
Since Slicehost and The Rackspace Cloud are in the same data centre as our current servers , the move was very easy .
Uptime and security
As a server monitoring product , the service needs to be available .
There is no such thing as 100 % uptime but Rackspace is known for its reliable network and systems .
Their support was another factor in the decision making process .
Rackspace know how our systems are set up and , like us , continuously monitor them so that if there is an issue , we can work together to fix the problem as quickly as possible .
Their support is indeed “ Fanatical ” – they even swapped out a lower Cisco firewall model for a newer one for free so we could access our servers through a secure VPN on our iPhones .
You can also get an amazing deal by negotiating with the sales team .
Cloud pricing is fixed but moving to Rackspace got us amazing value for money for the hardware we have .
And now we have an existing relationship , future upgrades can be negotiated .
Further , since we process customer card transactions through our servers ( we collect details on our site but do not store them ourselves ) , we have to be PCI compliant , something that Amazon EC2 is not .
Not entirely clear skies
That said , we are making use of some “ cloud ” services .
Our server has large internal storage but we also make use of the Rackspace Utility Network Attached Storage product .
This allows us to scale disk space indefinitely and pay per GB we use .
Unlike Amazon EBS , it really is per GB , not per provisioned storage .
This has saved a lot of development time working out how to deploy our database across multiple disks or handle resizing existing volumes .
Frequent review
We are likely going to be a Rackspace customer for life .
Their support is amazing and we know we can rely on them to deliver the service we would expect as customers .
However as we grow we will frequently review the situation to see if savings can be made without sacrificing unnecessary development time and quality of service .
Even if not for the primary hosting infrastructure , for other aspects of our systems – for example , we are currently looking into how we can use The Rackspace Cloud to run off - site database replication for further redundancy in addition to our current backups .
“ The cloud ” has its uses , especially when starting up , but it is not always the best option .
, the pistol - carrying Lebanon mom who received national attention
, was talking to a friend via a Web camera when her husband , Scott , shot her to death before killing himself , Lebanon police said today .
Meleanie Hain , 31 , and her husband , Scott , 33 , were pronounced dead by Lebanon County Coroner Dr. Jeffrey Yocum shortly after 8:30 p.m. Wednesday at their home at Second Avenue and East Grant Street , Lebanon , police said .
At a press conference today , Lebanon police said Meleanie Hain was in the kitchen on the first floor of the home and communicating with a friend of hers and Scott 's when Scott Hain fired six shots from a 9 mm handgun registered to him .
Scott Hain then went to the second floor of the home and shot and killed himself with a shotgun , police said .
Police said the friend had turned away from the computer during the conversation but turned back to the screen when he heard a shot and a scream .
The friend did not see Meleanie Hain shot , but did see Scott Hain fire a gun where Meleanie had been sitting and called 911 , police said .
Police did not identify the friend or further categorize his relationship to Meleanie Hain .
Police have served a search warrant and seized the friend 's computer .
Police took several handguns , a shot gun , two rifles and several hundred rounds of ammunition from the Hains ' home .
Meleanie Hain 's handgun was found fully loaded and in a backpack near the front door of the home , police said .
The couple 's three children were home at the time of the shooting but were not hurt .
Police did not say whether any of them witnessed the shootings .
Meleanie Hain ’s mother , Jenny Stanley , told WGAL - TV that the children , ages 2 , 6 and 10 , were “ hanging in there . ”
“ I ’m devastated , ” Stanley said .
“ I lost my daughter .
I lost my best friend .
The children lost their parents . ”
Recently by Ron Paul : Saving Face in Afghanistan
The other day when Lindsey Graham went after me , and accused me of trying to take over the Republican party , I could n’t help but chuckle .
Partisan politics is one thing , and about the only thing politicians understand .
But ideas are something else .
And our ideas — the ideas of liberty — are capturing the hearts and minds of millions of Americans , and that is what counts .
Ever since our presidential campaign ignited a prairie fire of freedom , especially among young people , I see our progress everywhere .
The bureaucrats are right , for example , to be worried at the Federal Reserve .
After putting us into this economic pickle , the Fed is under attack for the first time in all its years .
The Fed has devalued our dollar by 95 % since it was founded by the big banksters and one senator in 1913 , but it took the recent boom - bust engineered by the Fed , and then our presidential campaign , to rattle the china at their marble palace on Constitution (!)
Avenue .
End the Fed Ron Paul Best Price : $ 1.12 Buy New $ 8.53 ( as of 10:10 EST - Details )
To build on the momentum you and I started , I wrote a book that can change our country , End the Fed .
We must audit the Fed , expose its secret doings , and then end it .
We deserve sound money , not the fiat paper that can be manipulated for Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan , and against the rest of us .
The book has done well — four weeks on the NY Times bestseller list , for example — but while it started out at # 7 , and # 1 on Amazon , it has dropped .
This book can change America , and undermine all the statists in DC , by explaining , in easy to understand terms , the history of the Fed and all the trouble it has caused , and why we can and must replace it with the Constitution .
Please buy a copy , and recommend it to your friends .
It also makes a great gift for students and everyone who cares about freedom and prosperity .
Those are our birthright .
We must not let the Fed and all its gang take them away .
Please help me in anyway you can , and thank you !

The Best of Ron Paul
Given all the finger pointing at the US over monetary printing and the debasement of the US dollar , inquiring minds just might be asking " What is China doing ? "
That 's a good question , so let 's look at monetary numbers translated from Chinese .
Chinese Money Supply in 100 Million Yuan

Link For Chinese Money Supply
Balance Sheet Of Depository Corporations - Assets
Balance Sheet Of Depository Corporations - Liabilities
Link For Chinese Balance Sheet of Other Depository Corporations
The Chinese central banks ' printing and respective Chinese bank lending make us look like amateurs .
Chinese central bank assets and the money supply are up 25 - 26 % annualized YTD .
But this growth rate of money supply and bank lending is what is required to make up for the 8 - 10 % net contraction in output from the collapse in exports and export - related production .
Meanwhile , back in the US , total bank credit is contracting while M2 is up 5 % annualized YTD .
Total Bank Credit - Annualized Rate of Change
M2 - Annualized Rate of Change
M2 is actually down since May - August due to the decline in the rate of growth of bank lending over the summer .
If the May - June rate of deceleration were to persist , M2 could conceivably start start contracting by year end or early ' 10 .
How Will China Handle The Yuan ?
To understand what is happening , please consider How Will China Handle The Yuan ?
In spite of record worldwide stimulus , a global recession is everywhere you look except perhaps in China .
The reason is simple .
When the Chinese government " suggests " banks should lend , banks lend .
This is how command economies " work " , using the word " work " loosely .
Yes , the US has massive problems , but let 's have an honest assessment of problems elsewhere .
Bottom line , China is busy ramping up production for consumers that do n't exist :
Not here , not in the EU , and not in China ( not yet ) .
This love affair with China , a country that will not float its currency or offer freedom of speech , and hides bank solvency issues even more so than the US , is way overdone .
Remind me to reconsider decoupling when China allows freedom of speech and floats the RMB instead of pegging it .
Do n't Mistake Printing For A Sustainable Recovery

( CNN ) -- For Elke Kennedy , the significance of Wednesday 's hate crimes legislation can be traced to a single punch outside a bar on a drunken night two years ago .
" My son was murdered as he was leaving a bar in Greenville , South Carolina , " the 48 - year - old woman told CNN about her son , Sean , who was 20 when he came face - to - face with what she calls a hate crime .
" He walked outside the bar and there was three people sitting in a car outside and they called him over to ask him for a cigarette . "
It was 3:45 a.m. on May 16 , 2007 , and her underage son was legally drunk , but not so much that he could n't give them the cigarette .
He did so , then turned to walk away .
He did not get far , she said .
" As he was walking away , the guy in the back seat got out and walked over to Sean and called him a faggot and punched him in the face . "
The men got back into their car and drove off , leaving Sean on the ground , his brain separated from his brain stem , she said .
Fifteen minutes later , the 18 - year - old assailant called one of the women whom Sean had been with in the bar and left a message on her cell phone .
" You tell your faggot friend when he wakes up he owes me 500 dollars for my broken hand , " the message said .
Sean was taken to Greenville Memorial Hospital , where he was pronounced brain dead 17 hours later .
More than 700 people showed up at his memorial service at Crossroads Community Church in nearby Simpsonville .
Two days later , Stephen Andrew Moller , then 18 , was charged with murder .
He bargained it down to involuntary manslaughter and served 199 days in the county lockup followed by 12 months in prison , Kennedy said .
Moller was released on probation last July , she said .
An attempt to reach the Moller family Tuesday was not successful .
Had hate crimes been a federal offense in 2007 , the FBI would have been able to investigate the attack , and Sean Kennedy 's killer might still be in prison , his mother said .
For the past 27 months , Kennedy has logged 76,000 miles speaking at colleges and clubs across the country trying to raise awareness and gather support for the legislation .
Last week , the Senate did what she was seeking when it passed legislation by 68 - 29 that would make it a federal crime to assault an individual because of his or her sexual orientation or gender identity .
Obama is to sign the measure , which was added to a $ 680 billion defense authorization bill , on Wednesday .
Kennedy and her husband were driving Tuesday night from their home in Greenville to the nation 's capital , where they were planning to witness the ceremony .
" We are going there representing so many people , " she said .
" People who have been murdered and are dealing with the harassment and bullying and violence on a daily basis . "
But Kennedy said her work does not end with the president 's signature .
" This is a huge milestone , but it is not the end of the fight , " she said .
" We have to change the hearts and minds . "
Toward that end , she has spoken at 34 colleges and universities " to educate these kids about what hate and violence and bullying can do and give them options and teach them non-violent conflict resolution . "
But she expressed frustration that elementary schools have not allowed her to address their students , to send them the message that ends each of her talks : " No mother should ever have to bury her child , no mother should ever have to lose her child to hate or violence and no mother should ever have to fight for justice for her child . "
The measure is named for Matthew Shepard , a gay Wyoming teenager who died after being kidnapped and severely beaten in October 1998 , and James Byrd Jr. , an African - American man dragged to his death in Texas the same year .
Several religious groups have expressed concern that a hate - crimes law could be used to criminalize conservative speech relating to subjects such as abortion or homosexuality .
But Attorney General Eric
Holder has said that any federal hate - crimes law would be used only to prosecute violent acts based on bias , as opposed to the prosecution of speech based on controversial racial or religious beliefs .
Former President George W. Bush had threatened to veto a similar measure .
Opponents of the expanded hate crimes bill challenged the need to specify one particular community in federal legislation .
They contended that existing federal hate - crimes laws were sufficient to protect the rights of people based on sexual orientation and gender identity .
More than 77,000 hate crime incidents were reported by the FBI between 1998 and 2007 , or " nearly one hate crime for every hour of every day over the span of a decade , " Holder told the Senate Judiciary Committee in June .

A US student killed a burglar with a samurai sword , slicing off his left hand and severely cutting his neck after he spotted the intruder in his garage , police said .
The undergraduate medical student at Baltimore 's prestigious Johns Hopkins University was being questioned by police but he may not be charged if found to be acting in self - defence .
Samurai swords are legal in the United States .
Police received a call for help at 1:20 am ( local time ) after the burglar pried open a side door into the garage of the house , which four students rented off the campus , Baltimore police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said .
" They asked him to stop and while they called police , the suspect lunged at the student .
He then retaliated by striking him with a samurai sword , severed his left hand and gave severe lacerations to the upper torso , " he said .
The burglar , who was in his late 40s , had a history of burglaries and had just been released from prison on Saturday , he said .
The student , whose name was not released as he was not charged , had recently reported a burglary in which thieves reportedly took laptop computers and a Sony PlayStation video game machine .
The United States , where the right to bear arms is constitutionally protected , has few restrictions on owning swords , although some local jurisdictions limit the right to brandish them in public .
" I think everyone has the right to first of all defend themselves and defend their home and if this individual felt that a samurai sword was an appropriate tool to do so , I 'm not in a position to say that 's good or bad , " Mr Guglielmi said .
The samurai , Japan 's medieval knights , carried swords as they enforced a code of moral order .
Modern Japan , however , requires strict registration of all sizeable swords .
England and Wales last year banned the sale of samurai swords except to collectors , after a spate of crimes .
Tuesday 's incident was the latest violence involving a top US university .
Police on Monday found the body of a 24 - year - old Yale University student stuffed in a laboratory wall .

This shameless argument assumes  perhaps correctly  that no one in this country remembers anything .
So let me provide a reminder :
We already did make that mistake again when we walked away from Afghanistan to invade Iraq in 2003  and we did so at the Three Amigos ’ urging .
Then , too , they promoted their strategy as a way of preventing another 9/11  even though no one culpable for 9/11 was in Iraq .
Now we ’re being asked to pay for their mistake by squandering stretched American resources in yet another country where Al Qaeda has largely vanished .
To make the case , the Amigos and their fellow travelers conflate the Taliban with Al Qaeda much as they long conflated Saddam ’s regime with Al Qaeda .
But as Rajiv Chandrasekaran of The Washington Post reported on Thursday , American intelligence officials now say that “ there are few , if any , links between Taliban commanders in Afghanistan today and senior Al Qaeda members ”  a far cry from the tight Taliban - bin Laden alliance of 2001 .
The rhetorical sleights of hand in the hawks ’ arguments do n’t end there .
If you listen carefully to McCain and his neocon echo chamber , you ’ll notice certain tics .
President Obama better make his decision by tomorrow , or Armageddon ( if not mushroom clouds ) will arrive .
We must “ win ” in Afghanistan  but victory is left vaguely defined .
That ’s because we will never build a functioning state in a country where there has never been one .
Nor can we score a victory against the world ’s dispersed , stateless terrorists by getting bogged down in a hellish landscape that contains few of them .

Most tellingly , perhaps , those clamoring for an escalation in Afghanistan avoid mentioning the name of the country ’s president , Hamid Karzai , or the fraud - filled August election that conclusively delegitimized his government .
To do so would require explaining why America should place its troops in alliance with a corrupt partner knee - deep in the narcotics trade .
As long as Karzai and the election are airbrushed out of history , it can be disingenuously argued that nothing has changed on the ground since Obama ’s inauguration and that he has no right to revise his earlier judgment that Afghanistan is a “ war of necessity . ”
Those demanding more combat troops for Afghanistan also avoid defining the real costs .
The Congressional Research Service estimates that the war was running $ 2.6 billion a month in Pentagon expenses alone even before Obama added 20,000 troops this year .
Surely fiscal conservatives like McCain and Graham who rant about deficits being “ generational theft ” have an obligation to explain what the added bill will be on an Afghanistan escalation and where the additional money will come from .
But that would require them to use the dread words “ sacrifice ” and “ higher taxes ” when they want us to believe that this war , like Iraq , would be cost - free .
The real troop numbers are similarly elusive .
Pre-emptively railing against the prospect of “ half measures ” by Obama , Lieberman asked MSNBC ’s Andrea Mitchell rhetorically last week whether it would be “ real counterinsurgency ” or “ counterinsurgency light . ”
But the measure Lieberman endorses  Gen. Stanley McChrystal ’s reported recommendation of 40,000 additional troops  is itself counterinsurgency light .
In his definitive recent field manual on the subject , Gen. David Petraeus stipulates that real counterinsurgency requires 20 to 25 troops for each thousand residents .
That comes out , conservatively , to 640,000 troops for Afghanistan ( population , 32 million ) .
Some 535,000 American troops could n’t achieve a successful counterinsurgency in South Vietnam , which had half Afghanistan ’s population and just over a quarter of its land area .
OVIEDO , España .-
Por acá , a México se le empieza a ver con cierta inquietud .
Lo público es que la inseguridad y el narcotráfico nos tienen materialmente contra las cuerdas .
En lo privado , periodistas y círculos universitarios nos ven disminuidos .
Hace no muchos años éramos uno de los centros de América Latina , se nos pedía opinión y además se ejercía una influencia real , y para muchos ya no es así .
Brasil , para ir a lo inmediato , nos ha rebasado por la izquierda , el centro y la derecha .
El caso hondure ño se ha convertido en un asunto emblemático .
La desafortunada declaración del presidente depuesto de Honduras sobre López Obrador , en lugar de saberse leer se tomó como una afrenta que provocó que el Gobierno se hiciera a un lado de un conflicto que tenemos a la vuelta de la esquina .
El Gobierno de Calderón se dejó ir por impulsos en lugar de hacer a un lado la imprudente declaración .
Lo que está de por medio son la democracia y las instituciones de nuestros vecinos geográficos y de origen .
Hemos pasado de la imprudencia foxista a la pasividad calderonista .
Para España , México es un referente que se empieza a diluir .
El reconocimiento a la UNAM le cambia un poco la mirada a muchos universitarios y periodistas .
La presencia del rector en la Universidad de Oviedo , de Salamanca y Zaragoza ha provocado repercusiones favorables , las cuales empiezan a expandirse .
Han servido para ver otras caras de México , y no sólo las que nos agobian .
El reconocimiento a la UNAM tiene que ser valorado en el Gobierno , en el Legislativo , y particularmente en el ámbito de la educación .
La UNAM es una especie de centro rector que vale y crece en la medida en que se fortalece internamente y se expande .
Es “ la ” universidad del país , a pesar de los que la ven con desdén .
Es evidente que está llena de problemas , algunos de ellos provocados por los que a lo largo de su historia la han usado , y hoy por burócratas que le escatiman presupuesto , pero en las buenas y en las malas ha sido una especie de faro del país .
Su actividad política ha sido siempre polémica y clave en muchos movimientos sociales , sin soslayar los momentos adversos que ha vivido .
Ha pasado por radicalismos , los cuales al fin y al cabo se han dado en medio de la libertad bajo la cual vive sin restricción , hasta por provocadores y porros que se trepan en la Universidad para delinquir más que para manifestarse .
El Premio Príncipe de Asturias en “ Comunicación y Humanidades ” es una muy buena noticia en un país en donde los legisladores optan por cobrar más impuestos a ciudadanos , a los que les siguen pasando la cuenta de boquetes económicos y fiscales que no han provocado .
El reconocimiento a la UNAM debe ser visto como parte de lo mucho que tenemos y que debemos saber fortalecer y apreciar .
No podemos seguir en el todos contra todos .
El galardón abre puertas , entremos .
¡ OUUUCHCHCHCH !

Slava is thinking about adding a global interpreter lock to Factor , much like the Python GIL , as a step on the path to a full multithreaded VM .
This would allow factor code to run while blocking FFI calls ( e.g. C library calls ) execute .
As part of this each FFI call would need to release the lock before calling into C code and obtain it again afterwards before returning to Factor .
One of the problems with adding a GIL is that it penalizes the common single - threaded case .
This got me thinking about how a mutex lock could be implemented that optimized performance for the low contention case so as to minimize the performance impact to single threaded apps .
Here 's the best approach I 've come up with so far :
You need :
a spinlock ( implemented inline via cpu primitives ) a boolean to represent the GIL an int to represent contention on the GIL an OS semaphore ( win32 semaphore or pthread condition )
The goal is to arrive at a situation where if there is no contention then FFI calls just use inline assembler primitives to acquire / release the spinlock and flip the GIL , otherwise they fall back on the additional overhead of library calls to an OS semaphore .
Acquiring the Lock
The idea is that if there 's no contention then acquiring the lock is just a case of obtaining the spinlock and flipping the GIL boolean .
( code is half - baked pseudocode , sorry ! )
- acquire spinlock - if GIL == false - GIL=true // acquire GIL - release spinlock DONE !
- else : - increment contention - counter - release spinlock - goto LOOP LOOP : // contention counter has been incremented by this thread - acquire spinlock - if GIL == false - GIL=true // acquire GIL - decrement contention - counter - release spinlock DONE !
- else - release spinlock - wait on semaphore - goto LOOP
Releasing the lock
- acquire spinlock - release GIL - read contention counter - release spinlock - if contention counter is non-zero : notify semaphore
This is just an idea at this stage .
There was no working wifi on my train home today so have n't done any decent research on this , and I have n't done any empirical testing yet .
Also I 'm not a multithreading expert so if there 's a glaring error in the idea or in the implementation then I 'd be very pleased if somebody could point it out - thanks !
Business economists are split on whether the Federal Reserve 's massive infusion of credit into the economy will lead to inflation in the next couple of years .
Half of 266 members of the National Association for Business Economics surveyed in August said the Fed 's decisions to increase the money supply wo n't lead to inflation in the next few years , the NABE said Monday .
Some 41 % disagreed , though , citing " lagged effects of policies now in effect , " " monetization of the debt " and " ineffective exit strategy " as their primary concerns .

RALEIGH , North Carolina ( Reuters ) -
If it ’s raining outside or hurricane season is in full swing , it wo n’t just be real - life sports games affected but also sports video games with real - time weather starting to impact virtual players .
The New England Patriots play the New York Jets in a screengrab from " Madden NFL 10 " .

With game publishers just about perfecting ground visuals in games , the next step to boost realism is to replicate the actual weather , be it at a football stadium or on a golf course , which impacts how virtual players perform and how the game looks .
EA Sports has partnered with The Weather Channel to introduce real - time weather into its “ Madden NFL 10 ” football videogame so if a hurricane hits the United States , gamers will also find certain stadiums more challenging to play .
“ Tropical systems typically bring with them strong winds and heavy rain , so hurricanes on a path closer to a stadium would certainly affect gameplay , creating a wet field , wind gusts and more , ” said Tom Moore , lead meteorologist at The Weather Channel .
Broadband - connected consoles like Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 allow the new “ Madden ” game to get constant weather updates .
“ Our teams at The Weather Channel provide a data feed that allows EA to pull real - time weather for any location chosen as a venue within the game , ” said Derek Van Nostran , director of marketing for The Weather Channel Interactive .
“ We also provided historical data for the past three years so that the EA producers would be able to match realistic weather conditions at every venue for games played at any time of year . ”
From a gaming perspective , players will see their virtual NFL stars drop more passes , fumble more balls and slip and slide in the gale force winds and rain associated with a hurricane or tropical storm .
“ We basically have the traditional weather conditions covered , ” said Phil Frazier , senior producer of “ Madden NFL 10 ” at EA Tiburon .
“ We even support extreme heat and cold , where extreme heat has a huge impact on how quickly players fatigue as you play the game . ”
Frazier said weather conditions have a visual affect on the game as well .
Rain and snow games have a much different feel because of lighting tweaks and added fog effects while snow games feel cooler because of an added blue tint to the lighting .
Subtle lighting adjustments in rainy games make the game feel more dirty and the players ’ uniforms will get muddy if they ’re playing on grass fields .
College football fans will also experience real - time weather in EA Sports ’ “ NCAA Football 10 , ” which includes snow and rain .
The game ’s designer , Ben Haumiller , said bad weather will cause wide receivers to slip while running their routes and winds can impact everything from long kicks to field goals .
While football is a sport known for being played in any type of weather , the PGA TOUR stops play during rain but EA Sports ’ “ Tiger Woods PGA TOUR 10 ” allows gamers to play through virtual rain and wind storms that not even the pros would tackle .
“ At one point during development there was some really extreme tropical weather hitting northern Florida , ” said Mike Cayado , supervising producer for “ Tiger Woods PGA TOUR 10 ” at EA Tiburon .
“ When we entered the game onto the TPC Sawgrass course , we were playing in 30 - 40 mph winds .
That has never been experienced before inside our game . ”
Outside of the visual impact of the game ’s authentic courses , when the grass gets wet the ball sticks and does n’t roll as much .
“ As a player you have to be making constant adjustments to these changing conditions and it really adds a lot of depth to the gameplay , ” said Cayado .
The latest celebrity to take up the challenge of making themselves the ( much , much needed ) twelfth man of the England squad for this world cup is both the most surprising and probably the best equipped .
If anyone is going to bring back the reputation that England once enjoyed as being a casual sporting nation whose gentlemen believe that nothing beats a good ole friendly game of kick about in the sun , drinking tea and having jumpers for goal post chaps .
That were not all beer swilling goons that cause riots as well as fighting each other and love nothing more than a fart joke , then lets face it .
Its the Mayall .
England ’s powerhouse of comedy is rumoured to be bringing two typically English words together , footballs and Thespians .
Rik ’s song “ Nobel England ” is said to be a genuinely serious song ( we ’ll believe it when we see / hear it ) without any of your usual vindaloo style terrace ranting rubbish .
“ Football chants are one of the great traditions of following football ” says Mayall “ … and Shakespeare is also part of our national heritage .
It seemed only natural that they should go together . ”
Rik and his people have not yet blessed us with its intended release date yet but we do know that it will go directly head - to - head with the FA ’s official song which is yet to be released .
Closer to the tournament more will be available in the way of downloads or videos for the song .
Meanwhile , Check out Rik ’s site with a chance to back him , along with the extra added fun of winning dinner with Rik !
Yummy !
In the meantime , enjoy some of his funniness through song anyway !
Tremayne Durham still wants his money back .
Three years ago Durham killed one man and held another hostage in an unsuccessful attempt to get back $ 18,000 he thought he was due .
He is now serving a life sentence in the Oregon State Penitentiary , but he has n't given up trying to collect .
Today , he 's using the courts instead of a .357 magnum -- and so far , he 's having more success .
Durham has filed suit in Multnomah County Circuit Court against Rob Chambers , whom he paid nearly $ 18,000 to build a soft - serve ice - cream truck in December 2005 .
Durham changed his mind a few months later and when he could n't get a refund , killed one of Chambers ' former employees .
Later he showed up at Chambers ' house and jabbed a gun in his stomach and held him hostage for two hours .
Durham was sent to prison last year .
He filed his neatly handwritten suit in February , seeking money for the truck and an extra $ 20,000 to cover , among other things , the cost of traveling from his home state of New York to Oregon in his personal collection attempt .
In Multnomah County , civil suits under $ 50,000 are automatically sent to an arbitrator to resolve .
The arbitrator assigned to this case issued a draft ruling earlier this month in Durham 's favor because Chambers failed to respond to repeated letters requesting he participate in hearings .
Now , Chambers says he feels victimized all over again .
Chambers , who does n't have the money to hire an attorney , says he never got the letters and thought the case had been dismissed .
" He 's terrorizing me , " said Chambers , 39 . " ... That 's the good ol ' American way : He can sue me .
I 'm just amazed that they would even see this case . "
Arbitrator John G. Crawford told Chambers in a letter that he " will have an uphill battle in arbitration " because he admitted in writing that Durham paid him .
A hearing is scheduled for Wednesday , to give Chambers one last chance to argue his case .
Chambers , who says he suffers from post traumatic stress disorder , says he does n't have the money to pay Durham .
Since he was held hostage , his fledgling business has failed .
He said he 's been fired from jobs because of he tends to blow up at others under stress .
He 's sold almost everything of value that he owns , including the truck he was building for Durham .
What 's more , he does n't think he should have to pay the man who held him hostage and killed his former employee , Adam Calbreath , 39 .
Chambers suspects that Durham killed Calbreath because Calbreath would n't tell the killer where to find him .
" How do I live with that guilt ? "
Chambers said , tears filling his eyes .
He says he jumps whenever he hears a doorbell , because it reminds him of the afternoon Durham showed up on his front porch , brandishing the same gun he used to kill Calbreath .
Durham also brought along duct tape , handcuffs , gloves and a cloth bag big enough to cover someone 's head .
" He 's like , ' I 've been robbing people and killing people to get to you .
I just want my money ! ' "
Chambers said .
Prosecutors would later praise Chambers for keeping calm and talking Durham into letting him leave the house .
Chambers assured Durham that he was n't trying to cheat him and showed him the ice cream truck , still under construction in his garage .
Chambers told Durham he was wrong not to have returned his money and promised to do so .
Then he heated up a plate of ribs , and sat Durham down to watch a movie .
Chambers gave Durham a long story about how he had to find parts to finish another customer 's truck , in order to get paid and have money to pay him .
Durham agreed .
Instead , Chambers immediately summoned police , who surrounded the home and took Durham into custody .
In response to Durham 's $ 48,000 suit , Chambers has filed a handwritten counterclaim seeking $ 48,000 for battery , false imprisonment and the trauma he 's suffered since Durham held him hostage .
The arbitrator denied Chambers ' counterclaim in his draft ruling .
Durham 's pursuit of cash from prison raised eyebrows in Multnomah County Circuit Court .
But that 's nothing new .
Last year , Durham agreed to plead guilty to aggravated murder and save the state from an expensive death - penalty trial if the judge agreed to let him feast on his favorite foods .
The judge agreed , and Durham sat down to a smorgasbord of KFC chicken , Popeyes fried chicken , mashed potatoes , coleslaw , carrot cake and Haagen - Dazs ice cream .
Two weeks later , at his sentencing , he dined on calzones , pizza and lasagna .
The unusual deal made international headlines .
If the arbitrator rules in favor of Durham , Chambers can appeal and ask for a trial .
Josh Lamborn , a former deputy district attorney who prosecuted Durham , thinks the convicted killer would be the one with the uphill battle before a jury .
" I do n't think a jury is going to be very sympathetic , " said Lamborn , who now works in private practice .
Although he was vaguely aware of why Durham was in prison , Crawford , the arbitrator , said he based his draft order on the court file before him : Durham claimed he never got a ice - cream truck or his money back .
Chambers admitted in writing that Durham paid for the truck .
" All I had in front of me were those papers , " Crawford said .
Chambers did not say that the truck was under construction and he intended to give it to Durham .
And Durham did not mention that he was in jail on murder and kidnapping charges and could not take possession of the truck .
Crawford sent Chambers two certified letters notifying him that he must submit a statement and attend an arbitration hearing , but Chambers did n't respond .
Chambers , who was working temporarily as a long - haul trucker , said he was n't home to receive the letters and did n't go to the post office to pick them up .
Chambers said he thought the case was over when he received a letter notifying him that a judge had dismissed his now - defunct company from the suit in June .
Chambers said he did n't realize that he was still listed as a plaintiff .
Then earlier this month he discovered he was wrong when he found the draft order in Durham 's favor taped to his door .
He 's upset about having to take part in arbitration Wednesday and listen to the man who once held him at gunpoint .
Durham will attend the hearing by telephone from prison .
" I just start crying for no reason , " Chambers said .
It 's ironic that Durham is suing him now , said Chambers , reflecting on how differently things might have turned out if Durham had gone to court instead of coming to Oregon with a gun .
" Adam would still be alive , " Chambers said .
" He would n't be in prison .
I would n't be tormented . "
Thousands of hemophiliacs filed a class - action lawsuit Monday against Bayer Corp. and several other companies , claiming they knowingly sold blood contaminated with HIV and hepatitis C .
The lawsuit , filed in federal court , alleges the companies conspired to sell blood - clotting products that were manufactured using blood from sick , high - risk donors .
It also alleges the companies continued distributing them abroad in 1984 and 1985 , after they stopped selling them in the United States because of the known risk of HIV and hepatitis transmission .
Monday 's suit was filed on behalf foreigners who received the drug , said attorney Robert Nelson .
" This is a worldwide tragedy , " Nelson said .
" Thousands of hemophiliacs have unnecessarily died from AIDS and many thousands more are infected with HIV or hepatitis C. "
Bayer Corp. and Baxter Healthcare Corp. , also named in the lawsuit , did not immediately return calls seeking comment after business hours Monday .
The medicine , called Factor VIII concentrate , can stop or prevent potentially fatal bleeding in people with hemophilia .
Early in the AIDS epidemic , the medicine was commonly made using mingled plasma from 10,000 or more donors .
Because at the time there was not yet a screening test for HIV , the virus that causes AIDS , thousands of hemophiliacs were infected .
But the lawsuit alleges there were precautions Bayer and the others could have taken such as screening donors or using volunteers , a proven less - risky method , but refused .

The sound you just heard is the engine of a Harley - Davidson Motorcycle .
Today , we tell about this famous American company .
And , we tell about the year - long party that is celebrating the one - hundredth anniversary of the Harley - Davidson Motor Company .
(( THEME ) )
VOICE ONE :
The history of the Harley - Davidson Motor Company began in nineteen - oh - three , in a small wooden building in Milwaukee , Wisconsin .
Twenty - one - year - old William Harley and twenty - year - old Arthur Davidson built a machine that looked like a bicycle with a small engine .
A friend of the two men bought one of the first motorcycles they made .
They only made three motorcycles that year .
1903 : First production motorcycle .
On the door of the little wooden building , they painted a small sign .
The sign said , ¡°Harley - Davidson Motor Company .¡±
VOICE TWO :
The little company grew very quickly .
In nineteen - oh - six , it opened a new factory on Juneau Avenue in Milwaukee .
The company now had a total of six workers .
Two years later , in nineteen - oh - eight , the city of Detroit , Michigan bought the first motorcycle to be used by a police department in the United States .
It was a Harley - Davidson .
In nineteen - twelve , Harley - Davidson exported a motorcycle to another country for the first time .
That country was Japan .
1908 : Walter Davidson with the motorcycle he rode to a perfect 1,000 points at the American Morcyclists Endurance and Reliability Contest .
By nineteen - twenty , Harley - Davidson was the largest motorcycle company in the world .
More than two - thousand dealers sold Harley - Davidson motorcycles .
Most were in the United States .
However , dealers sold the Harley - Davidson motorcycles in more than sixty - seven countries around the world .
The motorcycle Harley - Davidson produced in the nineteen - twenties no longer looked like a bicycle with an engine .
It was a fast , powerful machine that provided good transportation .
Harley - Davidson motorcycle riders were winning races and setting speed records throughout the United States .
VOICE ONE :
Something else happened in nineteen - twenty that would have a lasting effect on the Harley - Davidson motorcycle .
The motorcycle became known as a ¡°Hog .¡±
The company tells this story to explain why .
A motorcycle racer named Leslie Parkhurst broke twenty - three speed records on his Harley - Davidson .
Mister Parkhurst¡¯s racing team had a pet animal they took with them to the races .
That pet animal was a small pig , also called a hog .
When a member of the team won a race , he would take the pig for a ride around the racetrack .
The racing fans loved the show .
They would shout , ¡°The Hog won again .¡±
Today , if a motorcycle rider tells you he rides a Hog , you know he is talking about his Harley - Davidson motorcycle .
(( MUSIC BRIDGE ) )
VOICE TWO :
Harley - Davidson has made other products besides their famous motorcycle .
Beginning in nineteen - twelve , the company began selling clothing for motorcycle riders .
Most of this clothing had the name Harley - Davidson printed on it .
In nineteen thirty - eight , Harley - Davidson began making a special motorcycle jacket for the New York City Police Department .
The jacket was made of heavy leather material .
Harley - Davidson still sells a very similar jacket today .
It is still popular with motorcycle riders .
It is also popular with people who just like leather jackets .
Harley - Davidson also sells pants , shirts , shoes , boots and just about everything else a motorcycle rider might want .
VOICE ONE :
The Harley - Davidson Company has faced financial problems several times in its history .
The nineteen - thirties was a period of severe economic problems known as the Great Depression .
In nineteen - twenty , Harley - Davidson sold twenty - seven - thousand motorcycles .
However , in nineteen - thirty - three , all of the American motorcycle companies sold only six - thousand machines .
About one - hundred other American motorcycle companies failed during the Depression .
Harley - Davidson survived .
VOICE TWO :
During the nineteen - sixties , a new threat faced Harley - Davidson .
Japanese motorcycle companies began selling their machines in the United States .
Companies like Honda , Yamaha and Kawasaki became popular .
These companies produced good motorcycles that were not very costly .
At the same time , Harley - Davidson had tried to expand too quickly .
Their motorcycles were more costly than the others .
The factory had production problems .
Oil often leaked out of the engines .
The engines often failed .
People told a joke about Harley - Davidson .
They said you had to buy two of their motorcycles -- one to ride and one for the extra parts you would need to repair it .
VOICE ONE :
In nineteen - sixty - nine , Harley - Davidson officials sold control of the company to a much larger company .
They planned to use the money they received in the sale to improve their products .
Harley - Davidson struggled to stay in business during this time .
The company says people who loved their motorcycles continued to buy them and helped keep the company from failing .
In nineteen - eighty - one , thirteen top officials at Harley - Davidson bought the company .
They started making improvements .
They began developing a much better product .
Two years later , Harley - Davidson asked the International Trade Commission for help .
The International Trade Commission agreed and gave protection to Harley - Davidson for five years .
This protection added to the price of large Japanese motorcycles .
Less than four years later , Harley - Davidson asked the International Trade Commission to end the protection .
No company had ever done this before .
By lifting the protection , Harley - Davidson was saying it could compete with any motorcycle company .

PITTSBURGH  On Tuesday evening in New York , top officials of the world nuclear watchdog agency approached two of President Obama ’s senior advisers to deliver the news : Iran had just sent a cryptic letter describing a small “ pilot ” nuclear facility that the country had never before declared .
The Americans were surprised by the letter , but they were angry about what it did not say .
American intelligence had come across the hidden tunnel complex years earlier , and the advisers believed the situation was far more ominous than the Iranians were letting on .
That night , huddled in a hotel room in the Waldorf - Astoria until well into the early hours , five of Mr. Obama ’s closest national security advisers , in New York for the administration ’s first United Nations General Assembly , went back and forth on what they would advise their boss when they took him the news in the morning .
A few hours later , in a different hotel room , they met with Mr. Obama and his senior national security adviser , Gen. James L. Jones , to talk strategy .
The White House essentially decided to outflank the Iranians , to present to their allies and the public what they believed was powerful evidence that there was more to the Iranian site than just some pilot program .
They saw it as a chance to use this evidence to persuade other countries to support the case for stronger sanctions by showing that the Iranians were still working on a secret nuclear plan .

A pair of maverick Bear Stearns hedge fund managers lied to clients " over and over again " to protect their multimillion dollar pay cheques , exchanging secret emails to orchestrate a $ 1.6 bn fraud as their funds imploded in the global financial crisis , a US jury heard yesterday .
At a federal court in the New York borough of Brooklyn , financiers Ralph Cioffi and Matthew Tannin became the first Wall Street bankers to stand trial in a criminal case arising from the credit crunch .
The men , who protest their innocence , are accused of hiding the true picture from clients as their two high - flying hedge funds fell to earth - an event which ultimately contributed to the collapse of the 85 - year - old brokerage Bear Stearns .
Prosecuting counsel Patrick Sinclair told jurors that the duo deceived investors " from France to Chicago , from Switzerland to right here in Brooklyn " , and flouted the " special relationship of trust " that comes with looking after other peoples ' money .
" These two defendants lied to their investors to save their multimillion dollar bonuses , " said Sinclair .
" In the United States of America , that is a crime .
It 's a serious crime and it 's called securities fraud . "
Cioffi , 53 , and Tannin , 48 , ran two Bear Stearns funds which , at their peak , managed $ 20 bn of assets .
During the good times , the court heard that they were well rewarded - Cioffi , a senior fund manager , earned a total of $ 32 m in 2005 and 2006 while Tannin , who has described himself as the " little cheese " of the two , received $ 4.4 m .
For 41 consecutive months , the pair enjoyed remarkable success as their funds consistently climbed in value .
But when the US property market began to wobble in early 2007 , their mortgage - stuffed funds faced difficulty .
Privately , the pair exchanged emails describing the market as " toast " and " pretty damn ugly " .
But on conference calls with clients , they are accused of lying about the number of investors pulling out of funds , and of hiding the truth about the amount of personal money they had at stake .
" They lied over and over again to lull investors into a false sense of confidence , " said Sinclair , highlighting one anxious message sent one morning from Tannin 's personal Google Mail account to a Hotmail account in the name of Cioffi 's wife .
" By lying , they stole from their investors the opportunity to make fully informed decisions . "
The case , which is expected to last six weeks , gives the US government the task of explaining the inner workings of hedge funds and collateralised debt obligations to a jury of seven men and five women , who were carefully screened for any prejudice against Wall Street bankers .
Asked for his views , one prospective juror said that " people on Wall Street receive exorbitant bonuses " , while another suggested that " large financial institutions always try to bend the rules " .
District judge Frederic Bloc repeatedly warned : " This is not a case to give people an opportunity to get revenge because they 're angry at Wall Street . "
Legal experts say that prosecutors face a tough task in proving the men stepped over a legal line between aggressive marketing and fraudulent deception .
Defence lawyers for the two men argue that they are being victimised , and that the government is " cherry picking " a handful of sentences , out of context , from thousands of emails .
Cioffi's counsel , Dane Butswinkas , conceded that the defendants had made mistakes , but argued that they were being punished for failing to anticipate " the greatest financial crisis since the Great Depression " .
" It 's always easier to call the right play on a Monday morning , after the big game on a Sunday , " said Butswinkas .
" It 's always easier to pick the right investment strategy after the fact .
Hindsight is 20 - 20 . "
Attempting to cloud the prosecution 's picture of the two men running the funds virtually single - handedly , Butswinkas produced tables of Bear Stearns ' management structure , bulky disclosure documents and a picture of the brokerage 's busy trading floor .
He said Cioffi and Tannin were not simply conspiring in a " bat cave " of their own .
" This was a talented group of people who had faith in themselves and in their team , " said Butswinkas , who stressed Cioffi 's humble roots - the former fund manager grew up in a small town in Vermont , worked as a bus boy in his family 's Italian restaurant and did odd jobs as a truck driver and a cashier to pay his way through college .
He arrived in New York in the 1980s to embark upon a career as a banker with just $ 200 in a " slightly worn out pouch " .
Cioffi and Tannin , both in dark suits , listened intently to proceedings and were accompanied to court by large contingents of family .
Tannin faces a maximum sentence of 20 years for fraud , while Cioffi , who faces a further charge of insider dealing , could face 40 years imprisonment .
The progress of the trial will be watched keenly by scores of other big names on Wall Street who are facing official investigations for questionable business practices in the run-up to the credit crunch .
The Consumer Federation of America says there is a popular desire for financiers to be held " accountable " for the spectacular eradication of wealth caused by the global credit meltdown .
People see our bakery and have all sorts of interesting expectations .
And , when you work in retail , you are taught that the customer is always right .
So I try to be as agreeable as possible when dealing with customers .
And I almost always mean what I say .
Except when what I really meant was something entirely different .
Here are a few examples ...
Customer : Can you do this three tier cake to serve 50 people by this afternoon ?
Me : No , I am so sorry but we are already totally booked for the next couple of days .
BWIRMW : You must be kidding ... did you think we could just whip up and bake three cakes , let them cool , then ice , decorate and stack them in just two hours ?
Customer :
Will you bake my wedding cake the morning of the wedding ?
Me : Your cake will be as fresh as possible .
BWIRMW : And your wedding is at 11 am ?
Do you have any idea how long it takes to bake , cool , ice , decorate and stack a wedding cake ?
Customer :
Where is your fresh bread ?
I really love your fresh bread .
Me : We 're baking fresh bread on Thursdays now .
BWIRMW : We stopped baking bread daily almost two years ago , so I guess it 's been a while since you bought any of that bread you really love .
Customer : I am having an employee meeting tomorrow , could you donate some cookies ?
Me :
If you are having a fund raiser for charity , we would be happy to donate a gift card , but we do not donate our food products .
BWIRMW : Wow , I never even thought of asking a business to DONATE something to give to my employees .
Customer : I have a recipe for my grandmother 's pound cake , can you make me one for tomorrow ?
Me : No , but could I recommend a personal chef or caterer ?
BWIRMW : Hmmm , let me see ... tie up our mixers , ovens and employees for one pound cake ?
Yeah , right .
Just smile and wave , boys , smile and wave .
Sifting through the newspaper , a news on Chicken Samosas caught my eye .
President Barack Obama had served them with other dishes at a White House Reception hosted for ambassadors this monday .
Being a foodie , most of the time I am in search of culinary delights which I could make to suffice my taste buds .
But this news made me hungry and I could think of nothing else other than samosas .
Monsoon drizzle had made the weather also perfect .
Only ingredient that my kitchen lacked for making chicken samosas was chicken .
Usually I had never made so much effort for making anything .
But samosas made me make that extra effort .
I immediately went to the market and bought some boneless chicken .
Making samosas is not a very difficult task .
The only difficulty is in giving the right shape and closing them properly .
As soon as you start frying them , your kitchen will be filled with a nice aroma as my had .
Finally when I took the first bite , I knew that all of my efforts had paid .
I cuddled up on the terrace with piping hot samosas dipped into tangy chutney and a hot cup of tea .
For vegan variations , instead of chicken filling you can try the original Indian potato filling .
Try it out , and if you do n’t get hooked , I ’ll eat it all of them on my own !
Ingredients
For dough
2 cup all purpose flour
2 tbsp oil
1 cup Water
pinch of salt
For filling
2 cups of boneless chicken shredded
1 large onion chopped
1 tbsp ginger garlic paste
coriander leaves
2 tbsp Garam Masala Powder
1 tbsp cumin seeds
1 tbsp red chilli powder
1 tsp. turmeric powder
salt to taste
oil for frying
Method
Preparing Dough
* In a bowl mix together flour , salt and oil .
With hands mix it well till the mixture is coarse .
* Add water and knead into a smooth dough .
* Leave it for about half an hour and prepare the filling in the meantime .
Preparing Filling
* In a saucepan heat 2 tbsp of oil .
Add cumin seeds .
* Then add chopped onions .
Fry till golden brown .
* Add rest of the spices - garam masala , turmeric powder , salt and ginger garlic paste .
* When the spices are cooked add minced chicken and let it cook for few minutes .
* Add chopped coriander mix well .
* Let the chicken filling cool before making samosas .
Making Samosas
* Make small balls from the dough .
Roll each ball into a big round .
It should not be very thin .
* Cut it into 2 halves using a knife .
Pick one half and make a cone out of it .
* Add the filling into the cone .
Seam the mouth and open edges with a little water , by pressing the ends .
Take care in doing this so that it may not open while frying .
* Do the same with the rest of the dough .
* When done , heat oil in a wok and deep fry all the samosas till golden brown .
* Serve them hot with yogurt and green chutney or cilantro yogurt dip .
Note :
To remove excess oil , press the samosas on paper napkins .
WASHINGTON — The military lawyer that represents an Afghan youth who spent roughly seven years in U.S. custody says the Defense Department has repeatedly ignored his requests for a war crimes investigation into the detainee ’s treatment .
Air Force Maj .
David Frakt , the attorney for former detainee Mohammed Jawad , says over the past 16 months he sent multiple memos to Defense Department and military leaders asking them to account for what a military judge called “ abusive conduct and cruel and inhuman treatment ” of his client .
Jawad , who was arrested when he says he was 12 years old for allegedly tossing a grenade at U.S. military , was moved from cell to cell 112 times during a 14 - day period to disrupt his sleep patterns , according to military documents .
Frakt said he believes the treatment constituted torture , violated the Geneva Convention , war crime laws and Defense Department regulations .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ Why has no one –no one has been held remotely accountable for this , ” Frakt said in an interview with Raw Story .
“ This is a mandatory investigation .
It ’s not optional , you ca n’t just sweep it under the rug… but they did as far as I can tell . ”
As first reported in The Washington Independent , Frakt wrote in memos to Defense Department officials : “ Accordingly , I believe I have an affirmative obligation to report the incident to my chain of command , ” listing military rules that mandate reporting possible war crimes to a superior .
Both a federal district court judge and a U.S. military commission judge have questioned the use of sleep deprivation , also called the “ frequent flyer ” program , on Jawad .
When military officials changed Jawad ’s cell 112 times between May 7 and May 20 , 2004 , roughly once every three hours , military Judge Stephen Henley , a U.S. Army colonel ruled “ the scheme was calculated to profoundly disrupt his mental senses . ”
Although officials were allowed to use such tactics during interrogation , Jawad ’s attorney Frakt said he was not interrogated months before or months after the sleep deprivation occurred .
Judge Henley also said in the September 2008 ruling that when Jawad was subjected to sleep deprivation , he “ was of no intelligence value to any government agency ” so “ the infliction of the ‘ frequent flyer ’ technique upon the Accused thus had no legitimate interrogation purpose . ”
Henley added that it violated the United Nations Convention Against Torture agreement signed by the U.S. and that the sleep deprivation tactics were used on Jawad , even after the Joint Task Force Guantanamo commander had ordered such techniques stopped .
ADVERTISEMENT
The Washington Independent notes that the Justice Department ’s Office of Legal Counsel itself allows anywhere from 48 to 180 hours of sleep deprivation , or 2 days to 11 days for “ high - value detainees , ” but “ never condoned 13 days of straight sleep deprivation on anyone , let alone someone like Jawad , who was at best an al - Qaeda or Taliban foot soldier . ”
Judge Henley concluded : “ Those responsible should face appropriate disciplinary action , if warranted under the circumstances . ”
Frakt wrote his first memo on May 29 , 2008 , and sent it to the chief defense counsel at the Office of Military Commissions .
After four months passed without a response , Frakt sent a similar memo via e-mail to the Commander in charge at the U.S. Southern Command post , Joint Task Force for Guantanamo Bay on October 7 , 2008 .
He also copied four lawyers in the Pentagon ’s Office of General Counsel on the e-mail .
ADVERTISEMENT
In January 2009 , Frakt again e-mailed the commander in charge at the U.S. Southern Command post , Joint Task Force for Guantanamo Bay , added a captain ’s name to the list and included the same four lawyers from the Pentagon ’s Office of General Counsel on the email .
Officials with the Defense Department and the U.S. Southern Command acknowledged requests for comments from Raw Story on Monday , but after three days time , no one has been able to say whether there has been any investigation into the Jawad case whatsoever .
ADVERTISEMENT
This summer , US District Judge Ellen Huvelle ordered Mohammed Jawad ’s release saying the government ’s case against him is “ full of holes . ”
Jawad now plans to sue U.S. government for his alleged mis-treatment .
Frakt told Raw Story “ the failure to investigate war crimes is , in itself , a war crime . ”
“ Was anyone questioning this ? ” Frakt said .
“ Is this fair , is it humane , is this right ?
It makes me wonder about the moral fiber of those involved . ”
A husband and wife were jailed today for the manslaughter of their baby , who died after they chose to use homeopathic remedies rather than conventional medicine to treat her severe skin disorder .
Thomas Sam , 42 , a lecturer in homeopathy , and his wife Manju , 37 , of Sydney , were convicted in June after the death of their nine - month - old daughter Gloria from septicaemia and malnutrition in May 2002 .
The parents had faced a maximum penalty of 25 years in prison .
The New South Wales state supreme court justice , Peter Johnson , ordered Thomas Sam to serve at least six years in jail , with a maximum sentence of eight years , and Manju to serve at least four years in jail with a maximum of five years and four months .
Johnson said there was a " wide chasm " between the couple 's approach and the action a reasonable parent would have taken .
Thomas Sam's " arrogant approach " to his preference for homeopathy and Manju Sam 's deference to her husband led to their daughter 's death , he said .
Prosecutors said Thomas Sam continued to consult homeopaths and natural medicine practitioners after his daughter was diagnosed at four months old .
Her health continued to deteriorate and her black hair turned white .
Gloria became malnourished by battles against infections that invaded her bloodstream through skin broken by rashes .
Her parents finally took her to a hospital and doctors gave her morphine and began treating an eye infection that had started to melt her corneas .
She died three days later .

Facebook this week rolled out Lite , a stripped down version of its site largely aimed at users with slower connections -- i.e. developing nations .
At present , Facebook Lite is only available in India and the U.S. ( not a developing nation , to be sure , though we are number 28 in the list of worldwide Internet speeds ) , but Facebook is certainly looking toward a worldwide rollout .
The functionality of the site is more basic that it 's full - featured counterpart , though users can still do plenty with the stripped down version , including commenting , accepting friend requests , looking at photos , updating statuses , and writing on walls .
Facebook 's own numbers , roughly 70 - percent of its users are located outside of the U.S. Originally posted to AppScout .
Auto Dealer Industry Files Suit to Block CA Emissions Limits
Here we go again … now that California has finally gotten a Clean Air Act waiver from Obama ’s Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) to regulate emissions from cars and trucks , the auto dealer industry has responded with a lawsuit .
On September 10 , 2009 , the US Chamber of Commerce and the National Automobile Dealers Association filed suit to block this waiver .
The groups are concerned other states will follow California ’s lead , which applies to current model year vehicles .
They are also concerned that global warming is an international concern and not a state issue .
After five years of Bush ’s refusal to allow the state to implement its greenhouse gas regulations , Lisa Jackson granted the waiver to California stating it was “ consistent with the Clean Air Act as it ’s been used for the last 40 years . ”
This decision was praised by environmentalists .
Frank O’Donnell , executive director of Clean Air Watch , called it “ the single biggest step taken so far by the Obama administration against global warming ” .
The lawsuit does not have the support of Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers , according to Charles Territo , “ We share the Obama administration ’s goals of increasing fuel economy and reducing carbon dioxide emissions and remain committed to the national program announced last May . ”
Mary Nichols , California Air Resources Board chairperson concurs :
We are very disappointed that these parties continue to pursue an outdated course of action designed to obstruct and oppose efforts to move us toward a cleaner environment and greater energy security , and we are confident that E.P.A. will prevail in court .
California has led the nation on aggressive greenhouse gas reduction efforts , and has shown you can protect the environment and create jobs at the same time .
Center for Auto Safety Safe Climate Campaign director Dan Becker adds , “ It ’s not surprising that polluting industries would throw the kitchen sink to try to block the E.P.A. from controlling global warming pollution , but it is unfortunate . ”
How will the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia respond ?
Environmentalists are confident the waiver will stand .
You would think that after the huge success of the Clash for Clunkers program , the auto dealers would be content with the Obama administration .

The Issue
It ’s back to school for former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales .
Texas Tech University is paying him $ 100,000 to teach a single undergraduate political - science course , Contemporary Issues in the Executive Branch , with an enrollment of 15 , and to help recruit minority students .
Supporters say he offers students a rare chance to learn from a participant in important national events .
Opponents say he is overpaid and underqualified and left his last job in disgrace .
Is the school providing honorable employment or a sinecure for a sinner ?
The Argument
Texas
Tech should not have hired Gonzales , as many of his new colleagues proclaim .
Passionately .
“ I think it ’s preposterous for him to come here , ” an unnamed professor told The Daily Toreador , the student paper ( as reported by Main Justice , an online magazine that follows the Justice Department ) .
“ They ’re trumping up some fake position to bring him in , and I do n’t know what his responsibility will be , but I ’m certain it wo n’t be commensurate with his pay .
If you look at his teaching load , it ’s incredibly reduced . ”
That masked scholar has at least part of a point .
Nationwide , the average pay for an adjunct professor is about $ 1,800 per course .
Gonzales makes more than 55 times that .
Sweet .
But not necessarily wicked .
I , too , am susceptible to resentment of those I think egregiously overpaid .
( Damn you , Eddy Curry ! )
Surely their ludicrously inflated salaries could better be spent on … oh , say , me .
But a defense can be mustered for a school ’s celebrity hire : even if it is dubious pedagogy , it can be cunning marketing — publicizing the university , attracting students , gratifying alumni and boosting their donations to their alma mater .
( Professor Brangelina , have you met Professor Talking Gecko from the Geico Commercials ? )
The anti-Gonzales camp makes a more cogent case against his appointment in a petition signed by more than 90 Texas Tech faculty members .
One telling assertion : Hiring Gonzales was cronyism , undertaken at the behest of Tech ’s chancellor , Kent Hance , a “ good friend ” of Gonzales’s .
“ Hiring faculty is paradigmatically the responsibility of academic departments , ” the petition argues .
“ It is not appropriate for the chancellor to be calling the deans of the various colleges asking them to hire particular individuals . ”
Walter Schaller , an associate professor of philosophy at Texas Tech who teaches ethics , among other things , is the author of the petition .
He told me : “ Strictly speaking , no rules were broken .
I do n’t have any sense that the dean was pressured into it .
But there is a built - in conflict : if you say no to the chancellor , you do n’t know what goodies you ’re giving up .
The chancellor should not be suggesting appointments for his friends . ”
No matter how Gonzales got the job , according to the petition , his “ ethical failings ” disqualify him for it .
The sins cited include the firing of nine U.S. attorneys , making misleading statements to Congress , mishandling the “ torture memo , ” denying the right of habeas corpus and repudiating the Geneva Conventions .
It is a disheartening C.V. , but some of these allegations are unproved , and others blur the distinction between moral transgression and policy dispute .
Yet it does seem that Gonzales ’s past conduct puts him afoul of the university ’s own Statement of Ethical Principles and that Tech would probably reject other applicants subject to similar criticisms .
As an anonymous student posted to The Daily Toreador ’s Web site : “ Maybe Tech should also hire Madoff to teach Contemporary Issues in Running an Investment Fund . ”
More potent still is the petition ’s charge that Gonzales fails to meet the university ’s standards for faculty .
It asks : “ Does he have a noteworthy academic record ?
Does he have a record of publishing in law reviews ? ”
It is true that universities regularly waive such criteria to hire accomplished practitioners — a musician or an actor or a dancer to instruct students at a performing - arts school , for example .
But such jobs generally go to those who provide a sort of vocational training .
This might apply here were Gonzales teaching law — many law schools distinguish between faculty proffering theory and those teaching practice — but it makes little sense for an undergraduate political - science seminar .
And , as it happens , the chancellor “ offered Gonzales to the law school , ” Schaller said , “ but there was little interest . ”
Gonzales ’s defenders argue that there is another , related reason to make an exception here :
There is much to be learned from people at the center of great events .
As one student put it in a post to the Toreador , “ Whether you agree or disagree with him politically , he was a ‘ player ’ at a level that allows him to offer unique insight . ”
Gonzales himself told Texas Lawyer magazine : “ I dare say very few are going to have the same level of insight , the direct hands - on involvement that I can bring to the students . ”
Schaller demurs .
“ I ’m willing to grant that a former attorney general has enough life experience to teach one class , ” he said .
“ But there is so much that Gonzales can not say — because of pending investigations , because of what he ’s said he ’s saving for his book — as to be overwhelming .
He ca n’t have the kind of honest exchanges students can expect from a professor . ”
Schaller points out that Gonzales acknowledged such restrictions in his interview with Deborah Solomon in The New York Times Magazine last month .
I ’d go further .
If participating in great events guaranteed insight into them , Robert E. Lee ’s horse , Traveller , would be teaching military history at West Point .
( If he were n’t dead .
Or a horse . )
To be a scholar requires training , acumen , genuine professional sophistication , not merely being there .
We rightly distinguish between subject and object , between a historical figure and a historian .
A better way of studying Gonzales ’s “ direct hands - on involvement ” in Washington would be for him to deliver a series of public lectures that students could subsequently analyze under the tutelage of actual scholars , who would earn in a year what Gonzales would be paid for one hypothetical hour of nostalgic palaver .
I ’m a reformer not a radical .
But as things stand , Tech is paying him a lot of money to do a job for which he is unsuited .
It was improper for the school to offer and indecorous for Gonzales to accept .
( Disclosure :
In a letter to The Times Magazine Gonzales called my advice in The Ethicist of Dec. 3 , 2006 , “ reckless and naïve . ”
Subsequent events have made it hard to regard his disapproval without irony . )
With housing prices down 30 + % on average over the last few years , is Uncle Sam blowing fresh air into the housing balloon and actually creating another housing bubble ?
I believe that ’s exactly what is happening .
If you are scratching your head and think I am off base with my assertion , please navigate this path along our economic landscape with me .
What drove the housing bubble ?
Cheap rates and undisciplined lending from the private sector .
What added to the bubble ?
The internal ‘ hedge fund ’ portfolios of Freddie Mac ( NYSE : FRE ) and Fannie Mae ( NYSE : FNM ) .
What is perpetuating the housing bubble if not creating another mini-bubble of sorts ?
Cheap rates and undisciplined lending directly from Uncle Sam or supported by Uncle Sam .
What is adding to this bubble ?
Those same internal portfolios at Freddie and Fannie .
What entities within Uncle Sam ’s domain are providing the cheap rates and undisciplined lending ?
1. The Federal Housing Administration ( FHA - insured loans are packaged into GNMA securities , which have the explicit backing of Uncle Sam )
2 . The Federal Reserve ’s quantitative easing program in which it has purchased hundreds of billions in mortgage - backed securities with authority to purchase a total of $ 1 trillion + in MBS is also blowing fresh air into the balloon .
3. Freddie and Fannie are also supporting the bubble by providing fresh capital via their portfolios .
People may say that Uncle Sam had to provide this capital because the private sector would not .
In fact , The Wall Street Journal makes that very assertion this morning in writing , Industry Seeks Fannie , Freddie Overhaul :
Together with the Federal Housing Administration , Fannie and Freddie now purchase or guarantee nearly nine in 10 new mortgages , since private buyers of such loans have been absent amid the housing bust .
I categorically do not accept this assertion .
There is more than enough private capital in the system to purchase these mortgages .
The issue is that the private capital will only purchase these mortgages at appropriate risk adjusted prices .
Freddie , Fannie , the FHA , and the Federal Reserve are stepping ‘ through the market ’ and subsidizing mortgage rates by at least 50 basis points and , in turn , crowding out private buyers .
The WSJ continues :
Fannie and Freddie have taken nearly $ 96 billion of capital infusions from the U.S. Treasury since last November .
The companies have received nearly 10 times that amount in additional support through purchases of debt and mortgage - backed securities by the Treasury and the Federal Reserve .
Who is benefiting from these subsidized rates ?
New homeowners .
Do not think for a second , however , that risks are properly aligned in this current mortgage dynamic .
The continued mispricing of risk will mean our housing market will experience more protracted levels of delinquencies , defaults , and foreclosures than if mortgage rates were higher and real discipline were instituted into the lending process .
In fact , unless our country accepts a fully socialized mortgage finance system , mortgage rates will have to move higher to reflect private sector pricing .
Risks and returns will then be properly aligned and the bubble will deflate .

As the New Democratic Party 's convention prepares to open tomorrow , it appears the main topic for debate will be a proposed name change to " Democratic Party . "
Many initial impressions of the idea seem to be positive , particularly because adopting a new name ( ironically by dropping the word " New " ) has been seen as a means of getting the party out of the rut it has been stuck in the last few years .
These initial impressions are entirely wrong .
The NDP 's focus on a name change is actually a perfect manifestation of the thinking that has put the party in its current rut .
In particular , focusing on the party 's name is exactly the type of unimaginative , play - it - safe move that has become typical of the NDP .
This cautiousness , in turn , is exactly the approach the NDP cannot afford .
At the most basic level , today 's NDP is a truly remarkable phenomenon : it is a fourth - place party , usually stuck in the teens in the polls , and purporting to represent the most marginalized groups in society – yet it has become stubbornly risk - averse , acting as if it has too much to lose to speak out strongly on many key issues facing the country .
When it comes to strategy , the NDP was certainly bold in lunging for power through the coalition .
It also has a notable amount of talent in its parliamentary caucus , with even right - wing commentators praising NDP MPs for being knowledgeable and performing effectively in parliamentary committees .
But when it comes to the party 's main policies , a mind - numbing blandness has set in .
There are few instances where the NDP has boldly taken a controversial position on a key issue .
If you have visited the NDP 's website frequently in the last couple of years , you were much more likely to read about credit card rates , bank fees , and insurance premiums than central economic , social , or foreign - policy questions .
A particularly deep part of the NDP 's rut is that avoiding controversy has become to be seen as the " pragmatic " approach .
Standing out on major issues , meanwhile , is viewed as the " radical " approach that will keep the NDP on the fringes .
But if pragmatism means anything , it is paying attention to results .
The results of the recent " pragmatic " approach are in , and they are dispiriting .
The party failed to break out of fourth place , or even break its old record for seats in Parliament , in an election against the weakest leader the Liberals have ever had in Stéphane Dion .
Moreover , the NDP suffered greatly from the backlash against the proposed coalition government , with Jack Layton 's personal popularity especially hard hit .
Dismissing more controversial stands as a " radical " tactic is also ridiculous .
If there is one thing that the NDP has to recognize , it is that Canadian politics has moved so far to the right that the party no longer needs to take radical positions to stand out .
Eminently moderate positions are now far outside the so - called mainstream .
The best example is Canada 's biggest foreign policy issue : Afghanistan .
At its last convention in 2006 , the NDP adopted the policy of withdrawing Canadian troops and negotiating with the Taliban .
But after facing a backlash from some quarters , Layton and other NDP leaders have been far from eager to pursue this issue .
Indeed , it has been widely noted how rarely Afghanistan is seriously debated in Ottawa at all .
Meanwhile , over the last three years , opposition to our mission in Afghanistan among the Canadian public has grown to the point where it is now the majority view .
Staying out of Afghanistan ( or at least avoiding combat roles ) is also the position of the overwhelming majority of NATO countries .
A vast number of security and defence experts in the West have been vocal in complaining about flaws in NATO 's strategy .
Most recently , negotiating with at least some members of the Taliban has been seriously contemplated by the British and American governments .
All of this should constitute a major vindication for the NDP .
Instead , the party 's sense of " pragmatism " has dictated that it avoid upholding its own position , even as Canadian voters , key allies , and experts in the field come to agree with most of it .
Another example is trade policy .
This , too , should be fertile ground for the NDP , as the free - trade orthodoxies still revered by most Canadian politicians and pundits have steadily lost credibility in much of the rest of the world .
Protectionism has been rising gradually in the U.S. for years , as witnessed by the softwood lumber dispute .
Many Latin American governments openly reject free - market nostrums .
Last year , the refusal of rich Western nations to actually practice free trade caused developing nations to walk out of negotiations on farm subsidies at a World Trade Organization meeting . .
Even if it is too much to ask for the NDP to challenge free - trade theology head on , at least it could have insisted that in an era of globalization , Canadian leaders need to recognize major shifts in attitudes outside our borders .
It could have emerged as the main voice warning Canadians about the most recent wave of protectionism , including the " Buy American " policy , and demanding that Canada stop acting as the world 's naïve little cub scout about trade matters .
In short , the NDP is not stuck far behind the other parties because it has lacked opportunities to offer distinct policies that would have , with time , proven to be both prescient and popular .
What has been missing is the basic will to take the heat that comes with going against the grain .

Whatever the party wants to call itself , the biggest priority at this convention should be shaking out of the fundamental culture of risk - aversion , of venturing nothing but still hoping to make gains , that has taken over the NDP in recent years .

There is a deepening row in France over the alleged lengths gone to by President Nicolas Sarkozy 's aides in order to conceal his short stature .
In a Belgian TV report , the employee of a French factory visited by Mr Sarkozy admitted being chosen to stand behind him because she was no taller than him .
The report became an internet hit over the weekend and other workers have since backed the allegation .
But the charge has been robustly denied by the president 's office .
A spokesman for the Elysee Palace called it " completely absurd and grotesque " .
But the president has been mocked by the opposition Socialists for his " complete stage management " .
How world leaders measure up
In a world where a carefully manipulated image ( and sometimes stack heels ) are essential , definitive vital statistics can be hard to come by .
The heights shown here are those most commonly recorded for each world leader Russian President Dmitry Medvedev , for example , is variously reported as being between 5 ' 2 " and 5 ' 4 " tall Napoleon 's height was once commonly given as 5 ' 2 " , but many historians have now credited him with another 4 inches owing to a miscalculation between French and English units of measurement
Touchy subject President Sarkozy visited the Faurecia factory in Caligny in Normandy , northern France , on Thursday last week as part of a drive to defend his management of the economy .
After a tour of the plant , he addressed factory employees while standing in front of a group of workers , who were all about his own height or shorter .
The president 's wife often dons flats in the presence of her husband
In a subsequent TV report by Belgian network RTBF , an unnamed employee confirmed she had been chosen to share the stage with President Sarkozy because she was no bigger than him .
Faurecia 's management released a statement on Monday to " deny the rumours that the Elysee had made any ' special requests ' as regards the staff present during the president 's speech " , reported French news agency AFP .
But French websites Le Post and Rue89 have since quoted union representatives at the plant , some of them named , as confirming that height criteria for staff to appear with Mr Sarkozy had been received by the management .
President Sarkozy is reported to be extremely touchy about his height , which is believed to be about 5ft 5 in or 5ft 6in ( 165-168 cm ) .
He has previously been pictured wearing shoes with a substantial heel and giving speeches standing on hidden platforms .
The French media have also previously noted the propensity of Mr Sarkozy 's wife , the former model Carla Bruni-Sarkozy , to don flat shoes when in the presence of her husband .

I killed hornets using sticky poison material and the hornets were attracted to to it and they died a slow and painful death .
I killed them all to save the bee hive next to my house .
Apparently they never saw me as a threat but an ally .
So I get free honey everyday and those hornets must die and they did .

Foaming Scubbing Bubbles works great , 2/3 sprays and they write until they die ^-^ it 's perfect for socio / psychopaths who like to watch creatures suffer :3

Cling wrap .
Ill corner them into the bathroom and shut the door , then wait for them to land somewhere .
Then bubble the plastic wrap around where they are ( they dont move because they cant see a shadow ) and tap the wall so that they fly onto the wrap .
Then just close the plastic up behind them , seal it up and throw it out .
No mess , no fuss , dont have to look at a dead bug .

You could try an airsoft gun :)
Posted by : Dan | Nov 18 , 2013 8:22:43 PM
WINDEX is the easiest way .
2 - 3 shots right on the fly and he 's dead .
no miss , no flying , no splash .
I put plastic bags in EVERY HOLE of my apartement to prevent the flies to get in .
Laundry , sink , windows , light , bath , everything is close shut and flies manage to get in .
I also put like 5 sticky rubber things that fly get stuck on it .
It work great but its a little disgusting to see like 30 flies still alive on that thing ...

i remember one time my neighbers cat died under our house and there were millons of flies everywhere .
That was perfect practice for me .
I eventually got pro at it
Posted by : asher | Nov 28 , 2012 3:34:22 PM
I just spent an hour going after this huge , disgusting , fat , slow fly .
I killed it , but I swear I can still hear the disgusting buzzing .
Long story short , neighbours have a cat and because my apartment is just above their own , my apartment is swarming with flies .
7 or 8 each time I get back from the office .
Normally I start going like a helicopter ninja with two towels until they fly outside and then close the windows .
But tonight , it was different .
Besides the normal sized flies , there was this humongous , disgusting fat one , you know the ones , those disgusting ones that are a little slower , bigger and make more noise when flying .
The ones you can squish easily but you avoid to because they are so big they leave a huge mess .
So first I started with hairspray .
It slowed it down but did n't kill it .
Started to go after it with a news paper , but it would hide into unreachable places .
I must have mazed it with hairspray about 6 times , damn thing would n't die .
Then , it made the mistake of hiding inside of those vase like lamps .
I got some clear window cleaner and drowned it in it .
Thought it was dead but after a few minutes it started buzzing again an managed to get out .
Finally I just reached for the window cleaner once more , sprayed it , waited for it to remain still and then squished it on the floor .
So fucking disgusting .

I swatted a fly and it came back to life a couple of times .
It seemed to be playing a game with me .
I had never seen a fly come back to life like that .
So I got out the heavy garnier hair spray in the green bottle ( had a sample size around ) and sprayed the little guy good .
He made a strange buzzy sound , another new thing to me , and was finally at my mercy ( the hair spray does not kill , just temporarily slows the fly down ) .
So I swatted it and the d# # ### thing exploded all over the place .
I am so grossed out now that I am googling " fly guts " and came upon this wonderful community .

You guys should try the SwatMate !

Rustoleum ?
No .
I do n't want to paint the inside
of my house with a spraycan !
Any pump type cleaning fluid like Simple
Green , Lysol , Formula 409 , Windex , Fantastic etc .
is toxic to flies .
Does n't have to be concentrated ,
could even be diluted .
Something else : I lost a
fly swatter and figured out how to kill flies with
a big old towel .
[ If you try to swat them , they 'll fly
from the towel shadow and to the light . ]
Hold the towel
open in front of you and hold it parallel to the window .
the fly is resting on .
Move towards the fly with the towel .
It boxes them in
with no direction to fly .
They wo n't move in that situation .
Then tap back of the towel , and kill the fly on
the front .
Works really well .

Rustoleum , believe it or not .
They seem to be really attracted to the bright orange and red colors , but the pigment they use to make Kelly Green is absolutely toxic to them .
It must be heavier than the others , because a good 2 or 3 second burst of Kelly Green from 6 inches away or less , and they go off to join the dead carcass in the sky .
Safety tips :
1 . Be sure to put the kids in a closet or lock them in the garage while you go on your bug hunt .
2. Sometimes the flies like to gather on the ceiling , particularly in the morning hours .
Be sure to wear something to cover your hair , like a shower cap .
And do n't forget eye protection .
3 . You can get the flies to gather in one room if you put a dead cat in the middle of the kitchen for two or three days .
This tip will save you hours of hunting in every room in your house .
4 . Let the kids participate .
Kids love to help .
Send them out to find the dead cat .
5 . Using a lighter to ignite the paint as it exits the can nozzle is completely unnecessary , contrary to the recommendations on This Old House .
The paint not only kills most of them , but survivors are much easier to see , so you can give them a second dose if necessary .
Or , if you 're all out of Kelly Green Rustoleum , you could just use Windex .
Windex really does work .
It 's toxic to flies and kills them in about 30 seconds .
It does n't stain , does n't leave streaks on windows , it 's 100 % effective , and best of all , it 's antiseptic .

I just used some febreeze to kill 3 flies .
Well it does n't kill them .
But it soaks their wings and they cannot fly .
swatted them with a flip flop and my house smells great .

I have an electrified ' tennis racket ' mostly for mosquitoes , but I do catch the odd fly with it .
Wonderful sound , that zap !
Posted by : BagLady | Jun 20 , 2012 11:55:48 PM
just hunt them with rubber bands , its the easyest way
Posted by : andre | Feb 23 , 2012 12:39:01 PM
Put a few mothballs in a clean vacuum sweeper bag , and put it in your sweeper .
Using the hose attachment , with the crevise tool , turn sweeper on .
and slowly approach fly from about 6 inches above him .
When he takes off , move tool towards him from .
the rear .
With a little practice , you 'll be able to approach them in flight and suck them in easily !
Throw bag out immediately I put it in a plastic bag , tie .it up tightly and .
the mothballs do their work

You could make a small bomb .
1 . Get a balloon
2 . Put olive oil in it ( or white vinegar )
3 . Fill it with mousse
4. Voila !
This is only really a stun bomb .

I usually wait until the fly flies onto the folds of a curtain , wait for a bit , and clap the fly to its death .
After which I , of course , take apart its wings and laugh at its inability to escape .

Here are some fun methods to kill flies :
1 ) Turn all the lights off in the Fly area , except one .
Place this light behind a fan .
You may want to point the fan away from yourself while you 're doing this :P
Note :
The really big flies seem to be able to battle against the suction from the fan .
2 ) When the fly lands , sure you could clap it to death .
Or you could take a lighter , increase the flame size ( http://www.metacafe.com/watch/908878/lighter_flame_hack_increase_the_size_of_your_lighter_flame/)
AND WATCH IT BURN .
I 'm currently chasing after this one fly of mine with a lighter .
Right now my house 's safety is taking the back seat .
Posted by : Visulth | Oct 20 , 2008 2:13:12 AM
For years I have been using a small butterfly net from the dollar store .
Everyone makes fun of me because I position myself and aim a few inches above where it landed .
I catch them with 80 % accuracy , stick the open net part on my belly , grasp ahold the opening with the fly at the bottom of the net , and take it outside .
This may seem over the top , and it's not that I care about the fly .
I just hate cleaning up fly guts .
This way everyone wins .
Yes , I know , they could fly right back in , but seeing as I do n't tag them , I will never know .

Well , I broke down and used Raid ( for flies ) .
So far , it 's working .
I will continue to use it for the next 2 weeks to eliminate all sources .
Thanks for trying .

After reviewing all of these messages - FUNNY and HYSTERICAL as they may be ( I laughed through a bunch of them myself ) , I have a HUGE fly problem .
About a week a ago I saw 4 average size flies and killed them with a newspaper and did n't think of them anymore .
But here 's the clincher ...
... yesterday evening ( after work ) I found approximately 8 flies [ they looked like horse flies ] ( one of which my cat found on the ceiling and hopped on the dining room table , of which he is not allowed to be on ) .
I killed them again with a newspaper and ignored it again .
Morning came ...
... around 7 am while trying to feed my cat , I swear there had to be 15 flies - again with the newspaper .
I went back to bed because I was up late doing some other things and woke up again at 12 pm ... I found 30 flies !!
Yes the newspaper again ( this is one tired paper that should be retired ) .
I could n't take it anymore !
I cleaned my entire apartment and read some interesting information on the Internet in between cleanings .
One of them was the soap and water spray bottle .
I 'm trying it .
In the mean time , as I was vaccuming , I found a bunch of larva along the dashboards of my apartment .
I used the hose of the vaccum and rubbed REALLY hard along the surfaces .
Afterwards , I sprayed again with the soap and water .
All I could do is hope .
Well , I had to leave the house for a few hours and guess what ...
... I found 2 or 3 flies .
I NEED HELP !!
How do you get rid of the eggs ???
I think we are forgetting where they start from .
How can we remove all sources from egg to adult ( nasty ) fly ?
Your suggestions would be GREATLY appreciated .
Again HELP !
Posted by : Ana | Oct 12 , 2008 2:25:12 AM
I always find that spraying them with deoderant seems to do the trick .
The spray coats their body and they suffocate .
Not before doing a rather spectacular breakdance though .
You get the satisfaction of killing that annoying fly and a floor show !
Posted by : RedRider | Oct 4 , 2008 5:24:11 AM
Ha ..
I can't touch flies .

a better way without the mess is flicking them with your middle finger ( released from the thumb ) ... slowly ( without change of air / wind pressure ) , you can move in pretty close without having to scare them away .... one hard flick does the trick .

Ok the ways listed may work but the one I learned was to put one hand directly above the fly and with your other move it slowly toward the fly .
Then smack it with the hand over the fly .
I believe the reason this works is the fly focuses on the hand moving toward it it and misses the fast hand from above .
try it .

all you people that say why not just use a fly swatter .
the fly is n't going to what for u to find it is it and even if its beside u most the time the fly will come when its not .
they call it sods law
an other way to catch fly do n't dust for a wile so u get spiders and spiders webs and they will do it for you if u do n't like spiders wait till they have built the webs then catch them with a glass and a bit o paper / card coz their slightly easer to catch than a fly but then the webs will slowly fill up

Airsoft gun works well .
Fly vanishes , usually without even a skidmark .
Does n't leave dents in the walls , but it does ricochet and pop wife in butt .
CO2 fire extinguishers freeze flies .
They 'll fall to the ground completely motionless .
Then you can imprison them in a jar and have all sorts of fun , such as -
1 . Put the jar in the freezer for suspended animation .
You can bring them back to life by breathing on them to warm them up , or use a blowdryer if you 're not comfortable having your mouth that close to a fly .
2 . Fill sink with water .
Submerge jar and twist it open just a tad .
This will drown the fly .
Wait until it stops moving , then drain the water out of the jar .
Cover the fly with a mound of salt .
Watch the salt wick the water out of the fly , then bring it back to life .
3. Superglue dental floss to the butt of the fly .
Tie other end on your finger .
You now have a mini fly - kite , with no wind needed !
( this actually works better with junebugs and moths . )
4 . Freeze in water , break ice .
This will shatter the fly .
Allow ice to melt and try to superglue fly back together correctly .
5 . Find a spider web .
Throw fly in web .
Watch the show .
6. Construct larger wings for your new fly pet .
Make them out of paper , draw rockets and machine guns , then glue to fly wings .
Conquer small third world countries with new destructo - fly air force .
Works best with step 1 .
Post videos of maiden flight on youtube .
7 . Follow step 1 , take jar out of freezer right before going to fancy restaurant .
Get cheap or free food .
8. Convince paint store employee to place your jar in the paint shaker machine .
( try saving up a bunch of flies for this one )
9 . Seal fly in 12 " subwoofer box .
Play techno music .
10 . Observe effects of alcohol on fly .
Use eyedropper for administration .
Enjoy .

If you want to be ' true ' to the sport then you must add a sportsmanlike skill .
Catching them with the single handed swoop and throwing them at the floor can work really well and even a kid can do it after a little practice .
( personally I always like gasoline in a squirt gun for wasps , no need to lite it ) .
But for flys I take kitchen matches and imbed about a third of a sewing needle in the end .
On the other end I put a nice spitball ( toilet tissue works well for this ) sized just a little smaller than the straw I intend to use as my blowgun .
Just need to watch peripherially in the background for pets , brothers , sisters etc , etc .
But the final convulsions can be really entertaining and are usually performed exactly where you pin them .
This will work for wasps also but depending on your actual skill could be quite dangerous .

One of life 's mysteries ; we all know flies like poos .
Well i decided to try an experiment ; I ate a few flies and as expected a couple of days later out came a poo .
But why is it when i ate a poo a FLY did n't come out the other end ?

My friend lives in a house in the deep fly - infested countryside of East Sussex ( i actually think it 's the act of spreading manure on fields that attracts them , yum ) .
Anyway , he used these specially bought ' fly bags ' which he hung around the garden .
They contain this chemical solution flies just cannot get enough of and they will crawl down the funnel into this gloopy stuff where they find ( somewhat belatedly ) that there 's no return and they beome tired , heavy and eventually fall into this stuff and drown .
Each bag catches more than 500 flies and when it 's full there 's a great sense of morbid satisfaction .
Posted by : Mark Morris | Jun 23 , 2008 7:01:08 AM
Heres a good one
get a plastic syringe ( not a needle ! ) put a peice of playdough on the end where liquid squirts out then as hard as u can until the pushy part at the back comes out and the fly will explode it just like send a human to the moon withput a spaceship !
its very entertaining ! :)

This is the best way to get rid of FLIES , especially when you are CAMPING .
PLEASE USE EXTREME CAUTION , as these little buggers are POISINOUS .
The use of rubber kitchen gloves works the best .
STEP 1 . With gloves on , pick one large mushroom .
STEP 2 . Crush mushroom and put it into a quart jar with about a pint of milk .
STEP 3 . Place this under your camper where clidren cannot reach .
When you are ready to break camp , simply throw the lid on the jar and toss it in the garbage ...
This is a trick I learned while taking a NORTHERN MICHIGAN FALL MUSHROOM CLASS , my instructor was the daughter of MORT NEFF the founder of MICHIGAN OUTDOORS .

Rat Glue on flies :
Buy a can of rat glue .
Poke a small stick inside , preferably a bamboo skewer .
Roll up the glue to cover 3 /4 of the stick .
Then just poke the unglued end into a cork and let the glued part be exposed .
The glue is smelly , it attracts flies .
They come and lands on glue and gets stuck .
More flies come after seeing a fly already " enjoying " itself on the glue , they get stuck too .
The hilarious part is when the flies try to fly off ... they cud manage even a few inches away from the stick but the glue is stretched to a strand .. and the fly can only hover ..
End their misery by poking them in tethered flight with the lighted end of a cig .
Now is tat sick or what ?
Posted by : nick | Feb 13 , 2008 8:50:06 AM
If they 're on a flat surface , just throw some honey on them .
( It 's really cool to do this , because if you leave the honey out for a week or two , you 'll have a fly in amber . ;-) )

Take a spray bottle fill it with water and soap or whatever you have in your cabinet ( EVEN TABASCO SAUCE ) and their you have a fly death spray !
Posted by : boxmaster | Jan 13 , 2008 11:04:13 AM
used this technique when I was a kid back in India .
We didnt have fly swatters at that time .
One difference is that you need to keep your hand above , and a little in front of the head of the housefly .
The reason this works effectively is that houseflys can only take off straight ahead .
They can not take off backwards .
So , when they see danger , they take off into your waiting hands and get squashed !
Also , this works only on houseflys .
Also , you dont need any special technique to kill other flys .
They are too slow .
Houseflys are extremely fast , and hence this technique .

Flies are great for developing that super fast reflex flick you need to play baminton competitively .
Wasps are too slow but good practise in devoloping a strong tennis smash .

after a stinky dump , do n't flush to lure your fly into the bathroom .
after it's in there , don a gas mask , enter the bathroom , shut the door , and flush .
your fly is trapped and now you do n't have to chase it around the house .
now you can practice your aim with a big fat rubber band and fast flushing technique .
you may want to use an OSHA approved gas mask depending on what you had for dinner the night before .
not the recommended technique for families with small children and the elderly , or those with sensitive noses .
Posted by : kyle | Oct 10 , 2007 4:36:12 PM
I 've used the clap trick for decades with good results .
Another trick is to take a piece of clear Scotch tape about 5 inches long held between two hands .
Bring it down slowly to a fly sitting on a horizontal surface .
I guess they can't see it coming .
After making contact , rub gently and they will be permanently taped where they sat .
This can be used to keep from going nuts while on guard duty at night in the Army .
If you launch a rubber band hooked over the end of a pencil , that works good too .
You might discover that a fly can fly without it 's head attached .
I killed 945 flies one day while pulling KP in Germany .
I think I need help .

Furniture polish .... in spray cans kills wasps , bees and flies in seconds .
I tried it by accident years ago and found it is more effective then using commercial wasp sprays ...
the last time I used a wasp spray it took about 5 - 8 mins for the damn thing to die .
with the polish , as soon as it makes contact .. its pretty much dead .
it also stop them from flying about after u spray them , bcus the polish is thick and wet and sticks their wings to themselves .. or the floor , window etc etc .
I have no idea why it works so well , the polish must contain something really deadly to flying insects ( posibly the silicon content I dont know ) .
but next time u have a wasp in your room .. try it ... make sure u get close and give it a good coating untill its all sticky and cant move .
Remeber , ive only tied this with AREOSOl polishes , others may not work as well ... or not atall !

oh ya ; just to add for the hopelessly retarded ... you are supposed to remove the bottle cap from the bottle and throw it out .

Aug 4 , 2007 2:33:37 AM
here is one i invented for catching spiders or any other crawlers that have made it up to the cielings / walls
take a small plastic water bottle
cut off the top , where the neck just starts to get thin ( where the cylindrical shape ends )
turn the part you just cut off upside down and jam it back into the bottle -- creating a funnel
get some soap ( bar or liguid ) and coat the funnel part with it
make sure there is bit of water in the battle
Now the annoying thing about spiders is once you catch them in a container they can easily crawl out or once your trying to dump them out they use their web to stay inside .
With this device you just knock the spider into the funnel area , the soapy coating forces him to slide down the neck and into the bottle .
Because of the design he will always drop right in the middle of the bottle and cannot cling to any walls .
Because of the water in the bottom he is unable to make his way to any of the bottle 's walls to climb out .
Now you just take out the funnel piece and dump out the spider @ a location of your choosing with the water .
Since he is still floating he will be unable to use his web to prevent this .
Enjoy :P

Yesterday I used regular Windex and that worked okay .
Not all of the flies died right away .
I found some of the Foaming Windex and that works great .
It kills them almost immediately !!
Then I just vac. them up !!!
There are way to many to catch with my hands .

My brother - in - law has a variation .
Instead of clapping his hands , he scoops one hand a few inches above the fly and catches it .
Then he throws the fly against the ground .
Avoids the gooey mess on your hand - but probably should still wash them !
Posted by : Jake | Jun 15 , 2007 3:20:27 AM
I dont like the idea of squashed flies all over my hands , so I use TWO rolled up newspapers / magazines ( preferable from the recycling bin ) and approach the insect from behind .
Then holding the weapons about 6 " apart , strike from both sides simultaneously at an angle of about 45 degrees .
Works well and is also good for bugs that fight back ( Wasp and Hornets )
Never kill a bee , they make honey !
Posted by : Steve Blincoe | May 13 , 2007 9:06:29 AM
Killing a fly - this one never fails .
Most microwaves have a light inside , that turns on when you open the door .
That 's what you need .
Wait until it 's dark outside .
Turn off all the lights in the house ( very important ) .
Open the microwave door , so that the light comes on .
Wait until the fly enters the microwave ( does n't take more than a few seconds - it comes to the light ) .
Close the door , turn it on , wait for the " snap " sound .
Remove the cooked fly .

I was once cracking nuts for my mom with a small anvil and mini-hammer .
A fly landed on the anvil and I tried to whack it with the hammer .
I completely missed .
Much to my suprise , the ' DING ! ' was loud enough to completely kill it dead .
Not a mark on it , but it 's brains must have been completely SNAFU'd .
Laughed my ass off . :)

Windex works like bug spray on a housefly .
A few spritzes and they fall to the ground .
A few more and they die , and you can easily pick them up with a napkin or tissue .
Also great is turning a can of compressed air upside down so it shoots frost .
This is great for hard - to - catch centipedes .
Mind , they do unfreeze and start running again , so dispose of them quickly .
Posted by : Most | Mar 22 , 2007 12:09:58 PM
Nice ... been doing the " Hand Clap " for years , ( worked great in Africa during those long deployments )
I try not to kill the flys anymore , but this is no " catch and release " program , they go into the fish tank where the Chiclids get them , more like " catch and fillet "
Posted by : Pete | Mar 22 , 2007 11:57:31 AM
I used to kill flies just like that .
But the cost of the handsoap and chapping from continuous washing caused to to devise another method :
Cut a rubberband at one end .
Sneak up behind the fly and stretch the band as far as possible .
Take aim and let one end go !
No more fly and no need to get your hands wet !
DISCLAIMER : Not for the faint of heart , as some blood ( or whatever that stuff is that flows through a fly ) may appear where the fly once sat .
DO NOT attempt without adult supervision .
While aiming , always wear safety goggles and keep rubberband a safe distance away from eye : failure to do so may result in serious injury or blindness .
Posted by : Steve | Feb 25 , 2007 1:33:30 PM
During twilight , open your doors .
The flies are attracted to the hue at twilight and go outside .
Twilight resembles the effect of a black - light .
Its the time just before the sun sets .

Fly swat methods that works !!!
By using an industrial yet inexpensive water spray bottle [ you 'll find it at " home depot " ] you can kill a fly or at least bend their wings by shooting up thin jet stream about three feet apart but strong enough to put the bug on a state of chock before you pick it up with a tissue or paper .
-------------------------------------------------
I also use a small dab of shaving cream on a long end of a stick [ either a chinese stick or staright branch ] then carefully approach the fly right on above their head [ they can't see up their heads ] then quickly dab it the fly will stick to the foam then sling it in to either kitchen sink on runing water or toilet and watch the fly drown .
Posted by : Gunsmoke | Jan 16 , 2007 1:44:12 PM
Very interesting ways to kill flies .
I 've got a can spray just about everywhere for quick efficient killing .
Will definetly try the clap technique .
Also must add , that if you really hate flies , get a Praying Mantis as a pet .
Catch live flies and put in jar with Praying Mantis , watch as they catch the fly and start eating it alive !
Really fun to watch !
Posted by : Carike | Jan 2 , 2007 5:27:05 AM
You also have those electrified - tennis - racket - thingies .
Very humane and very fun .
Although bigger flies usually only get stunned , so you have to shock them a few times until they start smoking ( of course you can also get the smaller flies to smoke , but I tend to kill of bigger flies ) .

Stawberry Glade will also work on most creepy - crawlers .

Now , not only are you bug free , the house smells great !

To trap Fly at night , turn all the light off but one at night .
Fly attracted to light .
it will fly to that lighted room by itself .
The smaller the room the better .
I prefer bathroom , so the fly can be dispose by blousing it down the toilet
I kill it using rubber band .
It need precision but that my hutting sport .

ok , well my question is for this tecnique from mr glass , do you actually smack the fly with your hands when you clap , or is it just the sound of your hands clapping that shocks them ??
yes , this might work when you are at a restaurant and dont have anything else to swat it with , but at home ... they made the fly swatter for a reason .
lol .
there are people out there who CAN live with fly 's , i personally hate flies !!
for some reason i cannot have them buzzing near me .

" For killing wasps and other stinging insects :
Instead of swatting with a newspaper , then dodging as it dive - bombs you , spray it with hairspray .
As the hairspray dries , it freeze up their wings so they can't fly .
Then you can swat it . "
... It 's easier if you hold a lighter in front of the hairspray can .
We had a hornet 's nest underground next to our house siding when I was a kid .
I would swat the side of the house with newspaper , which would make them send out a wasp to investigate .
A little poof of flame would take em ' out one by one .
Eventually they send most of the hive all at once , which is hilarious to watch - they all have to come out of the same small opening at once , and meet their flaming death quickly .
I 'm sure they did n't suffer ... much .

Fill a jar half - way with water .

You 've just made a Fruit Fly trap .
Cover and shake occasionally to re-foam the top .

I 've been using the vacuum with a long hose attached to it to get rid of the flies .
It works but it gets tricky if they are in between the window panes .
It 's also hard to vacuum if the flies are all over the curtain .
I 've just tried spraying windex and it slowly makes the flies weak and evenrually will drop dead .
Then I vacuum .
I 've tried dishsoap and sugar solution and left it on the window sill and dozens of them just dive in .
But water in a bottle spray mixed with a few drops of dishwashing soap is a cheaper alternative .
Spray them on the window .
You 're also cleaning your windows at the same time .
BTW , I can never swat a fly with my bare hands though .
It is just gross .

Investment in factories has risen China has said it is on track to hit its growth target of 8 % this year , after the economy grew 8.9 % from a year ago in the third quarter .
The figure is up from the 7.9 % rate seen in the previous quarter and is the country 's fastest GDP growth since the third quarter of last year .
Separate reports show that industrial production and retail sales also accelerated in September .
The economy grew by 7.7 % in the nine months to September .
Retail sales growth was 15.1 % in the first three quarters of the year , the National Statistics Bureau said .
China 's car market has become the world 's largest , with sales up 34 % to 9.66 million vehicles in the first nine months of the year .
Government investment
At the end of 2008 the Chinese government announced a 4 trillion yuan ( $ 586bn ; £ 354bn ) stimulus plan involving increased spending on infrastructure , such as rail and roads , to boost the domestic economy as exports slumped .
Latest figures show that investment , accounting for nearly 88 % of GDP growth earlier this year , is playing a vital role in China 's growth .
Investment in factories , construction and other fixed assets rose by one - third in the first nine months of the year to a record 15.5tn yuan .
But factory owners say that in many cases , while the volume of goods they are producing has risen , the prices customers are prepared to pay for them are lower than before the financial crisis .
Unemployment is still high in many areas , and some factory workers are reported to be working shorter hours and earning less .
The next challenge for policy makers is to begin to withdraw elements of the stimulus plan , and to reduce the huge outflows of credit the country 's state owned banks have issued , without damaging economic recovery .
As the stimulus is withdrawn , the hope is that demand from the private sector , from consumer spending and eventually from renewed demand for China 's exports , will keep the country 's growth rate stable .

They feel like failures .
Disillusioned , like a runner who trips out of the starting gate .
But many college graduates who 've been forced by the worst job market in decades to move back home with Mom and Dad say they also feel , to their surprise , fortunate .
" I 've learned to be so grateful , " said Genevieve Isola , a University of California graduate who 's living in her childhood bedroom in San Ramon and working in a clothing boutique , just as she did in high school .
Isola , 23 , earned a sociology degree in 2008 from UC Santa Barbara , part of one of the world 's most prestigious university systems .
Like most people with a fresh diploma , she saw it as a hall pass to a career in her field .
She prowled Internet job sites in search of anything sociology sounding : social worker , youth mentor , classroom counselor .
" You 're propelled by all this energy and all this knowledge , " she said .
" It 's a force that ca n't be stopped . "
And then the realities of the recession do stop it , as in brick wall .
There are 7.2 million fewer jobs now than when the recession began two years ago , according to the U.S. Labor Department .
Unemployment has n't been this high in 26 years , with nearly 1 in 10 people out of work across the country .
More returning home
Most of them can't crawl back to the home of their youth , get a hug from long - suffering parents and be served a free hot meal night after night .
But plenty of new graduates can - and they 're doing it more often , according to a Foster City company called CollegeGrad.com .
They began asking graduates in 2006 if they had moved back home after school .
At that time , 67 percent of more than 2,000 respondents said yes .
This year it was 80 percent .
Though it 's a small sample size , the numbers support anecdotal evidence that as jobs become more scarce , graduates are returning home in greater numbers , said Adeola Ogunwole , who runs CollegeGrad.com .
" It strips away your self - esteem , " said Isola , who moved back home in February .
" We had this whole purpose , this idea that our education would benefit us and society - and all off a sudden , you 're sitting at home searching for a minimum wage job . "
The benefits of retail
At first she was angry .
Then it dawned on Isola that even working at a retail outfit in Walnut Creek has its upside .
She has responsibility , works face - to - face with people and , best of all , gets paid .
" It 's like a spiritual awakening , " she said .
Graduates from around the Bay Area say that while they would n't choose to mooch off their folks - though many contribute financially - they 've discovered unforeseen benefits : new career paths , the possibility of graduate school and a new appreciation for the people who raised them .
" I 've gotten to see my parents in a different light , " said Natalie Quave , 24 , who has a degree in English from Cal and now works two part - time jobs .
She 's been living in Richmond with her dad , who 's from Mississippi , and her mom , who was born in El Salvador .
" I grew up thinking that they were very strict and practical , " Quave said .
" But in living with them now , I realize how open - minded they are , and pretty adventurous .
My relationship with them improved . "
Viva Barrows , a 2007 Cal grad , had big dreams .
She expected to be hired by Promises Films in Berkeley where she interned , but the struggling documentary company was n't hiring .
So she looked elsewhere for a film job and got callbacks and interviews , then rejections .
Getting a master 's degree seemed the logical alternative , and she was accepted by a film school in Vancouver .
With the promise of a Sallie Mae loan for less than 10 percent , Barrows set out for British Columbia in June .
On the way , she got the loan documents by e-mail and read the fine print : a 13 percent rate - and variable .
" It would 've amounted to upwards of $ 100,000 , " Barrows said .
She turned the car around and , at 25 , moved back in with her father and stepmother in Oakland and became a waitress .
" I 'm giving myself six months , " she said .
" If I can't find a good job or a project worth sticking around town for , I 'm going to seek out somewhere else to start fresh .
And that could be anywhere in the whole world . "
Learning new lessons
Her stepmother , Victoria Shoemaker , said Viva 's plight has made for some interesting conversations .
" We 're talking about the state of the world , and the future as it relates to young people , " she said .
" From our perspective , we 're giving her space and time to let her figure out what she 's going to do next . "
Meanwhile , Barrows said she 's learned two important lessons :
It 's possible to make films on her own , and " never take a loan from Sallie Mae . "
It 's not just humanities graduates who are unable to support themselves .
Chris Passanisi took a double major in economics and political science from Sonoma State last year , and it got him nowhere but back home .
Now a " more grateful and humble " Passanisi said he 's going for his master of business administration .
Despite the hidden benefits of being back home , graduates say there 's no denying that the blow they 've been dealt by the recession hurts deeply .
" I expected to have an excellent job in a field that I was passionate about , in a top corporate architecture firm in New York City , " said Lisa Li , 22 , a graduate of the prestigious Pratt Institute in Manhattan .
Instead , she 's back in San Francisco sharing a bedroom with her 15 - year - old sister and helping her parents manage their rental properties .
" I feel like a failure , " Li admitted .
" From this experience , I learned to plan ahead and not to take what you see at face value . "
The level of poverty in America is even worse than first believed .
A revised formula for calculating medical costs and geographic variations show that approximately 47.4 million Americans last year lived in poverty , 7 million more than the government ’s official figure .
The disparity occurs because of differing formulas the Census Bureau and the National Academy of Science use for calculating the poverty rate .
The NAS formula shows the poverty rate to be at 15.8 percent , or nearly 1 in 6 Americans , according to calculations released this week .
That ’s higher than the 13.2 percent , or 39.8 million , figure made available recently under the original government formula .

That measure , created in 1955 , does not factor in rising medical care , transportation , child care or geographical variations in living costs .
Nor does it consider non-cash government aid when calculating income .
As a result , official figures released last month by Census may have overlooked millions of poor people , many of them 65 and older .
According to the revised NAS formula :
* About 18.7 percent of Americans 65 and older , or nearly 7.1 million , are in poverty compared to 9.7 percent , or 3.7 million , under the traditional measure .
That ’s due to out - of - pocket expenses from rising Medicare premiums , deductibles and a coverage gap in the prescription drug benefit .
* About 14.3 percent of people 18 to 64 , or 27 million , are in poverty , compared to 11.7 percent under the traditional measure .
Many of the additional poor are low - income , working people with transportation and child - care costs .
* Child poverty is lower , at about 17.9 percent , or roughly 13.3 million , compared to 19 percent under the traditional measure .
That ’s because single mothers and their children disproportionately receive non-cash aid such as food stamps .
* Poverty rates were higher for non-Hispanic whites ( 11 percent ) , Asians ( 17 percent ) and Hispanics ( 29 percent ) when compared to the traditional measure .
For blacks , poverty remained flat at 24.7 percent , due to the cushioning effect of non-cash aid .

* The Northeast and West saw bigger jumps in poverty , due largely to cities with higher costs of living such as New York , Boston , Los Angeles and San Francisco .

TODD BYERS was among more than 20,000 people running the San Francisco Marathon last month .
Dressed in shorts and a T - shirt , he might have blended in with the other runners , except for one glaring difference : he was barefoot .
Even in anything - goes San Francisco , his lack of footwear prompted curious stares .
His photo was snapped , and he heard one runner grumble , “ I just do n’t want the guy without shoes to beat me . ”
Mr. Byers , 46 , a running coach and event manager from Long Beach , Calif. , who clocked in at 4 hours 48 minutes , has run 75 marathons since 2004 in bare feet .
“ People are kind of weird about it , ” he shrugs .
Maybe they should n’t be .
Recent research suggests that for all their high - tech features , modern running shoes may not actually do much to improve a runner ’s performance or prevent injuries .
Some runners are convinced that they are better off with shoes that are little more than thin gloves for the feet  or with no shoes at all .
di Peter Gomez , da Il Fatto 18 ottobre 2009 C ’erano una volta le Iene , un gruppo di ragazzacci che osava ridere in faccia a Berlusconi , mostrare il razzismo della Lega e sbeffeggiare le leggi ad personam .
C’erano , ma non ci sono più .
Oggi la trasmissione diretta da Davide Parenti , coautore con Antonio Ricci degli show - cult degli anni 80 , è solo l’ombra del suo passato .
È in crisi di ascolti , di creatività .
E , quel che è peggio , è costretta a fermarsi persino davanti a onorevoli di seconda fila , come Gabriella Carlucci .
È successo marted ì scorso quando , dopo una serie di telefonate con i vertici Mediaset , non è andato in onda un servizio che raccontava come l’ex conduttrice fosse stata condannata a pagare 10 mila euro di stipendio arretrato alla sua portaborse parlamentare .
Stessa sorte era toccata , un mese fa , a un pezzo sull ’immigrazione che metteva in imbarazzo il ministro Roberto Maroni .
Per questo , Fedele Confalonieri e Silvio Berlusconi , che fino a ieri citavano le Iene e Enrico Mentana come la prova della libertà di mediaset , oggi parlano d’altro .
Le foglie di fico non servono più .
Il regime non si nasconde per farsi accettare , ma in televisione mostra il volto peggiore per far paura .
I tempi , insomma , sono cambiati .
Anche nel 2001 il premier era sotto processo per corruzione .
Anche allora c’era un giornalista che pedinava un magistrato considerato nemico del gruppo .
Era la Iena Alessandro Sortino .
Ma non seguiva Ilda Boccassini , per mostrare le sue calze o per insinuare che fosse “ strana ” .
Lo faceva per dimostrare che era indifesa e per criticare la scelta del Governo di togliere la scorta a un pm antimafia che aveva osato mettersi contro Berlusconi .
Cose di un altro mondo .
Allora i vertici mediaset tolleravano che il solito Sortino inchiodasse il senatore Cirami all ’omonima legge ad personam o il ministro Lunardi al suo conflitto d’interessi .
Adesso è più probabile vedere una Iena sulla luna che davanti al ministro Angelino Alfano per parlare del suo Lodo .
Anche allora Berlusconi inondava l’Italia di propaganda , ma il Trio Medusa osava chiedergli conto del celebre “ Presidente operaio ” , per poi ridergli in faccia .
Anche allora l’onorevole Carlucci ebbe un corpo a corpo con il Trio .
Ma quello andò in onda .
Come si è arrivati a questo punto ?
Per capirlo bisogna ricostruire l’escalation delle censure , partendo dalla prima .
Quella subita dal programma nel 2001 , quando Marco Tronchetti Provera , per fare un favore a Berlusconi , soffoca nella culla “ La 7 ” che minaccia di danneggiare gli ascolti di Mediaset .
Le Iene riprendono Tronchetti mentre balbetta improbabile giustificazioni .
Il pezzo però viene fermato .
In redazione si mugugna , ma si decide di lasciar correre .
Così la situazione peggiora .
Tanto che , quattro anni dopo , si arriva a una silenziosa protesta .
Quando a essere bloccato è un servizio su Francesco Storace , le Iene si riuniscono a Roma e stipulano una sorta di patto : non diciamo niente , ma questa è l’ultima censura .
Era invece l’’ inizio della fine .
Oggi il Trio Medusa e Sortino non ci sono più .
Alla Iena rossa , nel 2007 , i vertici Mediaset avevano cancellato un servizio su Mastella e lui se ne è andato .
Confalonieri , infatti , non ha voluto sentir ragioni nonostante che proprio Sortino fosse stato diffamato dal figlio di Mastella con false insinuazioni sulla sua carriera .
A Segrate , del resto , Mastella è un intoccabile .
Lo sa anche Enrico Lucci che , già prima di Sortino , ha dovuto ingoiare la censura di un pezzo sul medesimo politico .
Il perché lo dice la cronaca .
Mastella in quei mesi stoppa la legge Gentiloni sulle tv e poi fa cadere il governo Prodi .
Una scelta politica , ovviamente .
La decisione di un uomo , oggi eurodeputato Pdl , che dice con orgoglio : “ Confalonieri ? È uno dei miei migliori amici ” .
E chi trova un amico ( di Confalonieri ) trova un tesoro .
Anche alle Iene . ( 19 ottobre 2009 )

National Highway Traffic Safety Administration statistics show that the following were five of the most frequently reported fatal bike - vehicle accidents from 2004 through 2008 .
Here , our urban cycling experts outline the best ways to avoid them -- and offer some other safety tips besides .
Oblivious at the wheel
Situation :
At a traffic light or stop sign , the driver obeys the traffic signal but fails to yield to you , the bicyclist .
Strategy :
Do n’t assume the driver will yield , even if you have the right of way .
If it ’s your turn to proceed at the stop sign , try to make eye contact with the motorist before you move into the intersection .
If in doubt , proceed as if you have n’t been seen .
The left cross
Situation : A motorist traveling in the opposite direction turns left directly into your path .
Strategy : Slow down as you approach an intersection , and try to make eye contact with drivers who might turn into your path .
Try to anticipate their actions and be ready to take evasive maneuvers .
If the car turns into your path , turn with them , in the same direction .
The right hook
Situation : A motorist passes you from behind , then slows and makes a right - hand turn directly in front of you .
Strategy :
If there ’s a right - hand turn lane and you ’re going straight , position yourself in a visible spot in the through - traffic lane .
When approaching the intersection , line yourself up in the center of the lane or in queue behind any cars already present so that the car behind you ca n’t pull up to your left and then make a right turn without seeing you .
Pulling up to the right side of a stopped car may place you in its blind spot .
The chancy break
Situation :
At an intersection , you try to beat a car that has the right of way , perhaps to avoid making a complete stop .
Strategy : Do n’t take chances .
Obey traffic signs and , when in doubt , yield to the motorist .
You will never win a battle against a massive hunk of steel .
The driveway exit
Situation : Vehicle exits from a driveway , alley or other mid-block location and pulls out in front of you .
Strategy : Keep a vigilant eye on side traffic and position yourself in a visible part of the lane , not so far to the right that parked cars obscure a driver ’s ability to see you .
Here are other some tips to help you stay safe on the road .
Be visible : Wear bright clothing and ride in motorists ’ line of sight , says Liz Elliott , executive director of Cyclists Inciting Change thru Live Exchange ( CICLE ) .
Always use a front and rear light at night .
Ride predictably : Never weave in and out of cars or make sudden moves .
Use hand signals to indicate your intentions to motorists , advises Ron Durgin , who teaches bike safety courses for the League of American Bicyclists .
“ Sometimes I ’ll hear a motor revving behind me and when I signal that I ’m making a right turn , I can hear the motor calming . ”
Claim your space : Ride too far to the right and you blend into the surroundings .
You also put yourself in the risky debris and gutter zone .
If the lane is 13 feet wide or narrower , it ’s generally not shareable , Durgin says , and you ’re best off claiming your legal right to the entire lane .
“ If you give cars the space , the average driver will take it and then you get squeezed , ” he says .
Make eye contact :
Never assume the motorist sees you .
Even if you ’re in the line of sight , the driver may not register you , Elliott says .
Look for a nod or glance that indicates that you ’ve been seen .
Be wary of parked cars :
Ride the distance of a door - length from parked cars and be on the lookout for people inside them , says attorney Bob Mionske , a former Olympic cyclist and author of “ Bicycling and the Law : Your Rights as a Cyclist . ”
Bicyclists have been killed by car doors swinging open .
Also look out for parked cars suddenly pulling out into the lane .
Obey traffic laws : “ Bicycles have all the rights -- and responsibilities -- of any other vehicle , ” Mionske says .
That means no running stop lights .
Ignoring laws could result in a ticket and may also aggravate sentiment against bicyclists .
Ride with , never against , traffic :
By law , bicycles are vehicles just like any other and must be operated as such .
Ride against traffic and you increase your risk of a head - on collision , especially because motorists do n’t expect bicycles coming the wrong way , Mionske says .
Wear a helmet and consider using a rear view mirror : A helmet wo n’t prevent an accident , but can save your life in a crash .
If you ’re not comfortable holding a straight line while looking behind you , consider purchasing a rear view mirror to attach to your helmet , Elliott says .
Avoid escalation : Never antagonize motorists , even if they act aggressively .
Escalation only increases your risk of injury .
When it ’s you versus 4,000 pounds of steel , the odds are against you , no matter how right you are .
“ Keep your finger where it belongs : on your handlebars , ” Mionske writes in “ Bicycling and the Law . ”
“ If you absolutely must use your finger , use it to dial the police . ”
Plan your route : Look for back roads and side streets that will get you to your destination without navigating major intersections .
You ’ll avoid traffic and noise , and often the back roads will get you there just as fast as the congested main roads will , Elliott says .

The mother of a 13 - year - old Dutch girl says she does n't support her daughter 's bid to become the youngest person to sail solo around the world .
Babs Muller told the Dutch daily newspaper Volkskrant that she had kept quiet on the issue until now because her daughter , Laura Dekker , had threatened not to see her again if she tried to foil the trip .
" If it were up to me , Laura would n't go , " Muller said in an interview .
" She can sail like the devil ; that 's not the problem , … [ but she ] is not yet grown up . "
On Aug. 28 , a Dutch court granted the state temporary custody of the girl to delay her voyage .
Dekker had planned to start her trip this month and to take two years to circumnavigate the world on an eight - metre boat named Guppy .
The Utrecht District Court ordered state child care authorities to take responsibility of Dekker for two months while she undergoes an assessment by a child psychologist .
Dekker 's German mother , who lives in the Netherlands , divorced the girl 's Dutch father , Dick , when Laura was six years old .
The girl lives full time with her father .
Until Saturday , it had appeared that both parents supported the girl 's ambitions , but Muller said that is not the case .
" It breaks my heart that I may lose contact with her , " she said .
" I have never had to take such a difficult decision … but I would rather [ have ] a living daughter that I did not see than a dead one . "
The Dutch court will issue a second ruling Oct. 26 on whether to extend the Council for Child Protection 's responsibility for the teenager , who will have celebrated her 14th birthday by then .
Python scripting in gdb 7.0 kicks total ass .
Today I played around with one cool usecase for it : Remote debugging .
I do n’t know how many times I have tried to help someone debug over irc , with the person cutting and pasteing gdb commands and results into xchat .
Well , no more !
Today I hacked up a gdb python script and an xchat python script that lets you export a gdb session over irc :
From gdb :
( gdb ) source gdb- server .py gdb irc server , Waiting for connection on / tmp/ gdb - socket - 500
In xchat :
> /load ~/xchat-gdb.py
Loaded xchat - gdb > / join #test > / gdb connect connecting to gdb ... connected !
Loggin in as another user on irc :
> / join # test > alex : gdb print " yey " < alex > $ 6 = " yey " > alex : gdb bt 2 < alex > # 0 0x00000035010d50d3 in *__GI___poll ( fds= < value optimized out > , nfds= < value optimized out > , timeout = - 1 ) at ..
+/sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/poll.c:87 < alex > # 1 0x00007 ffff52f96cc in g_main_context_poll ( n_fds= < value optimized out > , fds= < value optimized out > , + priority = < value optimized out > , timeout= < value optimized out > , context= < value optimized out > ) at gmain .
c:2904
Obviously this is kinda unsafe as you can do all sorts of things via gdb .
It needs to be able to limit who can control your gdb instance , and you should only give such permissions to people you trust .
Git repo here , have fun with it .
HONOLULU - Hawaii regulators have approved a Honolulu company 's plan to build the nation 's first tuna farm in waters off the Big Island .
Hawaii Oceanic
Technology aims to create an environmentally friendly open ocean farm for bigeye tuna , a favorite source for sushi and sashimi that 's overfished in the wild .
The state Board of Land and Natural Resources voted 4 - to - 1 Friday to give Hawaii Oceanic permission to install three large underwater cages for the tuna .
But the board is requiring the company to return for permission to build an additional nine cages once it has demonstrated the idea works .
Critics of the company 's plan say they 're worried about diseased farm fish escaping and contaminating wild stocks , and other potential negative affects on the environment .
IMAGINE taking a Nintendo 64 game and getting it to play on a Wii .
That technological task gives an idea of what the staff at Pixar Animation Studios faced in converting 1995 ’s “ Toy Story , ” Disney ’s first entirely computer - animated feature , and its 1999 sequel into 3 - D .
The double feature of “ Toy Story ” and “ Toy Story 2 , ” which was released on Friday , not only offers another generation of children the chance to see both films in theaters .
It also , conveniently , helps prime the promotional pump for next summer ’s “ Toy Story 3 . ” For Pixar and its owner , the Walt Disney Company ( another new development since the originals appeared ) , 3 - D innovation means the films can be seen as they should have been all along .
“ I ’ve always been thinking in three dimensions , ever since I started working with computer animation in the early ’ 80s , ” said John Lasseter , chief creative officer of Pixar and Disney Animation Studios and the director of “ Toy Story ” and “ Toy Story 2 . ”
“ Within the computer , we ’ve created truly three - dimensional environments .
We ’ve only looked at them with one camera .
Therefore it ’s a two - dimensional view of that three - dimensional world . ”
The production process for a 3 - D movie requires the use of two cameras , positioned next to each other , shooting action at the same time to mimic each of the viewer ’s eyes .
A live - action film not originally shot with two cameras cannot be made into a 3 - D film , but in the more malleable world of computer animation , the second camera view can be added .
The process involves a bit of virtual time travel .
Edward Cahn , the attorney appointed as Chapter 11 trustee to take over for SCO management , has filed a bond , a requirement under bankruptcy law , and sent notices to the largest SCO creditors and all the attorneys who have ever appeared that in the future all legal notices are to be sent to his attorney .
One such notice was sent to SCO 's bankruptcy attorneys .
Filing the bond is one of the normal things that happens -- the trustee has authority to act as management , after all , and that means money , and any time money is in the picture and a new stranger walks in to run a company , appointed by the US Trustee 's Office , which is part of the DOJ , they want some guarantee that he wo n't fly to Rio with the cash , and that if he does , the replacement money is already in hand in case someone sues over his decisions and actions .
Hey .
It happens .
The bond is returned when he faithfully has fulfilled his responsibilities , and no , he 's not responsible for anything SCO did or does , just his actions .
Money clouds people 's thinking , my mom told me .
" It creates conflicts , " is the way she put it .
And the SCO saga is nothing if not a monument to the accuracy of her assessment .
And what if the old SCOfolk do n't like the way he runs the company ?
You think that 's possible ?
Might they sue ?
Is the sky blue ?
The book , Reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code by Richard F. Brooud puts it like this :
The trustee displaces previous management of the debtor and is essentially both the chief operating officer and the chief executive officer of a corporate debtor .
The debtor continues to exist and has certain limited powers , including the power to file a plan .
The trustee and the debtor are " separate and distinct entities . "
It has been said that the fiduciary duties of a trustee are to the estate , not to the debtor .
Indeed , the Supreme Court has held that a trustee in bankruptcy has the power to waive a corporation 's attorney - client privilege .
Yummy .
His duty is to the estate , not the debtor .
And waiving the attorney - client privilege sounds like a grand idea .
Here 's what I 'd ask if I were the Chapter 11 trustee .
I 'd ask them about Microsoft 's role in all this , and I 'd ask the ex-Novell guys who swore up and down that the copyrights were supposed to transfer what , if anything , they will get out of it if SCO hits the litigation lottery .
Are there any oral agreements , like in the Canopy deal ?
How long ago did the idea to sue IBM over Linux first get mentioned ?
And why does SCO owe money to the creditors Maureen O'Gara , Alok Mohan , and a private detective ?
What was that money owed for ?
Wisely spent ?
Incidentally , that 's where Darl McBride 's brother Kevin works now , someone posted anonymously here last week : Kevin McBride is a member of the California and Utah Bars .
He holds a JD degree and BA degree in Economics , magna cum laude , from the University of Utah .
After 15 years of civil litigation experience , Mr. McBride moved to a strategic intelligence advisory role with Wayne Black & Associates , assisting corporations and individuals involved in financial litigation , asset recovery and private investigative matters .
Mr. McBride has extensive experience in document analysis and witness interviews related to complex financial and corporate matters .
He owns and operates a sophisticated document data center and analysis tools rarely matched by investigative agencies or law firms of any size .
He has had extensive experience managing electronic discovery in complex financial cases .
When document - intensive cases or investigations are at issue , McBride enables investigative , legal and expert witness teams to effectively collaborate in remote - access document investigation , analysis and sharing .
Mr. McBride is also trained in CQB techniques and assault team tactics .
Residing in the Los Angeles area , he has traveled throughout much of the Middle East and maintains contacts in those areas .
J. Gordon Liddy is associated with the firm also .
Speaking of money , how much exactly did Boies Schiller get paid ?
Grand total .
Not the ridiculously low figure they gave the bankruptcy court for the year prior to bankruptcy , but from 2002 onward .
What is the grand total ?
After all , the trustee 's job is to ascertain why the bankruptcy happened .
What were they told to achieve ?
Did they warn SCO at any point that going forward could lead to bankruptcy ?
We at Groklaw tried in 2007 to figure out what the total figure was -- $ 26 million ?
57 ? -- but in the end , we gave up , because there were pieces missing , like what they were paid in 2002 and who got what from the reimbursed expenses , since the attorneys were pooled under one of the retainers , at least , and Boies Schiller distributed .
I never published the article as a result , but I 'll let you see our rough draft now , because the raw data is still of some use , perhaps , even if we could n't make sense of it firmly in the end .
So remember , it 's just for that purpose .
I can't say how much they were paid .
But surely at some point someone had to notice that there was a lot of money going out and not much coming in .
Did the lawyers ever suggest cutting bait and quitting ?
If not , why not ?
What do they get out of it if SCO is sold off ?
What was SCO 's long term business plan ?
No. Really .
I 'd like to ask the investors some questions too .
Who first thought up the idea to sue over Linux ?
When ?
If it was supposed to be about copyrights , why was there no attempt by SCO to file for copyright registrations prior to beginning the litigation strategy ?
If the idea of suing first hit in 2002 , prior to setting up the stock sales plans for SCO insiders allegedly in January of 2003 , I 'd think the trustee would be interested in that .
No one seems to have sold in 2002 , but in March 2003 , it began , four days after SCO sued IBM .
How much have insiders made from this saga so far ?
Since Caldera / SCO
Group never made money as a company , other than the Sun and Microsoft license quarters , what exactly was the business plan ?
For the company , I mean , not management .
For example , since Caldera began as a Linux company , and it stopped offering Linux allegedly until matters could be resolved and offered a SCOSource license to those who wanted to keep running Linux , what was the business plan behind SCO 's offer of financial incentives for migration plans from Linux to Microsoft or any proprietary software in 2003 ?
In the coming months , SCO intends to expand the licensing program to include migration options for those end users who may be looking for alternatives to Linux .
Over the past several months , SCO has had discussions with several major companies for the purpose of bolstering SCOs intellectual property licensing and migration initiative . "
I 'd love to hear the numbers behind that idea .
How would that pay off for a Linux company ?
For that matter , for a Unix company , if folks migrated to Microsoft ?
Computer Business Review explicitly mentioned Microsoft : SCO would probably provide customers with financial incentives and discounts to migrate to SCO Unix , other vendors '
Unix , and what he referred to as " other proprietary operating systems " but probably Windows .
" We are offering a migration path to other operating systems that have a stronger IP basis than Linux , " the spokesperson said .
Incentives will be offered ' in the coming months .
Someone should crunch those numbers .
What was the plan , and how would SCO benefit out of it ?
I mean , how does a Linux company benefit from paying Linux users to stop using Linux ?
Does that mean SCO * never * intended for the allegedly infringing code to be removed ?
That it never intended to fix the problem or let anyone else fix it ?
Is n't that what SCOsource means , if you think deeply about it ?
And what other companies was SCO talking to about this ?
What did they offer SCO , if anything ?
And what was the ultimate goal ?
To kill off Linux or to get paid from never allowing an alleged infringement to be removed ?
Did the lawyers tell SCO that could work ?
What case or cases were they relying on that would allow SCO to charge for alleged copyright infringement -- not patent infringement -- on an ongoing basis , instead of telling what the code allegedly was and letting it be removed , with perhaps damages for past infringement ?
Remember that SCO asked for an injunction against AutoZone , to shut down their use of Linux , without ever saying where the allegedly infringed code was .
So what was the legal underpinning to that ?
I 'd love to be the Chapter 11 trustee .
Would n't you ?
You can probably think up even more questions you 'd like to ask .
Be my guest .
Here are the filings :
09/11/2009 - 911 - Bond ( Notice of Filing of Bond ) Filed by United States Trustee .
( Attachments : # 1 Exhibit A -- Copy of Bond # 2 Certificate of Service ) ( McMahon Jr. , Joseph ) ( Entered : 09/11/2009 )
You may notice that the statute says the bond should be filed within five days .
However , it also says that the US Trustee 's Office figures out what the bond should be , so if they take some time figuring out what the amount should be , then you can't file your bond until you have a sum certain .
How would you like to have to figure out a bond in a fact pattern like this one ?
Update :
If you would like to see what a Chapter 11 trustee report looks like , here are some to give you the flavor .
ALBANY , Ohio / WEST PALM BEACH , Florida ( Reuters ) - Within weeks of taking office , U.S. President Barack Obama rode to the rescue of homeowners resigned to financial ruin .

Obama , grappling with the worst U.S. housing crisis since the Great Depression , pledged to help as many as 9 million families keep their homes by reworking their mortgages .
Eight months later , the plan is plagued by delays , red tape and , some critics say , a reluctance by banks to do their part .
Just 17 percent of eligible borrowers have had their loans modified and monthly payments cut .
Hardly any have been given a cut in the amount they owe on homes which are now worth less .
That means many successful applicants are left with loans that they still will not be able to afford in the long run .
So instead of resolving the housing crisis that pushed the U.S. economy into recession , America may be prolonging it and , in the process , stunting the global recovery .
“ Every single policy we ’ve seen has merely kicked the problem down the road , ” said Laurie Goodman , a veteran analyst at broker - dealer Amherst Securities Group LP , which specializes in residential mortgage - backed securities .
“ But there is no easy solution to the underlying problems . ”
For homeowners like Jeff Latta , there was no help at all .
Latta , a 53 year - old retiree , pays $ 1,600 in monthly home payments that eat up 93 percent of his pension and he struggles to make child support payments .
To help pay his mortgage , Latta has slashed his bills by hunting for food in the wooded hills around his town of Albany in southern Ohio , and growing his own vegetables .
He has resorted to selling pumpkins and firewood to make cash .
In March , Latta heard about Obama ’s Home Affordable Modification Program , or HAMP , that allows mortgage payments to be reduced to 31 percent of a homeowner ’s income .
The plan was launched as a central plank of Washington ’s efforts to stem foreclosures .
Latta applied for a loan modification but was rejected .
His bank said his income from selling pumpkins and firewood -- a net of $ 906 in 2008 -- was too high .
“ Frankly , I ’m disappointed , ” Latta said .
“ I thought I would qualify as I am at high risk of default . ”
Foreclosure prevention advocate Bryce Burton at Ohio Housing Finance Agency said Latta ’s bank miscalculated his income .
“ Jeff is a shining example of someone doing everything they should be to keep their house , ” Burton said .
Nonprofit agencies say HAMP helps combat foreclosure but success varies from lender to lender .
Mortgage servicing companies , which service but do not own loans , complain that excessive bureaucracy slows the process .
HOME VALUES DROP $ 4.7 TRILLION
That banks lent irresponsibly in the U.S. property boom is irrefutable .
As San Diego - based realtor Steve Rodgers says : “ If you could fog a mirror , they ’d give you a mortgage . ”
But borrowers are facing blame too for using their homes as machines to raise cash and consume on credit .
The bubble burst in early 2007 and America went into recession later that year .
From the market ’s peak in 2005 to the second quarter of 2009 , U.S. home equity fell 37 percent , or by $ 4.7 trillion , according to the Federal Reserve .
To put that into context , China ’s economic output totaled about $ 4.3 trillion in 2008 .
There have been recent signs the housing market may be bottoming .
But rising unemployment and “ shadow inventory ” -- homes that banks have yet to foreclose on -- raise the prospect of further price declines .
Between July 2007 and August 2009 there were more than 7 million foreclosure filings , according to RealtyTrac , out of a total of 111 million households in the United States .
To stem the tide Obama launched HAMP , a $ 75 billion plan offering cash incentives to servicers to cut payments for distressed borrowers with most of the money coming from the $ 700 billion bank rescue program Congress approved last year .
But companies like subprime mortgage servicer Ocwen Financial Corp complain they have been inundated with borrowers who simply have no chance of qualifying for HAMP .
“ I think there is a sense publicly ... ( that ) everybody will be eligible for this program , ” said president Ron Faris at Ocwen headquarters in West Palm Beach , Florida .
Slideshow ( 9 images )
“ What we are finding is probably at this point , unfortunately , less than one in three borrowers that has applied is actually eligible under the government guidelines . ”
Margery Rotundo , a senior vice president at Ocwen , worried about the consequences of most HAMP applicants being rejected by servicing companies , saying it might produce “ a tidal wave of foreclosures . ”
The U.S. Treasury Department said on October 8 that under HAMP more than 500,000 people so far had their payments cut , slightly under 17 percent of those deemed eligible , ahead of the department ’s November 1 deadline for reaching that number .
But Treasury officials concede that even if HAMP is a success , millions more foreclosures remain likely .
LAWSUITS PENDING
One of the big obstacles in the government ’s modification program has been the sheer workload .
“ No one , including Treasury , had any concept of how much work this was going to be in getting these documents from borrowers , ” said Gregory Hebner , head of Irvine , California - based MOS Group Inc which handles loss mitigation for some servicers .
Nonprofit groups also have complaints about the government ’s program , and others independent of it .
Counselors recount tales of lenders losing documents or of difficulty reaching bank staff .
“ A client of mine was kept on hold for an hour and a half and transferred 17 times , ” said Michelle Watts , an OHFA foreclosure prevention advocate .
“ Some people just give up . ”
Ohio Attorney General Richard Cordray filed a lawsuit in July against a large mortgage servicing firm , Carrington Mortgage Services , alleging it had failed to make good faith efforts to stem foreclosures , and he warned more could follow .
“ We ’d rather not sue everyone , but we will if we have to , ” Cordray said .
Another problem is the number of borrowers who re-default on their modified loans .
The U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency says 56.2 percent of loans modified in the second quarter of 2008 re-defaulted after 12 months .
According to Amherst Securities , an even higher 70 percent of homeowners re-default within 12 months of a modification -- but it stresses its data does not include HAMP modifications .
On October 9 , a day after the Treasury announced HAMP was ahead of target , the Congressional Oversight Panel issued a scathing report on the program .
It found fewer than half of the predicted foreclosures would be avoided under HAMP .
Furthermore , many modifications added to the principle owed by homeowners at the end of their mortgages even as the market value of their homes fell , “ a factor that appears to be associated ” with higher re-default rates , the report said .
Some nonprofit groups say the high re-default rate is because many homeowners lack counseling on budgeting .
Mark Seifert , head of nonprofit agency Empowering and Strengthening Ohio ’s People said his group ’s re-default rate is around 30 percent because counselors help homeowners cut their budgets to keep their homes .
This may involve not eating out and cutting all non-essential items .
For all the problems , many nonprofit groups say HAMP has led to more successful loan modification applications .
“ HAMP has given us another tool in our toolbox , ” said Melinda Opperman , vice president of counseling group Springboard in Riverside , California .
“ Before we could help three to four people out of 10 .
Now it ’s five to seven . ”
Emergency talks will take place with postal workers today to avert a national strike that would halt deliveries of 75 million letters and parcels daily , cost tens of millions of pounds and accelerate the loss of corporate business that imperils the Royal Mail 's long - term future .
Unless a deal can be done in the next 24 hours , the Communication Workers Union ( CWU ) plans to call out all its 121,000 postal members at sorting and delivery offices in an escalating dispute over modernisation .
A stoppage – which would halt deliveries to 28 million homes and pile pressure on retailers in the run-up to Christmas – could take place seven days later .
There was speculation yesterday it could be called for 22 October .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
In the latest of a series of local strikes following stoppages in Bristol , Essex , Birmingham , Leeds and Edinburgh , all post will be halted in London today .
A business group , the Centre for Economic and Business Research , warned that a national strike lasting five days would cost the country £ 1.5 bn .
The Government warned it posed an even sterner test – to the very future of the postal service .
The Business Secretary Lord Mandelson , who was forced to abandon part - privatisation of Royal Mail in July , said : " It would be a suicidal act – turning more hard - pressed consumers and businesses away from using mail .
The Government has backed Royal Mail financially with billions of pounds so that the company can modernise , but these strikes will impede that essential process ... they are not the way to safeguard the future of our postal services . "
Royal Mail 's finances are haemorrhaging due to the rise of the internet and increased competition , which has seen its grip on the postal system loosened by rivals such as UK Mail and Dutch - owned TNT .
Some of Britain 's biggest retailers , Tesco , John Lewis , Amazon and Play.com , have already announced they are considering switching to competitors in the run-up to Christmas .
The Department store chain House of Fraser dropped Royal Mail last week .
Last week , CWU announced that three - quarters of its members who voted were in favour of taking strike action in a row over pay , jobs , conditions and alleged bullying and harassment .
Yesterday a " peace offer " from the CWU appeared to leave the two sides further apart than ever .
The union offered to halt the action if Royal Mail agreed changes to working conditions for the next three years and provided a new " benefits package " for staff carrying out modernisation .
Dave Ward , the CWU 's deputy general secretary , said : " Postal workers do not want to take strike action but neither are they prepared to put up with continuing attacks from a management which is failing .
We have written to Royal Mail making it clear that the CWU is ready to issue notice for a national strike as voted for by three - quarters of postal workers .
We have offered what we believe is a genuine alternative to reach a lasting agreement . "
In an open letter last night , Royal Mail 's managing director , Mark Higson , told Mr Ward : " What you describe as the ' CWU peace offer ' does seem to be the opposite – it reads like a list of fresh demands against Royal Mail .
This is hardly consistent with your description of it as a way of resolving this dispute peacefully . "

At the heart of the dispute are changes designed to improve the efficiency of Royal Mail 's 141,000 delivery workers , 20,000 of whom are not in the CWU .
Under a deal two years ago , the union agreed to a rolling programme of changes but some have been unpopular , with staff also experiencing a pay freeze .
They are being asked to work harder and in different roles , for example , delivery drivers helping out with sorting if they finish earlier than the end of their shift .
Royal Mail is asking delivery postman to deliver to extra streets during the summer and to work to revised delivery routes generated by computers .
Both sides agree modernisation is necessary to secure the future of Royal Mail , founded by Charles I in 1635 .
Although operating profits doubled to £ 321 m in the year to April , this financial year it is forecasting a 10 per cent drop in post due to the recession and the rise of electronic communication , at a cost of £ 700 m .
Its pensions deficit has doubled to £ 6.8bn , and competition is crumbling its customer base .
Plans to sell off part of the network with the aim of driving up efficiency was halted in July , ostensibly because of the difficulty in obtaining a good price in the recession .
However political commentators blamed opposition from 140 Labour backbenchers at a turbulent time for the Prime Minister .
Gordon Brown 's spokesman said : " Obviously it is a difficult situation and what Pat McFadden [ the Postal Affairs minister ] is trying to do is keep in touch with the appropriate unions – he met the CWU yesterday – and the management of the business . "
Asking for the conciliation service ACAS to be called in , Robert Hammond , post expert at Consumer Focus , said : " It 's hugely disappointing to watch a great UK institution tear itself apart .
A prolonged strike over Christmas could cripple the service .
The bottom line is that there are no winners in this dispute .
Royal Mail customers are already finding alternative ways of communicating and many will not return once the dispute is over . "
The state of Royal Mail today ...
Royal Mail Group is the business – 100 per cent owned by the state – which runs the Post Office network , the letter delivery service Royal Mail and the delivery / courier company Parcelforce .
Delivery
Daily collections are made from 113,000 post boxes , 14,300 post office branches and 87,000 businesses .
Letters and parcels pass through 70 mail centres , eight regional distribution centres ( for customer - sorted mail ) and 3,000 delivery offices .
There are 141,000 postal workers .
To deliver the mail , they drive 30,000 red vehicles and ride 33,000 bicycles .
Performance
The industry regulator Postcomm stipulates that Royal Mail must deliver 93 per cent of first - class letters by the next day and 98.5 per cent of second - class letters within three days .
In the first quarter of 2009 - 10 , Royal Mail beat these targets , hitting 94.5 per cent and 98.9 per cent for first and second - class post respectively .
99.61 per cent of mail was delivered correctly , above the target of 99.5 per cent .
There were 1,321,320 complaints about Royal Mail last year about lost , damaged or delayed post , with £ 13 m in compensation paid .
Finances
In 2008 - 09 , Royal Mail Group made an operating profit of £ 321 m , twice the previous year 's total of £ 162 m .
Its letters division moved from a £ 3 m loss in 2007 - 08 to a £ 58 m profit , despite a 5 per cent fall in the amount of mail delivered .
Overall , the group 's revenue increased by 2 per cent to £ 9.56 bn .
However , the business faces three big problems : increased competition from rivals ; a pensions deficit which has doubled to £ 6.8bn ; and a forecast 10 per cent drop in revenue this year .
The increase in email use is expected to cut mail delivery revenues by £ 700m .
All of the group 's business areas are open to competition .
Rival operators collect letters and parcels from companies , sort them and take them to Royal Mail for delivery over the last mile .
Royal Mail currently has a 60 per cent share of the business post collection .
... and the anatomy of the dispute
2007 Pay and Modernisation agreement
Royal Mail and the Communications Workers ' Union both agree on the need for improvement to the postal service .
The dispute , however , centres on the ongoing implementation of the Pay and Modernisation Agreement .
Royal Mail says it has done nothing to break the spirit of the agreement , but the union maintains it has walked away from talks .
Jobs
Royal Mail argues that only one middle manager has faced compulsory redundancy in the past few years .
The union maintains that the company is forcing people out by closing offices , making them commute long distances and by pressuring staff to work part time .
Pay
Royal Mail employees have been subject to a pay freeze since March .
The CWU argues that its members deserve a better deal for enduring the modernisation programme and in light of group profits of £ 321 m this year .
Royal Mail says its letters division , where most work , recorded only wafer - thin profits of £ 58 m last year .
Job security
Despite agreeing to job cuts , the CWU wants a greater degree of job security for its remaining members .
The union argues Royal Mail will pressure members to go part time and force its members out by closing sites .
Royal Mail says it expects those on 40 - hour - week contracts to work their hours .
Pensions
Both sides agree the Royal Mail 's pension deficit could soon top £ 10 bn .
The union argues Royal Mail is responsible , especially after the company took a contributions holiday between 1990 and 2003 .
The union says the Government should now underwrite the pension scheme , but Royal Mail claims a government offer was rejected by the union .
Going Rouge , a parody of the former vice - presidential candidate 's ' mom 's eye view ' of US politics , Going Rogue , will hit stores next month on the same day as its target
For those unable to stomach Sarah Palin 's forthcoming " mom 's - eye view of high - stakes national politics " Going Rogue , small US publisher OR Books has announced that it will bring out Going Rouge , an alternative view of the former Republican vice - presidential candidate , on the same day .
Parodying the cover of Palin 's memoir ( subtitled An American Life ) , which sees a relaxed - looking Palin in front of a blue , cloud - strewn sky , Going Rouge ( subtitled An American Nightmare ) places Palin in front of thunderous clouds and lightning .
The book – the title is a reference to the US newsreader who mistakenly called the autobiography Going Rouge – will see a series of contributors examine Palin 's origins in Alaska , her rise in the Republican party , and " the nightmarish prospect of her continuing to dominate the nation 's political scene " , OR Books said .
It will be published as a paperback and ebook on 17 November , the same day that Palin 's hardback Going Rogue is due out .
Another spoof , Going Rouge – The Sarah Palin Rogue Coloring and Activity Book by cartoonist Julie Sigwart and Micheal Stinson , is also out on 17 November .
Featuring mazes ( " Help Sarah find her way to the White House " ; " Where in the world does domestic Alaskan oil go ? " ) , puzzles and word games , the authors promise to " mercilessly lampoon and parody everything Palin in 48 pages of hilarity " .
" We are environmentally conscious folks , and consider her to be a total threat to ecosystems everywhere , a continuation of the abominable legacy of George W Bush , an epitome of the stereotypical ' Ugly American ' , " Stinson said by email today .
He promised that their book " does n't just have a buncha words , we 've got pictures " too .
AlBut whether either of the Going Rouge books will have any impact on Palin 's sales is doubtful .
Going Rogue , written in just four months for a reported $ 7 m ( £ 4.4 m ) advance , pushed Dan Brown 's new novel The Lost Symbol off the top spot on Amazon.com 's bestseller lists earlier this month , over six weeks before publication .

Un tribunal resolvió el viernes mantener medidas cautelares que impiden la siembra comercial de maíz transgénico en México , pero dejó en manos de la Suprema Corte decidir la constitucionalidad de disposiciones en la ley que las sustentan , en el último capítulo de una larga controversia en torno al cereal .
El tribunal federal determinó que no tiene facultades para resolver un recurso legal de PHI México - en la que tienen participación Dupont y Pioneer - que impugnó disposiciones de una ley de acciones colectivas , dijo el abogado del grupo que promueve un juicio para evitar la siembra de maíz transgénico en México , René Sánchez .
" Su argumento es que no va a entrar al estudio de la constitucionalidad de ley porque le toca a la Suprema Corte y , por lo tanto , deja la cosas como están hasta que la Corte decida si lo va a estudiar o no , si lo va a resolver o no " , dijo Sánchez a Reuters .
" La única manera que tenían para levantar y permitir la siembra era conceder el amparo , no lo están concediendo , no están resolviendo sobre eso " , añadió .
Hasta ahora , México permite la siembra experimental con fines científicos en superficies de hasta una hectárea y la siembra piloto no comercial con medidas de contención en áreas de hasta 10 hectáreas .
Ambas deben estar bajo vigilancia de un juez .
La siembra comercial se mantiene prohibida en todo el país .
Empresas como Monsanto , DuPontPioneer y Singenta están a la espera de que México elimine las barreras a la siembra transgénica , medida a la que ambientalistas se oponen por temor a contaminación de variedades nativas en el país que es visto por muchos como la cuna de maíz .
" Somos optimistas en cuanto al sentido que seguramente habrá de resolver la Corte a este tema levantando la suspensión " , dijo a Reuters Alejandro Monteagudo , portavoz de la asociación que agrupa a las empresas de biotecnología en México .
Las medidas cautelares forman parte de un juicio promovido por la Colectividad del Maíz , agrupación formada por campesinos , investigadores y ambientalistas , entre otros , desde 2013 .
El juicio ha logrado frenar la siembra comercial que parecía muy cercana a finales del 2012 .
De acuerdo a observadores , una decisión final sobre el futuro de la siembra comercial en México debería darse el año que entra .
" Hay una ley de bioseguridad y hay un marco jurídico que se tiene que respetar y si se levanta la medida cautelar lo que nosotros tendremos es la posibilidad de solicitar esos permisos " , dijo a Reuters el abogado de Monsanto México , Rodrigo Ojeda .
México , donde la tortilla de maíz es parte fundamental de la dieta básica , perdió hace unas décadas la autosuficiencia en la producción del grano , por una mezcla de factores que incluye los efectos climáticos adversos como sequías y heladas .
El país produce en su mayoría maíz blanco para consumo humano , pero es altamente deficitario en maíz amarillo para consumo pecuario , del que importa más de 10 millones de toneladas al año desde Estados Unidos .
They are scribblings that may come back to haunt Matthew Tannin .
The former high - flying Bear Stearns hedge fund manager – who goes on trial for fraud in a New York court this week – had a habit of recording his inner-most thoughts in emails sent to himself on a private Google Mail account .
" I am going to use this to keep my diary , " he wrote .
" I did n't want to use my work email any more . "
In words never intended for public consumption , Tannin wrote of his worries about becoming dependant on an antidepressant , Wellbutrin , and a stress medication , Lorazapan , to cope with concern about the performance of his fund .
He expressed satisfaction at earning close to $ 2 m ( £ 1.3 m ) in a year but alluded to a " religious crisis " and complained about " schlepping the kids around from place to place " during a holiday in London .
As his confidence in his money - making panache began to falter , Tannin pinpointed a meeting in 2006 when he realised that his Bear Stearns fund faced potential trouble : " I had a wave of fear set over me – that the Fund could n't be run in the way that I was ' hoping ' .
And that it was going to subject investors to ' blow up risk ' . "
Tannin and his boss , Ralph Cioffi , ran two funds holding $ 1.4bn of clients ' funds that collapsed in July 2007 , an event widely viewed as the first clear signal of America 's sub - prime mortgage crisis and the global credit crunch .
The meltdown of these funds sparked a chain of events that contributed to the demise of Bear Stearns , an 85 - year - old Wall Street institution , in early 2008 .
They have been charged by US prosecutors with defrauding customers by hiding the true condition of investments as prospects steadily darkened .
The first high - rolling financiers to face criminal action arising from the financial crisis , Cioffi and Tannin have become unwitting poster boys for perceived arrogance , recklessness and irresponsibility on Wall Street .
Frustrated at not seeing higher - ranking bank bosses clapped in irons , the public and the US media are watching keenly .
" I do think there 's a desire on the part of the public to see people held accountable , " said Barbara Roper , director of investment protection at the Consumer Federation of America .
" The trouble is that a lot of what brought down the system was legal . "
According to the government , Tannin and Cioffi stuffed their funds with dangerous mortgage - linked securities while marketing them as low - risk , high - quality investments .
Federal authorities obtained Tannin 's deleted email account by serving a subpoena on Google , forcing the company to search its archives .
Prosecutors say the pair realised at an early stage that things were going amiss , exchanging messages remarking that conditions had turned " pretty damn ugly " and that the sub - prime market was " toast " .
But they constantly reassured customers that they were comfortable , that there were buying opportunities and that there was no cause for alarm .
Behind the scenes , the US government contends that Cioffi 's private concern was such that he withdrew $ 2 m of his own money , reducing his own " skin in the game " .
The trial , which begins on Tuesday , is expected to last six weeks , with at least 38 prosecution witnesses and 500 exhibits .
Arrested in June last year , Cioffi and Tannin have had 16 months to prepare their defence .
Their lifestyles have been widely scrutinised – New York magazine recently reported , in an unsympathetic tone , that Cioffi had been obliged to sell his beachside retreat in the Hamptons and two of his three Ferraris .
Legal experts say that it will be a tough case for the government to prove .
Few of the facts of what happened are in dispute .
But prosecutors must convince a jury of the defendants ' state of mind by producing evidence of intent to defraud .
" The government will need every drop of evidence it has to prove intent , " said Peter Henning , a white - collar law expert at Wayne State University in Michigan .
" These cases are circumstantial .
It 's a string of inferences .
It 's about what they knew and when they knew it . "
They may be the first .
But Cioffi and Tannin will by no means be the only financiers to face criminal proceedings arising from the credit crunch .
The FBI has more than 580 corporate fraud investigations underway , of which at least 40 concern sub - prime mortgage lending .
" New York white - collar lawyers are doing quite well right now responding to grand jury investigations and the threat of grand jury investigations , " said Daniel Richman , a professor at Columbia Law School .
" There 's a sense that quite a few more are moving down the pipe . "
I said in 2016 , “ Damn , the Democratic Party really nominated the ONE PERSON who could possibly lose an open election to a dim- witted , flatulent psychopath like Donald Trump , huh ? ? ”
But , I have to hand it to them : they proved me wrong by finding another !
Five Weapons We Should Use in the Event of a Giant Monster or Alien Attack
What do we pull out of the toolbox when our civilization is threatened by malevolent forces beyond our comprehension ?
I ’ve got some ideas .
Every Friday , I ’m compiling a list of five things that meet one criterion .
“ What is that criterion , ” you ask ?
Well , it ’s going to change every week and you ’re just going to have to try and keep up .
This week …
Five Weapons We Should Use in the Event of a Giant Monster or Alien Attack
Whether during the War of the Worlds or when The Blob was swallowing folks by the truckload , the human race has generally been depicted to have some semblance of an impressive - yet - ultimately futile military response to unbelievable threats .
The problem is that in nearly every monster or alien invasion narrative , the militaries of the world fail because they seemingly only have three basic settings on their panic switches :
a few ground troops with assault rifles missiles fired from fighter planes nuclear weapons
Why movies so wrought with fiction and imagination neglect to get any more creative or * gasp * realistic when it comes to the human counteroffensives , I will never know .
The shortsightedness of the military figures presented in these movies ultimately leads to discussions about what we , as a species , would / should do and how we would fare when faced with an attack from a giant spider or a fleet of extraterrestrial destroyers ( do n’t act like this has n’t crossed your mind ) .
What do we pull out of the toolbox when our civilization hangs in the balance ?
I ’ve got some ideas .
5. Focus All Your Energy
As of 2009 , most countries are sticking with traditional munitions like bullets and missiles and bombs .
You probably knew this much .
But all of those countries are also looking to the future , in the form of lasers and sonic weapons .
And if those are our future weapons , then we should probably assume there would be no more perfect time to unleash our own directed - energy weapons than on the always - impressively - evolved foes science - fiction authors swear are coming our way .
This idea is n’t as crazy as it sounds , either .
For one , Boeing recently destroyed a target with a laser strapped to a plane .
Really .
Based on the pinpoint accuracy and effectiveness of that tool , King Kong would n’t even get up to the 10th floor of the Empire State Building , if he threw his little temper tantrum today .
A less - destructive but just as effective method of using focused energy ( radiation , in this case , rather than the light in a laser ) to subdue an opponent is the US military ’s “ Active Denial System , ” which is basically just a giant microwave heat gun , causing extreme pain in any life form caught in the crosshairs .
Acoustic weapons have only been used in crowd control situations thus far but it ’s obvious that if we turn them up to 11 , we would probably damage a lot more than a set of eardrums .
Remember that part in The Incredible Hulk when they slowed down The Hulk with only sonic weapons ?
There 's your proof ; I mean , that movie was basically a documentary , anyway .
4. Kill It ! Kill It With Fire !
Napalm may smell good in the morning but it ’s a thing of the past .
The current preferred incendiary weapons generally involve oxidizing agents and white phosphorus ( in addition to the standard kerosene / benzene mixture ) .
So , basically , now we ’ve got super napalm .
What do those newfangled ingredients mean when it comes to knocking a monster on its ass ?
The oxidizing agents mean the ignited fires will not stop burning very easily ( like terrifying trick birthday candles ) .
And as for white phosphorus … well , let ’s put it this way : white phosphorus is so serious , it has been deemed inhumane for a military to use it as a weapon during combat – the sticky , incandescent particles easily vaporize flesh while also working the chemical ’s poisonous properties into the bloodstream as the deadly smoke fills the lungs and eyes of the target and anyone nearby .
It 's pretty hardcore .
Curiously , this can 't - miss option was never even considered in a flick like Godzilla when a giant flesh - and - blood monster was stomping tanks like autumn leaves on a driveway .
3. A Gatling Gun with Wings
Even though the A - 10 Thunderbolt II is armed to the teeth and has been around for decades , I cannot recall it ever being featured in a movie when a bulletproof monster or UFO threatens a metropolis .
I find this omission curious because the Thunderbolt is an airplane that is literally built around a chain gun .
I do n’t care what sort of armored spaceship or thick monster exoskeleton you ’re dealing with , I think we should at least give the airplanes that can fire 3900 uranium - depleted 30 mm rounds per minute a shot ( or a few thousand shots , more accurately ) , do n’t you ?
2. Rail Against It
This is the most unfamiliar concept on the list ( it ’s still largely in development ) and as such , I think we should really hype up just how awesome it would be to finally unveil it dramatically after the Martians blow up our famous landmarks .
A rail gun is a device that depends on electrical currents to hurl a large non-explosive projectile down two electrified rails at incredible speeds ( like , say , eight times the speed of sound ) .
It sounds a bit strange but basically it is a giant gun that uses electricity instead of gunpowder .
It would do some seriously awesome damage to any being stupid enough to stand in its way .
1. Let 's Punch Right Through It
For some reason , when it comes to giant science - fiction foes , our movie heroes only appear to be interested in literally scraping their opponent ’s surface .
In Independence Day , when the deflector shields are finally down , how does the remaining American Air Force finally engage a 15 - mile wide spaceship ?
With air - to - air missiles designed to shoot down other jets and larger planes ( neither of which are 15 - mile wide spaceships ) .
When bullets and rockets and carpet bombs were doing nothing but pissing off the Cloverfield monster , nobody ever thought about trying something different – no mention of harpoon missiles or poison gas or anything .
In my admittedly amateur expertise , the answer to both of these conundrums seemed pretty obvious : how about something that slices through the monstrous , previously - impermeable exterior and reduce all the insides to goo ?
When giant warships and creature (s ) the size of a skyscraper seriously threaten us , do n’t think we ’re not going to quickly reach for the Massive Ordnance Penetrator , a 15 - ton bomb carrying over 2 tons of explosives with the ability to penetrate 200 feet of reinforced concrete ( and if not that , maybe one of MOP ’s predecessors , the Mother and Father of All Bombs ) .
And if none of those work … then I guess we have no choice but try and infect them with smallpox .
Muslim woman ' blackmailed by couple who threatened to show family photos of her wearing Western clothes '
An asylum seeker and his wife blackmailed a Muslim friend by threatening to show photographs of her wearing jeans and a T - shirt to her devout family , a court heard yesterday .
Emal Ismaeli , 34 , and Joanna Richards , 22 , demanded more than £ 7,000 in a two - month terror campaign against the woman , identified only as Miss X .
They threatened to confront her traditional Islamic family - including her husband - to - be - with photographs of her in Western clothing with her arms around a man , and with a videotape of her dancing .
An asylum seeker and his wife have been jailed at Wolverhampton Crown Court for threatening to show a Muslim friend 's family photos of her wearing jeans
Ismaeli and mother - of - one Richards , both of Lye , West Midlands , admitted blackmail at Wolverhampton Crown Court and were jailed for 15 months and 12 months respectively .
Miss X's potential shame was ' the powerful weapon being used against her ' , the court was told .
The photographs were taken during a day out to a seaside resort two years before with Ismaeli and Richards , who are now divorced .
Prosecutor Bernard Linnemann said : ' Miss X received a letter on the doorstep of her father 's home with her name on the envelope .
' Inside was a picture of her in Blackpool wearing western clothing .
On the back , Miss Richards had written " If you do n't sort out the money you owe , more will come out " . '
The court heard how Richards formed the belief that Miss X was having an affair with her husband , while Ismaeli attacked her car , ripping off its wing mirror , and tried to unlock the door as she drove .
Gurdeep Garcha , defending Ismaeli , said the blackmail attempt was a short - lived and ' amateurish ' operation , adding that his client deeply regretted what he had done .
Sam Powis , representing Richards , said the mother - of - one 's crime had been committed out of stupidity and anger but the photographs had not been taken with the intention of using them for blackmail .
Sentencing them , Judge Michael Challinor said : ' The harm that has been done is very significant . '
A Denver jury said Leo Cisneros was not guilty of reckless child abuse resulting in the death of his 10 - year - old daughter , Auralia .
He was convicted of a lesser charge of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute .
Cisneros ’ family was elated that he was acquitted of the child - abuse charge , which could have resulted in more than 50 years in prison .
“ If he was the worst father , do n’t you think they would have found him guilty ? ” said Cisneros ’ cousin , Jonathan Davis , after the verdicts came in .
Davis , who sat through the two - week trial , said Cisneros still faces between eight and 24 years in prison for the marijuana conviction and a charge of having a gun while possessing drugs .
He will be sentenced Nov. 5 .
Jurors began deliberating Friday and resumed this morning .
They returned the verdict at about noon today and quickly left the courthouse without comment .
Auralia was shot in the face on Nov. 26 , 2007 , during a shootout between her father and three men who tried to break into the front door of their west Denver apartment .
The robbers — Trivi Trujillo , Joshua Rojas and Juvencio Hernandez — all have pleaded guilty in the case and are serving or are expected to serve between 16 and 24 years in prison .
Davis says he believes Trujillo shot Auralia through a window of the family ’s apartment and does n’t think anybody has properly paid for her death .
He said his cousin was merely a “ petty weed dealer ” who was ambushed in a robbery he did not expect .
“ These guys could do 10 years and be right back out on the street , ” he said .
“ That ’s not justice . ”
The jury did not have to determine whose bullet killed the girl .
Jurors also did not have to decide whether Cisneros was allowed to shoot at the robbers because under Colorado ’s “ make my day ” law , he had a right to defend his home .
Prosecutors argued that the fatal shot came from Cisneros ’ gun , a point contested by the defense , who criticized Denver police for not investigating the path of the robbers ’ bullets .
Deputy District Attorney George Poland also told the jury that Auralia was holding a baggie of pot in her pocket at the time of her death .
But Auralia ’s mother , along with a neighbor and one of the first Denver officers at the scene , testified they saw Auralia ’s hands across her chest at the time of her death .
“ This whole time , they were trying to say that there was marijuana in her hand and it was his bullet that killed her , ” Davis said .
“ The jury saw the truth . ”
Defense lawyer Laura Menninger said the case was unique because she did n’t know of another incident where the victim of a robbery became the focus of prosecution .
“ The jurors paid very careful attention and did their job , ” she said .
“ There was a lot of pretrial publicity to overcome and things that turned out not to be true . ”

Vijay Mallya's team won their first podium place at the Belgian Grand Prix
Williams and Force India have been readmitted to the Formula 1 Teams ' Association ( Fota ) after their suspension from the group was lifted .
Their ban was imposed at the height of the budget cap crisis when they broke ranks and applied for unconditional entry into the 2010 championship .
Fota 's executive committee says all teams competing in the championship are welcome to join the group .
That means new teams Campos Grand Prix , Manor and US F1 are also eligible .
Earlier in the summer , F1 was faced with the possibility of many of the most high - profile teams withdrawing from the championship in protest at the prospect of budgetary restrictions being imposed on them by motorsport 's governing body , the International Motorsport Federation ( FIA ) .
606 : DEBATE
But FIA president Max Mosley 's original plan for a £ 40 m budget cap was replaced with an agreement to reduce costs to " mid-1990s levels " , to be done according to Fota 's chosen methods , and with Mosley agreeing not to stand in October 's elections .
" The Fota executive committee looks forward to working with the FIA and Commercial Rights Holder to promote a healthy , dynamic and sustainable sport , " said an official statement .
" To this end , Fota intends to now enter into open discussion with the Commercial Rights Holder with the wish to confirm arrangements beyond 2012 . "
Evangelical actor Kirk Cameron is on a serious crusade against Charles Darwin -- connecting the scientist 's most famous and significant work to Adolf Hitler .
To commemorate the upcoming 150th anniversary of Darwin 's " Origin of Species " -- Kirk has released a 6 - minute long video on his evangelical website bashing Darwin 's book along with C.D. 's famous theory of evolution .
In the video attack -- which Kirk made to promote the release of a reworked , creationist edition of " Origin of Species " --
Kirk essentially calls Darwin a racist , a woman - hater and claims Darwin 's theory has an " undeniable connection " with Hitler .
But it gets better -- Kirk claims he will be embarking on a college tour , in the hopes of infiltrating the minds of America 's future " lawyers , doctors and politicians . "
To quote Kirk , " These students are n't stupid . "
Since I have only started learning Perl I ’m not yet qualified to talk about the programming aspects of the languages .
I also do n’t have much experience with lot of other languages so would n’t try even comparing them .
Here I ’m only trying to state a few traits of the general Perl community and programmers , which I already started loving .
1 ) Perl people are passionate .
Have you ever talked to a Perl programmer ?
The chances are that you will start programming in Perl too .
Actually I too was brought in like that by a friend .
Perl Programmers love Perl more than anything in the world and will do anything to popularize it .
If you are in doubt check the community .
2 ) The gurus are there to help you
The irc channel contains knowledgeable guys and they are always ready to help a newbie .
Whenever I had doubt I visited the #perl channel in freenode and my doubts were cleared within minutes .
Yesterday I saw a senior member in irc stating “ :)
Ha I did n’t kill a newbie ” , after explaining a seemingly easy doubt for a newbie and the newbie reporting to check into the matter further .
The emotion embedded in the statement was how much the Perl community want new people to come in .
I do n’t know if this is normal with all the programing language channels , but in #perl you are sure to be in company of prominent and great guys .
It is possible that the author of the book that you following explaining your doubts .
3 ) Great documentation
Good documentation is available online , for download and most of the time pre installed in linux .
Documentation is rather exhaustive and you get to learn every aspect of the language from this alone .
However there are also lot of printed material to assist .
The Llama , Camel and Alpaca are the premium source of education in the field of Perl .
The documenation got a new and nice face lift recently and is rather god looking and easily navigable .
4 ) Highly expressive and less restrictive language
The language is really expressive and less restrictive .
There are more than one way to do things , and actually it is the motto of the language .
At first a newbie may find it hard to remember all of these different techniques and also some of the language constructs may seem confusing and unnecessary .
But a few days in Perl and you will start enjoying all of these and it begins to seem second language to you .
For a sample of what I was saying look into the last post .
For another example you will get confused ( I got ) that a subroutine can be called with and without a ‘ &’ and you doubt why ?
But a couple of pages more into the Llama would tell you the reasons .
And once you know the reasons , you will appreciate it , and sometimes you even wonder how in the world Larry even visualized this feature .
Another thing I found in my small experience so far are two new constructs , unless and until .
I have n’t seen any of these in any of the languages I have used so far .
You may argue by saying it is same is made possible by adding a ‘!’ in front of ‘ if ’ and ‘ while ’ .
Yeah , it is true , but it is great to have those and it makes you more expressive and I ’m sure Perl have more of them in stock for me .
5 ) Nice and humble people .
There are more but I ’m stopping with this one .
This is by far the most important thing I have noticed .
Perl people are humble .
They love their language and are passionate about them but would never belittle another languages .
Most of them are well versed in many languages .
Actually all of them would tell you to learn other languages too and use one which suits you .
I think the confidence is from the fact that once you start coding in Perl you are unlikely to move into others .
Perl is pretty addictive .
: : : : : : : : : :
It would be nice to have support for vector unit ( MMX , SSE , AltiVec , and so on ) operations in GHC .
Currently Data Parallel
Haskell cannot utilize vector units due to GHC 's lack of support .
Those vector operations could be nicely used to get e.g. stereo signal processing for the price of mono signal processing .
Maybe those operations could be added to GHC .
Prim , or because there are so many , to a new module , GHC .
Prim .
Vector .

Boom .
Nokia 's just hit Apple with a patent infringement lawsuit , claiming that " all iPhones models shipped " infringe on ten of Espoo 's patents relating to GSM , UMTS , and WiFi .
According to Nokia 's press release , the patents in question have been licensed by some 40 other companies , " including virtually all the leading mobile device vendors , " and Apple 's refused to agree to " appropriate " license terms .
That 's pretty vague , actually -- it could either mean that Apple was willing to license the patents at a price less than what Nokia demanded , or it could mean that Apple refused to pay at all .
We 'll obviously be covering this one in great detail as it progresses -- stay tuned for a fun decade or so of litigation .

Indeed , modern Pashtun history is , in part , one of backlashes against overambitious modernization efforts that lacked local “ buy - in . ”
The American military has become far more sensitive to Afghan sensibilities in the last few years , and there are some first - rate commanders on the ground who cooperate well with local Pashtun leaders .
That creates genuine stability .
But all commanders cannot be above average , and a heavier military footprint almost inevitably leads to more casualties , irritation and recruitment for the Taliban .
One of the main arguments for dispatching more troops is the terrorist threat from Al Qaeda .
But Steven Simon , a National Security Council official in the Clinton years who is now a terrorism expert at the Council on Foreign Relations , notes that there may be more Al Qaeda fighters in Pakistan , Yemen and perhaps Somalia than in Afghanistan .
“ I ’m skeptical that the war in Afghanistan is going to solve the Al Qaeda problem , ” he said .
That ’s not to say we should pull out , and it ’s a false choice to suggest that we should either abandon Afghanistan or double down .
A pullout would be a disastrous signal of American weakness and would destabilize Pakistan .
My suggestion is that we scale back our aims , for Afghanistan is not going to be a shining democracy any time soon .
We should keep our existing troops to protect the cities ( but not the countryside ) , while ramping up the training of the Afghan Army  and helping it absorb more Pashtuns to increase its legitimacy in the south .
We should negotiate to peel off some Taliban commanders and draw them over to our side , while following the old Afghan tradition of “ leasing ” those tribal leaders whose loyalties are for rent .
More aid projects , with local tribal protection , would help , as would job creation by cutting tariffs on Pakistani and Afghan exports .
Remember also that the minimum plausible cost of 40,000 troops  $ 10 billion  could pay for two million disadvantaged American children to go to a solid preschool .
The high estimate of $ 40 billion would , over 10 years , pay for almost half of health care reform .
Are we really better off spending that money so that more young Americans could end up spilling their blood in Afghanistan without necessarily accomplishing much more than inflaming Pashtun nationalism ?
One of the beauties of bike riding is the freedom .
You buy one , or find one , and just jump on .
There are no taxes , no fuel to buy and almost anything that goes wrong can be fixed by the rider .
They ’re also cheap enough that anyone can own one .
But should bikes be treated more like cars ?
Further , is it even possible to do so ?
Bike riding seems to be getting more and more popular , a result of green concerns , money concerns and the attentions of politicians .
London Mayor Boris Johnson plans to spend £ 111 million on cycling infrastructure in the capital in the coming year .
It might not surprise you to learn that Johnson is a keen cyclist .
So as the use of bikes explodes , and bike - sharing schemes in many European cities bloom , are we heading for a changes in the law ?
Taxes
One way to pay for bike lanes is to levy a tax .
This could be on sales , or something like the vehicle tax on cars .
Many drivers like this idea , as they bemoan that they are giving cyclists a free ride .
But road tax does n’t exist , and there are many other taxes which pay for their upkeep , including the vehicle license of cyclists who own cars .
Also , once bike lanes are built , they require little maintenance other than stopping cars from parking in them .
It ’s also likely that taxation would be impossible to enforce .
How would you know who had paid for what ?
Bikes would need to carry registration plates , and that seems unlikely .
A sales tax on new bikes would slow sales and be , in these times of peak oil , political suicide .
It looks like we ’re safe for now .
Insurance
Car-advocates often propose mandatory third party insurance for cyclists .
It is available , and it ’s cheap — a testament to the difference in damage - causing capability beween a two wheeled , human powered bike and a two - ton , gas - fuelled monster .
As bikes become more common in cities , it is likely that pedestrians will start to sue cyclists for crashing into them , so insurance could be useful .
But again , how would you possibly police mandatory insurance without registering all bikes and making them carry license plates ?
Add to this that most policies would be void the moment that a rider runs a red light of hops onto a sidewalk and you ’re looking at a whole mess .
Which brings us to :
Road Laws
Cyclists flout the law .
We run stop lights , drive on the pavement ( legal here in Barcelona , although wearing an iPod will get you a fine ) and head in the wrong direction down one - way streets .
All clearly illegal , but all , at times , the safest thing to do .
Sure , a bad cyclist will likely do all three at once , at top speed , and give some poor grandmother a heart attack .
But for the more careful rider , a slip down a one - way street can avoid a dangerous junction , for example .
It has been argued that red lights and street directions should n’t apply to cyclists anyway , as they are not inventions for safety but inventions to lubricate traffic - flow , specifically motor - traffic .
As a bike , carefully and sensibly ridden , cannot cause a traffic jam , it follows that they should not have to abide by these traffic schemes .
With the exception of driving on the correct side of the road , why should bikes obey car laws ?
Roadside Assistant
As easy as bikes are to fix , not everybody want to repair a flat or gets their hands dirty on their way to work .
Roadside assistance for cyclist has just been announced for AAA members in Oregon and Southern Idaho .
The catch is that you ’ll have to have a car to get it , as there is no standalone package for cyclists :
It ’ll come as part of the Plus , Plus RV and Premier packages .
These start at $ 105 per year .
Neither will the mechanic fix it for you .
He will give you a lift , for up to 25 miles , but apparently it is too hard to mend a bicycle .
Marie Dodds of the AAA told Oregon Live that “ There are a million sizes of tires and tubes .
Our people are not prepared to repair bikes . ”
This seems like an excuse : apart from removing the bottom bracket of my bike , I can repair everything on it with a multi-tool , a 15 mm wrench , a pump and a puncture repair kit ( slipped into a pocket made from an old inner- tube section ) .
I can true a wheel , break and remake the chain and swap in a new saddle , all with a kit that fits into a pocket .
I ’m sure that an AAA van could carry everything needed in a small tool - box , and how much space does a box of different sized tubes take up ?
Still , late night rescue in the rain is still a nice service to have .
Or you could try the Better World Club , which has offered a bike assistance scheme for some time .
It ’ll cost $ 40 , and they will even fix a puncture for you .
What do you all think ?
Should bikes be , legally , treated like cars , or should cars be penalized further to push people onto bikes ?
There are plenty of opinions , and we have n’t even started on the savings in health costs made by riding instead of driving .
Have at it in the comments , and keep it clean .

The confused web of international law and the simmering global tensions beneath it have not been resolved by the report of the Independent Fact Finding Mission on the Conflict in Georgia .
In fact , the report only serves to emphasise that the inadequacy of our politicians and institutions to deal with the central issue of our times : what , if any , are the agreed rules for the making , breaking and interaction of states ?
The report was commissioned by the Council of the EU and undertaken by a team headed by Swiss diplomat Heidi Tagliavini , and it is good .
In fact , it is more than that : in an international field generally characterised by increasing mediocrity , it is a rare gem that takes in the historical and cultural perspectives alongside the more clinical legal one , giving context to the issues at stake .
As such , it is willing to admit the facts , such as they are known to this point , are clear – yet necessarily complex , and that unless the complexity is taken into account it is impossible to understand the narrative – or avert a further disaster .
Boiled down to one sentence , the report says Georgia attacked first , but upon a background of lengthy provocation by Russia .
Unsurprisingly , Georgia has rejected the specific finding though not the report in its entirety , Russia has seemingly embraced the specific finding but not the whole report , while international leaders have remained eerily silent , and for good reason : no one emerges well from these pages ( barring Nicolas Sarkozy , then head of the EU presidency , whose persistent diplomacy is deemed to have brought about a ceasefire ) .
The US is correctly singled out for criticism for building up Georgia 's military capability without a thought for the viability of this move or its end result ; Russia is justifiably criticised for using its so - called ethnic nationals as a ruse to enter and expand a presence in South Ossetia and Abkhazia ; Georgia is clearly criticised for being provocative to a much bigger and powerful neighbour without a thought for consequence ; and the international community at large is criticised for doing too little in the face of an obviously deteriorating situation that has wider implications for the region and much further afield .
All these are bad enough , but the nub of the report remains the essential international stand - off regarding sovereignty and the interpretation of international law – which is the real reason the international leadership is flummoxed .
It is made clear that these issues served as part of the backdrop to the conflict , that self - determination is not recognised in international law as a basis for the unilateral creation of a new state " outside the colonial context and apartheid " , and that much of international state practice " and the explicit views of major powers such as Russia in the Kosovo case stand against it . "
Most crucially , the report goes on to note that according to " the overwhelmingly accepted uti possidetis principle , only former constituent republics such as Georgia but not territorial sub-units such as South Ossetia or Abkhazia are granted independence in case of dismemberment of a larger entity such as the former Soviet Union . "
One year ago I wrote here that :
[ Kosovo ] has become the nub of the Georgian conflict – which only underlines the need for a far more fundamental debate [ about international law ] .
And while the west adamantly refutes any comparison between the two , Russia is equally adamant it has served as a precedent for its own actions .
The report clearly bears out this assessment , and while it criticises Russia for recognising the so - called independent republics of Abkhazia and South Ossetia – deemed unlawful by the report – it also effectively accepts Russia 's position that Kosovo 's self - declared independence is problematic within international law , not least because it had been a province of the former Yugoslavia , not a constituent republic .
This is an important development , underlined in paragraph 8 of the report 's " Observations " section – which is drafted in determinedly ambiguous terms that reflect far beyond the events in the Caucusus :
The conflict in Georgia in summer 2008 laid open tendencies by some of the political actors to move away from generally - accepted principles of international law such as the respect of territorial integrity .
There were also ambiguities , if not infringements as related to the principle of sovereignty .
There has also been a tendency to move away from multilateralism and negotiated results and solutions in favour of unilateral action .
These are extremely strong words , aimed as much at Washington and Brussels and all capitals in the west as they are at Moscow and Tbilisi and capitals east .
They should be heeded .
Reviewing the report , David Hearst pointed out last week that the Caucasus has to work out its own relationships , possibly with western help but without western interference .
This is true , but there is a need for a corollary : east and west , north and south , Russia and Georgia – we all need to work on achieving an agreement on international law and its application to states .
If not we are looking not only at a further potential deterioration in the Caucusus , but also at other possible conflicts over self - determination and sovereignty .
From Kurdistan to the Basque country , from Transnistria to Chechnya , the world is full of peoples who seek independent states : they deserve to know the rules of the game .
But beyond that , we all need to know : are states to remain defined by territorial integrity or has that now become a pawn to be used cynically by one side or another in an unfolding game of international one - upmanship ?
People passing through a walkway owned by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints ( the Mormons ) are now on notice after a gay kiss incident .
Church officials have posted new signs at the Salt Lake City Main Street Plaza where two men were cuffed after sharing a kiss in July .
The new signs warn visitors : “ The [ LDS ] Church reserves the right to refuse access to any person for any reason . ”
Security guards cuffed and detained Matt Aune , 28 , and his partner Derek Jones , 25 , on July 9 , a Thursday , as they walked across a walkway that connects the Mormon Temple to other church sites .
Police responding to the incident cited the couple for trespassing .
While church officials say “ there was much more involved than a simple kiss on the cheek , ” responding officers were told that security guards observed the men “ kissing and hugging ” on church property .
In a statement , church officials alleged the men were “ engaged in passionate kissing , groping , profane and lewd language , and had obviously been using alcohol . ”
The men agreed they had been drinking but insisted there was nothing indecent about their affections .
The incident sparked two “ kiss ins ” near church property in protest and renewed a heated debate on anti-gay discrimination by the Mormon Church , whose members donated millions of dollars – and thousands of volunteer hours – to the campaign to ban gay marriage in California last year at the behest of church leaders .
Eventually , all charges against the men were dropped .
City Prosecutor Sim Gill said the church failed to adequately warn the couple that they were on private property .

Women in top gear for motoring
Female motorists are the brunt of many a car - related gag , yet new research reveals women are savvier about cars and motoring than many men give them credit for .
Indeed , the average woman considers her car to be more important than clothes , makeup or holidays .
Women 's car insurance specialist , Diamond asked more than 4,000 women from across the country for their views on motoring , and found 44 % like talking about cars with their friends , and almost two thirds enjoy watching Top Gear .
The Diamond Women and Their Cars Survey also revealed , unlike what some men might have you believe , less than 3 % of women would choose a car based on its colour .
Indeed , nearly half of women enjoy chatting with their friends about cars .
In fact , the top two reasons women cited for choosing a particular car were economy and price , both chosen by 20 % of women .
A further 12 % of women said the make and model would be the deciding factor in their choice .
Sian Lewis , managing director of Diamond said , " Our research shows many of the stereotypes you hear about women drivers are very much outdated and untrue .
" Today 's generation of women drivers keep up to date with the motoring world , make informed motoring choices and take efforts to look after their wheels .
" Three - quarters of women said they know how to check the oil , water and tyre pressure on their car .
A quarter of these women make sure they do the necessary checks before a long journey , and 16 % check their car once a month .
However , more than a third admitted they do know how but rarely service their car , and only 27 % admit to never doing it as they do n't know how .
The poll also shows that women are practical drivers too , preferring the reassurance of a torch and atlas in their glove compartment compared to that that offered by lippy , mascara or a compact .
15 % of women keep a torch to hand , 12 % an atlas , compared to 8 % who make sure they 've got make - up in the glove box .
Archive Binge Custom RSS Feeds
WHAT IS ARCHIVE BINGE ?
Archive Binge is a Comic Rocket feature that lets you digest a whole bunch of pages of longer webcomics at rate you set for yourself .
It 's for those times when you look at an interesting webcomic and realize that you do n't have time to consume 800 + pages of something like Darths & Droids in a single sitting -- let alone the almost three years it would take at a strip a day !
Once you 've created the RSS feed for a particular comic , it will take you through the archive at a rate faster than the new comics update .
You can quickly get up to date on comics with large archives without spending hours or days trying to read the archive in one go .
You can start from the beginning , or wherever you 've read up to .
You can set your feed to deliver a strip each day , a few strips every weekday , or whatever rate you want , up to 10 strips a day .
If you happen to read the next 50 strips , you just update your position in the feed and it will continue to drip the strips to you .
You can even pause your feed if you want and turn it back on again at your leisure .
CREATING , EDITING AND DELETING FEEDS
To create a feed , find the Info Page for the comic you want .
In the right sidebar , under the heading Archive Binge Feed , there 's a Create button .
Click it .
Once you do it 's replaced with three buttons : RSS , Edit , and Delete .
The RSS link gives you the code to add to your feed reader .

The airship crashed by trees and hedges in a farmer 's field
Top Gear presenter James
May escaped unhurt when an airship he was travelling in crash - landed in a field .
May was filming a feature for the TV show in which a caravan was attached to the bright orange airship and flown across Cambridgeshire .
It was supposed to land on a cricket pitch but strong winds blew it off course and it landed on its side in a farmer 's field near the A428 .
Emergency services were on stand - by , but were not needed , the BBC said .
Eyewitness Peter Clarke told the Daily Mail newspaper the caravan - carrying airship was " a very strange sight " .
He said : " I understand they were planning to land on the village cricket green in the middle of a match .
" All the cricketers were there dressed in their whites waiting for it to appear , but it started drifting off in the wrong direction .
" The film crew were a bit fed up as they 'd been hanging around the village all day waiting for the wind to drop so they could film . "
A spokeswoman for Top Gear confirmed May was uninjured , but refused to disclose any further details about the stunt .
" Viewers will have to wait until the next series to find out what happens , " she added
Obama administration gives British distiller $ 3 billion to move from one American territory to another
We ca n’t explain this one and we doubt that President Obama can , either .
He just agreed to pay a British company nearly $ 3 billion so it can move from Puerto Rico to the Virgin Islands .
London - based Diageo PLC will receive tax credits and other benefits worth $ 2.7 billion over 30 years , including the entire $ 165 - million cost of building a state - of - the - art distillery on the island of St. Croix in the Virgin Islands , a U.S. territory .
Virgin Islands officials say the arrangement complies with the letter and spirit of tax law and will help the islands ’ sagging economy .
Captain Morgan is now produced in another U.S. territory , Puerto Rico , and critics say the Virgin Islands ’ subsidy for the new distillery there , along with the other benefits , are so generous that they practically guarantees a profit on every gallon of rum produced there by Diageo , the biggest distilled spirits maker in the world .
“ The U.S. taxpayer is basically being asked to line the pockets of the world ’s largest liquor producer , ” says Steve Ellis , the president of Taxpayers for Common Sense , a nonpartisan watchdog organization .
The Lord Obama giveth to one U.S. territory and taketh from another .
Puerto Rico loses 300 jobs in this move , but that ’s just the tip of the iceberg .
It also uses 90 % of the taxes it derives from rum on public welfare .
Unfortunately , we know the way this administration thinks .
So we ’re completely prepared for the announcement that they ’re going to spend another billion or two moving all of Puerto Rico ’s unemployed to the Virgin Islands .

Report after report from the World Bank , United Nations Development Program , and the Arab League emphasize that the education deficit in the Arab world is among the main causes of its underdevelopment .
With 5 percent of the world 's population and the bulk of the world 's oil and gas , the Arab world nonetheless lags behind most of the rest of the world , and suffers from what can best be termed " educational poverty . "
Without dramatic improvement at all educational levels , unemployment , illiteracy , and income inequality will continue to worsen , and the region will remain a danger to itself and its neighbors .
Even before the current economic recession , unemployment in the Arab world was estimated at 14 percent - the world 's highest average outside sub-Saharan Africa .
Among young people and recent graduates , the figure is more than double .
The Arab world also has the highest population growth rate in the world , with almost 40 percent of its population now below the age of 15 .
According to some estimates , the Arab world accounts for one - quarter of the world 's unemployment among the 15 - 24 age group .
Just to keep up with the inflow of young people into the labor market , Arab economies will have to generate 100 million new jobs over the next 10 years , which will be impossible if education remains impoverished .
Enrolment ratios in the Arab world have improved over the past decade , but Arab countries still have one of the lowest average net enrolment ratios in the developing world .
About one - fifth of eligible children , more than 7 million , are not in school , and 60 percent of these are girls .
The average years of schooling for Arabs is less than half that for the East Asian states .
Not surprisingly , despite progress in recent decades , illiteracy remains at around 30 percent on average , and in some Arab nations reaches 50 percent and 60 percent .
The quality of Arab education is also an obstacle .
Today 's job market demands skills based on problem - solving , critical thinking , modern languages , and technology , but Arab educational systems generally remain traditional , rote - based , and authoritarian .
Research throughout the world shows that education is a key prerequisite for sustainable growth .
The East Asian tigers invested heavily in education , and it paid off in terms of a capable and modern workforce .
By contrast , development in the Arab world , driven largely by oil revenues , has left the population under- educated and economically marginalized .
Education is also important in the Arab context because of its special status in Islam , which , like Judaism and Christianity , is a religion of the book .
The Gospel of St. John says , " In the Beginning was the Word " ; the first word that was revealed to the Prophet Mohammad by the Angel Gabriel was " Read ... "
Among the Prophet 's sayings is , " It is the duty of every Muslim man and woman to seek learning . "
Moreover , Islam does not have a priesthood , just scholars .
The Arab golden ages , in 11th - century Baghdad and 14th - century Andalusia , are revered as periods of great learning .
Schools and universities received large - scale support , and students and scholars traveled from city to city in pursuit of knowledge .
After these golden ages , education fell into decline .
By the 1970s and 1980s , the Arab world 's post - independence states had made great improvements in their education sector .
But they did not have the resources to keep up with their own growing populations .
The dramatic levels of investment of the 1950s and 1960s tapered off , with the result that too many children are now either outside the school system or are receiving a low - quality education that leaves them without basic literacy and numeracy skills .
And there are still too many disparities based on gender , location , wealth , disability , and other markers of marginalization .
What the West has most , and what the Arab world most needs , is education .
It requires more schools and fewer guns ; more universities and fewer aircraft carriers .
The American University of Beirut , founded in 1866 , has arguably done more to transform the Middle East in positive ways than any other comparable institution , yet it receives only $ 3 million in annual aid from the United States , which spends billions on armies and weaponry in the region .
Indeed , the cost of a single month of Western military spending in Iraq or Afghanistan would be enough to triple total aid for education in the Middle East .
The cost of two cruise missiles would build a school , the cost of a Eurofighter a small university .
Education can also have a fundamental effect on forming values .
Radical Islamists recognized this long ago and plowed their resources into schools .
Saudi Arabia recognized it in the 1970s as it sought to expand its influence , and over the years the kingdom has funded thousands of schools and colleges that teach its stringent brand of Wahhabi Islam .
In Afghanistan and Pakistan , the radical vision is conveyed to the young in religious schools known as madrasas .
Indeed , " Taliban " means " students . "
The struggle for the future of the Arab and Muslim worlds that is being fought now will be won or lost not on the battlefield , but in the classroom .
I ’ve been using Python for a while .
Recently I have noted some nuances , wonders and counter - intuitive things I ran into .
The list grew surprisingly fast .
Disclaimer : Most of the problems that I list here can be understood and explained .
It ’s just my opinion that something is odd , so forgive me if I raise something that , in your opinion , is not an issue at all .
It ’s less apparent , but still reasonable to point out that the select module is inconsistent .
It specifies methods , some of which take seconds , others take milliseconds as a parameter .
I ’m often in doubt about the behaviour of get - like methods , due to inconsistent behaviour .
Currently some of them raise exception , others just return None .
Why None ?
Unfortunately pprint is not special and has to be used with brackets .
Hopefully this issue was addressed by Python 3 – print will also always require brackets .
I ’d love to use pprint . pprint in the same way print is used .
This often appears in conjunction with print :
Constructing tuples is misleading for beginners .
For example foo ( 1,2 ) is way different than foo ( ( 1,2 ) ) .
On the other hand foo ( 1 ) is the same as foo ( ( 1 ) ) .
All my friends who learn Python have a problem with sort .
Apparently < list >.sort ( ) returns None , which causes a lot confusion .
What they need is the builtin sorted .
Internals
Circular imports
It ’s not a surprise that Python does n’t handle circular imports .
But what does that actually mean ?
Let ’s create two files : a.py and b.py .
Let ’s import b from a and a from b : $ cat a.py var _1 = 1 import b var _2 = 2 print “ Hello world from module a ” print “ Imported b , b.var_1= %r b.var_2= %r ” % ( getattr ( b , “ var_1 ″ , None ) , getattr ( b , “ var_2 ″ , None ) ) $ cat b.py var _1 = 1 import a var _2 = 2 print “ Hello world from module b ” print “ Imported a , a.var_1= %r a.var_2= %r ” % ( getattr ( a , “ var_1 ″ , None ) , getattr ( a , “ var_2 ″ , None ) )
Think for a while about what result you would expect .
$ python -c " import a " Hello world from module ' b ' .
Imported a , a.var_1=1 a.var_2=None
Hello world from module ' a ' .
Imported b , b.var_1=1 b.var_2=2
What actually happened ?
We requested module a .
Module a runs .
a requests module b.
Flow goes to b .
b requests a .
Python understands that it ’s actually in the middle of creating module a , and gives back the reference to half - loaded namespace from module a .
Module b prints out a.var_1 , which has the correct value , but a.var_2 is not set yet , so it defaults to None .
After that everything continues normally .
Module naming and side effects
It ’s often forgotten that direct imports from inside the module , like import a imports something way different than global import import blah .a .
For example , if you created a file / tmp / a.py : $ cd /tmp ; PYTHONPATH =.. python >>> import a >>> import tmp.a
The commands are importing different module from Python ’s point of view .
If a.py has any side effects , they will be executed twice .
A common bug is to use local paths from inside the module , while encouraging users to use global module paths from outside .
This leads to double imports .
So , if you ’re importing local files from inside a python module , consider the syntax with dot : # Imagine we ’re in a module * tmp* , in a file * b. py * : import a # bad , import is different than * tmp .a* import tmp . a # better , but we ca n’t rename the module easily from .
import a # perfect !
imports file a.py from _this_ module .
What do imports import ?
If I need a.b.c.d( ) ,
Python requires me to understand which of the parts describe a module , which describe a file inside module , which describe a class and which a function .
In this case I could assume that a.b.c are modules and d( ) is a global function : >>> from a.b. c import d >>> d()
But that can be wrong !
a can be a module and b.c.d( ) can describe a class , sub class and sub sub class . >>> from a import b >>> b.c.d()
That ’s not all .
In normal cases lacking a proper import causes an exception .
Sometimes it does n’t …
My favourite example is os . path .
I still do n’t know if I should import os or os . path .
Both versions work : >>> import os >>> os.path.devnull ‘/ dev/null ’ >>> import os.path >>> os.path.devnull ‘/ dev/null ’
Module reload Apparently Python does allow you to dynamically reload modules .
That ’s a pretty neat feature .
But in practice it ’s not very useful –
modules are usually imported from global namespaces and local imports
from inside the code are considered slow .
Loading order Python uses several mechanisms for loading modules : System modules are loaded from / usr / lib / python2.5 .
.
Other are in /usr / lib / python2.5/site- packages .
.
There ’s also /usr / share / python - support .
.
And /usr / lib / python - support .
.
I have n’t yet mentioned eggs .
.
And eggs have *. pth files .
Python Eggs are really dirty .
Install a few of them and run : >>> import sys >>> sys.path [ '' , '/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/multiprocessing-2.6.2.1-py2.5-linux-x86_64.egg' , '/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/amqplib-0.6.1-py2.5.egg' , ...]
Yes !
Eggs are injected into the loading paths , polluting your system Python installation , and hurting Python startup time .
Btw .
I tried to force Python to use eggs from my home directory :
it ’s painful .
Not to mention the problems there are with
platform - specific eggs .
999+1 is not 1000
The well - known “ feature ” of Python integers is that they do n’t play nicely with is operator .
Internally , small integers are reused objects and is , which checks object memory location , works fine .
Greater integers are created as new objects every time , so is fails .
>>> 1 is 1 True >>> 1000 is 1000 True >>> 999 + 1 is 1000 False >>> 2 + 1 is 3 True
To make things even worse the behaviour changes over python versions .
For example 100+1 is 101 returns True in Python 2.5 but False
in Python 2.4 .
The order of unpacking Have you ever wondered what is the order during tuple unpacking ? >>> _ , _ , _ = 1 , 2 , 3 >>> _ 3
On the other hand this syntax is not allowed in function declarations .
Strange . >>> def a ( _ , _ , _ ) : print _ … File “ < stdin > ” , line 1 SyntaxError : duplicate argument ‘ _’ in function definition Speaking of function declarations , there ’s a nice feature that allows you to define named parameters before unnamed ones , although this syntax works only for function definitions , not for usage : >>> def foo ( a= 1 , b= 2 , * args , ** kwargs ) : … print “ a= %r b= %r args= %r kwargs= %r ” % ( a , b, args , kwargs … >>> foo( 4 , 5 , 6 ) a= 4 b= 5 args= ( 6 , ) kwargs={} >>> foo( a= 4 , b= 5 , 6 ) # I would expect this to work !
File “ < stdin > ” , line 1 SyntaxError : non-keyword arg after keyword arg
Python has deterministic garbage collection Unlike other dynamic languages , Python uses reference counting as a garbage collection mechanism .
During normal execution objects are freed right in the moment where they lose the last reference .
This means that while the program runs Python should n’t have any unexpected hiccups !
Unlike Java or Erlang , Python can run predictably smoothly .
Am I saying that Python is a proper realtime language , and that you could use it in
a medical ventilator ?
Well , Python does have advanced garbage collection
but it ’s only used to free cyclic references .
With proper programming discipline you can avoid creating reference loops .
Oh , and please
do avoid setting __del__ destructors , as Python ca n’t free reference loops with objects that define them .
This is an update to a 2007 post : Home Builders and Homeownership Rates1
From 1995 to 2005 , the U.S. homeownership rate climbed from 64 % to 69 % , or about 0.5 % per year .
Click on graph for larger image in new window .
The first graph shows the homeownership rate since 1965 .
Note the scale starts at 60 % to better show the recent change .
The reasons for the change in homeownership rate are discussed in the 2007 post ( a combination of demographics and changes in mortgage " innovation " ) , but here are two key points :
1 ) During the boom , the change in the homeownership rate added about half a million new homeowners per year , as compared to a steady homeownership rate , 2 ) the homeownership rate ( red arrow is trend ) is now declining .
The U.S. population has been growing at close to 3 million people per year on average , and there are about 2.4 people per household .
Assuming no change in these rates , there would be close to 1.25 million new households formed per year in the U.S.
( The are just estimates , and fewer households are formed during a recession - a key problem right now ) .
Since about 2/3s of all households are owner occupied , an increase of 1.25 million households per year would imply an increase in homes owned of about 800K + per year .
If an additional 500 K per year moved to homeownership - as indicated by the increase in the homeownership rate from 1995 to 2005 - then the U.S. would have needed 1.3 million additional owner occupied homes per year .
Important note : these number can't be compared directly to the Census Bureau housing starts and new home sales .
There are many other factors that must be accounted for to compare the numbers .
During that same period , since about 1/3 of all households rent , the U.S. would have needed about 400K + new rental units per year , minus the 500K per year of renters moving to homeownership .
So the U.S. needed fewer rental units per year from 1995 to 2005 .
The second graph shows the number of occupied ( blue ) and vacant ( red ) rental units in the U.S. ( all data from the Census Bureau ) .
Sure enough , the number of rental units in the U.S. peaked in early 1995 and declined slowly until 2005 .
The builders did n't stop building apartment units in 1995 , instead the decline in the total units came from condo conversions and units being demolished ( a fairly large number of rental and owner owned units are demolished every year ) .
Even though the total number of rental units was declining , this did n't completely offset the number of renters moving to homeownership , so the rental vacancy rate started moving up - from about 8 % in 1995 to over 10 % in 2004 .
Since 2004 there has been a surge in rental units .
Most of this increase is not new apartment buildings , rather a combination of investors buying REOs for cash flow , condo " reconversions " , builders changing the intent of new construction ( started as condos but became rentals ) , flippers becoming landlords , or homeowners renting their previous homes or 2nd homes instead of selling .
This increase in rental units is more than offsetting the decline in the homeowership rate , and the rental vacancy rate was at a record 10.6 % in Q2 .
( and will probably be over 11 % soon because of the " first - time " homebuyer tax credit ) .
This increase in the homeownership rate , from 1995 through 2005 , meant the homebuilders had the wind to their backs .
Instead of 800 K of new owner demand per year ( plus replacement of demolished units , and second home buying ) , the homebuilders saw an additional 500 K of new owner demand during the period 1995 to 2005 .
This does n't include the extra demand from speculative buying .
Some of this demand was satisfied by condo conversions and owner built units , but the builders definitely benefited from the increase in homeownership rate .
Looking ahead , if the homeownership rate stays steady , the demand for net additional homeowner occupied units would fall back to 800 K or so per year ( assuming steady population growth and persons per household ) .
However the homeownership rate is declining , and this is now a headwind for the builders .
It appears the rate is declining at about 0.5 % per year .
This means the net demand for owner occupied units would be 833 K minus about 500 K per year or about 333 K per year - about 25 % of the net demand for owner occupied units for the period 1995 to 2005 .
( Not including replacing demolished units and 2nd home buying ) .
Although we can't compare this number directly to new home sales ( because of 2nd home buying , replacement of demolished units , and other factors ) this does suggest new home sales will probably remain at a low level until the homeownership rate stops declining .
The third graph shows New Home Sales for the last 45 years .
the Census Bureau reported : " Sales of new one - family houses in August 2009 were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 429,000 . "
Once the homeownership rate stops declining - probably at about the same time the excess existing home units are mostly absorbed - new home sales will probably increase to a steady state rate based on population growth .
However this level will be substantially below the average for the period from 1995 to 2005 when the homebuilders benefited from the increasing homeownership rate .
The " first - time " homebuyer tax credit ( and new homebuyer tax credit in California ) probably boosted new home sales a little this year , so the homeownership rate might increase in the 2nd half of 2009 .
However that increase will probably be temporary , and the homeownership rate will probably start declining again .
Key points :
New Home sales will probably remain at a low level until the homeownership rate stops declining .
Once the homeownership rate stops declining , new home sales will increase to a steady state rate based on population growth - but far below the levels during the housing boom .
U.S. Copyright Office Says " Fuck Google " to Congress
* If you do n't know what the hell is going on here , please read or listen to this interview first * Marybeth Peters , The Register of Copyrights for the U.S. Copyright Office , testified before Congress yesterday in a surprise hearing about the Google Book Settlement " Chairman Conyers , Ranking Member Smith , and Members of the Subcommittee , I appreciate the opportunity to appear before you today to testify about the impact of the proposed Google Book Settlement Agreement on U.S. copyright law and policy as part of this hearing on Competition and Commerce in Digital Books .
" The Copyright Office has been following the Google Library Project since 2003 with great interest .
We first learned about it when Google approached the Library of Congress , seeking to scan all of the Library 's books .
At that time , we advised the Library on the copyright issues relevant to mass scanning , and the Library offered Google the more limited ability to scan books that are in the public domain .
An agreement did not come to fruition because Google could not accept the terms .
"
In 2005 , we followed very closely the class action filed by The Authors Guild and its members and the infringement suit filed by book publishers shortly thereafter .
The facts of the underlying lawsuits are simple .
Google was reproducing millions of protected books in their entirety , without permission of the copyright owners , through systematic scanning operations set up with large research libraries .
Once scanned , the books were indexed electronically , allowing end -users to search by title and other bibliographic information .
Google returned hits to its customers that included the option of browsing " snippets " ( e.g. several lines of the book ) , except for public domain books , which could be viewed and downloaded in their entirety .
Google 's search engine is free to users , but the company collects substantial revenue from the advertising that appears on web pages , including those pages on which images of , and information from , copyrighted books appear .
The lawsuits raised complex and sometimes competing legal questions , including questions about intermediate copying , future markets , book digitization goals and fair use .
Members of the legal community and the public debated the issues vigorously and anticipated what a Court decision on the merits might look like .
" When the parties announced last fall that they had reached a settlement in what was becoming a long and protracted litigation , our initial reaction was that this was a positive development .
But as we met with the parties , conversed with lawyers , scholars and other experts , and began to absorb the many terms and conditions of the settlement -- a process that took several months due to the length and complexity of the documentsÃ¢Â Â" we grew increasingly concerned .
We realized that the settlement was not really a settlement at all , in as much as settlements resolve acts that have happened in the past and were at issue in the underlying infringement suits .
Instead , the so - called settlement would create mechanisms by which Google could continue to scan with impunity , well into the future , and to our great surprise , create yet additional commercial products without the prior consent of rights holders .
For example , the settlement allows Google to reproduce , display and distribute the books of copyright owners without prior consent , provided Google and the plaintiffs deem the works to be " out - of - print " through a definition negotiated by them for purposes of the settlement documents .
Although Google is a commercial entity , acting for a primary purpose of commercial gain , the settlement absolves Google of the need to search for the rights holders or obtain their prior consent and provides a complete release from liability .
In contrast to the scanning and snippets originally at issue , none of these new acts could be reasonably alleged to be fair use .
"
In the view of the Copyright Office , the settlement proposed by the parties would encroach on responsibility for copyright policy that traditionally has been the domain of Congress .
The settlement is not merely a compromise of existing claims , or an agreement to compensate past copying and snippet display .
Rather , it could affect the exclusive rights of millions of copyright owners , in the United States and abroad , with respect to their abilities to control new products and new markets , for years and years to come .
We are greatly concerned by the parties ' end run around legislative process and prerogatives , and we submit that this Committee should be equally concerned .
" As outlined below , the Copyright Office also believes that some of the settlement terms have merit and should be encouraged under separate circumstances .
For example , the creation of a rights registry for book authors , publishers and potential licensees is a positive development that could offer the copyright community , the technology sector and the public a framework for licensing works in digital form and collecting micro-payments in an efficient and cost - effective manner .
Likewise , the promise to offer millions of titles through libraries in formats accessible by persons who are blind and print disabled is not only responsible and laudable , but should be the baseline practice for those who venture into digital publishing .
The ability of copyright owners and technology companies to share advertising revenue and other potential income streams is a worthy and symbiotic business goal that makes a lot of sense when the terms are mutually determined .
And the increased abilities of libraries to offer on - line access to books and other copyrighted works is a development that is both necessary and possible in the digital age .
However , none of these possibilities should require Google to have immediate , unfettered , and risk - free access to the copyrighted works of other people .
They are not a reason to throw out fundamental copyright principles ; they are a pretext to do so .
"
In the testimony below , we will address three specific points .
First , we will explain why allowing Google to continue to scan millions of books into the future , on a rolling schedule with no deadline , is tantamount to creating a private compulsory license through the judiciary .
This is not to say that a compulsory license or collective license for book digitization projects may or may not be an interesting idea .
Rather , our point is that such decisions are the domain of Congress and must be weighed openly and deliberately , and with a clear sense of both the beneficiaries and the public objective .
" Second , we will explain why certain provisions of the proposed settlement dramatically compromise the legal rights of authors , publishers and other persons who own out - of - print books .
Under copyright law , out - of - print works enjoy the same legal protection as in - print works .
1
To allow a commercial entity to sell such works without consent is an end - run around copyright law as we know it .
Moreover , the settlement would inappropriately interfere with the on - going efforts of Congress to enact orphan works legislation in a manner that takes into account the concerns of all stakeholders as well as the United States ' international obligations .

Health investigators are under more pressure as two elderly women are reported to have died , days after receiving the swine flu vaccine .
It brings the total number of deaths linked to the vaccine in Sweden to four .
The two latest deaths were reported to the Swedish Medical Products Agency ( Läkemedelsverket ) on Friday .
A 74 - year - old woman from Sollefteå in northern Sweden died four days after receiving the swine flu vaccine .
The woman , who suffered from heart and lung disease , was classified as a high - risk patient .
“ Naturally a report will be undertaken , ” said Dr. Markus Kallionen in a press statement released by Västernorrland County Council .
“ We must take this case seriously and investigate what has happened . ”
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
A further case of a 90 - year - old woman who also died after receiving the vaccine has been reported by newspaper Expressen .
Läkemedelsverket are currently investigating circumstances surrounding the deaths of two high - risk patients , a 50 - year - old man with a serious heart condition and woman with an acute muscle disease .
“ It ’s important to says that they had complicated illnesses , “ Gunilla Sjölin Forslund from Läkemedelsverket told news agency TT .
“ We still do not know if the deaths are connected to the vaccine . ”
Sweden launched a mass vaccination programme in a bid to control the flu pandemic on October 12th .
Cases of swine flu reached record levels last week with 198 new cases in comparison to 93 the previous week .

It was about 10 minutes to 10 on Tuesday night that mobile phones across Brighton started bleeping .
They belonged to the members of the Cabinet and caused many to abandon their dinners and hunch overtheir Blackberrys , urgently discussing what to do next .
Britain 's brashest and biggest - selling tabloid newspaper , which likes to sometimes make news rather than merely report it , was at it again .
After 12 years of supporting the Labour Party , The Sun was filling its front page the next morning with the headline " Labour 's lost it " .
As the news spread like bushfire around the sealed - off part of Brighton where Labour is holding its annual conference , the doors opened on a suite in the Grand Hotel where News International , which owns The Sun , was holding a party .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Gordon Brown , who was expected to attend , immediately cancelled his appearance , as did Peter Mandelson , now his First Secretary , but who in a previous life played a central role in the negotiations between Tony Blair and the Murdoch empire in the 1990s which led to The Sun 's backing of Labour in 1997 .
He knows News International 's chief executive , Rebekah Brooks , well , and vented his fury in a telephone conversation with her .
Yesterday , Mandelson 's people claimed he told her that she and her colleagues were " chumps " .
Her version of the same conversation had Mandelson using a noun that sounds similar , but is great deal more vulgar .
But while it was a shock to the Labour faithful , the news that David Cameron now has a political asset that has eluded Conservative leaders for 12 years did not come from nowhere .
It was the product of months of networking , negotiating , wine drinking , canape quaffing , villa visiting and yacht boarding as the Conservative Party and Britain 's biggest media company learned to love and understand each other once again .
Yesterday , one of the happiest men in the country was Andy Coulson , David Cameron 's highly paid and much criticised communications director , for whom the front page of yesterday 's Sun was the culmination of months of delicate diplomacy .
Four years ago , when David Cameron did not have an experienced tabloid operator like Coulson to advise him , it nearly went horribly wrong .
When the raw and newly elected Tory leader first met News International 's patriarch Rupert Murdoch , he was intent on projecting himself as a socially tolerant leader with modern ideas who would shake up an outdated Tory Party .
In his anxiety to be modern , Cameron described with great enthusiasm how he had enjoyed the new US blockbuster film Brokeback Mountain .
Far from being impressed , the ageing Murdoch was appalled that a would - be prime minister should be watching a film containing graphic scenes of gay sex .
In those days , Murdoch had more time for John Whittingdale , the Tory chairman of the Commons committee on culture and media , who had worked for Margaret Thatcher in Downing Street , than for anyone in Cameron 's shadow cabinet .
He also thought that the Shadow Chancellor , George Osborne , was more of a Thatcherite than Cameron .
Cameron 's master stroke , in June 2007 , was to hire Coulson five months after he had lost his job as editor of the Murdoch - owned News of the World when it emerged that the paper had been bugging royal telephones .
It was a controversial appointment that opened Cameron to political attack and is costing the Tory party a hefty salary – reputedly £ 200,000 a year .
But it produced dividends , because it meant that the Tory leader had at his side someone he trusted absolutely , who was also trusted inside the social world of the Murdoch clan .

Coulson is a dear friend of Rebekah Brooks , formerly Rebekah Wade , who edited The Sun from 2003 until she stepped up into her post earlier this year .
When Wade was arrested in 2005 for allegedly assaulting her then husband , the actor Ross Kemp , it was to Coulson she first turned for help .
It is said that each would die for the other .
This link gave Cameron a secure line into the social circle that includes James Murdoch , his sister Elisabeth , her husband the publicist MatthewFreud , Wade 's second husband , the old Etonian former racehorse trainer , Charlie Brooks , and Nat Rothschild , of the banking family .
Rothschild , son of Jacob , the fourth Baron Rothschild , is an exact contemporary of David Cameron 's most important political ally , George Osborne .
As young boys , they were in the same year at a private preparatory school .
They met again at Oxford University , where they were members of the elite Bullingdon Club .
In summer 2008 , David Cameron and his wife were flown in Matthew Freud 's private plane to meet Rupert Murdoch in his yacht , Rosehearty , off a Greek island .
Afterwards , Cameron was flown to Turkey for a family holiday , and Murdoch went on to Corfu for his daughter 's 40th birthday .
Osborne was already in Corfu , on a family holiday that acquired notoriety because Peter Mandelson was also in the area , and what was said in private aboard a yacht owned by the Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska blew up into a political row after they returned to the UK .
The Osborne family was holidaying in a villa owned by Nat Rothschild , in an area of northern Corfu which is so popular with the London set that it is known as " Kensington on Sea " .
David Cameron and his family had previously holidayed there in 2006 .
One guest who has also stayed at the villa said : " It 's an old olive press and olive mill that Jacob Rothschild bought about 25 years ago and which Nat now has .
It has been extensively added to over the year , in a very simple way , so that it sleeps about 20 .
It 's stunningly beautiful and understated . "
He added : " It all seems incredibly cosy .
James Murdoch , Rebekah Wade , Charlie Brooks , Matthew Freud , Elisabeth Murdoch , Cameron and Osborne are all very much at ease with each other .
There is a mix of the social and the political .
It all seems incredibly close . "
No one doubts that it was the Murdochs , father and son , who were behind yesterday 's announcement in The Sun , rather than the paper 's new editor , Dominic Mohan .
" Everybody was involved to a greater or lesser extent , " one senior member of the editorial staff said .
" Were Rupert and James involved ?
The answer to that is that they are always involved in something as important as this .
Rupert created The Sun .
He 's not going to just leave it to someone else .
It 's his baby . "
But it was not all socialising – there was some politics .
Executives at News International have been particularly exercised by the threat to newspapers posed by the BBC 's website .
Speaking at the Edinburgh festival in August , James Murdoch , the son of News International 's founder , described the BBC 's reach as " chilling " .
He also complained about the media regulator , Ofcom .
Keen to oblige , David Cameron has promised to abolish Ofcom and scale back the BBC .
The probability now is that Murdoch 's other daily newspaper , The Times , will follow its tabloid stablemate .
Although Tories complain about the closeness between New Labour and some Times political writers , the newspaper has its strong links with the Tories too .
There is thought to be a job in a Cameron government and a peerage awaiting the Times chief leader writer , Danny Finkelstein , if he chooses to take it .
Finkelstein was Osborne 's intellectual mentor when the two worked for the former Tory leader William Hague .
The Times editor , James Harding , fits perfectly within the Cameron social set .
He and George Osborne were pupils at the same public schools , St Pauls , as teenagers .
He and Cameron played tennis together before Cameron became an MP and in 2006 they were reported to be staying together at the Rothschild villa in Corfu .
Harding 's fiancée , Kate , is the daughter of the financier , Sir Mark Weinberg , Jacob Rothschild 's business partner .
But all this back history did not diminish the shock felt at the Labour party conference in Brighton when news of The Sun 's front page hit them .
It was a shock , above all for Gordon Brown , who has also tried hard to cultivate the Murdoch clan .
In the final days of Tony Blair 's premiership in 2007 , during one of the farewell parties at 10 Downing Street , guests looked across to the lawn behind No 11 and saw Gordon Brown in conversation with Rupert Murdoch .
When Rebekah Wade and Charlie Brooks celebrated their wedding in June , on the Brooks family estate near Chipping Norton , Gordon Brown was there , as well as David Cameron .
But the difference is that Cameron moves smoothly through these occasions , giving the appearance of someone who is having a good time , but Brown is too obviously there out of a sense of duty .
Brown still believed that his relations with the Murdoch empire were intact on Tuesday afternoon as he was delivering his speech to the Labour Party conference , his biggest speech of the year .
At 6 pm , he put in a routine call to Dominic Mohan , who took over the editorship of The Sun last month .
There have been some famous conversations between Sun editors and prime ministers , including the one in which Kelvin MacKenzie told a beleaguered John Major : " John , let me put it this way .
I 've got a large bucket of shit lying on my desk and tomorrow morning I 'm going to pour it all over your head . "
But this conversation produced no fireworks .
Mohan did not even tell Brown what the next day 's Sun was going to do to him .
In the cold light of morning , Labour had to assess yesterday how much it mattered that their 12 - year rapprochement with The Sun was over .
The last time that Labour lost a general election , in 1992 , The Sun 's continuing support for the Conservatives was reckoned to be decisive , both by the defeated Labour leader Neil Kinnock and by the paper itself , which boasted in a famous headline : " It was The Sun wot won it . "
But that was in the days before the internet , when 24 - hour news was in its infancy and The Sun had a formidable reputation as an opinion former .
Although its executives still argue that The Sun 's eight to 10 million readers are more likely to switch party allegiancethan readers of other newspapers , they are also rather less likely to vote at all .
It is estimated that barely half turned out at the last general election .
And if opinion polls are accurate , Labour under Gordon Brown had already lost the allegiance of a large proportion of those Sun readers who will vote months before yesterday 's bombshell .
Perhaps a suitable headline for today would be " It was The Sun wot followed the general drift of public opinion and joined the winning side . "
Not snappy , but accurate .
A question of policy : Cameron and the Murdochs
The media tycoons have much to gain from a Tory administration :
Abolish Ofcom
James Murdoch has complained that the media regulator is unaccountable , and intervenes far too much , stifling creativity ( and profit ) .
David Cameron agrees .
The Conservative leadership has been making the right noises for the Murdochs this summer .
On 26 June , Ofcom announced it would force Sky to sell premium television football rights for transmission on platforms such as BT .
The next day , Sky vented its anger and said it would appeal – with the hint of further legal proceedings .
On 6 July , Mr Cameron arranged an unscheduled press conference to talk about quangos and announced that , if elected , he would abolish Ofcom .
Curb the BBC
Its income is guaranteed through the licence system , while the profitability of Sky television and the Murdoch newspapers depend on the state of the market .
Mr Cameron is sympathetic .
Wreck the Lisbon Treaty
Rupert Murdoch has never liked the EU , and welcomes anything which holds up further integration .
But if , as expected , the Irish vote to ratify the treaty , Mr Cameron may have to disappoint on this one .
Back the troops in Afghanistan
The Sun accuses Labour of not doing so , but it is not obvious what the Tories would do differently .
They say they might restore three disbanded infantry battalions , but have not said how to pay for it .
It 's a tall order :
Over the next few decades , the world will need to wean itself from dependence on fossil fuels and drastically reduce greenhouse gases .
Current technology will take us only so far ; major breakthroughs are required .
What might those breakthroughs be ?...
California Secretary of State Debra Bowen today authorized the backer of an initiative that would ban divorce to begin collecting signatures to put the proposed constitutional amendment before voters .
John Marcotte now has until March 22 , 2010 , to collect 694,354 signatures of registered voters in order to get the measure on the ballot next year .
The proposal would change the California Constitution to " eliminate the ability of married couples to get divorced in California . "
Couples could still get their marriages annulled under the proposal .
The simplest weapon we ever made .

The CIA Museum is home to many interesting artifacts associated with the Central Intelligence Agency ’s predecessor , the Office of Strategic Services ; foreign intelligence organizations ; and the CIA itself .
The following article is the first in a series that will explore the Agency ’s amazing history through the artifacts in the CIA Museum .
This article focuses on the caltrop .
* * * * *
A caltrop is a device — usually made out of metal — with four spikes arranged in such a way that when any three spikes rest on the ground , the fourth points upward .
They come in all shapes and sizes — from Christmas tree caltrops with jagged edges to caltrops comprised of hollow spikes .
Caltrops are very useful in slowing the advance of troops attacking by vehicle or animal — horses , camels , and war elephants .
The weapon got its name from the star thistle , a weed with a form and function similar to its namesake .
Intelligence Uses
During World War II , caltrops were used extensively for Jedburgh team operations .
The Jedburgh teams were created in the early days of the Office of Strategic Services — the predecessor of today ’s CIA .
The teams of American , British and French officers would parachute into enemy - occupied territory to conduct sabotage .
The Jedburghs scattered caltrops across enemy aircraft runways .
These caltrops were made out of hollow spikes , which could puncture a self - sealing tire and cause it to blow out .
When a fighter plane rolled over a caltrop during take off or landing , the tires would blow out , causing the plane to go into an uncontrollable ground loop and eventually crash .
In more recent examples , caltrops were used during the Korean War .
The United Nations used caltrops against the sneaker - clad Chinese troops .
Today , caltrops are particularly effective when strewn across enemy roadways or airport runways .
History
Caltrops have been used throughout history in Europe , Asia , North Africa and the New World .
However , caltrops are often overlooked in favor of more impressive warfare weaponry , such as bombs or poison gas .
The unfortunate soul who stumbles across a caltrop during battle has healthy fear and respect for the silent weapon .
When encountered , a caltrop can easily puncture pneumatic tires and gravely injure — and sometimes kill — soldiers or animals .
A caltrop could be considered the ideal weapon because they :
Are cheap and easy to make ,
Portable ,
Retrievable and reusable ,
Extremely effective ,
Require no skill or training to use , and
No maintenance or special care .
Macedonia
Caltrops were used as early as 331 B.C. at the Battle of Arbela — or Gaugamela — in what was once Persia .
The Persians sowed caltrops across the battlefield to restrict Macedonian troop movement .
When horses pulling chariots happened across a caltrop at full speed , the chariots were damaged and the horses were gravely injured .
Despite the obstacle created by the caltrops , Alexander the Great of Macedonia was able to navigate through the caltrops and win this battle .
He recognized the caltrop ’s worth as a weapon and used them against other enemies .
Roman Empire
The Romans adopted the caltrop from their encounters with Hellenistic armies .
During the Battle of Nisibis fought in A.D. 217 in what is now southern Turkey , the Romans employed the caltrops in an ingenious manner .
The Romans faked a retreat and dumped caltrops — which quickly sank into the sand — behind them .
As the Parthians followed , horses and camels ran over the caltrops and were made lame , throwing their riders to the ground .
The battle lasted for three days and ended in a draw between the two armies .
Asia
Genghis Kahn encountered caltrops during the Mongol invasions in 1213 when he attempted to attack the main fortress of the Chin Empire .
The land surrounding the fort was littered with caltrops .
After camping out near the fort for nearly a month , Genghis Kahn decided to move on to his next target rather than risk falling victim to a caltrop .
Europe
The Scots also used caltrops against the British during the Battle of Bannockburn fought near Stirling , Scotland , in 1314 .
The Scottish army placed nail caltrops on the battlefield , which ultimately halted the English cavalry and resulted in a British retreat .
Historians say that the use of the caltrop during this battle contributed to the Scottish victory .
New World
Caltrops continued to be used into the 17th century .
A caltrop was found in Jamestown during an archaeological dig .
The English settlers probably used caltrops to discourage surprise attacks by native Americans .
From the early Roman Empire to the Cold War , the caltrop has stood the test of time as a useful weapon .
The CIA Museum currently has a caltrop on display in the Directorate of Science and Technology exhibit .

Although President Barack Obama has more empathy for the opinions of the Islamic world than his predecessor and seems to vaguely understand that they do affect U.S. security , he does n’t seem to understand specifically that U.S. meddling in and occupation of Muslim countries inflames Islamic radicals and is the main cause of blowback anti-U.S. Islamist terrorism .
In Afghanistan , Obama has already thrown in more troops and will probably be goaded by the military and conservatives into further escalation .
This despite a timeline that appears to indicate that the insurgency grows as a reaction to increased foreign presence in the country .
Up until 2005 , U.S. forces were stationed mainly in Kabul , and the Taliban presence in Afghanistan was minimal .
During 2005 , U.S. forces moved out into the rest of the country ; strangely ( or not so strangely ) the Taliban resurgence began in 2006 .
In other words , escalating the number of U.S. forces has the counterproductive effect of merely escalating the conflict .
Obama and the rest of the bipartisan foreign policy establishment have ignored this glaring fact largely because the reverse is perceived to have happened in Iraq .
A U.S. troop surge in 2007 there appears to have significantly dampened ethno- sectarian mayhem and the rebellion against the U.S. occupier .
Yet many experts say the surge had less to do with reducing the violence than did the sectarian separation from prior ethnic cleansing and paying off the Sunni guerrillas not to fight U.S. occupying forces .
After all , for the Iraqi election in 2005 , U.S. forces had the same number of troops as during the surge , yet chaos reined .
And Iraq is " not over till it ’s over , " as the recent massive bombings of Iraqi government buildings have shown .
The restive Sunni militias have not been integrated into Iraq ’s security forces , and one can only wonder what will happen when payments eventually stop .
More similar to Afghanistan than Iraq is the situation in Somalia .
U.S. policymakers worry that the lack of a strong central government and an Islamist insurgency will make that nation a possible haven for al - Qaeda terrorists , but they rarely admit that U.S. policy caused the problem in the first place .
Al - Shabaab , the militant Islamist movement now trying to take over the country , had minimal popular support before the CIA began supporting corrupt Somali warlords .
Normally , Somalis tend to be moderate Muslims .
The U.S. then sponsored and aided Somalia ’s arch rival , Ethiopia , in its invasion of Somalia .
Such foreign intervention and occupation caused popular support for al - Shabaab to skyrocket into the current problem .
If a foreign country were intruding in or occupying the United States , Americans would probably support any force that would push back against outside interference .
In fact , Americans already did .
Why ca n’t a country that was born out of exasperation about British control and occupation understand that people in other countries do n’t like foreign interlopers any better than Americans do ?
After 9/11 , President George W. Bush alleged that al - Qaeda had attacked the U.S. because of its freedoms .
Yet other countries that enjoyed political and economic freedoms were n’t attacked .
Most foreign policy analysts chose to ignore or play down all of Osama bin Laden ’s writings about his reasons for attacking the United States : U.S. meddling in and occupation of Islamic countries .
Why ?
Interventionism – a non-traditional U.S. foreign policy developed after World War II – has many supporting vested interests , especially government security bureaucracies , and thus has bipartisan support .
Foreign interventions bring bigger budgets to such bureaucracies and also secretly subsidize various industries ( for example , U.S. intervention in the Persian Gulf benefits U.S. oil companies ) .
So despite endangering U.S. citizens – through being subjected to 9/11 - style anti-U.S. terrorism – and swelling the ranks of militants and terrorists in Afghanistan , Pakistan , Iraq , and Somalia , U.S. meddling in the Muslim world and elsewhere continues because politically powerful interest groups benefit from the policy at the expense of the general public .
I have come to realize that life has few second chances to offer but instead , many second thoughts and guesses .
I cannot tell you that I did everything I could have or should have done , it just simply would not be true .
I look back now and I know could have and should have done more when I first learned of his abuse almost two years ago .
She could have had that second chance .
I would not be left now with nothing but my second guesses that torment my every waking moment had I stepped in and acted with more insistence , been more persistent and not tried to rely on the hope that she ’d just leave him and things would be hunky dory .
Some women cannot leave .
Krystal was one of them .
She tried a few times .
To our horror we found out that the last time she did he hunted her down and forced her into the trunk of her car where she remained for 2 1 / 2 days .
I can not imagine her terror .
It makes me sick to even think or write about it .
I cannot make any allusion of understanding what it is like for any woman in such a situation .
I am not and have never been in their shoes to ever know the torment they have endured .
What I do understand , and all too well , is from a parents perspective , a fathers perspective - that it was ultimately my job and responsibility to protect my child .
Period .
As I cannot fathom this from an abused woman ’s perspective , you cannot possibly relate to what I feel knowing that as a parent that I failed in the job of protecting her .
Nor do you ever want to be able to relate to what that is like , believe me .
I would n't want you to .
Neither would Krystal .
Krystal was one of those people who could not and would not pass by an animal , child , the elderly or disabled without making a point of acknowledging their presence and making them feel welcome and at ease , that they had a friend .
She choose to become a CNA because she felt she could really help people who needed it most .
And she did .
Many a time she visited the same folks she was payed to care for on her own time and on days off .
The cases that bothered her most were the kids and frail who were dumped in a facilty and left to die alone , she was profoundly disturbed by each one .
When her ex showed up stalking her at her job she called the police .
She was immediately fired .
The day before at our local hospital a deranged ex had shot and killed his ex wife ( a friend of Krystals ) in the parking lot , the facility did n't want the liability of some deranged asshole hunting her down like that at theirs .
The thing that bothered her more than losing her job was her concern for a particular patient , a man dying of AIDS who had been literally and figuratively dumped at the door .
Other workers treated him as if he had the plague .
He had no one .
He had Krystal .
She was all he had .
She was frantic , " now he has no one , none of those people give a shit about him " .
Although she was going through all that she was , her focus of concern was so unselfishly on someone who'd been a total stranger to her just a week or so before and his well being .
That was just her .
We all need a bit of that great sense of empathy she had .
It goes a long way .
It can change someone life .
I really do feel that she'd be highly upset with me if I did n't use what has happened to her to try to reach others and hopefully , maybe , someone will read it and reach out to help out someone in a similar situation .
It need n't end as it did for her .
We are still here , we are still alive , there are many more victims of DV out there who are , and like her patient , some times all they need is to know that someone does care .
Someone like you .
I do n't know if this is the penitence I am forced to pay , all of these second guesses or what .
The could have , should have , would have thoughts , but I do know that they have continuously and persistently tormented me to the point of illness both physically and mentally .
My wife even more so than I .
We are not the same people we were nor do I see how we can ever be again .
We all got into this life knowing , even expecting to die .
Knowing that some day we would unfortunately have to bear the awful witness and pain to our parents deaths .
Few , if any of us ever envision that of our child’s .
No loved one ’s death is easy , a child ’s death is overwhelming .
A murdered child is even worse .
Unfortunately , I know this to be true ...
In 1991 my son ran out in front of a car while chasing a ball and was hit and killed by a car .
I cannot say that I ever got over it , no one " gets over it " .
What I can say is that the biggest question haunting me about Krystals death is simply , WHY ?
I did n’t have to grapple with that question with Bryans death , I knew it was an accident .
I knew there was nothing that I or any one could ’ve done to prevent it from happening .
This is so much , so radically different because I know that there were a million missed opportunities that could have prevented this from ever happening .
I only needed one .
Now I 'd give my life for that one .
If there is anything to be gained out of this horror , if I could point out what it is I wish for you to take away from reading this it is two things .
I have not and cannot come up with any better wording than when I wrote about Krystals death here originally and I implore each and every one of you that have knowledge of any woman suffering as a victim of domestic violence to understand that you , too , could be but one instance away from the same anguish my wife and I now are having to deal with .
Please take my words here to heart :
Get involved .
Be a voice for one silenced , stand up for someone beaten down , say something that needs to be said , be there where you have n't been before , step up for those being stepped on , ask questions , demand answers , stand up but never never ever stand by or stand down when you know you are witnessing spousal abuse / violence .
DO something .
Get involved .
These women are our mothers , our sisters , and daughters .
This shit has to stop .
http://www.dailykos.com/...
Do not stand back and allow a victim to remain a victim .
Get involved .
So many victims cannot or will not come forward , they may feel you would not understand .
They may feel ashamed or guilty or feel they cannot talk about it .
Let them know you are there and that they can talk about it .
Do not judge them , they are victims and may see no way out of the hell they are enduring .
Let them know that there is a way out , become a part of that way .
Offer them the information they may fear seeking .
Just do n't ignore it .
Just do n't ignore them .
They need you .
They need all of us .
If you are a victim of domestic violence , please , seek help .
There are many great organizations awaiting your call or email that not only can help but will .
It does not need to continue and you should not have to live in fear of the next incident .
You may not survive the next incident .
Do n't wait until there is nothing you can do , instead , do n't stop until there 's nothing left that you have n't done .
Unfortunately , it really is a matter of life and death .
Maybe not the last time , maybe not this time , maybe not the next , but how many chances do you think you 'll have to intervene ?
You may only have the next one .
I wish I had one more ...

The second thing ?
I know from experience just how difficult it is trying to come up with the right words to say to someone that has just lost a loved one .
It is very difficult , honestly , I am no better at it than anyone else .
I am not downing anyone for their attempts to offer words of condolence because I truly know just how difficult it is .
Some of it is ingrained in us and we can only say what we think is right in that moment for that moment .
We all mean well and what we may say is well intended but think about this ...
Some things you might try to refrain from saying .
" She is in a better place " . .
" It was Gods will " .
" This is parts of Gods plan "
" She is n’t suffering any more "
Last : all of us say this , " if there is anything I can do , please call and let me know " .
Well I know we would all do whatever , whenever , and however , by any means necessary IF that person ever DID call but did you ever notice that they never call ?
Because they have n’t does not necessarily mean that they want to be left alone , they may really need you but feel they would be bothering or imposing upon you with their problems .
Grief of a loved one lost is devastating and those you care about may never reach out to you as a result , even if they want to so badly .
So remember when you say those words to keep saying them , keep calling , keep stopping by , keep offering .
The worst and loneliest time is directly after a funeral , when every leaves the house and goes home and you are left with nothing but your thoughts , believe me , I know .
The following was sent to my wife by a friend of hers who also lost a child .
I think it exemplifies what I am trying to say :
I ’ve never lost a child before ,
and I do n’t understand
all of these emotions I am feeling .
Will you try to understand and help me ?
Please let me mourn .
I may appear together , but I am not .
Often times it hurts so much
I can hardly bear it .
Please let me mourn .
Do n’t expect too much from me .
I will try to
help you know what I can and cannot handle .
Sometimes I am not always sure .
Please let me mourn .
Let me talk about my child , I need to talk .
It ’s
part of the heeling .
Do n’t pretend nothing has
happened .
It hurts terribly when you do , I
love my child very much and my memories
are all I have .
They are very precious to me .

Please let me mourn and thank you
for helping me
through the most difficult time of my life .
My wife and I thank all of you for any and every word of support , sympathy and condolence offered since our nightmare began .
We thank those of you who reached out personally with the help we needed at a very difficult moment , it has not been forgotten , nor will it .
I assure you .
UPDATE : Well , another long day , you have no idea of how good it was to come home and see just how many of you read this and are moved to action .
We really do appreciate it , it is all we really ask , to get involved .
I thank every one of you who have , or plan to do something , these women having to deal with this crap are indeed ALL of our sisters , mothers , and daughters .
When one suffers so do we all .
For Krystal :
In the last decade , Al Gore has won the triple crown : an Oscar , a Nobel Peace Prize , and ( this is disputed ) Florida .
Now , winning an Oscar is hard — you usually have to pretend to be handicapped , or speak with a semi- convincing English accent , or spend hours in an uncomfortable period costume .
And Gore himself would have trouble telling you how to claim the Sunshine State .
But the Nobel Prize is easy .
The important thing to remember is that peace does n't have much to do with it .
One of the very first winners was Theodore Roosevelt , a man who described the Spanish - American War as " fun . "
The Peace Prize is more of a Humanitarian of the Year Award , with humanitarian defined loosely enough to include Yasser Arafat and Henry Kissinger .
Broadly speaking , there are three ways to get it :
1 . Be a famous humanitarian .
This is the obvious approach .
It is also the hardest .
The Nobel Peace Prize has been awarded to Albert Schweitzer , who built hospitals in Africa ; to Norman Borlaug , who developed high - yield strains of wheat ; to Muhammed Yunus , who devised a new method of giving loans to low - income entrepreneurs ; and to the Dalai Lama , who…actually , I 'm not sure what the Dalai Lama does , but evidently it impresses a lot of people .
Does your achievement need to be related to peace ?
It can — as with , say , Linus Pauling , who capped off an impressive scientific career with a crusade against above - ground nuclear testing .
But the peace angle is n't necessary .
It is n't even strictly necessary that your accomplishments be as impressive in practice as they are in your intentions .
( You 'll note that Gore has not actually stopped global warming . )
The best way to get credit in Oslo is to conduct your humanitarian pursuits while working with some vast global agency .
Indeed , if you do n't think you have the chops to , say , revolutionize Third World agriculture , you can always get a Peace Prize the next way :
2. Start an international organization .
Or , if you can swing it , be an international organization .
Over the years , the Nobel Peace Prize has gone to Amnesty International , Doctors Without Borders , the UN's International Labor Organization , and the Red Cross .
Gore himself will share his prize with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change .
The Peace Prize has also gone to Cordell Hull , who helped found the United Nations ; to Dag Hammarskjöld , the former head of the United Nations ; to Kofi Annan , another former head of the United Nations ; and to a wide range of delegates to and officials within the United Nations .
UNICEF won it once .
The UN 's refugee office won it twice .
When Annan took the prize , he shared it with the entire United Nations .
And before there was a United Nations , the Nobel committee promoted the League of Nations .
( In 1919 it gave the prize to League founder Woodrow Wilson , whose previous contribution to peace was to plunge the United States into the most pointless major war in its history . )
Before there was a League of Nations , the Nobel committee honored groups like the Inter - Parliamentary Union and the Institute for International Law .
Now , some of those organizations do worthy things .
But they do n't have much to do with peace , unless you define peace as " international cooperation . "
Sometimes , as with Amnesty International and Doctors Without Borders , that means a bottom - up movement of individuals collaborating across national lines .
More often the award honors institutions of global governance , whether or not they 're particularly pacific .
One year it went to the UN 's peacekeeping forces , which advance the cause of peace by shooting people .
You 'll see a similar trend in the non-institutional figures who win the Peace Prize .
Occasionally it goes to a Carl von Ossietzky , a Martin Luther King , an Andrei Sakharov , a Lech Walesa — that is , to a person nonviolently struggling against an oppressive state .
But the award is as likely to go to a current or former government official : a George Marshall , a Willy Brandt , a Mikhail Gorbachev , a Jimmy Carter .
Some of those statesmen are n't exactly pacifists , which leads us to the third and easiest way to win the Peace Prize :
3 . Kill a lot of people , then stop .
In 1973 , the Nobel Peace Prize was shared by Henry Kissinger and Le Duc Tho .
Kissinger 's CV included the " secret " bombing of Cambodia and the " Christmas " bombing of North Vietnam ; just a month before his prize was announced , he was complicit in the coup that installed a brutal dictatorship in Chile .
So why did he win ?
Because he and Tho had reached a truce to end the Vietnam War .
Tho was n't a particularly peaceful man either , but at least he had the common courtesy to refuse the award .
More recently , the prize went to Palestine Liberation Organization chief Yasser Arafat , a man whose career to that point had been spent arranging terrorist assaults on civilians .
He shared the award with Israel 's Shimon Peres and Yitzhak Rabin ; the three of them , like Kissinger and Tho , had negotiated an end to a war .
In this case the peace agreement did n't hold , and both the state of Israel and various Palestinian groups went on to produce many more corpses .
So do n't worry if you develop a taste for blood during the initial stage of your Peace Prize campaign :
You 're free to resume killing once Mr. Nobel 's money is safely in your hands .
By this method , the prize could conceivably go next year to Dick Cheney , the Janjaweed , or anyone else in a position to bring a war to a temporary stop .
That someone could be you !
My advice to anyone who wants to follow in the footsteps of Linus Pauling and the Dalai Lama is to fuse approaches two and three .
Start an NGO devoted to murder and mayhem — something on the SPECTRE / Al Qaeda / Medellin Cartel model — and then agree to a truce .
In theory , you could accomplish this in an afternoon , but to make a splash big enough to impress the Nobel judges it 's probably best to bargain with something larger than the Nashville Police Department 's hostage negotiations unit .
Choose your target wisely .
Either that , or make a movie .

Hi LMB lovely to see you x
Hi Pronkie x
Glenn Beck libertarian , liberty movement , Mark Levin libertarian , Ron Paul supporters , Sean Hannity libertarian , Tea Part movement
Somehow , it ’s become trendy among the right to call yourself a libertarian .
Glenn Beck has boasted himself a libertarian as well as Mark Levin .
The new addition to the conservative , wanna - be libertarians is none other than the war trumpeter , Sean Hannity .
On his radio show on Wednesday , Hannity jumped on the bandwagon , declaring himself a libertarian .
Perhaps Hannity does not understand the libertarian perspective on privacy , foreign policy and immigration .
If he did , he would realize calling himself a libertarian is like calling Castro a capitalist .
The recent conservative trend toward libertarianism makes sense .
Libertarianism is enjoying a new - found popularity , due in a large part to the efforts of former presidential candidate , Ron Paul .
But most importantly , the trend makes dollar sense as proved by the ratings of Fox News ’ Glenn Beck show .
But to understand why libertarianism is so popular , it ’s important to understand the rise of what is called the liberty movement .
The liberty movement was birthed during the anti-civil liberties and pro-war years of the Bush regime .
The movement ’s first joiners were disillusioned conservatives and former Republicans .
The PATRIOT Act , ‘ war on terror , ’ bailout of Wall Street and numerous other actions by the Republican administration caused many former right - wingers to take a long , hard look in the mirror .
However , the liberty movement did n’t stop with the right .
The anti-war and civil liberty aspects also appealed to many on the left .
And when Ron Paul began his grassroots bid for the presidency , peoples of all leanings began to join .
Sadly , the momentum continued up until the election of President Barack Obama .
Assuming “ change ” had arrived , many of the loudest anti-war advocates on the left disappeared .
Liberal media voices that previously served as civil - liberty watchdogs under the Bush administration lost interest in such matters .
However , what is happening on the right is of much more concern .
Former Bush - supporting , PATRIOT
Act - loving warmongers are suddenly “ converting ” to libertarianism .
The first was self - described conservative Glenn Beck .
Since Beck ’s transition to Fox news , his rating have soared .
His show is quickly dominating the 5 p.m. timeslot .
Beck , perhaps in a stroke of genius , has tapped into the liberty movement .
With his claim of libertarianism and promotion of events such as the “ 9 - 12 Project , ” Beck is attempting to become the poster boy for the disenfranchised , former Ron Paul supporters .
Conservative talk show host and author of best - seller , Liberty and Tyranny , Mark Levin , is also channeling the liberty movement .
In a recent interview with Pajama TV , Levin declared :
“ I ’m not a party guys down the line .
I ’m a conservative guy when it comes to economic matters .
Frankly , I ’m more libertarian . ”
However , Levin went on to reveal his true conservative colors saying liberal newspapers in America are “ working overtime ” to get Democrats elected .
“ We ’re facing a force in this country that requires us to take back , from my perspective , the Republican party as Reagan did , ” he said .
In the same interview , Levin talked about President Barack Obama ’s weakness in dealing with , what he described as , “ Nut job , genocidal regimes . ”
He labeled President Obama the “ quintessential appeaser ” saying “ He talks and talks , that ’s what he does . ”
Levin also referred to the glory days when America was considered the “ greatest force on the face of the earth . ”
Speaking of Presidents Ronald Reagan , John F. Kennedy and Franklyn D. Roosevelt he said :
“ When these guys would talk about America , they talked about America in the most glowing terms .
They did think it was a special country .
They were really were honored to be president of the greatest force on the face of the earth . ”
Such rhetoric could not be further from the libertarian mindset .
Like Levin , the newest addition to the “ libertarians , ” Sean Hannity , is a poorly - hidden wolf in sheep ’s clothing .
Not only is libertarianism at odds with these men over issues such as the ‘ war on terror ’ and civil liberties , it has little , save economics , in common with them .
Take , for example , this excerpt from the Libertarian party ’s Web site on the issue of immigration :
“ Yet our system offers no legal channel for anywhere near a sufficient number of peaceful , hardworking immigrants to legally enter the United States even temporarily to fill this growing gap .
The predictable result is illegal immigration . ”
Such a common sense , humanistic view of immigration would undoubtedly be labeled liberal propaganda by Beck , Hannity and Levin .
While it ’s doubtful staunch Ron Paul supporters will be swayed by these men ’s deceitful attempts , many pro-liberty conservatives that “ saw the light ” during the Bush administration are already buying in to them .
Glenn Beck ’s ratings are proof .
The branding and image of a company is extremely important , because ultimately a good image leads to more sales – period .
Psychology dictates that a person is more likely to buy a product / service if they have an emotional attachment ( which can be achieved visually ) to that product or service in the way it is presented .
In basic terms , if a visitor “ likes ” your website they ’re more inclined to buy something from it .
The way you can build an emotional attachment is through design aesthetics which create a feel of quality or affordability ( dependent on which image you ’re going for ) .
So , how do you go about planning and implementing a design such that you produce one that presents a positive image ?
Have you always wanted to adopt a technique that allows you to plan and develop the aesthetics of a website , logo , or poster design to a high degree ?
Well , I think mood boards are for you .
A mood board is a collage of your ideas and inspiration for any design work , whether it be web or print , in the form of visual representations .
It ’s like brainstorming , but solely for the development of a design ’s aesthetics and feel , rather than its content and other plans as well .
Mood boards are not just visual representations , they represent the emotion you wish to portray across your work – because it is emotion that creates the look and feel of a design of any kind .
Mood boards are absolutely brilliant , because you can use anything you like to develop them .
Let ’s say , you come across a texture on a piece of old cloth you have lying around the house , and you feel you could implement that texture in your design , you could simply cut it up and make it apart of your board .
Like the font spacing and style in a magazine article you read ?
Cut it out , and stick it on .
You can develop mood boards digitally using your favorite design software , or by hand ( which is what I prefer ) using real cut-outs and materials .
Mood boards are used in a whole array of abstract disciplines such as :
Interface design
Website design
Brand design
Marketing communication ( commercials )
Movies
Storyboarding
Video game design
Painting
Fashion
Music
Examples of Mood Boards
So , what should I include on my mood board ?
Color palette / wheel
Shapes and textures
Effects ( such as ripple of water on the 4th mood board )
Lighting
Vivid imagery
Color combination
A mood board is for your own use , there is nothing that must necessarily be included on it .
Include what ever you wish to include that you feel will help you develop the look and feel of the design in your own mind , so you can aptly translate that when you construct the design .
If you need to add a process to your work flow which helps you attain excellent results , then I think mood boards are for you .
You do n’t need to spend hours on end creating one either , just collate bits and bobs you find useful and interesting as you go along your usual day - to - day business .
By the time it comes to designing the piece , you ’ll have naturally gathered good inspiration and ideas by passively using a mood board previously .

A PROBATIONARY driver 's estimated alcohol reading and speed - and the fact that she was driving naked at the time - were used as evidence yesterday to commit the teenager for trial on culpable driving .
Jessica Maree Langford , 19 , pleaded not guilty to the charge and to dangerous driving causing the death of her boyfriend at Hastings on November 29 last year .

Melbourne Magistrates Court heard that Langford 's speed was calculated at 104 km/h in a 90 km/h zone and her blood alcohol concentration at .09 about two hours after the crash .
She and Daniel Andrew Glover , 19 , had been '' skinny dipping ' ' at Shoreham around midnight and remained naked after using their clothes to dry off .
Langford later told police they had been drinking at the beach and that swimming in the nude had been fun , but denied any sexual activity happened while driving .
50,000 line up for housing aid in Detroit
By Jerry White
8 October 2009
Police guard the North entrance of Cobo Hall as thousands look on
An estimated 50,000 residents of Detroit filed into Cobo Hall convention center on Wednesday seeking assistance to pay utility bills and keep from being evicted from their homes .
City officials , who expected around 3,000 people to apply for the aid , were overwhelmed by the turnout .
In a scene reminiscent of the crowds of jobless workers who lined up for free soup during the Great Depression , a queue of tens of thousands of workers and unemployed people wound around the downtown arena .
Young mothers pushing baby carriages , disabled workers in wheelchairs , senior citizens and throngs of young workers and youth stood for hours waiting .
Many had slept on the streets the previous evening to be the first served .
Several people fainted during the wait and were treated by medical personnel on the scene .
By 11:30 a.m. , Detroit ’s mayor , David Bing , made a public appeal for citizens to stop coming to Cobo Hall .
Hundreds of police , including officers from Detroit ’s special Gang Unit , stood guard at the entrances to hold back the crowd .
Several people were reportedly injured in the rush to enter the building after the police finally opened the doors around noon .
Those in line were funneled through the glass doors and quickly sped toward a table where they were handed applications and told they had to fill them out and deposit them in boxes before a 2 p.m. deadline .
Wednesday was the last day for residents to apply for the city ’s Homeless Prevention and Rapid Re-Housing Program ( HPRP ) .
The program , funded by a $ 15.2 million grant from the Obama administration 's stimulus program , will provide assistance to only about 3,400 people , according to Constance Bell , a spokesperson for the program .
In addition to the 50,000 applications given out Wednesday , an additional 30,000 were distributed previously , Bell said .
This means that only about one out of 23 people who applied will see any money .
The large turnout was based on fast - spreading rumors that the city was providing $ 3,000 to low - income families in need of aid .
Such is the level of economic desperation in the city — where the official jobless rate is 29 percent and more than one - third of the population lives below the official poverty line — that tens of thousands showed up .
The vast majority will not qualify for the aid , the city spokesperson admitted .
The HPRP program only provides temporary assistance to pay utility bills for those who are already homeless or facing pending evictions or foreclosures .
Moreover , it will be paid only to those who are able to keep up their housing payments after receiving the aid .
No money will be used to make mortgage payments .
People wait outside the North entrance of Cobo Hall
Rather than informing those who showed up that their efforts were likely to be in vain , city officials continued to hand out and collect applications for the program .
Their overwhelming concern was to prevent an angry outburst from people who had suffered the indignity of waiting for hours and being manhandled by the cops .
The lack of preparation and disorganization at the event is an indication of how distant government officials are from the reality confronting the working class and the extent of the social crisis .
The 80,000 households that applied for assistance represent roughly a third of the city ’s population .
The real jobless rate in Detroit is much higher than the official figure of 29 percent , due to the tens of thousands who have given up looking for nonexistent jobs .
This crisis has been exacerbated by the forced bankruptcies and restructuring of General Motors and Chrysler by the Obama administration , which , with the support of the United Auto Workers , destroyed thousands of jobs and slashed the wages and benefits of auto workers and retirees .
Particularly striking were the thousands of young workers lining up for assistance .
Thirty years ago , a large number of these young people would have been employed in city ’s many auto factories .
Since 1970 , however , the city has lost three - quarters of its manufacturing jobs , wiping out the jobs of 250,000 workers .
Today , there is nothing but low - paying jobs for young workers , without the slightest economic security .
Last month , tens of thousands of workers lined up at the state fair grounds in Detroit after the regional gas and electric company , DTE Energy , announced it was offering help to distressed homeowners and renters .
According to a report last month in the Detroit News , Michigan ’s two largest power companies , DTE Energy and Consumers Energy , last year cut off heating to a total of 181,000 customers .
DTE has already shut off energy to 115,000 households , a pace that will far surpass last year ’s 142,000 cutoffs .
Detroit — which used to boast one of the highest rates of home ownership in the nation -- had the top home foreclosure rate in 2006 and 2007 , and still ranks among the highest in the US .
Detroit ’s economic decline has been long in the making .
The living standards won by auto workers gave the Motor City the highest per capita income in the nation in the 1950s .
The last three decades , beginning with the Chrysler bailout of 1979 - 80 , has seen an unrelenting assault on the working class by big business and the government , culminating in Obama ’s restructuring of GM and Chrysler .
The deindustrialization of Detroit was symbolic of the shift by American capitalism from manufacturing to the most parasitic forms of financial speculation .
At 15.2 percent , the state of Michigan has the highest unemployment rate in the US .
Over the past decade , as the auto industry was downsized , Michigan lost 870,000 jobs .
The number is expected to rise to one million by late next year .
Even as the demand for social services increases , state and city governments are slashing spending for housing , education and health care to cope with large budget deficits .
The Obama administration , which handed trillions to Wall Street , has offered no similar bailout to the states or the estimated 15 million people who are now unemployed .
The state of Michigan — facing a $ 2.8 billion deficit — is slashing programs across the board .
On the same day that thousands lined up for housing assistance , Detroit ’s Democratic Mayor David Bing , a multi-millionaire businessman , announced a “ turnaround ” plan to cut $ 500 million over the next two years by permanently shrinking city government , selling off public assets , privatizing and cutting services , and laying off more than 1,000 city workers .
The economic crisis is bringing much of the rest of the country to similar straits as in Detroit and Michigan .
Scenes of economic desperation are increasingly common throughout the country , with free clinics attracting crowds of thousands in California , Texas and other states , and thousands of people lining up for a handful of available jobs .
The US is experiencing a social crisis unparalleled since the 1930s .
In the face of this crisis , the Obama administration is offering no serious relief to the tens of millions of working people who face economic ruin .
The tragic scene that unfolded Wednesday in Detroit underscores the derisory character of Obama ’s so - called “ stimulus ” and “ recovery ” schemes .
The White House has rejected out of hand any public works program to put the unemployed to work .
Instead , all of its policies — from the Wall Street bailout , to the attack on auto workers , to its plans to slash health care costs — are designed to protect the wealth and power of the financial elite .
The granting system turns young scientists into bureaucrats and then betrays them

Funding :
No external funding was received for this work .
“ O , how full of briers is this working - day world ! ” — William Shakespeare , “ As You Like It ” It is a summer day in 2009 in Cambridge , England , and K. ( 39 ) looks out of his lab window , wondering why he chose the life of a scientist [ 1 ] .
Yet it had all begun so well !
His undergraduate studies in Prague had excited him about biomedical research , and he went on to a PhD at an international laboratory in Heidelberg .
There , he had every advantage , technical and intellectual , and his work had gone swimmingly .
He had moved to a Wellcome - funded research institute in England in 1999 .
And although his postdoc grant , as is typical , was for only two years , he won a rare career development award that gave him some independence for four more years .
A six - year postdoc was an unusual opportunity , and it allowed him to define his own research field .
By 2004 , he had published six experimental papers in good journals , and on four of these , he was first author .
It was the high point in his career , and when he applied for posts in Cambridge , London , Stanford , and Tubingen , he was short - listed for them all .
He chose Cambridge University and a Royal Society Research Fellowship that offered him up to ten years ' salary .
This should have brought the peace of mind to plan projects that would take five years , or even longer .
So , what went wrong ?
It had taken almost a year to prepare , submit , and be awarded his initial research grant ( for late 2005 – late 2008 ) from a publicly funded agency in the UK , the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council ( BBSRC ) .
Immediately , he hired a technician and started to train her carefully .
During early 2006 , he took on a postdoc , Frieda , and a student , and they both settled in well .
However , by mid 2007 , K. began to worry about his future : although the BBSRC grant had run for less than two years , it was already high time to apply for another .
He submitted a new application in October 2007 and , although it was well reviewed and received a high rating , he found out in spring 2008 that it was not funded .
As an insurance , he had concocted a different project ( you cannot submit to different agencies with the same plans ) and sent it to Cancer Research , UK , in February 2008 — this application was also excellently reviewed but also turned down in August 2008 .
Now he was near the end of his initial grant , and his technician , who had a family to support , left to take a more secure job in a nearby research institute — laying waste to all her specialised knowledge that they had both worked so hard to build .
Soon , Frieda 's postdoc grant was about to end , so K. applied to several local colleges and trusts to keep her going , but won her only another 6 months ' salary .
Becoming anxious and not sleeping well , he had approached the Wellcome Trust in the autumn of 2008 with a rewritten and updated version of the rejected BBSRC project .
But , with her extra 6 months over in April 2009 and no security ( she has two small children ) , Frieda had been concentrating less and less on her work ; she reluctantly abandoned her lifelong ambition to be a researcher .
She looked for a job in science publishing or in the granting agencies — both of which , ironically , offer better working conditions and much better security of employment than research .
That morning , Frieda had been offered a post as assistant editor of a journal , and it was time to organise her leaving party .
So , on this summer day in 2009 , K. has one student left in his group and has one grant application outstanding .
If he gets the grant , the salary dedicated for Frieda could be given to a new postdoc , but that person would have to be trained all over again .
Yes , the second half of 2007 and all of 2008 had been a nightmare — 14 of these 18 months had been almost entirely devoted to writing grant applications .
K. now sees how he has changed from being an enthusiastic scientist into an insecure bureaucrat .
He feels he has lost much of his last 3 years and wasted his BBSRC grant , despite doing his very best ( see Box 1 ) .
Box 1 . Scientists Speak Out : A Broken System
“ What a strange business this is : We stay in school forever .
We have to battle the system with only a one in eight or one in ten chance of getting funded .
We give up making a living until our forties .
And we do it because we want to help the world .
What kind of crazy person would go for that ? ” — Nancy Andrews , Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs and Dean of the Duke University School of Medicine “ The present fashion is for BIG projects , generated from above .
This view was boosted by the Human Genome Project , and while some big projects work , they erode the anarchic and creative spirit that drives science forward .
Students and post - docs see this , and it is hard for their idealism to persist . ” — Marvin Wickens , Max Perutz Professor of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry , University of Wisconsin - Madison “ The problem is , over and over again , that many very creative young people , who have demonstrated their creativity , can't figure out what the system wants of them — which hoops should they jump through ?
By the time many young people figure out the system , they are so much a part of it , so obsessed with keeping their grants , that their imagination and instincts have been so muted ( or corrupted ) that their best work is already behind them .
This is made much worse by the US system in which assistant professors in medical schools will soon have to raise their own salaries .
Who would dare to pursue risky ideas under these circumstances ?
Who could dare change their research field , ever ? ” — Ted Cox , Edwin Grant Conklin Professor of Biology , Director of the Program on Biophysics , Princeton University “ One can not run a small one - grant lab here — there just are n't enough funds in a single NIH grant ( which typically provides about $ 225,000 in direct costs / year ) to pay for a PI salary ( especially at medical centers ) , plus supplies , plus the salaries of one or two other people ( not to mention tuition , which we also have to pay some part of for grad students ) .
Even with three grants — which are mighty hard to get and harder to maintain — so much money goes for salaries that there is barely enough left over to do an experiment .
So the system demands writing more and more grants and doing fewer and fewer experiments .
I feel like I 'm always writing some summary , justifying how some small pot of money was spent , and how this endeavor differs from the other ongoing efforts in my lab ( most agencies of course want to believe that they are the sole source of funding for a particular project ) .
In other words , the system just does n't work ” — Richard Mann , Professor , Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics , Columbia University “ After 30 or so years of research , I went through a period of two and a half years without funding , despite eight applications .
Last year , I did finally achieve a further three years funding with two grant applications .
But what was achieved by this delay ?
Programs that should have begun over 2 years ago have been held back , allowing our competitors in other countries to get ahead .
The funded grants are no better than those that were turned down . ” — Michael Glazer , Professor of Physics , University of Oxford “ You can write a grant for an important project for which there is ample pilot data .
It can be very well reviewed but still fail to be funded .
Money is limited , and maybe the projects funded are even better , so you cannot necessarily complain .
But the issue is wastage .
The pilot data may go nowhere — just languish in a drawer .
Expertise will be lost — the applicants will have to work on something else .
Eventually , someone else may repeat the work and bring it to publication , but without the advantage of knowing what had already been done .
So the previous investment of the funding bodies is wasted . ” — David Strutt , Senior Research Fellow , Professor , Department of Biomedical Science , University of Sheffield “ People do not realize that when it comes to arguing their case for more funding , scientists who do basic research are the least articulate , least organized , and least temperamentally equipped to justify what they are doing .
In a society where selling is so important , where the medium is the message , these handicaps can spell extinction . ” — Arthur Kornberg , Nobel Laureate in Physiology or Medicine ( deceased 2007 ) Editor 's note :
The above comments were e-mailed to the author , with the exceptions of the quotes from Nancy Andrews ( see [ 4 ] ) and Arthur Kornberg ( see [ 15 ] ) .
K.'s plight ( an authentic one ) illustrates how the present funding system in science eats its own seed corn [ 2 ] .
To expect a young scientist to recruit and train students and postdocs as well as producing and publishing new and original work within two years ( in order to fuel the next grant application ) is preposterous .
It is neither right nor sensible to ask scientists to become astrologists and predict precisely the path their research will follow — and then to judge them on how persuasively they can put over this fiction .
It takes far too long to write a grant because the requirements are so complex and demanding .
Applications have become so detailed and so technical that trying to select the best proposals has become a dark art .
For postdoctoral fellowships , there are so many arcane and restrictive rules that applicants frequently find themselves to be of the wrong nationality , in the wrong lab , too young , or too old .
Young scientists who make the career mistake of concentrating on their research may easily miss the deadline for the only grant they might have won .
Research institutes with their own funds can solve these problems , but grant holders like K. do not have any flexibility .
The real world of science has no tidy banks of pigeonholes , each one occupied for a standard period by an exemplary student or a perfect postdoc .
Grantsmanship and the Application Process “ Scientists might have had a Hippocratic oath of their own .
They might have promised their gifts to mankind .
But instead , I have fathered a race of inventive dwarfs who can be hired for anything . ” — Bertolt Brecht “ The Life of Galileo , ” version by David Hare After more than 40 years of full - time research in developmental biology and genetics , I wrote my first grant and showed it to those experienced in grantsmanship .
They advised me my application would not succeed .
I had explained that we did n't know what experiments might deliver , and had acknowledged the technical problems that beset research and the possibility that competitors might solve problems before we did .
My advisors said these admissions made the project look precarious and would sink the application .
I was counselled to produce a detailed , but straightforward , program that seemed realistic — no matter if it were science fiction .
I had not mentioned any direct application of our work : we were told a plausible application should be found or created .
I was also advised not to put our very best ideas into the application as it would be seen by competitors — it would be safer to keep those ideas secret .
The peculiar demands of our granting system have favoured an upper class of skilled scientists who know how to raise money for a big group [ 3 ] .
They have mastered a glass bead game that rewards not only quality and honesty , but also salesmanship and networking .
A large group is the secret because applications are currently judged in a way that makes it almost immaterial how many of that group fail , so long as two or three do well .
Data from these successful underlings can be cleverly packaged to produce a flow of papers — essential to generate an overlapping portfolio of grants to avoid gaps in funding .
Thus , large groups can appear effective even when they are neither efficient nor innovative .
Also , large groups breed a surplus of PhD students and postdocs that flood the market ; many boost the careers of their supervisors while their own plans to continue in research are doomed from the outset .
The system also helps larger groups outcompete smaller groups , like those headed by younger scientists such as K .
It is no wonder that the average age of grant recipients continues to rise [ 4 ] .
Even worse , sustained success is most likely when risky and original topics are avoided and projects tailored to fit prevailing fashions — a fact that sticks a knife into the back of true research [ 5 ] .
As Sydney Brenner has said , “ Innovation comes only from an assault on the unknown ” [ 6 ] .
How did all this come about ?
Perhaps because the selection process is influenced by two sets of people who see things differently .
The first are the granting organisations whose employees are charged to spend the money wisely and who believe that the more detailed and complex the applications are , the more accurately they will be judged and compared .
Over the years , the application forms have become encrusted with extra requirements .
Universities have whole departments devoted to filling in the financial sections of these forms .
Liaison between the scientists and these departments and between the scientists and employees of the granting agencies has become more and more Kafkaesque .
The second set of people are the reviewers and the committee , usually busy scientists who themselves spend much time writing grants .
They try to do their best as fast as they can .
Generally , each reviewer reads just one or two applications and is asked to give each a semiquantitative rating ( “ outstanding , ” “ nationally competitive , ” etc. ) .
Any such rating must be whimsical because each reviewer sees few grants .
It is particularly difficult to rank strongly original grants ; for no one will know their chances of success .
The committee are usually presented with only the applications that have received uniformly positive reviews — perhaps favouring conventional applications that upset no one .
The committee might have 30 grants to place in order of priority , which is vital , as only the top few can be funded .
I wonder if the semiquantitative and rather spurious ratings help make this ordering just [ 7 ] .
I also suspect any gain in accuracy of assessment due to the detail provided in the applications does not justify the time it takes scientists to produce that detail .
How to “ Restore Science to Its Rightful Place ” [ 8 ]
“ Could we stimulate more discovery and creativity if more scientists had …security of …research support ?
Would this encourage risk - taking and lead to an overall improvement in the quality of science ? ” — Stephen Quake ( Stanford University ) [ 9 ] .
K.'s problems were partly due to the time it took to write his applications and the long lag period between submission and decision .
Drastic simplification of this grant - writing process would help scientists return to the business of doing science .
Grant applications should be much shorter , and if so , scientists would spend less time writing them and less time reviewing other applications .
Since the failure rate is high , these savings of time and effort would be very substantial — in Cambridge University , an average scientist writes about three applications to get one grant ; similarly , in the United States “ after multiple submissions and a protracted process , only about 20 % of grants will ultimately be funded ” [ 4 ] , and the success rate is dropping [ 10 ] ( see Box 2 ) .
Box 2 . Scientists Speak Out : A Path to Reform “ I long ago concluded that grant applications should be short , they should contain ideas , they should have a short turn - around time , and they should invest in a person who has shown they can do original and interesting work .
Shortness has one very important additional virtue not often noticed : a reviewer can actually remember what they 've read .
A typical application in this country runs to 25 pages , they are laden with detail , and they select in the long run for referees who can remember detail , a terrible outcome . ”
— Ted Cox , Princeton University ( Author 's note : the National Institutes of Health has recently reduced the page limit on applications from 25 to 12 – still far too long , in my opinion . )
“ My solution ?
Everyone should get slotted into a funding category and assessed every five years .
If you 're productive , you get five more years of resources .
If productivity is down , you are moved down a category .
If it is high , you can apply to move up .
Starting PIs are in a different category and must apply to get onto the treadmill .
The difference : PIs would be judged by overall productivity , not grantsmanship .
We can stop wasting our time writing grants , and the system can be more easily calibrated to train a sustainable number of postdocs .
It is depressing to train people who will struggle for funding .
A peer - reviewed , 5 - year renewable , productivity - based ‘ track ’ system with a set amount of money at each level would stabilize funding , encourage innovation and productivity , allow each PI to control how their money is allocated , and permit us to make nationwide decisions about the size of our science enterprise .
It also has the merit of simplicity . ” — Ross Cagan , Professor of Developmental and Regenerative Biology , Mount Sinai School of Medicine “ A simpler , more efficient , fairer , and more productive system is that operated by research institutes , such as the IMCB in Singapore , where investigators are given a budget , allowed to get on with their research and reviewed after five years . ”
— Philip Ingham , Professor , Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology , Singapore / MRC Centre for Developmental and Biomedical Genetics , University of Sheffield “ I commend the European Research Council : the grants are larger and last longer .
They are judged purely on scientific merit by scientists , no political strings , no fake collaborations , no age limits . ” — Maria Leptin , Professor at the Institute of Genetics , University of Cologne , Germany , Director elect , European Molecular Biology Organization “ It would be far more honest if we reverted to the system of direct funding to the universities .
I would like to see future scientists taken off this treadmill so that they could be scientists , not fund raisers .
In the UK , it was under the Thatcher government that the move was made away from direct funding towards indirect funding via the research councils .
It was this move , coupled with the ideology of ‘ wealth creation , ’ that created the problems we have today .
But how to persuade government and the public that scientists should simply be given money for research ?
We would need an intense program of reeducation about how science works in practice ; emphasis would have to shift from plans to outcomes .
Thus , most science would be funded through local channels ( the university , the department , etc. ) and , every four to five years , the retrospective judgment of our results would drive future funding .
This would be true peer review rather than the present ‘ prejudicial review . ’
After all , we do expect to be peer reviewed when we submit a manuscript — for work that we have already done .
No one writes a paper about what they intend to do .
But there would be resistance to these changes , partly because many colleagues are experts at playing the present ( dishonest ) system . ” —
Michael Glazer , University of Oxford Editor 's note :
The above comments were e-mailed to the author .
It would help free up time for research if scientists were not forced to dream up future plans but instead could opt to present their recent publications .
Even some first - time applicants with a strong recent record , like K. , could take this option ; others might prefer to write projects .
Grants should last for longer ; three years is too short , and having five - year renewals would itself reduce the burden of grant writing .
There should be a presumption against large groups , and people who aim to run them should demonstrate both efficiency and effectivity ; they should show that they have enough time to run each of their grants and to care for each of their people .
We need to reduce the bureaucracy as well as the delays it generates : the right approach to too much paperwork is not to appoint expensive offices to cope [ 11 ] , but to cull it .
Rationalisation would save a lot of money that could be put into the grants themselves rather than into their administration .
An important reform would be to set a maximum limit on the number of papers that could be offered as part of any application or any assessment .
At the moment , evaluating individuals and departments rewards those who produce many articles , mainly because counting papers is so much simpler than reading them .
Over 20 years , this mismeasurement of science [ 12 ] has wrought a sea change in practice : no longer are communication and record the primary purposes of publishing ; instead , we now use papers as tokens to get jobs and funding .
This same sea change has fuelled a huge increase in the number of papers and journals and decimated their quality and utility .
The solution is to allow , say , only three to five of the best papers of the group from over the previous five years to be offered for assessment ( as Howard Hughes Medical Institute already do in the US ) .
The evaluation of these papers should be corrected for the size of the group , i.e. , productivity would be rated per person , not per group .
If these reforms were enacted , the pressure to rush out many papers would be replaced by pressure to complete projects that report stories of value and present them well .
In consequence , the literature would be transformed and improved , and we would all benefit .
But this reform would create a problem .
At the moment , young people need a paper as a ticket for the next step , and we should therefore give deserving , but unlucky , students another chance .
One way would be to put more emphasis on open interviews ( with presentation by the candidate and questions from the audience ) and references .
Not objective ?
No , but only false objectivity is offered by evaluating real people using unreal calculations with numbers of papers , citations , and journal impact factors .
These calculations have not only demoralised and demotivated the scientific community [ 13 ] , they have also redirected our research and vitiated its purpose [ 14 ] .
S.C.'s Wilson Rakes
In $ 750,000 in Less Than 48 Hours ; Opponent Tops $ 1 Million
Updated 7:50 p.m.
By Paul Kane
With a political arms race in full force , Rep. Joe Wilson ( R - S.C. ) has raised almost $ 750,000 in less than 48 hours since his shout of " You lie ! " to President Obama during the Wednesday address to Congress , almost matching the Internet - fueled haul of his likely Democratic opponent .
A senior GOP official said Wilson , who apologized to White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel after the health - care speech but has since refused a more public apology , has turned his own previous sleepy campaign machine into an Web - friendly effort .
Just as liberals have poured cash into the campaign of Rob Miller , who lost to Wilson by almost eight percentage points in 2008 , conservatives are pouring contributions into Wilson 's campaign at an astonishing rate .
Miller , a former Iraq war veteran , has raised more than $ 1 million for his 2010 rematch with Wilson , according to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee .
Republicans expect Wilson to also top more than $ 1 million by Monday because of the immense publicity he 's received in the last 48 hours .
In the relatively inexpensive South Carolina district , which takes in the southern portion of the state , the two opponents will likely have their two - year budgets filled in less than a week , strategists say .
To put this fund - raising haul in perspective , Wilson , by early next week , could equal the total amount of money he raised in the entire two - year - election cycle of 2008 , when he raised a little more than $ 1.1 million .
Miller , by contrast , raised just $ 390,000 in donations for the entire 2008 cycle and lent himself another $ 235,000 of his own money , according to records filed with the Federal Election Commission .
So he 's already doubled , in just two days , his total donations over a two - year period .
The controversy will definitely go on through the weekend , as Wilson -- a quiet backbench lawmaker who 's never been in the national spotlight -- is scheduled to appear on the Sunday morning news show " Fox News Sunday . "
If he continues to refuse to make a public apology on the House floor , Democrats plan to offer a resolution admonishing his comments to Obama .
After liberal Internet activists turned Miller into a cause celebre in their effort to extract revenge on Wilson , conservatives joined the fray .
Wilson , who hired GOP web strategist David All , now has ads running on conservative - leaning web sites such as the Drudge Report .

New Zealand Author Claims Libraries Are Involved In Grand Theft By Loaning Books
from the this - has - to - be - parody , - right ?
dept
What pisses me off as an author is that for every person who buys your book , dozens of other bludgers get to read it for nothing .
Let me give you an example .
A few years back I wrote a biography of Helen Clark .
It took about six months to write and during that time I had effectively no other income .
The book retailed at $ 45 .
On the standard author 's royalty of 10 % , I got $ 4.50 for every copy sold .
Helen , Portrait of a Prime Minister sold 9,000 copies , a reasonable if not spectacular figure in the New Zealand market .
So I got $ 40,500 before tax for my six month 's work .
I 'm not complaining about that either .
But ...
Every public library in New Zealand bought at least one copy of Helen .
And they lent each of those copies to other people to read for ... nothing .
Last year there were still 227.4 copies of the book in New Zealand public libraries .
If each of those copies was taken out by one person a month , that 's 2,729 people who read but did n't pay for my book -- my six month 's work .
At $ 4.50 per unsold copy , that 's a theoretical loss of income to me in one year of $ 12,280 .
But there 's a principle here : when one person buys a book and lends it to another person to read , they effectively become an accessory to theft .
Their generous act amounts to little more than stealing the author 's work .
When a public library buys a book and lends it to thousands of other people to read , it 's grand theft copyright and really no different from illegally downloading music or movies or copying CDs or DVDs on your computer .

Via Family Holloway , I came across a short opinion piece by Brian Edwards bitching about how libraries are facilitating book theft .
At first , I honestly thought it was a joke or a parody , to make fun of those who complain about online " piracy , " but I actually think he 's serious .
I 'd never heard of Edwards , but apparently he 's a big media personality and author in New Zealand .
And , boy , does he hate the fact that libraries do n't pay him every time someone checks out a book :
While he later admits that not all of those people ( and he made up the numbers anyway ... ) would have bought the book , but them immediately follows that statement up with this doozy :
For someone who positions himself as an expert , he seems to have almost no understanding of the purpose of copyright law or of the public library systems .
In the end , he says that libraries should pay him 1 / 4 of the usual book sale royalty per loan of his book .
So , in his case , $ 1.13 every time the book is loaned out .
Apparently , he does n't quite realize that he 's basically asking the public libraries , funded by public tax dollars , to subsidize him .
The original Holloway link above does a nice job schooling Edwards , and then discusses things in more detail with Edwards in the comments -- though Edwards seems unwilling to budge on his claims of libraries being theives , or to understand basic common sense .
Someone points out to him that if he bought a chainsaw , it would be ridiculous to stop him from lending it to someone , and his response is : " There is no intellectual property in a chainsaw .
" Edwards also seems fully enamored with the myth that copyright law is based on some sort of " labor theory " -- that the more time you put in , somehow the more money youto get out .
While I 'm unfamiliar with New Zealand copyright law , in the US , such theories have been widely discredited in the courts repeatedly .
And , of course , they make no sense when viewed alongside the actual purpose of copyright law .
Edwards seems to believe that copyright is welfare for creators , rather than an incentive to create .
In the meantime , perhaps the public libraries of New Zealand can do Mr. Edwards a favor next time he publishes a book : do n't buy it .
Ditto for anyone who might think of lending it ... er... I mean , being an accessory to a crime in distributing copyrighted materials .

When a client comes to me with an over - the - counter will or a trust prepared by another lawyer , the wording of the document is often unnecessarily confusing .
This presents a danger since the person who signed the document may not truly understand what it says .
The document might also be incomplete or fail to address necessary issues .
As an attorney , I take care to see that every will , revocable or irrevocable trust or contract I create is in clear , understandable language .
Not only do we make our clients understand what they are signing , but we also prepare the document with the aim of protecting them from future challenges .
Fujifilm and Sony have each tackled this problem exactly the right way , the hard way : by redesigning the sensor itself , the tiny rectangular chip at the heart of every digital camera .
For years , Fuji has been bragging about the unconventional layout of its sensors .
On this chip , the tiny individual pixel sensors ( called photosites ) are n’t square ; they ’re hexagonal , arrayed in a honeycomb .
That ’s supposed to expose more sensor surface to the incoming light .
The new sensor in the F200EXR , though , goes a step further .
In what ’s called EXR mode , it can merge two adjacent photosites , in effect doubling the light collected at that spot on the sensor .
Of course , this trick also halves the megapixels  you get 6 - megapixel shots instead of 12 .
But amazingly enough , in low light , those 6 - megapixel shots are actually sharper and more detailed than the 12 - megapixel shots from the same camera .
Sony gave the sensor a makeover , too .
According to Sony , a sensor is actually a sandwich of layers : tiny lenses on top , then color filters , then some wiring , then the actual light detectors on the bottom .
Sony says that in its new Exmor R sensor , the circuitry layer has been moved to the bottom , so that less light is lost en route through the stack .
Does any of this make any difference ?
It sure does .
I spent three successive evenings shooting the same twilight and nighttime scenes with the Sony , the Fuji and my own Canon PowerShot SD880 , a terrific 2008 camera with no special low - light features .
Now , I am a rabid fan of Canon pocket cameras , having found them to be the best on the market year after year .
But in almost every one of my after - sundown tests , the Canon photo was too blurry to be useful .
The Fuji and Sony shots were sometimes grainy ( an S.L.R. would have done better ) but were always sharper , and managed to capture something in anything shy of total blackness .

A shipwreck apparently containing toxic waste is being investigated by authorities in Italy amid claims that it was deliberately sunk by the mafia .
An informant from the Calabrian mafia said the ship was one of a number he blew up as part of an illegal operation to bypass laws on toxic waste disposal .
The sunken vessel has been found 30 km ( 18 miles ) off the south - west of Italy .
The informant said it contained " nuclear " material .
Officials said it would be tested for radioactivity .
Murky pictures taken by a robot camera show the vessel intact and alongside it are a number of yellow barrels .
Labels on them say the contents are toxic .
The informant said the mafia had muscled in on the lucrative business of radioactive waste disposal .
But he said that instead of getting rid of the material safely , he blew up the vessel out at sea , off the Calabrian coast .
He also says he was responsible for sinking two other ships containing toxic waste .
Experts are now examining samples taken from the wreck .
Other vessels
An official said that if the samples proved to be radioactive then a search for up to 30 other sunken vessels believed scuttled by the mafia would begin immediately .
For years there have been rumours that the mafia was sinking ships with nuclear and other waste on board , as part of a money - making racket .
The environmental campaign group Greenpeace and others have compiled lists over the past few decades of ships that have disappeared off the coast of Italy and Greece .
Processing waste is highly specialised and is supposed to be an industry where security is the top priority .
If tests show that there is nuclear material on the seabed it will prove that the mafia has moved into its dirtiest business yet .

Widespread birds such as the starling are in decline Rare birds in the UK have been faring far better than their more common counterparts over the last decade , according to a new assessment .
The research shows almost 60 % of the 63 rare birds that breed in the UK have increased over the last 10 years .
By contrast , only about one third of common species have increased over the same period .
Just 28 % of rare birds have decreased over the same period , compared with four out of every 10 common birds .
The rare birds described in the assessment with increasing populations include the osprey , corncrake , avocet , cirl bunting and stone - curlew .
All of these birds are subject to conservation action .
The declining common birds include the linnet , nightingale , swift , guillemot , starling , house sparrow and red grouse .
These are suffering declines for a variety of reasons , including changes in farming practices .
FROM THE TODAY PROGRAMME

More from Today programme Dr David Noble , from the British Trust for Ornithology , said : " That some of our rarer birds have responded to targeted conservation action is great news .
It shows just what can be achieved .
" What we need to do now is to continue the good work and use some of the lessons we have learned to help our more common birds . "
Dr Mark Avery , the RSPB 's conservation director , said : " Over the last decade we 've enjoyed some cracking conservation successes , including removing some threatened species from the Red List and increasing the populations of red kite , bittern , avocet , osprey , stone - curlew and cirl bunting .
" However , these triumphs are countered by continued declines of some widespread species , like the skylark , kestrel , willow warbler and grey partridge . "
The overview of 210 native breeding birds has been produced by a coalition of conservation organisations , to mark the publication of the State of the UK's Birds report , which is in its 10th year .
The report is published by the RSPB for a coalition of conservation organisations .

Congressman Jerrold Nadler of New York introduced the “ Respect For Marriage Act , ” in the House today which seeks to overturn the Defense of Marriage Act ( DOMA ) .
At a Capitol Hill press conference , Nadler called the Respect for Marriage Act “ the first step to overturning the Defense of Marriage Act and sending that ugly law into the history books where it belongs . ”
“ Our bill ensures that all married couples , including lawfully married same - sex couples , will have the same access to federal responsibilities and benefits , including critical programs like Social Security that are intended to ensure the stability and security of American families , ” Nadler said .
The repeal legislation would only facilitate federal recognition of same - sex marriages — not civil unions or domestic partnerships .
Additionally , the bill contains a “ certainty provision ” allowing married same - sex couples to receive the federal benefits of marriage even if they move to a state that does n’t recognize their union .
Nadler said the task ahead in trying to overturn DOMA “ is not easy ” and that he expects opponents of repeal to try to keep DOMA on the books by “ making false claims that our bill will force same - sex marriage on unwilling states . ”

Diese Geschichte handelt von der Organisation Human Rights Watch , ihrer deutschen Direktorin Marianne Heuwagen und von der Villa Aurora , aber auch vom Auswärtigen Amt des SPD - Kanzlerkandidaten Frank - Walter Steinmeier .
Es ist eine verwickelte Geschichte , mit Handlungsorten in Zentralasien , Bochum und Los Angeles .

Ich erzähle diese Geschichte , weil sie einen Blick in die Werteordnung eines deutschen Spitzenpolitikers erlaubt , wie das nur selten der Fall ist .
Wenn ich Franz Müntefering , den SPD - Chef , sehe , wie er bei der Notlandung kürzlich seinem Nächsten hilft , fühle ich mich gut aufgehoben .
Münte wird uns nicht verraten .
Münte kümmert sich .
Diese Geschichte , die ich zu erzählen habe , zeigt , wie anders das Büro von Außenminister Frank - Walter Steinmeier handelt .
Sie zeigt , dass Steinmeier nicht nur den Deutsch - Türken Murat Kurnaz in Guantanamo verrotten lies .
Diese Geschichte zeigt , dass diese Haltung Steinmeiers gegenüber dem Schicksal des Einzelnen auf seine ganze Umgebung abfärbt .
Dass diese Berater aus seinem direkten Umfeld die Macht des Systems über den Menschen stellen .
Ich weiß nicht , ob irgendeiner die Geschichte hier liest .
Sie ist persönlich , mit Details überfrachtet , anklagend und viel zu lang .
Hier geht es nicht um Folter und Tod.
Nicht um Gefangenschaft und Mord .
Dies ist die Geschichte eines kleinen Mädchens , gerade sechs Jahre alt , das ihre Tante besuchen will .
Das Mädchen heißt Asha .
Galima Bukharbaeva und ihr Mann Marcus Bensmann sind unbequem .
Sie stören vor allem die Mächtigen in Zentralasien .
Sie durchkreuzen hier und da ihre Pläne. Zumindest versuchen sie das .
Galima Bukharbaeva und ihr Mann Marcus Bensmann haben bis vor ein paar Jahren in der usbekischen Hauptstadt Taschkent gelebt , der Heimat von Galima .
Die beiden sind Journalisten .
Sie haben über das Massaker von Andischan als Augenzeugen berichtet .
Damals , als im Mai 2005 in der usbekischen Stadt ein paar hundert Menschen niedergemetzelt wurden .
Sie schrieben , dass der Diktator Islam Karimow hinter der Bluttat steckt , dass er damit seine Herrschaft sichern wollte .
Sie haben dafür gekämpft , dass die Europäische Union Sanktionen gegen den Mörder nicht aufhebt .
Galima Bukharbaeva und ihr Mann Marcus Bensmann mussten aus Usbekistan flüchten , weil sie nicht schweigen wollten .
Sie waren in Lebensgefahr .
Eine Kalaschnikowkugel durchschlug einmal den Rucksack von Galima , durchschlug ihren Pass und durchschlug ihren Presseausweis .
Ich habe die Durschüsse , den Weg der Kugel an Galimas Rückgrat vorbei , mit eigenen Augen gesehen .
Galima und Marcus haben bei Ihrer Flucht aus Usbekistan alles zurückgelassen .
Galima wurde in einem Diplomaten - Wagen aus der Gefahrenzone geschmuggelt .
Es war kein deutscher Diplomat .
Galima und Marcus mussten ihre Wohnung in Taschkent aufgeben und alles was darin war .
Die Kleidung , die Bücher , die Ohrringe , die Urlaubsfotos , alles , was ein Mensch hat .
Aber sie haben auch die Familie von Galima verlassen .
Die Freunde und alle anderen , die ihnen dort nahe standen .
Das war 2005 .
Galima und Marcus leben seither aus dem Koffer .
Sie haben versucht , eine neue Heimat zu finden .
Sie haben in Aserbajdschan gelebt , oder in anderen Nachbarstaaten Usbekistans , wie Kirgistan oder Kasachstan .
Sie wollten Usbekistan nah sein , um aus dem Land , das sie nicht mehr betreten dürfen , besser berichten zu können .
Aber sie müssen die lange Hand des usbekischen Diktators fürchten .
Oft genug schlägt dessen Geheimdienst auch im Ausland zu .
Die Angst hört nicht auf .
Bekannte wurden gefangen , in Gefängnisse gesteckt , gefoltert und vergewaltigt .
Ihr Freund Alisher Saipov wurde im Oktober 2007 vom usbekischen Geheimdienst in Kirgistan ermordet .
Mit Schüssen in die Knie und in den Kopf .
Alisher und Galima waren die beiden wichtigsten Journalisten aus der Region .
Galima und Marcus mussten weiter flüchten .
Sie kamen nach Deutschland , das war Ende 2007 .
Hier ist das Leben schwer .
Fern von Galimas Heimat , fern der usbekischen Familie und Freunde .
Galima und Marcus schlagen sich durch .
Eigentlich wollten die beiden nur kurz in Deutschland bleiben .
Nach den Präsidentenwahlen in Usbekistan zu Weihnachten 2007 hofften beide , sie könnten zurück nach Zentralasien , wenn der Verfolgungsdruck abnehmen würde .
Marcus versuchte es als Erster .
Er flog im Januar 2008 alleine nach Kasachstan , um zu sehen , ob dort vielleicht ein Leben für beide möglich sei .
Der Plan scheiterte .
Marcus wurde in der kasachischen Hauptstadt Astana gekidnappt , geschlagen , getreten .
Seine Gesichtknochen zersplitterten , bevor ihn die Täter ohne Jacke und Schuhe in die nächtliche kasachsische Steppe warfen .
Mitten im Winter , 20 Grad unter Null .
Marcus hat überlebt .
Im Bochumer Bergmannsheil wurde er aufgepäppelt .
Galima saß an seinem Bett , monatelang .
Es war knapp .
Marcus und Galima sind meine Freunde .
Ich kenne die beiden als engagierte Reporter .
Ich habe angefangen , mich für diese Geschichte hier zu interessieren , weil ich mitbekommen habe , was ihnen widerfahren ist .
Nach Jahren auf der Flucht und dem mörderischen Anschlag waren Marcus und Galima erschöpft , ausgepowert .
Trotzdem lernte Marcus wieder gehen und greifen .
Trotzdem fing Galima wieder in Deutschland an zu Schreiben .
Gegen die Macht des Herrschers in Usbekistan , jenen irrsinnigen Diktator Islam Karimow , in dessen Foltergefängnissen Menschen zu Tode gekocht werden .
Ich habe hier ein vertrauliches Dokument verlinkt aus dem Jahr 2002 .
Der britische Botschafter Craig Murray beschreibt darin die Lage damals .
Die USA und mit ihnen auch die Deutschen haben sich mit dem usbekischen Diktator einen Verbündeten gesucht für ihren Krieg in Afghanistan , der abscheulich ist .
Nicht nur der Krieg in Afghanistan selbst ist falsch , auch seine Folgen sind es .
Seither hat sich nichts zum besseren verändert .
Im Gegenteil .
Danach passierte das Andidschan - Massaker und all die anderen Morde .
Ich bin kein Freund von Verschwörungstheorien .
Und man könnte denken , ich schweife jetzt ab .
Aber vielleicht gibt es doch einen Zusammenhang .
Beachten
Sie bitte den folgenden außenpolitischen Hintergrund , um die ganze Geschichte zu verstehen .
Am Ende passt alles irgendwie zusammen .
Oder auch nicht .
Im deutschen Außenministerium von Frank - Walter Steinmeier können die Geschichten von Galima und Marcus über den usbekischen Diktator nicht beliebt sein .
Denn Karimow ist ein Verbündeter des SPD - Ministers und der deutschen Regierung im unseeligen Krieg in Afghanistan .
In Karimows Diktatur Usbekistan liegt ein Stützpunkt der deutschen Armee , er heißt Termes .
Hierhin kommen die deutschen Panzer und Soldaten , bevor sie weiter nach Afghanistan geschickt werden , um dort zu kämpfen .
Die Deutsche Regierung gibt Karimow deswegen Geld .
Die Deutsche Regierung hofiert Karimow .
Die deutsche Regierung bildet usbekische Soldaten aus .
Aber wichtiger noch : Das Außenministerium von Frank - Walter Steinmeier setzt sich für den Diktator in Usbekistan politisch ein .
Nach dem Massaker von Andischan hatte die EU Sanktionen gegen Usbekistan verhängt .
Karimows Apparatschiks durften nicht mehr nach Europa reisen .
Eigentlich .
Denn die Deutsche Politik brach die Sanktionen und ließ im November 2005 trotz Einreiseverbot der EU den usbekischen Innenminister Sokir Almatow in einer Spezialklinik nach Hannover behandeln .
Almatow war einer der Hauptverantwortlichen für das Massaker von Andischan .
Das auswärtige Amt , damals noch unter Joschka Fischer , rechtfertigte die Einreise des Schlächters mit humanitären Gründen .
Danach dann setzte sich Steinmeier in der Europäischen Union dafür ein , dass die Sanktionen aufgehoben wurden .
Und diesem Wunsch der Deutschen widersetzte sich die EU nicht lange .
Als Steinmeier das geschafft hatte , reiste als einer der ersten Karimow - Funktionäre der usbekische Stasi - Minister nach Deutschland .
Er kam nicht mit leeren Händen : Der Stasi - Minister brachte die Geständnisse angeblicher Terroristen mit .
In Deutschland wurden diese Geständnisse im Terrorprozess gegen die Sauerland - Gruppe benutzt .
Ich weiß nicht , ob die Geständnisse aus den usbekischen Folterkellern der Wahrheit entsprechen .
Ich weiß aber , dass ich Foltergeständnissen nicht glaube .
Und ich weiß , dass ich es widerlich finde , wenn deutsche Ermittler nach Usbekistan in die Folterkeller fahren , um die Geständnisse zu überprüfen , indem sie die Folteropfer vor Ort vernehmen .
Marcus und Galima haben über diese Sachen berichtet .
Und über mehr .
Sie haben über die Sanktionen geschrieben , haben aufgeklärt , dass sich vor allem das deutsche Außenministerium unter Steinmeier für den Diktator Karimow einsetzt .
Im vergangenen Jahr wurde Galima nun ein Stipendium angeboten .
Sie sollte als „ writer in exile “ in die Villa Feuchtwanger nach Los Angeles fahren .
Dort sollte sie sich erholen .
Und mit ihr Marcus .
Die beiden wollten ein Buch über Zentralasien schreiben .
Sie freuten sich auf die Ruhe , auf einen Zwischenstopp ihrer ständigen Flucht , sie wollten ihr Leben ordnen .
Galima und Marcus traten ihr Stipendium in diesem Mai an .
Eingeladen hatten zu dem Stipendium ein Verein : er nennt sich Freunde der Villa Aurora .
Eingeladen hatte vor allen die Kuratoriumschefin der Villa Aurora : Marianne Heuwagen .
Die Fast - Rentnerin war mal Journalistin .
Seit ein paar Jahren ist sie Chefin der deutschen Sektion von Human Rights Watch und nebenbei ist sie wie gesagt Kuratoriumschefin der Villa .
In der Villa Aurora in Los Angeles hatte einst der deutsche Schriftsteller Lion Feuchtwanger und seine Ehefrau Martha Zuflucht vor den Nazis gefunden .
Die Villa wurde während der Diktatur in Deutschland eine Anlaufstelle für deutsche Exilanten .
Viele hatten es schwer sich in der Fremde zurechtzufinden .
Die Villa Aurora und das Ehepaar Feuchtwanger boten ihnen eine Insel an .
Nach dem Tod der Feuchtwangers sollte der Gedanke an das Exil Aufrecht erhalten werden .
Deshalb hat sich in den USA und Deutschland jener Freundeskreis gegründet , der aus der Villa eine Künstlerresidenz machte .
Unter anderem wird jedes Jahr ein Schriftsteller oder Journalist aus einer Diktatur eingeladen .
Dieser „ writer in exile “ soll in der Villa Feuchtwangers fern der täglichen Kämpfe im Exil Ruhe finden , um sich einem langfristigen Projekt widmen zu können .
Die Villa schreibt auf ihrer Webseite zu dem Writer in Exile Programm :
In Zusammenarbeit mit wichtigen Menschenrechtsorganisationen und der Feuchtwanger Memorial Library an der University of Southern California ( USC ) vergibt die Villa Aurora jährlich ein bis zu zwölfmonatiges Aufenthaltsstipendium für einen in seinem Heimatland verfolgten Schriftsteller ( Feuchtwanger Fellowship ) .
Mit diesem Programm erinnert die Villa Aurora an die historische Verfolgung und macht gleichzeitig auf die weltweit andauernde Unterdrückung freier Meinungsäußerung aufmerksam . “
Galima war bis zum Massaker von Andischan 2005 in der usbekischen Karimow - Diktatur eine der einflussreichsten Journalistinnen .
Mutig hat sie trotz ständiger Drohung des Geheimdienstes gegen Folter , Korruption und Machtwillkür angeschrieben .
Als sie nach dem Massaker fliehen musste , hat sie ihre Arbeit im Ausland fortgesetzt .
Sie hat vor dem US - Kongress in Washington und vor dem EU Parlament in Brüssel Zeugnis über das Massaker abgelegt .
Sie hat in der Herald Tribune und in der Süddeutschen Zeitung über das Regime in Usbekistan berichtet .
Zudem verantwortet Galima aus dem Exil heraus die usbekische Webseite uznews.net .
Diese Seite gehört zu den wichtigsten , unabhängigen Quellen über die Diktatur in Usbekistan .
Für ihre Berichterstaatung erhielt sie in New York den Freedom of Press Award .
Galima organisiert , wo sie kann , den Informationsfluss über verhaftete und gefolterte Menschen in Usbekistan .
Das usbekische Regime hasst sie dafür .
Regelmäßig entfachen die regierungshörigen Medien in Usbekistan Hetzkampagne gegen Galima .
Knapp ein Jahr nach dem Mord an Alischer Saipov bezeichnete die Sprecherin der usbekischen Staatsanwaltschaft Galima und Marcus auf einer von der EU inszenierten Medienkonferenz als
Informationsterroristen “ .
Usbekische Freunde und Kollegen von Galima schweben in ständiger Angst , verhaftet zu werden , weil sie Galima kennen .
Nicht zuletzt sorgt sich Galima immer um ihre Familie , die in Usbekistan geblieben ist .
Wenn die Freunde der Villa Aurora ihr Programm ernst nehmen , haben sie mit Galima die richtige Person eingeladen .
Allerdings war sich die Villa unter Heuwagen nicht sicher , ob sie Galima einladen soll .
Streng genommen lebte sie ja schon nicht mehr in Usbekistan , und musste nicht erst ins Exil geholt werden .
Andererseits muss ein Mensch immer sein Heimatland verlassen , um in ein Exil zu gehen und dann als „ Writer in Exile “ zu gelten .
Und das Programm heißt ja auch so .
Wie dem auch sei , schließlich verzichtete das Kuratorium unter Heuwagen auf Haarspaltereien und lud , wie gesagt , Galima und ihren Mann Marcus ein .
Die Villa ist ein schöner Ort. Am Rand von Los Angeles stehen die drei Stockwerke im Stadtteil Palisades .
Umgeben von Palmen und Ruhe .
Ab und an eine Lesung oder ein Konzert .
Ab und an eine Feier der deutschen Filmschaffenden – wenn zum Beispiel der Oscar verliehen wird .
An diesen Ort verfolgte Schreiber aus aller Welt zu holen , ist sicher eine gute Idee .
Seit das Programm im Dezember 1995 ins Leben gerufen wurde , kamen Reporter und Schriftsteller aus Nigeria , Birma , Pakistan , Kongo , Turkey , Afghanistan , China und Algerien .
Die Villa ist aber auch ein
Ort mit dem sich eitle Menschen schmücken können .
Und damit komme ich zurück zu meiner Geschichte .
Asha ist die Nichte von Galima .
Ein liebes Kind , aufgeweckt , lachend , interessiert , verspielt .
Ein Kind mit dem Galima und Marcus gerne ihre Zeit verbringen .
Seit ihrer Flucht aus Usbekistan versucht Galima ihre Schwester und die Nichte Asha einmal im Jahr zu sehen .
Irgendwo auf der Welt .
In Indien , in Deutschland , in Kasachstan , in England .
Meist haben sie es geschafft .
In diesem Jahr wollten sie sich in Los Angeles treffen .
Galima und Marcus fragten bei der Villa nach , ob Asha mit ihrer Mutter , Galimas Schwester , bei ihnen in der Villa übernachten könnte .
Für ein paar
Tage nur .
Zunächst sah alles gut aus .
Galima und Marcus wollten für die Flugkosten und die Übernachtungen bezahlen , die Villa sollte damit nicht behelligt werden .
Zwar heißt es in der Hausordnung der Villa , dass Kinder nicht erwünscht sind im Haus von Lion Feuchtwanger , aber man werde vielleicht eine Ausnahme machen .
Das sagte eine Mitarbeiterin zu Marcus und Galima , eine der leitenden Angestellten der Villa .
Zunächst half die Organisation von Marianne Heuwagen sogar dabei , der Nichte von Galima und ihrer Mutter Visa zu besorgen für die USA .
Für Menschen , die im Exil leben , ist es wichtig , die Verbindung in die Heimat zu halten , in die Familie .
Sie sind nicht freiwillig weg , im Urlaub .
Sie sind dazu gezwungen , in der Fremde wie in einem Gefängnis zu leben , ohne Aussicht auf Heimkehr .
Exil und die Sehnsucht nach der zurückgebliebenen Familie gehören zusammen , wie Einsamkeit und Schmerz .
Das muss gerade eine Organisation wissen , die sich der Erinnerung an das Exil - Elend auf die Fahne geschrieben hat .
Zudem war Galima ja nicht wie die anderen eingeladenen Künstler nur für drei Monate in Los Angeles , sondern sollte für viele Monate bleiben .
Was ich damit sagen will : Ich denke , den Wunsch die Familie zu sehen , kann jeder verstehen , der mitfühlend ist .
Die Villa hat ein Gästezimmer .
Wenn dieser Raum nicht von einem zusätzlichen Sitpendiaten genutzt wird , können Gäste dorthin eingeladen werden .
So ziemlich jeder darf da schlafen .
Für 75 Dollar die Nacht .
Man muss sich nur mit der Führung der Villa verstehen .
Mit Marianne Heuwagen etwa .
Immer wieder kamen dorthin Leute wie Führungspersonal des Goethe - Instituts beispielsweise .
Dieses Gästezimmer sei je nach Verfügbarkeit zum Besuch frei , sagte man Marcus und Galima .
Die Nichte Asha und die Schwester könnten dort sicher die wenigen
Tage schlafen .
Galima und Marcus freuten sich auf die Nichte , auf ihr Lachen .
Alles schien gut zu sein .
Doch es kam anders .
Die Villa unter Marianne Heuwagen hat sich , wie gesagt , eine Hausordnung geschaffen , in der Kinder verboten werden .
Und Marianne Heuwagen war entschlossen , die Hausordnung , die unter ihrer Verantwortung entstanden ist , über Gefühle zu stellen .
Heuwagen ließ mittteilen : Hausordnung ist Hausordnung – Basta .
Insbesondere die sechsjährige Asha sei unerwünscht .
Das Kinder - Verbot gelte .
Das ist dumm , aber nachvollziehbar .
Verbohrte Kleingeister , die den Maßstab für Güte verlieren und Hausordnungen über Menschlichkeit stellen , gibt es überall .
Nicht nachvollziehbar ist allerdings , wie es weiterging .
Als man Galima schließlich den Beschluss mitteilte , dass der Besuch der Nichte und der Schwester nicht gestattet werde , sagte Galima , dass sie dann ebenfalls nicht in der Villa bleiben könne .
Sie wolle nicht an einem
Ort sein , der ihrer Schwester und ihrer Nichte Asha verboten werde , obwohl sie tausende Kilometer aus dem Verfolgerland anreisen würden .
Für einen Besuch von vielleicht zehn Tagen .
Galima und Marcus sagten , sie würden aus der Villa ausziehen und zu Asha und ihrer Mutter gehen .
Die Villa - Mitarbeiter waren überrascht .
Eine Mitarbeiterin bat , doch noch eine Woche mit dem Auszug zu warten – bis Montag , dann würde die Führung der Villa eine endgültige Entscheidung fällen .
Dann hieß es plötzlich , die Keine - Kinder - Regel hätten die Behörden von Los Angeles als Bauauflage verhängt .
Wenn die Villa dagegen verstoße , bestünde die Gefahr , dass die Nachbarn der Villa den Regelverstoß sähen und ihn zu Anzeige brächten .
Daher sei wohl keine Ausnahme vom Kinder - Verbot in der Hausordnung möglich .
Marcus und Galima wurden hingehalten .
Man warte auf eine Entscheidung aus Berlin , hieß es immer wieder , ob Asha bei ihrer Tante übernachten dürfe .
Marcus und Galima gerieten in Stress .
Jeden Tag , jede Nacht .
Darf die Nichte kommen ?
Darf sie nicht kommen ?
Was sollen wir tun ?
Der Tag der geplanten Anreise rückte näher .
Keine Reaktion .
Marcus schrieb Briefe an die Geschäftsführerin der Villa und an den damaligen Vorsitzenden der Villa , Freimuth Duve , Briefe , in denen er deutlich machen wollte , warum der Familienbesuch für einen im Exil lebenden Menschen wichtig sei und die Villa , sollte sie das „ Writer in Exile “ - Programm ernst nehmen , dieses verstehen müsste .
Er versuchte seinen Standpunkt klar und deutlich zu machen .
Auch um sich und seine Frau Galima zu schützen , vor dem emotionalen Stress einer Flucht aus dem Haus von Lion Feuchtwanger .
Mitch Markowitz ist ein Freund der Villa .
Er wohnt nicht weit weg und kommt gerne auf einen Sprung vorbei .
Mitch Markowitz ist nicht irgendwer .
Er hat bis vor wenigen Jahren als Drehbuchautor gearbeitet .
Er schrieb Skripte für die Serien „ Monk “ und „ MASH “ .
Er hat das Drehbuch für „ Good Morning Vietnam “ geschrieben und andere Filme .
Mitch Markowitz fühlt sich als Jude der Idee verbunden , Menschen auf der Flucht vor Unterdrückung zu helfen , indem sie im Haus eines vor den Deutschen geflüchteten Juden eine vorübergehende Heimat finden .
Mitch hat die Geschichte von der angeblichen Keine - Kinder - Regel gehört ; er hat von der Sorge Galimas und Marcus gehört und er hat an die Villa Aurora einen mitfühlenden Brief geschrieben :
I was just informed that a visiting journalist from Uzbekistan who had to escape from that country and having been denied her basic human rights there and had to flee and seek political refugee status , and is staying at Villa Aurora has been denied by the Villa to have have her six year old niece a short stay at the villa of two weeks .
This is astonishing to me .
I know it is the policy of the Villa Aurora not to allow children to stay at the villa , but this woman is a political refugee who has fled her country because of political repression ; she was marked for murder .
Her friends have been murdered .
Her husband was kidnapped and beaten and left for dead .
Now they are staying at the Villa as part of a program designed in part by the German government to aid political refugees like her .
Lion Feuchtwanger himself was a political refugee .
Do you think if he was staying at the house now it would be appropriate for a free government like the US or German to deny a young family member the right of a brief of two weeks if there was room in the house to give a political refugee some brief comfort ?
I believe the Villa Aurora has been a great refuge for artists and writers and journalists for a long time and is a great resource both for our community and for the European and the world community , and it is a great treasure .
I admire the work you have done , and i been privileged all these years to have been and invited artist filmmaker , and have attended many wonderful gatherings there .
I have met many wonderful artists and journalists and these people have enriched my life immearsurably .
I hope you can prevail upon the German government to make an exception for Galima Bukarbhaeva and her husband Markus and allow a child , Galima ’s niece , a brief stay at the villa .
Galima is not simply an artist who is staying at the villa at the pleasure of the German government .
She and her husband are people who have suffered greatly at the hands of one of the most corrupt and brutal dictatorships in the world — a distinction that government shares with the likes of Burma ( where I have spent a great deal of time working with impoverished musicians ) , North Korea , and Iran .
Having escaped from the brutality of the Karimov regime , I believe Galima and her husband are refugees who deserve to be treated with a special brand of compassion and for whom certain rules , perhaps , need not necessarily apply .
I believe that for certain people who have been through a great deal of terror in their lives , we must be especially kind and especially generous and put certain rules aside .
Such people have suffered at the hands of history .
We must honor them instead .
Mr. and Mrs. Feuchtwanger , and other Jews during the war , writers , journalists , dissidents from various repressive regimes from around the world and all other displaced persons who have not been free to do in their home countries what they should have been free to do should , perhaps be shown a degree of courtesy the rest of us do not perhaps deserve .
As a Jew who did not live through the holocaust , for example , I do believe that people who did deserve more than I deserve .
For someone who had to escape terror in their nation , I do believe they deserve a degree of courtesy I , or other artists perhaps do not .
Wo n’t you Please ask the German government to make an exception to their rules and allow this lady ’s child to stay at the Villa for perhaps a week or two .
It will be a very good deed .
It ’s rules , after all , that forced these people to flee their country in the first place .
Can we show these people we are better than that ?
Sincerely yours , and with great respect to you , the Villa Aurora , and the German government whom I admire and respect greatly , Mitch Markowitz , Screenwriter
Es kam der entscheidende Montag , irgendwann im Juni .
Es kam allerdings immer noch keine Reaktion aus Berlin – keine Reaktion von Marianne Heuwagen und der Villa .
Noch nicht mal der Hinweis , dass die Freunde der Villa und ihr Vorstand von dem Problem gehört hätten , und noch einige Zeit zur Beratung bräuchten .
Selbst am Abend , als der Arbeitstag in Berlin schon lange zu Ende war , kam keine Reaktion .
Marcus und Galima gingen in das Büro der Angestellten , um nach dem Entscheid zu fragen .
Noch am Freitag , hatten die Angestellten gesagt , sie seien nur Messanger , „ Überbringer der Botschaft “ , doch es kam keine Botschaft .
Es hieß nur von den Angestellten der Villa , man wisse nicht , wann die Entscheidung aus Berlin komme .
Berlin schweigt .
Man würde schon Bescheid geben , vielleicht morgen , vielleicht übermorgen .
Galima und Marcus mögen sich gedulden .
Dann drehten sich die Angestellten der Villa ab und unterhielten sich untereinander über einen Film oder so , vielleicht auch über das Wetter .
Sie ließen Marcus und Galima stehen .
Dumm stehen .
Traurig stehen .
Wütend stehen .
Galima und Marcus waren mit den Nerven am Ende. Galima schrie die Angestellten der Villa an , wenn sie nur Botschaften überbrächten , sollten sie endlich eine Botschaft überbringen und sagen , was los ist .
Nachher legte man Galima diese Erruption der Enttäuschung als „ gestische Gewalttätigkeiten “ aus .
Und man versuchte ihre
Wut als „ masslose Aggressivitäten bis hin zu fast körperlicher Bedrohung “ auszulegen .
So steht es in Emails , die mir vorliegen .
Was für Worte .
Ich kenne Galima .
Sie ist sehr schlank , sehr weiblich .
Was soll das sein : „ eine fast körperliche Bedrohung “ eine „ gestische Gewalttätigkeit “ ?
Galima hat die Angestellte der Villa beschimpft , ja .
Sie hat sie angeschrien , ja .
Hatte sie ein Recht dazu ?
Bestimmt nicht .
Aber sie war auf jeden Fall ein Mensch in einer Notlage , machte sich Sorgen um ihre Nichte und hat sich mit Worten gewehrt .
Sie hat keinen Stein geschmissen und keinen Menschen geschlagen .
Die Villa schmückt sich mit einem „ Writer in Exile “ - Programm .
Ein „ Writer im Exile “ , wie Galima , hat im Kampf um die Freiheit des Wortes schlimmes erlebt .
Die Diktatur , ein Massaker , die Flucht , der Kampf im Exil , die Drohungen des Staates , die verhafteten und ermordeten Freunde und Kollegen .
All das bleibt im Menschen , formt einen Menschen .
Wenn ich höre , wie arrogant die Villa und vor allem Marianne Heuwagen mit Galima und Marcus umgegangen sind , denke ich , die Leite wissen nicht , welche seelischen und psychischen Belastungen das Exilschicksal mit sich bringt .
Doch das war nicht alles .
Heuwagen hat nachgelegt :
Am nächsten Tag kam ein Brief von der Geschäftsführerin der Villa , Mechthild Borries - Knopp .
In einem Rundschreiben an alle möglichen Leute hieß es dort :
„ Dear Galima and dear Marcus , I am writing this letter to you on behalf of the Board of Directors of Villa Aurora and the Chair of our Kuratorium , Marianne Heuwagen , who is the director of Human Rights Watch in Germany . ….
Let me remind you also of the concept of our Feuchtwanger Fellowship Feuchtwanger Fellowship .
Each year , together with important human rights organizations and the Feuchtwanger Memorial Library at the University of Southern California ( USC ) , the Villa Aurora awards the Feuchtwanger Fellowship .
This is a grant for up to twelve months residency for a writer who is persecuted in his or her homeland .
The program was founded in honour of the European exiles of the past who found refuge in Los Angeles .
It is also intended to remind us of the intellectual repression that continues today .
…
Galima is the first fellow whom we granted the fellowship , although she already has found refuge in Germany since 2005 , and is not in actual danger of being persecuted in Germany . ….
When XY ( Namen unkenntlich gemacht d. Autor ) proposed Galima as the Villa Aurora fellow for 2009 , we had a lot of doubts first , because she already had lived in Germany since 2005 , being married to a German , and thus not fitting in our concept ( in accordance with the German Foreign Office ) of helping writers who are living in their countries under continuous persecution or observation as dissidents .
But we were finally convinced by the project which Galima wanted to realize at the Villa : to write a book about her traumatic experiences in Usbekistan .
We decided to make one exception in her case , and to grant this working fellowship to a journalist living in refuge in Germany in order to help Galima to be able to write this book and to reach a broader public in communicating her tragic experiences .
All the discussions , the tensions and misunderstandings have nothing to do with this fellowship and the conditions under which they are granted .
If these discussions continue in this violent and insulting way , we might be forced to cancel the program for Galima , and grant the fellowship to a writer who needs it desperately , - unfortunately there are so many persecuted writers even nowadays in many countries , and this is such a generous and precious fellowship that we would like to grant it to somebody who can really appreciate and honour it . ”
Haben sie den Brief von Frau Dr. Borries - Knopp verstanden ?
Ich fass den langen
Atem mal mit meinen Worten auf das Wesentliche zusammen :
Die Villa dient dem Gedenken Feuchtwangers .
Wir sind wichtig und haben lange Namen .
Galima passt nicht ins Konzept .
Sie ist gar kein richtiger Flüchtling .
Aber wir haben beide Augen zugedrückt .
Und wenn Galima nicht die Klappe hält , fliegt sie raus .
Der Wunsch seine Familie zu sehen ist kein Menschenrecht .
Es gibt genügend andere erbärmliche Kreaturen , die wir uns holen können , die kein Ärger machen .
Und unsere Wohltaten zu würdigen und zu ehren wissen .
Diese Aussage finde ich nicht nett .
Es geht frei nach dem Motto : Tanz nach unserer Pfeife , Kaninchen .
Wir bezahlen Dich schließlich .
Aber das ist nicht alles .
Bitte beachten Sie folgendes : Der Brief spielt mit Unwahrheiten .
Galima lebt gar nicht seit 2005 in Deutschland .
Wie oben beschrieben lebte Galima damals mit Marcus in Kasachstan , in Aserbajdschan , in Kirgistan .
Sie waren nach dem Massaker und der Entkommen aus Usbekistan vielleicht drei oder viermal in Deutschland – zu Besuch , um ein paar Wochen von ihrer ständigen Flucht zu verschnaufen .
Erst nachdem Alisher Saipov ermordet wurde , kamen die beiden Ende 2007 für längere Zeit nach Europa .
Und welche Rolle spielt es überhaupt , ob Galima mit einem Deutschen verheiratet ist ?
Die Geschäftsführerin der Villa verbreitet weiter Unsinn .
Frau Dr. Borries - Knopp besteht mir gegenüber darauf , dass dies ein interner Brief gewesen sei .
Aber warum schickt sie dann den Brief nicht nur an den Vorstand sondern auch an Menschen , die nichts mit der Villa - Organisation zu tun haben .
Der Adressenverteiler liegt mir vor .
Ihre Rundmail bekamen alle möglichen Menschen , die sich für den Fall interessieren könnten und die sich mit Galimas Fall beschäftigt haben .
Diese Menschen , auch die honorigen Vorstände des Trägervereines mussten den Eindruck gewinnen , Galima sei eine ungebührliche , keifende Schnorrerin .
Diese Menschen mussten denken , Galima sei gar keine Exilatin im Sinne des „ Writer in Exile “ - Programms .
Dieser Brief ist der Versuch einen Ruf zu ermorden .
Die Menschen , die den Brief bekamen , erfuhren nicht , dass man Galima und Marcus hingehalten hat .
Über Tage und über Wochen .
Sie erfuhren nicht , dass die Villa zunächst dem Aufenthalt von Asha und Galimas Schwester eher positiv gegenüberstand .
Bitte merken
Sie sich das , weil das Erwecken von Eindrücken noch eine Rolle spielt in der Geschichte .
Die Villa Aurora arbeitet mit Zwischentönen , um Leute ins schlechte Licht zu rücken .
Denn diese Attacke sollte nicht reichen .
Die Villa hat weiter auf den Ruf von Galima geschossen .
Ich bringe jetzt einen Brief von Marianne Heuwagen , den Frau Dr. Borries - Knopp ebenfalls in ihrer Rundmail an alle möglichen Interessierten verschickt hat .
Ich zitiere die Passage , mit der Borries - Knopp eine Art juristische Stellungnahme von Heuwagen ankündigt :
“ I am attaching a letter from Marianne Heuwagen , who is devoting all her work to human rights issues , to clarify the situation for Villa Aurora from the legal side of our situation .
Später hat Frau Dr. Borries - Knopp behauptet , Heuwagen habe keine juristische Stellungnahme abgegeben .
Aber im ernst : wie ist der obige Satz anders zu verstehen ?
Es hieß : Heuwagen wolle “ clarify the situation for Villa Aurora from the legal side of our situation . ”
Aber egal : Bitte lesen
Sie den folgenden Brief von Heuwagen aufmerksam durch .
Denken sie daran , dass Galima ein Flüchtling ist , denken sie an die Kugel durch ihren Rucksack , denken sie an ihren erschossenen Freund Alisher Saipov und an ihren fast erschlagenen Mann Marcus .
Lesen
Sie jetzt diesen Brief und denken Sie daran , dass ihre Nichte und Schwester in ein paar Tagen anreisen .
Denken
Sie daran , dass
Sie in einem fremden Land sind und nicht wissen , wo ihre Verwandten oder sie selbst schlafen sollen .
Denken
Sie daran , dass ein Vertreter der Villa Aurora zuerst gesagt hat , es könne eine Ausnahme gemacht werden und die beiden können in der Villa bleiben .
Denken
Sie daran , dass dieser Vertreter der Villa Aurora zuerst geholfen hat , ein Visum zu besorgen , und dann weitere Hilfe verweigerte , weil „ Berlin “ anders entschieden habe .
Denken sie an das Lachen eines sechsjährigen Kindes , ihrer Nichte .
Und jetzt lesen Sie den Brief :
„ Dear Mechthild , as you know , I know Marcus and Galima from my work with HRW ( Human Rights Watch ) .
You should stress in your conversation with them the following points :
It is not the VA , that does not allow children stay there , it is the City of LA and / or the Coastal Commission .
It took us years to get the permits ; it took us even more years to get the Villa running and operating .
We cannot risk loosing any of those permits because one writer in exile wants his family and / or children to stay .
During all the 15 years we have been working on this , never once did anybody from the board or the dedicated volunteers who set up VA stay there for vacation purposes , not once , never .
Their request has nothing to do with human rights and we should not allow them to misuse the issue of human rights and prosecution in this context , it is despicable Last but not least , someone at VA should explain to them , that they better keep the ball low – as they say in German soccer , because Galima is really not the “ writer in exile ” the program was set up for and I would hate to see anyone in the press or German parliament raise that issue .
She has been living in Germany already for four (! ) years in a safe heaven : and she is by no means threatened , only if she would return to Uzbekistan , which she does not need to do , because her husband is German !
As you know , the program was set up for writers who are currently threatened .
We are already very generous in letting a couple stay and letting Marcus stay with her .
There is no need to extend our hospitality to further family members , particularly children .
You can mention my name , if you wish , but I do not want to hear from Marcus or anybody else in that matter again , its is too annoying .
Kind regards Marianne Marianne Heuwagen ; Direktorin des Deutschland - Büros , Human Rights Watch ”
Ich will auf diese Punkte eingehen :
Marianne Heuwagen hat diesen Brief mit der Autorität einer Direktorin von Human Rights Watch geschrieben .
Von der Kanzel herab .
Sie hat diesen Brief von der Villa - Geschäftsführerin über eine Rundmail verschicken lassen .
Das ist zunächst intrigant geschickt , denn so könnte sie immer nachher sagen , ich wollte den gar nicht rumschicken – die Frau Dr. Borries - Knopp hat das auf eigene Rechnung getan .
Dann die Details : Marcus wurde ein knappes
Jahr zuvor fast erschlagen .
Nicht in Usbekistan , sondern in Kasachstan .
Überhaupt , was spielt es für eine Rolle , was der Mann von Galima für eine Nationalität hat ?
Gar keine .
Galima kann in Deutschland leben , weil Galima gemäß des UN - Abkommen vom 28 .
Juli 1951 einen Flüchtlingpass besitzt .
Die deutschen Asylbehörden haben in Galima das gesehen , was sie ist : ein politischer Flüchtling .
Galima hätte nach ihren Berichten über das Massaker in Andischan in jedem freien Land Asyl bekommen .
Deutschland war hier weder besonders gnädig , noch hat die Asylentscheidung mit der Ehe zu einem Deutschen zu tun .
Was will Heuwagen dann damit sagen , dass Galima einen Mann in Deutschland hat ?
Ich höre einen Zwischenton .
Meint Heuwagen , Galima habe sich einen Mann aus Deutschland geangelt , um hier im Westen rumzuschnorren ?
Soll die Behauptung , Galima sei eine Schnorrerin , zwischen den Zeilen verfestigt werden , so wie es schon im Brief von Mechthild Borries - Knopp stand ?
Vielleicht will Heuwagen aber auch sagen , dass sich die Probleme des Exils in Luft auflösen , wenn man mit einem Deutschen verheiratet ist ?
Und wieder Unwahrheiten in den Zwischentönen .
Galima hat nicht vier Jahre in Deutschland in einem sicheren Hafen gelebt .
Was für ein verlogener Unsinn .
Sie ist erst seit Ende 2007 dauerhaft im Land .
Seit dem Anschlag auf Marcus in Kasachstan und den Mord an Alisher Saipow in Kirgistan ist klar , dass Galima auch in anderen Ländern als Usbekistan bedroht ist .
Auf einer Medienkonferenz , die das Auswärtige Amt in Bischkek organisiert hat , traf wenige Monate vor dem Mord an Alisher Saipov eine Delegation aus Usbekistan auf Marcus .
Ein usbekischer Delegierter sagte , usbekische Dienste wüssten , dass Galima in Aserbaidschan ihre propagandistische Arbeit gegen Usbekistan fortsetzte .
Marcus hat das als Drohung aufgefasst .
Sie gaben ihr Quartier in Aserbaidschan auf .
Alisher wurde wenig später im kirgisischen Exil erschossen .
Nachdem Marcus auf der Konferenz über das Massaker in Andischan berichtet hatte , stand ein usbekischer Delegierter auf und zeigte auf Marcus .
Er sagte unwidersprochen im Beisein hochrangiger deutscher Diplomaten , die Tatsache , dass Marcus noch am Leben sei , wäre der Beweis für seine Lügen .
Denn hätten die Usbeken in Andischan ein Massaker verübt , dann hätten sie als ersten Marcus erschossen .
Egal , zurück zum Brief von Heuwagen .
Wie gesagt :
In der Villa gibt es ein Gästezimmer , in denen jeder Freund der Villa , oder sollte ich sagen , jeder Freund von Heuwagen und deren Freunden , für 75 Dollar schlafen kann .
Dort haben immer wieder verschiedenen Gäste gewohnt , die zu Besuch kamen , um ein paar Tage abzuhängen .
Das nur zum Satz :
During all the 15 years we have been working on this , never once did anybody from the board or the dedicated volunteers who set up VA ( Villa Aurora ) stay there for vacation purposes , not once , never . ”
Das Gästeprogramm steht sogar im Internet .
klick
Und hören sie die Drohung :
Last but not least , someone at VA should explain to them , that they better keep the ball low – as they say in German soccer , because Galima is really not the “ writer in exile ” the program was set up for and I would hate to see anyone in the press or German parliament raise that issue . ”
Will Heuwagen Galima ausweisen lassen ?
Will sie Galima im Parlament und in der Presse als Sozialbetrügerin verunglimpfen , als Schnorrerin ?
Ihren Ruf ruinieren ?
Was soll das heißen ?
Aber richtig will ich unten auf einen anderen Punkt eingehen .
Heuwagen schreibt :
It is not the VA , that does not allow children stay there , it is the City of LA and / or the Coastal Commission .
It took us years to get the permits ; it took us even more years to get the Villa running and operating .
We cannot risk loosing any of those permits because one writer in exile wants his family and / or children to stay .
Heuwagen schiebt hier die Verantwortung für das Kinder - Verbot in der Villa auf andere ab .
Und zwar auf die amerikanischen Behörden .
Genau auf die Behörden , die einst Feuchtwanger und seine Frau auf ihrer Flucht vor den Deutschen aufgenommen haben .
Heuwagen sagt , es ist nicht die Hausordnung , die Kinder verbietet .
Eine Hausordnung kann der Hausherr , also sie selbst als Kuratoriumschefin , ändern , anpassen oder ignorieren .
Es sind aber laut Heuwagen die übermächtigen Behörden , die Kinder verbieten .
Die amerikanischen Behörden sind es , die uns wohl meinenden Deutschen Milde und Mitgefühl untersagen .
Mitch war einer der Empfänger der oben angesprochenen Rundmail .
Mitch hat auf den Brief von Heuwagen reagiert :
„ Dear Marianne Heuwagen : I have thought long and hard , and for days , about your letter concertning the journalist Galima Boukharbaeva printed above .
While I can understand how it can be taken as a triviality as to whether or not the Villa Aurora would allow or not allow her small niece to stay with her for two weeks , I have heard both sides , from both sides , and I found the comments in your letter demeaning , arrogant , inappropriate , and very damaging considering your position at Human Rights Watch .
I was shocked by your words because you are speaking from a high public platform .
Words like that should not come from that platform .
If words like yours become public , they could , in fact damage an organization I believe has done a great deal of good work in a world of bad deeds .
Human Rights
Watch is an organization that does not need any bad press .
I myself do some humanitarian work abroad in Burma , I teach the Karen people every year , gratis .
My work is unsubsidized by any organization , or government , and I have been doing the work since 2001 .
I started two orchestras in Burma and this work , along with the work of other dedicated professionals , has resulted in a number of talented Karen students to receive scholarships and study at music conservatories abroad in places like Austria , Thailand , and Singapore .
Some lives of impoverished and oppressed people , in other words , have been changed forever .
I recieve no help whatsoever .
A letter like yours makes me glad I have not taken money from anyone because I have always been afraid of large organizations and the people who rise to the top within them .
Who are they ?
What are their motives ?
For example , an in all modesty , I think Human Rights Watch should maybe have a second look at who you are .
Who are you to decide what is a trifle in the life of someone who has been forced into political exile , whose friends have been tortured and murdered , whose husband has been beaten and left for dead , and who has to live in a country without her family ?
Who are you to decide whether a visit from her niece is a bother or not , or for how many years she has lived somewhere or whom she married ?
This is not any business of yours , and these are shocking words coming from some someone at Human Rights Watch .
Just shocking .
It is one thing to take a side .
It is quite another to take an ATTITUDE , a condescending attitude , an arrogant attitude , and to EXPRESS that attitude to someone who has suffered greatly , particularly when you are doing that from the platform of a humanitarian organization .
From the helm of a district office of an organization that espouses values that are defined to be high minded and humane , I do n’t think it is appropriate .
If this issue was a bother to you , if ANY issue concerning ANY political refugee AT ANY TIME , and FOR ANY REASON , is a BOTHER TO YOU , excuse my presumptive reasoning , but you may have the wrong job .
I once paid a visit a temple which is considered by Burmese , about an hour outside Rangoon , and which sits on a very serene lake , to be among the holiest Buddhist sites in Burma .
A simple sign there , translated in English , Burmese , and Pali , reads , “ The most important things in life are patience and tolerance . ”
In all of Buddhist thought , at the most holy of Buddhist sites in Burma , one of the most troubled , disgusting , military dictatorships in the world , as well as one of the most devout Buddhist nations , this is what the monks chose to say on the modest sign , erected there .
Let me leave you with this .
I choose to forgive you for what you have said to Galima .
But I also want to say that in doing so , you have done some damage , that you have misrepresented a great organization , and you left , in my mind , anyway , a great deal of doubt , about what your organization stands for , what you stand for , and why you have the job you have .
Mitch Markowitz Screenwriter “
Gute Worte . Treffende Worte .
Galima und Marcus haben die Villa nach dem Brief von Mariane Heuwagen verlassen .
Sie sind in ein Motel gezogen .
Sie haben auf eine Entschuldigung gewartet .
Sie haben bei Freunden von Human Rights
Watch nachgefragt , was die davon halten , dass die Deutschland - Chefin der Organisation so einen Brief an eine verfolgte Journalistin im Exil schreibt .
Marcus und Galima haben gewartet .
Nichts passierte .
Aber Marcus und Galima haben in den Staaten Freunde gefunden , die ihnen geholfen haben , Galimas Nichts und Schwester aufzunehmen .
Von der Villa Aurora und Marianne Heuwagen kam keine Reaktion .
Oder , nein , das ist nicht richtig .
Eine Reaktion gab es – eine einzige .
Die Villa Aurora hat Galimas und Marcus US - Visum offiziell kündigen lassen .
Ausreise in maximal vier Wochen .
Verpisst Euch .
Als ich das Ganze gehört habe , dachte ich spontan , dass es die von Heuwagen behauptete Keine - Kinder - Regel nicht geben kann .
Nicht in Amerika .
Die dürfen da Waffen tragen , um zur Not die Regierung zu stürzen .
Und dann soll im Land der Freien die Regierung irgendwem verbieten dürfen , Kinder aufzunehmen ?
An so eine Regel können nur Deutsche glauben , dachte ich .
Ich habe angefangen zu bohren .
Zu suchen .
Zu fragen .
Amerika ist frei .
Ich habe die Umbaugenehmigungen für die Villa Aurora bekommen .
Ich habe die Betriebgenehmigungen bekommen .
Ich habe die Änderungsgenehmigung bekommen und die Anhörungen .
Einfach alles .
Ich habe die Coastal Comission , die City of LA und den Bezirk Pacific Palisades genervt .
Ich habe alle Stellen und Ämter durchstöbert .
Falls es jemanden interessiert :
Hier habe ich alle Dokumente der amerikanischen Behörden zur Villa Aurora , die ich bekommen habe , in einem Zip - Ordner zum Download zusammengefasst .
Klick .
Da kann man alles nachlesen .
Es gibt Beschränkungen , wer wann wo parken darf , wie viele Menschen in der Villa wohnen dürfen und wie viele dort arbeiten .
Von einer Herberge , in der man sich Zimmer mieten kann , ist zwar nicht die Rede , aber von Gästezimmern und Künstlern , die man einladen wolle .
Soweit so gut .
Nirgendwo habe ich die Keine - Kinder - Regel gefunden .
NIRGENDWO .
Stattdessen schrieb Al Padilla von der Coastal Comission :
I cannot think of any governmental agency , State or City , that would place such a restriction . ”
Edgar Garcia von der Cultural Heritage Commission , die für den Denkmalschutz in der Villa verantwortlich ist , sagte :
The Cultural Heritage Commission does not have any authority to issue any kind of recommendation or finding that would prohibit children from entering a property .
Therefore , the Commission never prohibited children from accessing the property . ”
Valerie Cameron vom verantwortlichen Baudezernat der City of LA schrieb :
There is no agency in the City of Los Angeles , or any other government agency that I can think of , that discriminates against children as residents , whether their tenancy is permanent or temporary .
As a matter of fact , landlords cannot deny tenancy to anyone because they have children ; THAT is against the law . ”
Nate Kaplan vom 11 Bezirk in Los Angeles , zu dem Pacific Palisades gehört , rief sogar die Villa selbst an , um zu hören , was das für eine Regel sein soll .
Danach schrieb er :
It is in fact true that this is not a policy set by the City of Los Angeles or the Coastal Commission , rather one set by the Villa Aurora in the Pacific Palisades .
I have confirmation from Corolla from the VA . ( führende Angestellte der Villa Aurora d.A. ) ”
Amerika – das Land der Freien eben .
Das einzige , was die wirklich interessiert in den Genehmigungen , ist die Frage , wie viele Parkplätze auf der Straße benutzt werden dürfen .
Was im Haus los ist , ist denen ziemlich egal .
Ich habe Marianne Heuwagen vor ein paar dutzend Tagen angeschrieben , ob Sie irgendein Dokument vorlegen kann , dass die Keine - Kinder - Regel bestätigt .
Sie hat es bis heute nicht getan .
Ich habe Sie gefragt , warum sie Unsinn als juristische Stellungnahme verbreitet hat .
Sie hat mir geschrieben :
wie schön , dass Sie gründlich recherchieren .
…
Was Kinder anbetrifft , so reicht es völlig aus , dass deren Aufenthalt in der Hausordnung nicht vorgesehen ist . “
Gut .
Nur hat Heuwagen das Kinder - Verbot NICHT mit Bezug auf die Hausordnung verhängt , dann hätte sich kaum einer beschweren können .
Man hätte das nur als kleingeistige Arroganz einer engstirnigen Frau auslegen können .
Aber Frau Heuwagen schrieb in ihrer
Art juristischer Stellungnahme :
It is not the VA , that does not allow children stay there , it is the City of LA and / or the Coastal Commission .
Eine Hausordnung kann man ändern , gesetzliche Regeln nicht .
Heuwagen und die Villa haben sich mit Verweis auf ein staatliches Verbot aus der Verantwortung gestohlen – nichts anderes .
Aber es wird noch perfider .
Marcus und Galima wurde von einer Angesellten gesagt , man müsse Rücksicht auf die Nachbarn nehmen , die seien Einflussreich und könnten durch die Kinder gestört werden .
Die wären so mächtig , die könnten die Betriebsgenehmigung für die Villa in Frage stellen .
Wegen Kindern in der Villa .
Wegen der sechsjährigen Nichte von Galima
Ich glaube Marcus und Galima .
Trotzdem habe ich die entsprechende Angestellte der Villa angeschrieben und gefragt , ob sie tatsächlich diese Sätze gesagt hat .
Ich habe keine Antwort bekommen .
Dafür habe ich mir den Heuwagen - Brief noch mal durchgelesen und auch dort wird gesagt , ein Kind in der Villa könne die Genehmigungen gefährden .
Der Gedanke der Denunzianten aus der Nachbarschaft scheint also zumindest latent in der Villa zu herrschen .
Ich habe Human Rights Watch gefragt , was sie davon halten , dass Marianne Heuwagen als Direktorin des Deutschland - Büros von Human Rights Watch eine juristische Stellungnahme abgibt , in der sie behauptet , die amerikanischen Behörden würden Keine - Kinder - Regeln aufstellen .
Ich bekam auf diese Frage keine Antwort von Human Rights Watch .
Es hieß dort nur , man habe keine „ eigenen Kenntnisse “ von einer solchen Regel .
Dafür bekam Galima eine Antwort von Heuwagen .
Überraschenderweise schrieb ihr jetzt nach gut zwei Monaten die Human - Rights - Watch - Angestellte .
Und zwar unmittelbar nachdem ich im Hauptquartier von Human Rights Watch angefragt hatte , was vom Heuwagen - Statement zu halten sei .
Heuwagen versuchte sich jetzt gegenüber Galima für ihren Brief zu entschuldigen .
Sie schrieb : Galima sei doch irgendwie eine richtige Exilantin und habe schlimmes erlebt , und sie habe Galima nicht beleidigen wollen .
Tja , bleiben die anderen Punkte .
Vor allem die Sache mit der erfundenen Keine - Kinder - Regel .
Ich habe weiter nachgebohrt .
Ich habe gefragt , was mit der Regel ist .
Und Frau Dr. Borries - Knopp schrieb mir abschließend :
Selbstverständlich gibt es die schriftlichen strengen Auflagen der Stadt Los Angeles bezüglich des conditional use permit der Villa Aurora als Künstlerresidenz – sonst hätten wir uns darauf nicht bezogen .
Und von nun an : no further comments !
Gut , ich habe diese conditional use permit der Villa Aurora .
Hier können
Sie sich das Dokument herunterladen .
Klack .
Sie finden dort kein Wort zu einer irgendwie gearteten Kinderregel .
Warum auch , wie ich mittlerweile erfahren habe , waren andere Kinder schon in der Villa .
Die Afghanin Mary Ayubi aus dem „ Writer in Exile “ - Programm war mit einem Kind da .
Genauso wie Steffi Weismann aus dem Künstlerprogramm im Jahr 2008 .
Was also steckt hinter dem Kinder - Verbot für Galima und Marcus ?
Ich kann es mir nicht erklären , ich habe nur eine Vermutung .
Eine Spekulation .
Ich denke jetzt laut nach .
Und komme zurück auf den Brief von Marianne Heuwagen , den Außenminister und SPD - Kanzlerkandiaten Frank - Walter Steinmeier und auf Geld .
Heuwagen schreibt :
I do not want to hear from Marcus or anybody else in that matter again , its is too annoying . ”
Warum ist das Annoying ?
Warum ist es nervig , wenn sich jemand für die Gefühle seiner Frau einsetzt ?
Oder geht es um etwas anderes , womit Marcus Heuwagen nervt ?
Human Rights
Watch setzt sich seit Jahren für die Menschenrechte in Usbekistan ein .
Und Marcus hatte in dieser Sache mit Heuwagen zu tun .
Vor fast einem
Jahr etwa wurde der mit Marcus und Galima befreundete Journalist Salijon Abdurahmanov in Usbekistan vom Diktator Karimow verhaftet , ihm wurden Drogen untergeschoben und er wurde zu 10 Jahren Haft verurteilt .
Abdurahmanov hat für Galimas Webseite gearbeitet .
Reporter ohne Grenzen haben zügig über den Fall berichtet .
Doch Human Rights
Watch hat zu dem Fall lange geschwiegen .
Das ist unüblich , denn gerade Human Rights
Watch ist dafür bekannt , schnell und umfassend über Menschenrechtsverletzungen und Verhaftungen in Usbekistan zu berichten .
Marcus hat daher öfter Heuwagen und Human Rights Watch in New York angeschrieben .
Er wollte wissen , warum Human Rights Watch in diesem Fall schweigt , und keine Erklärung zu Gunsten des verhafteten Freundes abgibt .
Heuwagen und Human Rights
Watch haben ihn immer wieder vertröstet .
Immer wieder gab es Ausreden , man könne nun keine Erklärung abgeben , weil jemand im Urlaub sei oder verhindert .
Was weiß ich .
Vielleicht stimmen die Erklärungen ja sogar .
Allerdings lief in der Zwischenzeit etwas anders ab .
Gegen Usbekistan hatte die EU auch dank der Berichte von Marcus und Galima Sanktionen verhängt .
Deutschland und Steinmeier störte sich an den Sanktionen , da sie die Beziehungen zu Usbekistan erschwerten , dem Gastland der Deutschen Truppen .
Das usbekische Regime änderte sich jedoch aufgrund der Sanktionen nicht .
Menschenrechte wurde weiter unterdrückt , es gab keine Aufklärung über das Andischan - Massaker und keine Bewegung in Fragen der Pressefreiheit .
Da erfand Steinmeier den Menschenrechtsdialog mit Usbekistan .
Er gaukelte Fortschritte mit dem Despoten in Taschkent vor .
Das Büro von Human Rights Watch in Usbekistan war zum Beispiel in Folge des Andischan - Massakers unbesetzt geblieben .
Die Mitarbeiter von Human Rights Watch erhielten schlicht kein Visum mehr .
Nun erreichte die EU während der Embargo - Verhandlungen von Usbekistan die Zusage , die Mitarbeiter von Human Rights Watch wieder ins Land zu lassen ( klack ) und schrieb dies auch in den EU Beschluss , der die Sanktionen bis auf das Waffenembargo gegen Usbekistan aufhob ( klick ) .
Genau in dieser Zeit entschied sich das Schicksal von Abdurahmanov .
Und Human Rights
Watch schwieg .
Einige Menschrechtler wurden freigelassen , andere festgenommen .
Erst als die Verhandlungen mit Uskebistan über die Neubesetzung des Human Rights Watch Büros in Taschkent scheiterten , kam die erste Erklärung der Menschenrechtler zu Abdurahmanov .
klick
Bis heute hat Human Rights Watch keinen Mitarbeiter in Usbekistan .
Das deutsche Außenministerium und die EU haben die Menschenrechtsorganisation schlicht für ihre diplomatischen Spielchen benutzt .
Anfang diesen Jahres hat Marcus dann wochenlang versucht , von Heuwagen und Human Rights Watch eine Statement zu bekommen , als die usbekische Präsidententochter Gulnara Karimova und gleichzeitige usbekische Botschafterin bei der UN in Genf zusammen mit Chopard eine Schmucklinie herausgab .
Die Präsentation wäre eine Gelegenheit gewesen , auf die menschenverachtende Diktatur in Zentralasien aufmerksam zu machen .
Eine der wichtigsten Repräsentantin des Folterstaates wollte sich schließlich im Westen mit ihrem Blutschmuck profilieren .
Heuwagen und mit ihr Human Rights Watch haben eine Stellungnahme schriftlich abgelehnt .
Es schien , als sei eine Konfrontation mit dem Unterdrückerstaat , um den sich Steinmeier bemüht , nicht gewünscht .
Warum diese Milde gegen das usbekische Regime ?
Sollte man nicht erwarten , dass eine Menschenrechtsorganisation , die sich für die Menschenrechte in Usbekistan einsetzen will , dies auch nachhaltig tut , zumindest mit zwei Erklärungen oder Briefen ?
Heuwagen ist die wichtigste Vertreterin von Human Rights Watch in Deutschland .
Sie hat oft und viel mit dem Außenministerium von SPD - Kanzlerkandidat Frank - Walter Steinmeier zu tun .
Als Vertreterin von Human Rights
Watch muss sie Druck machen , das ist ihr Job .
Sie muss unabhängig sein und stark .
Um Interessenskonflikte zu vermeiden , hat sich Human Rights Watch deshalb strikte Regeln gegeben .
Auf der Webseite der Organisation heißt es :
Um unsere Unabhängigkeit zu bewahren , lehnen wir jegliche direkte oder indirekte finanzielle Unterstützung von Regierungen ab . “
Mit diser Regel wird um Spendengelder geworben .
Die Regel ist simpel : Führende Mitarbeiter sollen sich nicht korrumpierbar machen und nicht dem Einfluss von Regierungen verfallen .
Auch nicht dem Einfluss des SPD - Kanzlerkandidaten und deutschen Außenministers Frank - Walter Steinmeier .
In der Vergangenheit hat Human Rights Watch auch die deutsche Politik und deren Haltung zu Usbekistan oft und scharf kritisiert .
Aber erinnern sie sich an die Geschichte am Anfang ?
Die Rolle Usbekistans in der deutschen Außenpolitik ?
Nun , es gibt eine Verbindung zwischen Heuwagen und dem Außenministerium von Steinmeier , die seltsam ist und auch hinterfragbar .
Nach den Angaben von Offiziellen der Villa Aurora finanziert das deutsche Außenministerium die Aktivitäten der Villa Aurora in Los Angeles .
Heuwagen als Chefin des Kuratoriums der Villa lässt sich als Mitgründerin , als Ideengeberin der Villa feiern .
Die Villa ist so was wie ihr Kind .
Aus einem Brief einer Heuwagen Untergebenen :
Frau Heuwagen hat sich um den Erhalt der Villa Aurora sehr verdient gemacht , und wir sind ihr alle sehr dankbar für ihr großes Engagment in der Gründerphase der Villa Aurora .
Denn ohne ihr aufopferungsvolles Engagement als ehrenamtliche Mitgründerin gäbe es das Artist - in - Residence - Center heute nicht , von dem so viele Künstler und auch Exilschriftsteller seit über 14 Jahren profitieren .
Sie ist sozusagen die Mutter des Projekts . “
Heuwagen genießt also eine Ehre , die ihr das Außenministerium finanziert , bezahlt , schenkt .
Auch mit Ehre kann man korrumpieren .
Damit nicht genug : Das Außenministerium bezahlt nicht nur die Show in LA .
Im Kuratorium der Villa Aurora sitzt zudem Michael Zenner .
Er ist ein Vertreter von SPD - Kanzlerkandidat und Außenminister Steinmeier .
Und zwar ist Zenner sein Beauftragter für Kommunikation in Zentralasien .
Das ist einer der Männer , der die PR für Steinmeier macht , damit Usbekistan nicht mehr als eine der schlimmsten Diktaturen in der
Welt da steht , sondern als Partner der Deutschen .
Ich zitiere nochmal aus dem Brief der Geschäftführerin der Villa Aurora .
When XY ( Name gekürzt d. A ) proposed Galima as the Villa Aurora fellow for 2009 , we had a lot of doubts first , because she already had lived in Germany since 2005 , being married to a German , and thus not fitting in our concept ( in accordance with the German Foreign Office ) of helping writers who are living in their countries under continuous persecution or observation as dissidents . ”
Verstehe ich recht , dass nicht die Freunde der Villa alleine die „ Writer in Exile “ auswählen , sondern , dass die „ Writer in Exile “ den Ansprüchen des deutschen Außenministeriums entsprechen müssen ?
Das deutsche Auswärtige Amt unter der Führung Steinmeiers hat sich den usbekischen Despoten Islam Karimow zum Partner ausgeguckt , in dessen Reich von Panzerwagen auf Frauen und Kinder geschossen wird , über sechstausend politische Häftlinge in Lagern in den Wahnsinn gefoltert werden , Journalisten und Menschenrechtler verhaftet , verfolgt und getötet werden .
Und dieses auswärtige
Amt entscheidet darüber , wer im Haus von Lion Feuchtwanger , der vor den Nazis aus Deutschland flüchten musste , als Exilant anzusehen ist und wer nicht ?
Und gerade die vielleicht wichtigste Stimme des unterdrückten Usbekistan , Galima Bukharbaeva , soll diesen Regeln des deutschen Auswärtigen Amt eigentlich nicht entsprechen , so schreibt die Geschäftsführerin des Villa - Vereins ?
Ich fass mal die Fakten zusammen .
Marcus und Galima haben Steinmeier und seine Politik in Zentralasien scharf angegriffen .
Galima hat aus der Villa Aurora heraus weiter gegen Usbekistans Diktator gearbeitet .
Heuwagen hat sich als Direktorin von Human Rights Watch in Deutschland mindestens zweimal zögerlich gezeigt , wenn es darum ging auf Anfrage von Marcus und Galima Vorgänge in Usbekistan zu kommentieren .
In ihrer zweiten Rolle als Kuratoriums - Chefin der Villa Aurora hat sie Druck gegen Marcus und Galima gemacht .
Und Galimas Ruf angegriffen .
Ich frage mich :
Gibt es einen Zusammenhang zwischen dem Finanzier der Villa , dem Außenministerium von SPD - Kanzlerkandidat Frank - Walter Steinmeier , der behaupteten Keine - Kinder - Regel , Marcus und Galima sowie Marianne Heuwagen ?
Es gibt ein Indiz , dass darauf hindeutet .
Ich habe weiter nachgefragt , was mit der Keine - Kinder - Regel ist , ob Heuwagen oder die Villa Aurora eine Verfügung der Behörden vorlegen können .
Überraschenderweise bekam ich zum Schluss Post und zwar direkt und unterschrieben aus dem Hauptquartier von Bundesminister Dr. Frank - Walter Steinmeier , SPD - Parteivorstand , Willy - Brandt - Haus , Wilhelmstraße 141 , 10963 Berlin .
Markus Klimmer schrieb mir da in seiner Rolle als direkter Berater von Steinmeier und als neuer Vorstandsvorsitzender der Villa Aurora .
Die Villa habe über die Jahre
seinen Entscheidungen immer die Rechtsauffassung zugrunde gelegt , dass in den USA alles , was nicht ausdrücklich erlaubt ist , nicht durch den Permit abgedeckt ist . “
Angesichts der großen Schwierigkeiten , unter denen die Betriebserlaubnis für die Villa erteilt worden sei , „ werden wir diese Rechtsauffassung auch künftig vertreten “ .
Und weiter schreibt der Steinmeier - Berater und Freund .
Alle Stipendiatinnen und Stipendiaten werden vor Reiseantritt ausführlich auf diese Rahmenbedingungen aufmerksam gemacht .
Ich füge hinzu : Die Villa ist als denkmalgeschütztes Haus eine Art historisches Museum .
Da sich dort jeder frei bewegen kann , ist die Villa nicht für den Aufenthalt von Kindern ausgelegt .
Besuch von Verwandten ist gleichermaßen ausgeschlossen .
Dies werden und müssen wir auch künftig so handhaben . “
Kein Wort davon , dass in der Villa schon Kinder geschlafen haben , kein Wort von dem Gästezimmer , das man für einen Tripp mieten kann .
Kein
Wort dazu , dass bisher immer behauptet wurde , es gebe eine behördliche Auflage keine Kinder in der Villa schlafen zu lassen .
Stattdessen präsentiert der Kanzlerkandidaten - Berater eine Rechtsauffassung , die mich erschauern lässt .
Alles was nicht „ ausdrücklich “ erlaubt ist , ist verboten .
Auf dem Rasen spielen ?
Nicht „ ausdrücklich “ erlaubt – also verboten .
Eine Oskarparty feiern ?
Nicht „ ausdrücklich “ erlaubt – also verboten .
Sekt trinken , Zigarre rauchen ?
Nicht „ ausdrücklich “ erlaubt – also verboten .
Ein Gästeprogramm wie die Villa es auf ihrer Webseite anpreist ?
Nicht „ ausdrücklich “ erlaubt – also verboten .
Oh , das wird aber trotzdem gemacht .
Hab ich was übersehen ?
Mein Gott , diese Rechtsaufassung vertritt ein Mann , der unser Land anleiten will .
Wer ist überhaupt dieser Dr. Klimmer .
Vor ihm war Freimut Duve Vorstandschef der Villa .
Duve ist wegen seines Einsatzes für die Menschenrechte seit Jahrzehnten bekannt .
Markus Klimmer hat früher bei McKinsey gearbeitet und ist jetzt Wirtschaftsfachmann in Steinmeiers Wahlkampfteam .
Was versteht dieser Mann vom Exil und vom politischen Kampf für die Freiheit des Wortes ?
Und wieso wird gerade er Vorstandschef in der Feuchtwanger Villa ?
Falls Herr Dr. Klimmer bis hierhin liest : Sie und Ihr Chef , Herr Dr. Steinmeier , Sie wollen überzeugte Sozialdemokraten sein ?
Sozialdemokraten , wie wir sie im Ruhrgebiet kennen ?
Freundliche , warme Menschen , die wissen , dass Menschen immer wichtiger sind als dumpfe Regeln .
Herr Dr. Klimmer , es gibt nicht mal eine Regel , die es Ihnen verbietet , Kinder in der Villa aufzunehmen .
Es ist Ihre „ Rechtsauffassung “ , die sie sich einreden , Kinder seien Bah .
Herr Dr. Klimmer , sie sind ein Apparatschik .
Da sich dort jeder frei bewegen könne , sei die Villa nicht für den Aufenthalt von Kindern ausgelegt , schreiben Sie .
Herr Dr. Klimmer wollen Sie Kinder an die Leine legen ?
Stören Sie etwa Kinder .
In der Kirche ?
Im Museum ?
Auf der Wiese vor Ihrem Haus ?
Was zur Hölle haben Sie gegen Kinder , Herr Dr. Klimmer ?
In den Betriebsgenehmigungen für die Villa wird die Aufnahme von Menschen als Gästen „ ausdrücklich “ erlaubt .
Sind für Sie , Herr Dr. Klimmer , Kinder keine Menschen ?
Überhaupt : Herr Dr. Klimmer , wo ist Ihre „ ausdrückliche “ Erlaubnis zu atmen ?
Sie wissen , was das nach ihrer Logik heißt , wenn Sie keine Erlaubnis fürs Atmen vorweisen können ?
Verboten .
Mich erschreckt das totalitäre Antlitz hinter der „ Rechtsauffassung “ von Herrn Dr. Klimmer .
Was für einen Anspruch an Recht hat dieser Mann an der Spitze unseres Staates .
Wie will er sich um das große Ganze kümmern , wenn er im Kleinen so versagt .
Wie anders ist das in den USA .
Dort darf niemand diskriminiert werden .
Dort gibt es sogar ein entsprechendes Gesetz dazu , dass niemand wegen seines Alters , seiner Rasse , seines Geschlechtes wegen diskriminiert werden darf .
Wie Valerie Cameron vom verantwortlichen Baudezernat der City of LA schrieb :
As a matter of fact , landlords cannot deny tenancy to anyone because they have children ; THAT is against the law . ”
Ich habe Al Padilla von der Coastal Comission nochmal gefragt , was er von der Rechtsauffassung des persönlichen Steinmeier - Beraters Dr. Klimmer hält .
Ist tatsächlich alles verboten , was nicht „ ausdrücklich “ erlaubt ist ?
In einer Email hatte Dr. Klimmer mir geschrieben , er habe als McKinsey - Berater entsprechende Erfahrungen in den Staaten gemacht .
Sind Kinder also wegen ihrer Nicht - Erwähnung in der Erlaubnis verboten .
Al hat geantwortet :
Well , that ’s a bunch of rubbish .
If there is not a specific condition , ordinance , rule , restriction , etc. , then absence or silence does not mean a prohibition .
As I told you and you can clearly see in our permit , we have no such restriction .
And based on what the City has permitted and has told you , neither does the City .
I can not speculate why the Germany Villa Organization would say such a thing , but based on the facts , as presented up to now , it is not true .
Unless they come up with something in writing that specifically says „ no children “ , then children are allowed .
You must have written an article in the past that got them mad . 🙂
Ich weiß nicht was ich dazu noch sagen soll .
Eigentlich ist es auch egal .
Weil der Kern der Story immer noch der ist :
Die Chefin von Human Rights Watch Deutschland lässt sich ihr Hobby vom Deutschen Staat bezahlen .
Sie lässt sich als „ Mutter “ der Villa ihr Kind von dem Ministerium finanzieren , dass sie überwachen soll .
Sie kontrolliert die Einrichtung mit den Bürokraten , auf die Sie Einfluss nehmen soll , damit sich diese für die Durchsetzung der Menschenrechte einsetzen .
Und ausgerechnet in Zentralasien tun diese Bürokraten das mit angezogener Handbremse .
Und als Krone dieser Geschichte erzählt die Chefin von Human Rights Watch Deutschland ein Märchen von einem verbotswütigen Amerika , in dem angeblich Bürokraten Kindern den Besuch von Verwandten in irgendwelchen Häusern verbieten würden .
Ich habe die Human Rights Watch Zentrale in den USA gefragt , was Sie von dieser Nummer halten ?
Dass sich ihre deutsche Direktorin ihr Hobby von Steinmeiers Ministerium bezahlen lässt , dass sie ihr Ehrenamt auf Rücken der Behörden wahrnimmt .
Der Human Rights Watch Zentrale ist das egal , ob ihre Direktorin vom deutschen Außenministerium gepampert wird .
Es heißt :
HRW does not consider it a conflict of interest as neither she nor HRW derives any material benefit from it , nor does this position have a role in making determinations as to the fellowships or other benefits granted by Villa Aurora .
Ms. Heuwagen does not determine policy for HRW on Russia and Central Asia , and it is far - fetched to suggest that her role as an honorary chair or this dispute , which does not involve HRW in any way and about which HRW expresses no opinion , would have any effect on our work in those regions .
Es ging es nur um ein Mädchen , sechs Jahre alt , das seine Tante besuchen wollte für zehn Tage in einem fremden Land .
Ein Mädchen , das in die Wogen der Weltpolitik gerät und von den Interessen Steinmeiers , seiner Berater und Frau Heuwagen überrollt wird .
– Nachtrag –
Die Geschichte steht nun schon ein paar Tagen online .
Ich habe von der Villa Aurora eine Reaktion erwartet .
Irgendeine .
Es kam bis jetzt nichts .
Stattdessen fiel mir folgender Brief in der Endphase des Wahlkampfes im Jahr 2009 auf : klack .
Zehn Tage vor der Abstimmung zum Parlament trafen sich da Frauen in kleiner Runde zum Kaffeeklatsch mit Frank - Walter Steinmeier ( SPD ) .
Es heißt in dem Brief :
Rund 20 Frauen aus den unterschiedlichen Bereichen des gesellschaftlichen Lebens sind heute der Einladung des Bundesaußenministers und SPD - Kanzlerkandidaten Frank - Walter Steinmeier gefolgt und haben bei einem gemeinsamen Frühstück über frauenpolitische Themen diskutiert .
Dann haben die Damen Steinmeier den Aufruf : „ Frauen für Frank - Walter Steinmeier “ vorgestellt .
Die Anhängerinnen des Ministers fordern darin die Gleichberechtigung „ in der Wirtschaft auch in Führungspositionen “ und „ keine Herdprämie und keinen Küchenbonus “ .
Zitat :
Das geht nur mit einem Kanzler , der aus der Gleichberechtigung des Grundgesetzes eine Gleichstellung in der Wirklichkeit schafft .
Frank - Walter Steinmeier trauen wir das zu .
Deswegen unterstützen wir ihn .
Zwanzig Frauen als Vertreterinnen der Frauenbewegung .
Eine der Unterzeichnerinnen hat zumindest ihren Job auch , weil ihr Brötchengeber vom Ministerium Steinmeiers finanziert wird .

Welcome !
Here you will find me open up my soul ...
It began with a shaggy , Ancient Mariner figure dragging himself along a seashore .
Its jaunty credit sequence intertwined cartoon flowers and the photographed heads of Victorian grandees .
It introduced viewers to Arthur " Two Sheds " Jackson and the Funniest Joke in the World – and it was the start of a five - year love affair between the British TV audience and a world of cosily surreal humour .
Monty Python 's Flying Circus first hit the airwaves 40 years ago , on 5 October , 1969 .
The timing was awful : it went out late on a Sunday night , in a slot formerly filled by a religious programme .
But rumours of its surreal brilliance spread along the schoolboy grapevine , catchphrases ( " And now for something completely different , " " Bloody Vikings " ) began to appear in newspapers , and mildly satirical visual gags , like the Upper - Class Twit of the Year Contest or the Ministry of Silly Walks , were greeted as though they represented mad anarchy .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
By the beginning of the new decade ( programmes 12 and 13 were screened in January 1970 ) the nation was hooked on the new cult of Python : men with knotted handkerchiefs on their heads , shrill - voiced housewives in blue rinses , huge cartoon feet descending from the sky to squash the action , ancient footage of WI ladies applauding , stiff newsreaders and pretentious arts - show presenters , mendacious shopkeepers , and intrusive brigadiers closing down sketches with the words " Too silly ... "
But was it actually funny ?
As with The Goon Show before it and The Fast Show after it , Monty Python established the taste by which it was judged .
It was different .
There were no punchlines , no scenes that ended with close - ups of a discomfited face , no anchorman , no musical interludes , no studio audience and no laughter track .
Instead , a mix of cod-interviews , cod-documentary and cod-information was stitched together by Gilliam 's hilarious bloated animations and naked Victorian cut-outs .
Watching the first episode now , I can recall the delight with which ( aged 15 ) I watched the procession of unexplained bizzarerie on the screen .
The hairy old man of the sea struggling 100 yards to utter the word " It's ... " .
The squeals of dead pigs as they 're squashed one by one .
Mozart presenting a series on Famous Deaths ( " We start with the wonderful death of Genghis Khan , conqueror of India . " )
The Italian lesson in a class of noisy Italians .
The interview that gets nowhere because the interviewer is distracted by his guest 's nickname .
The cross-cutting between a Grandstand - type TV studio and roving - mike correspondents waiting to encounter Pablo Picasso executing a painting while riding a bicycle on the A272 .
The conceit of " The world 's funniest joke " which makes all who hear it die laughing , and is co-opted into the Allied cause in the war ...
Inevitably , there 's some distance between the memory of watching the first Python and the experience of seeing it now .
Terry Gilliam 's surreal animations are still a delight and have n't aged a millisecond .
The logic by which scenes are linked ( by blackboards , signposts , bits of elderly artwork ) still seem the work of fertile imaginations , while it 's hard not to laugh at the subversion of po-faced TV presenters .
But after that – goodness , how tired it looks .
The pacing is all wrong : after the rapid - fire early sketches , the " Funniest Joke " section outstays its welcome by several minutes , and leaves you frustrated that the joke itself is never translated from German .
Did they expect the viewers to understand it ?
The suspicion that the writers were being a touch elitist is worsened by the Oxbridge smart - aleckry on display .
Would any comedy writer today name - drop so many historical names , confident that the audience would be dead impressed ?
Richard III , Marat , Jean d'Arc , Lincoln , Edward VII , Nelson , Mozart , Kandinsky , Braque , Mondrian , Chagall , Ernst , Kokoscha , Schwitters ...
Gosh , well done , chaps , for having a nodding acquaintance with French and art history -- not that it 's being used for any actual humorous effect .
Modern viewers might also raise an eyebrow at the underlying homophobia : the arts interviewer who wants to call his film - director guest " sweetie " , " sugar plum " and " angel - drawers " has a moment with another arty poseur .
" Never mind , Timmy , " says the latter .
" Oh Michael you are such a comfort , " says the former .
You can hear the sneers coming off the writers like cologne : " These guys are pretentious .
And they 're poofs . "
Looking back , I suspect it was the lovely randomness of the show – the sense that anything could start or stop at any time , or be interrupted by a giant foot or a human hand – that most delighted my generation in 1969 .
And we loved the individual performers , especially Cleese and Palin .
But a lot of Python was stuck fast in the public - school - Oxbridge ethos , the comedy of the schoolroom , the naughtiness of playing foolish japes on figures of authority .
It liberated us all from the tyranny of the punchline – but it may be time to stop thinking that the liberation was a revolution .

On 23rd October almost 4,000 workers from different trade unions took part in a demonstration in defence of their workplaces .
About 500 people are going to be fired from the Cegielski factory due to the so - called economic crisis .
Anarchists and members of anarcho - syndicalist trade union Wokers ' Initiative also took part in the protest .
The demonstrtors first gathered on the premises of the factory and then moved towards the Provincial Office .
The bloc of Workers ' Initiative and Sierpien ' 80 together with the anarchists was chanting slogans such as “ Government out to the pavement , paving stones on the government ” , “ One , two , three , four , stop those damn dismissals ” , “ A worker dismissed , a boss hanged ” , “ Capitalism is n't working !
factories under the control of workers ” etc. Rhythms of Resistance samba group from Poznan supported the demo with their rhythms .
A banner saying “ A worker dismissed , a boss hanged ” was dropped from one building on the route of the demo .
When the demonstration reached the Provincial Office , the leaders of Solidarnosc trade union ( which organized the demonstration ) were declaring a radical fight in defence of the workplaces and even “ burning the office ” , at the same time they were buring car tyres .
When the anarchists joined the shipyard workers in the back of the office building clashes with the police broke out , then the shipyard workers retreated as they were told to by their leaders .
After the demonstration had finished , the cops on horses surrounded a group of anarchists and WI activists , also those from Cegielski factory and took their I.D.s .
At the same time one of the WI activists interrupted a live TV interview given by the boss of Solidarnosc and said “ The members of our union are being nicked over there , and people from Solidarnosc are doing nothing about it , where is your solidarity ??!! ” .
This event was trasmitted live to the public TV news .
None of the demonstrators was arrested .
Three cops and one unionist got injured and hospitalized .

In 2002 , President George W. Bush helped make us poorer by signing off on higher steel tariffs .
In 2009 , President Barack Obama helped make us poorer by signing off on higher tire tariffs .
Is this supposed to be change we can believe in ?
Economic analysis shows that trade creates wealth .
The law of comparative advantage demonstrates that when we specialize and trade , we produce more wealth using the same resources .
Preventing trade means that we use more resources to produce less wealth .
A simple example illustrates the essential logic of comparative advantage .
Suppose Amy can produce either one hundred oranges or ten tires in a day while Chen can produce either ten oranges or two tires in a day .
At first glance , it does n't look like they have anything to gain from one another :
Amy is much more productive than Chen .
When we compare their opportunity costs , however , a different story emerges .
The opportunity cost is what you have to give up to get something else .
To produce one hundred oranges , Amy gives up the opportunity to produce ten tires .
Her opportunity cost of an orange is one tenth of a tire , and her opportunity cost of a tire is ten oranges .
Chen 's opportunity cost of an orange is one fifth of a tire , and her opportunity cost of a tire is five oranges .
In terms of tires , it is cheaper for Amy to produce oranges because she only gives up one tenth of a tire to produce an orange while Chen has to give up one fifth of a tire .
In terms of oranges , it is cheaper for Chen to produce tires because he only gives up five oranges to produce a tire while Amy gives up ten oranges to produce a tire .
They can both have more oranges and more tires if they specialize and trade .
Suppose Chen offers
Amy one tire in exchange for seven oranges .
Chen would be better off because he would get seven oranges in exchange for one tire , whereas he would only get five oranges in exchange for one tire if he produced them himself .
So if Chen is better off , Amy has to be worse off , right ?
Wrong .
This is an attractive deal for Amy too , because she can get a tire for only seven oranges , which is fewer than the ten oranges she would have to give up if she produced tires herself .
At any " orange price " of tires between five and ten , Amy and Chen are both better off .
Economists have shown that the same logic applies to trade between countries as well .
Simply replace " Amy " with " the United States of America " and " Chen " with " China , " and you can easily see that both countries are better off if they can specialize and trade .
This law of comparative advantage is one of the most important and most poorly understood ideas in economics .
It is also an anvil that has worn out many hammers .
In spite of repeated objections from noneconomists and even a few theoretical counterexamples from economists , the law of comparative advantage remains robust .
Tire protectionism has other unintended but predictable consequences as well .
Since we are poorer , we have fewer resources to invest in education , health care , and innovation .
Also , higher tire prices means that some people will drive on worn - out tires longer than they otherwise would , which increases accident risk and will likely lead to more highway deaths .
There is another effect that goes beyond simple economics 101 .
In addition to an introductory course , I also teach courses in economic history and the history of economic ideas .
In these classes , I focus on the role of institutions , ideas , communities , and secure private property rights in historical economic change .
$ 50 $ 44 " Preventing trade means that we use more resources to produce less wealth . "
The president 's capitulation to special interests tells people that they can expect the government to take care of them when things do not go their way .
It encourages people to invest resources in picking others ' pockets rather than producing wealth .
History is littered with the dry bones of civilizations that encouraged Peter to get rich by robbing Paul .
Protectionism is a step toward the dustbin of history .
The salutary effects of trade are sometimes hard to see , but they are very real and very important .
By embracing protectionism , President Obama has adopted a policy that works against his supposed concern for Americans ' well - being by reducing innovation , destroying wealth , perverting incentives , and encouraging destructive nationalism .
Protectionism gives politicians an opportunity to appease special interests , but we 're all worse off for it .

New features in the fish shell
[ Development ] Posted Sep 29 , 2020 17:52 UTC ( Tue ) by ayoisaiah
Fish ( the " friendly interactive shell " ) has the explicit goal of being more user - friendly than other shells .
It features a modern command - line interface with syntax highlighting , tab completion , and auto - suggestions out of the box ( all with no configuration required ) .
Unlike many of its competitors , it does n't care about being POSIX - compliant but attempts to blaze its own path .
Since our last look at the project , way back in 2013 , it has seen lots of new releases with features , bug fixes , and refinements aimed at appealing to a wide range of users .
Some of the biggest additions landed in the 3.0 release , but we will also describe some other notable changes from version 2.1 up through latest version .

The Hate Preacher Who Lost His Venom Infamous Islamist Imam Forswears Terror

Dear Cecil :
For years those sugarless gum commercials have said , " Sugarless gum is recommended by four out of five dentists for their patients who chew gum . "
What does the fifth dentist recommend ?
Gum with sugar ?
Elizabeth E. , Towson , Maryland
Cecil replies :
Oh , sure , Elizabeth , why not ?
It ’s like tire dealers scattering tacks on the road .
Fact is , the fifth dentist usually recommended no gum at all .
Not the kind of advice a chewing - gum company wants to play up real big .
The Warner - Lambert Company , makers of Trident sugarless gum , commissioned a market research firm to survey dentists in July 1976 .
The research people came up with a list of 1,200 dentists who were supposed to represent a cross-section of their profession .
The dentists were asked what they recommended to their gum - chewing patients –sugared gum , sugarless gum , or no gum at all .
Sugarless gum won with 85 percent .
Nobody seems to remember exactly how many votes sugared gum got , but I figure there had to be at least one .
Cast by the same guy that in a real election always votes for Donald Duck .

Surely by now you 've seen pictures or videos of flexible OLEDs -- many from Samsung .
Did you ever wonder just how durable the things are ?
The video after the break should answer that question .
In it , one of the Hammer Bros. from the Super Mario games , apparently frustrated about Polyphony Digital 's endless delays , is attempting to destroy a screen looping a Gran Turismo 5 clip .
A traditional LCD shatters like so much porcelain , while the 2.8 - inch , 20 micrometer thick OLED display is completely unaffected , even when folded .
Impressive , and apparently just the thing to wear when exploring the Mushroom Kingdom .
http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalletOfHolding
— The Dungeonomicon note Actually , it 's not all that unreasonable ; 100 Troy pounds of gold works out at about $ 1,410,000 .
The rent on it would still just be a handful of coins every month .
Quite expensive for a house , but not entirely implausible .
" 100 pounds of gold for a house ?
How does anyone make rent without a wheelbarrow ? "
In most modern video games - RPGs in particular - the principle of Money for Nothing strongly applies , to the extent that it 's not rare to end some games with a cashflow in six or more digits .
And several of these games depict money as collectible gold pieces .
Tie these together and you have the Wallet of Holding , where a quantity of gold which would in reality amount to several tons ( five million 24kt gold coins the size of the British fivepence piece would be over 41,000 kilos ) and take up a colossal amount of space ( the same amount would cover a football pitch ) tucks up nice and neatly into a - completely disconnected part of the inventory where money takes up no space or weight .
Advertisement :
This trope can be justified in futuristic settings , where the money you carry is n't physical , or even in present - day settings given the ubiquity of credit cards .
It has a tendency to be more prominent in games where you have a limited inventory or carrying capacity for objects .
This is usually an used as an anti-frustration feature , unless the game is specifically trying to keep you from amassing too much wealth at once as part of an Anti-Grinding feature .
An intermediate solution is the Wallet Upgrade , where there is a cap on the amount of money you can collect , but this will be increased one or more times in the game .
See also Bag of Holding , Hollywood Density .

Straight examples :
open / close all folders
First Person Shooter
In Borderlands and all of its sequels , money is depicted as an actual physical cash item that you pick up , and in some cases as other objects such as gemstones or crystals .
You can literally be carrying millions of bucks in cash and it weighs nothing .
This is actually justified in - universe , as everyone carries a Storage Deck Unit which " digistructs " material objects into a digital storage device that can be stored on one 's belt .
Later games add other currencies , such as Eridium , moonstones , and Torgue tokens that also take up no space .
MMORPG
In World of Warcraft Gold coins can be carried in infinite amounts .
Gold bars , on the other hand , can only be carried 20 per stack .
Let 's not even get into the fact that a gold bar is only worth 6 silver ( 0.06 gold ) .
Of course , you can only carry gold in infinite amounts if you are a subscriber - if not , you can only carry 10 gold .
Not only can you carry an infinite number of gold coins , you can always make change .
If you have 6 gold , and you give 50 silver to another player who 's carrying 7 gold , you end up with 5 gold 50 silver in your pocket and he ends up with 7 gold 50 silver .
Where did those 100 silver pieces come from ?
Likewise , if you 're carrying 2 gold 90 silver , and you loot 20 silver from a monster 's corpse , you are now carrying 3 gold 10 silver - not 2 gold 110 silver .
Like the Runescape example below , the amount you can carry is capped only by the signed 32 - bit integer used to store it .
In Runescape gold coins , or gp , are a weightless inventory item limited in quantity only by the game engine .
The limit comes out to 2,147,483,647gp .
The same thing is also true of other items in the game that are stackable in the inventory .
For these items you can keep 2,147,483,647 of them in a single slot in your inventory .
Most but not all items stack in the bank the same way even if they do not stack in the inventory .
With the currency pouch update , the player can also store every other kind of currency in the game without taking any inventory space .
Also played straight in Elsword .
Money caps at 2 billion .
Most shops only sell items in the thousands price range , so that 's no problem for supply restocking .
The only time you 'll need to grind money forever and a day is on the player - controlled market , where rare costume pieces and gear can easily run hundreds of millions .
The Elder Scrolls Online :
Unlike the previous titles , your inventory is now limited by the number of unique objects and not their weight , even though septims are still ' weightless ' .
This is quite frustrating , as it puts a damper on the traditional loot sprees that Elder Scrolls players usually do to tiny items ; carrying a greatsword is now less cumbersome than carrying two different types of extremely light crafting materials .
Much of the gold in your wallet of holding will have to go towards purchasing a bigger bag , which is already ridiculous as they 're made from poor - looking materials and are the size of a watermelon .
The fact that Final Fantasy XI has this frustrates players to no end , as while you can hold millions upon millions of gil as soon as you start out , you have to jump through about 50 hoops to upgrade your 30 on - character and 50 at - home inventory spaces .
Roguelike
Angband plays this perfectly straight .
By the time you win the game , you will have millions of gold pieces , which weigh nothing .
Stranger yet , you can't drop it in your home or anywhere else , even though there are Bandit Mooks which can steal money from you .
Elona also plays this straight .

Role Playing Game
The Elder Scrolls : Played straight in every main series game except for Daggerfall ( see below ) .
Septims , the series ' standard currency of fairly large gold coins , do not have weight .
With all of the Money for Nothing typically available as you progress through the games , players frequently end up carrying around hundreds of thousands or even millions of gold coins with no penalty .
In Morrowind , the developers only made discrete models for dropped gold up to 500 coins .
This means that a pile of 500 coins is identical to a pile of 500,000 coins .
Oblivion and Skyrim replace stacks of dropped coins with brown coin pouches , but a pouch will look the same whether it contains 10 coins or 10,000 .
Fallout and Fallout 2 .
In the first one , the currency was Bottle - caps .
In the second , there are actually ' coins ' , represented as physical bits of metal .
In both , everything else in your inventory has a measured weight , and your carrying - capacity is limited .
In both , your money is entirely weightless .
Not everything has a weight ; there are plenty of items , such as stimpaks , rad-away , beer bottles and buffout drugs that have a zero weight .
Which means that at the end of the game , if you have some basic economic acumen , you 'll be carrying hundreds of syringe - like stimpaks , dozens of bags of anti-radiation medicine , and maybe a few hundred bottles of beer , all of which take up no weight , and apparently fits neatly in your back pocket or wherever you wear things .
Of course , you can also carry five flamethrowers and a minigun without a single bulge in your clothes , so ...
Fallout 3 stays squarely with its predecessors on this one .
Bottle caps are weightless .
Most health items ( but not food ) are weightless .
Ammo , unlike the originals , is also weightless .
That 's right , a motorcycle helmet weighs 2 pounds , but those 50 mini - nukes in your back pocket ?
Weightless .
Fallout : New Vegas continues the trend , except the ammo will have some weight in Hardcore mode .
However , the updated crafting system leads to some weirdness , like empty syringes having weight , but not the stimpaks you can make from them .
Neverwinter Nights most certainly is n't a subversion .
You have an inventory weight system , sure , but gold is n't part of it .
And likewise Mount & Blade .
Oddly enough , you can store your excess items in chests and these chests do have their own money counters , but there 's no way to actually transfer the money into them ...
Baldur 's Gate : Gold is weightless , and plentiful .
So plentiful , in fact , that you wonder why assassins risk their lives to kill you for 50gp when all they need to do is walk into a few noblemen 's houses and rifle through their drawers .
Gems and many items of jewellery are useless other than to sell for gold , but they take up inventory spaces .
Thankfully , several merchants sell Bags of Holding specifically designed to hold said jewellery .
Wizardry .
Gold is fantastically plentiful .
And there 's not a whole lot of places to spend it at .
In the Mario & Luigi series , you can pretty much carry as much money as you can find , despite not even having a wallet to put it in .
To the point where in Mario & Luigi : Dream Team , the money cap is somewhere in the millions and expensive items can cost a few thousand coins each .
It even works to power up certain weapons !
Aversions , etcetera
Action Adventure
The various The Legend of Zelda games have an upper limit as to how many rupees you can carry at any given time .
In later games , you can acquire larger wallets with a greater capacity as you go along and are required to purchase items that cost more than the initial wallet limit .
Also in , Twilight Princess , opening a treasure chest containing a rupee when your wallet is full will cause Link to put it back , which keeps you from wasting money but can be frustrating for completionists .
In Star Fox Adventures , at first Fox can only carry up to 10 Scarabs ( the only wallet he has is that of his own clothes ) , but after helping a character in SnowHorn Wastes he receives a Scarab Bag that allows him to store up to 50 .
As the game progresses , he 'll get subsequent larger wallets to carry up to 100 , and then to 200 .
In Ōkami , the money purse is one of the attributes you can upgrade as you gather enough Praise points from the characters you help , as well as the plants and animals you make happy .
Each upgrade increases the current cap by one digit , thus going from 99999 to 99999999 ( four upgrades ) .
The Guardian Legend has Red Landers .
In Hype : The Time Quest , not only can Hype have a wallet upgrade by completing Wellet 's race during the Second Era , he can also upgrade the maximum amounds of each good he can carry once through the game , usually by completing a race or getting rids of all the bees plaguing either Torras or the forest .
In Tomb Raider ( 2013 ) , the closest thing to money is salvage , which there is no limit for .
In the sequels , salvage is divided into sub-categories , each of which has an ( upgradeable ) upper carrying capacity , plus actual money is introduced into the system .
There is no upper limit to the amount of gold Lara can carry , but in Rise of the Tomb Raider a practical upper limit is introduced by the fact that there 's only a finite amount of gold ( sufficient to buy everything at the game 's sole store ) to be obtained in the first place .
This goes away in Shadow of the Tomb Raider .
First Person Shooter
BioShock limits how much money you can carry to $ 500 ( despite the four - digit money counter ; presumably a leftover from an earlier version ) .
In BioShock 2 , the limit rises to $ 600 , and can be further upgraded to $ 800 .
Played straight in Bioshock Infinite .
Far Cry 3 and Far Cry 4 both have limited wallet space , which must be upgraded by skinning animals and crafting bigger wallets out of them .
Hack And Slash
In the original Diablo , 5000 gold coins would take up an inventory slot , which led to a glitch where you can't buy the best armor in the game because you can't hold enough money .
An item added in the expansion to the game doubled your gold capacity .
All subsequent versions eliminated this , although Diablo II still caps the amount you can carry .
MMORPG
Averted in Mabinogi , where money takes up inventory space but can be collected in money bags that take up less space .
These bags can only hold a certain amount , meaning you can end up with quite a few bags in your inventory .
The one blessing is that you can buy a bag that holds an infinite amount , and money is fairly hard to come by .
Plus , for high - value transactions , you can pay NPC vendors directly from your bank account , and withdraw gold as cheques for trading with other players .
There seems to no longer ( as of 2013 ) be an infinite - storage bag for gold , presumably because gold coins are now usable as a form of ammunition .
The secondary currency introduced around the time this became possible is either weightless or given to you in pouches which disappear when used , though as you can only gain ducats through trade with NPCs who have banking connections ( they 're not looted or stolen , and are untradeable between players ) it 's possible they have no representation beyond letters of credit or somesuch .
EverQuest money has weight ; for this reason , a lot of transactions took place near banks because the amounts of money needed for some trades would weigh you down so much that you could n't move .
The banks will also exchange your lower - valued coins for more valuable ones .
MUDs
Averted in BatMUD , where every coin weighs exactly one gram .
There are a whopping 11 different types of coins , with the most worthless having the relative value of 0.01 gold coins , and the most expensive having the relative value of 500 gold coins .
That means , if you are carrying money worth 80000 gold coins , it can weigh anything from just 0.16 kilograms ( a small pile of mithril coins ) to eight metric tons ( 8000 kg , a COLOSSAL mountain of mowgles coins , an amount which probably no character in the game can carry ) .
If you deposit it all into a bank and then withdraw it , you get 80000 gold coins ( 80 kg ) regardless of what kind of coins you deposited .
Shopkeepers also accept all types of coins , and generally pay in gold coins .
As a peculiar quirk , if you are only carrying highcoins , and you get robbed by a thief , who robs a random sum measured in gold , the thief will sometimes pay you small coins in exchange .
Played with in a variety of MUDs .
Some games have multiple coins with varying weights for them , others have weightless money .
Averted more often in Fantasy settings than Science Fiction settings .
Roguelike
Ancient Domains of Mystery : 1000 gold pieces weigh 1 stone ( Which conveniently is 50 grams or about 0.11 pounds instead of the usual 14 pounds or about 6.3 kilograms ) .
Your inventory can hold unlimited items , but if you collect enough gold ( or anything else ) , eventually its weight will start to become a problem .
Nethack has gold Zorkmids as currency , which do have weight ; 45000 zm weighs as much as a suit of plate mail .
Players looking to boost their endgame score by accumulating wealth are advised to convert the gold into gemstones ( 100 zm weighs as much as one gem , and even the least valuable gem is worth 200 zm ) to avoid getting so weighed down they can't climb the stairs .
In Scarab of Ra , the gold you collect while exploring the pyramid does slow you down ... but wherever you see the words " Bank of RA " written on a wall , you can magically deposit it into your outside - world bank account .
The net effect on realism is actually negative .
Role Playing Game
Simulation Game
Dwarf Fortress :
If you made coins back when the fortress economy was still a thing , then your dwarves would spend a huge amount of time walking to the coin stockpile to pick up their pay , carrying it , taking it home , and then going home to get some when they want to buy food or whatever .
Just not making any coins at all ( or making them and locking them away in an inaccessible vault deep in the fortress somewhere ) meant they apparently just calculated everything from memory instead .
This and many other annoyances is why the whole mechanic was Dummied Out pending a complete rework .
Tabletop Games
GURPS gives a weight for coins , albeit it advises the GM to gloss over it .
Also notable in that the Dungeon Fantasy points out that a good challenge for the players would be how to handle the logistics of transporting the loot they find .
The One Ring : Each point of Treasure is worth one point of Encumbrance , so adventurers will quickly amass more than they can physically carry and need to find a safe place to deposit it .
Mixed
MMORPG
Dungeons & Dragons Online , coins are weightless .
Despite this , different denominations ( platinum , gold , silver , copper ) are tracked independently , although the latter three are rarely found in significant quantity , and are automatically spent first with vendors before using platinum .
Western RPG
In TaskMaker , you can only hold up to 41 items in your pouch , including forms of money .
However , you can deposit the money into an Auto Teller , and your balance will always be available whenever you enter a shop .
If you die , any un-deposited currency will get lost to thieves .
Roguelike
Averted in Castle of the Winds where cash has weight and does n't automatically convert .
Played straight in that it has no volume .
And played straighter yet justified when you hit town and just dump the stuff at the bank in favour of a letter of credit .
Simulation Game
Partial aversion in the Animal Crossing series .
Your wallet can carry a very healthy amount of money , as in 99,999 bells .
However , it starts taking space in your inventory after you hit the cutoff point : 30,000 bells per slot in the GameCube game or 99,000 bells per slot in the DS and Wii games .
Very few things cost tens of thousands of bells or more , and in the Wii game , most of those can be bought with a debit card that accesses the player 's bank deposit .
In Dwarf Fortress Adventurer Mode , stacks of coins have weight based on quantity , rounded to the nearest Urist .
Many stacks of double - digits or more will have weight appreciably increasing with the success of the adventurer .
But the same coin could be have 0 encumbrance , if they 're sorted into blindingly spammy single - digit stacks .
Tabletop Games
Dungeons & Dragons : Depending on the edition ( and the Dungeon Master , as always ) D&D either plays this completely straight or does not , by core rules , support it .
By standard , 50 coins weigh a pound .
This is regardless whether it 's copper , silver , gold , platinum or steel , and whether it 's freshly minted , taken from an ancient hoard , or received through wishing magic .
At a certain point many players wo n't bother with cheap copper ( unless they have quick access to money exchangers or are just that greedy ) .
Gems and artwork treasures have a full selling price , so they can work pretty well as a money alternative .
Sometimes you may even hold on to particulary expensive weapons and armor simply because they weigh less than the money you 'd get for them .
( Which makes a certain sense , as the merchant who'd want to buy a + 5 lance is also the person who'd be likely to sell the stuff you want to buy . )
Older editions , in which the logistics of getting one 's loot out of the dungeon were very much intended to be part of the challenge ( even if the actual rules did n't always communicate this intent clearly ) and experience points were awarded for the actual gold piece value of the treasure thus retrieved , could go as far as having 10 coins regardless of type weigh a pound .
Bags of holding , portable holes , and similar means of carrying more stuff without being weighed down by it were highly sought after for just this reason .

We celebrate 20 years of the iconic Sheffield label with co-founder Steve Beckett , recent signing Hudson Mohawke and music from Aphex Twin , LFO and Boards of Canada
Brrnpp !
Whhzz !
Skrree !
That , dear friends , is the new sound of Music Weekly , as we celebrate 20 years of the magnificent Warp Records .
From landmark techno records to avant - garde bleep symphonies , the weird noises of Warp have had a huge impact on popular music and provided us with artists such as Autechre , Boards of Canada , Battles and Grizzly Bear .
First up , Rosie Swash speaks to founder Steve Beckett to discover how an indie record shop transformed itself into the world 's best electronica label .
Steve recalls working with Vincent Gallo , branching out into films and why Warp has always attracted a rather freaky sort of artist .
We then stamp a strict Warp - only rule on to this week 's Singles Club .
Luke Bainbridge joins Paul MacInnes and Tim Jonze to look back on classic tracks by LFO , Aphex Twin and Boards of Canada .
Between them , they try to pinpoint the label 's magic , but end up comparing music to plants .
That 's what listening to Warp does to your brain .
Finally , Paul chats to Warp 's latest sonic whizz , Hudson Mohawke , to discuss whether a wonky diet of glitchy beats , hip - hop and spliced samples could be the sound of young Scotland .
He reveals how he was the UK 's youngest DMC finalist , how he began mixing at the tender age of eight and why his ultimate ambition is to write a classic pop tune .
With brains suitably fried , we leave you for another week .
Let us know what you thought of the show in the comment section below and feel free to befriend us on Facebook .
Until next time ...
A Palm Bay woman and her boyfriend were arrested Monday for child abuse after the couple went old school to punish their 8 - year - old daughter for swearing .
They washed her mouth out with soap .
We do n't know about you , but we would petition President Obama and Congress to make it mandatory for every parent to carry a bar of Irish Spring in their back pockets with all the profanity kids use today .
Police claim Adriyanna Herdener and Wilfredo Rivera went too far by placing a bar of soap in the girl 's mouth and letting it stay for 10 minutes .
Herdener did not intervene in the discipline .
The girl eventually vomited and Rivera took her to the local hospital , where hospital staff called police .
No one wants a child to be hurt or inhumanely punished , but parents ' discipline choices in this country have come down to calling Dr. Phil or hiding the joysticks to the Wii .
Next time your kid has a potty mouth , just give them some gum .
Facebook Lite is a new streamlined version designed for people with slow internet connections .
There 's no chat and no applications .
It 's designed to give users quick access to their News Feed , inbox and events .
Oddly though , it still includes a " post video " button -- who would do that on such a slow connection ?
I often can't do that with broadband .
Brands with Facebook Pages get short - changed here .
You can't find Pages in the search results on Lite , even if you 're already a fan ; only people show up .
There are no engagement ads -- just minimalist self - service ads with text , thumbnails , and a link .
Updates from Pages do n't appear in your Lite inbox .
Branded Pages ' status updates still appear in the News Feed , and you can click that to go to the Page , but there 's just the stripped down
Wall rather than all the tabs ( there 's still a link to the Page 's photos and videos ) .
It 's yet another reminder for Page owners that to stay top of mind with consumers , it 's important to post updates regularly .
Developing an editorial calendar can help achieve that goal .
Facebook
Lite could be bad news for brands if consumers adopt it en masse , but that 's not likely for two reasons .
First , the percentage of home internet users with broadband access is reportedly well over 90 % .
The sound of modems dialing up is quickly being relegated to those " when I was a kid ... " stories , like the one my dad tells about walking to school 20 miles in the snow being chased by German shepherds .
Stories of 1,200 baud modems sound even less believable .
Second , most Facebook users who try Lite will wind up missing some of the full functionality , whether it 's instant messaging or applications or the easier way links appear when including them in status updates .
There will be people out there like Mashable 's Stan Schroeder who talk about how they prefer Lite , but I 'll wager he 's well in the minority , and even most of the Stans out there will wind up defaulting to the original .
Even some dial - up users will probably choose the original rather than give up features like IM .
Brands should keep an eye on this though .
One way is to check Quantcast 's Lite traffic report ( non-existent so far ) and other sources to see if it gains momentum .
The safer bet is that it will keep a small percentage of consumers loyal and addicted to Facebook without changing the habits of anyone else .

VATICAN CITY , September 18 , 2009 ( LifeSiteNews.com ) -
A prominent Vatican official recently stepped into the US health - care debate , offering words of praise for President Barack Obama 's health - care reforms that seem to suggest that responsibility for an individual 's " health " belongs to the " central government . "
But that point is at loggerheads with the arguments of a handful of US bishops who have spoken up on the same subject .
These bishops have suggested that state - run health care violates a Church principle called " subsidiarity . "
" The health of their own citizens belongs to the authorities , to the central government , " Cardinal Renato Martino told a Catholic News Service reporter after a Vatican press conference .
Martino , a high - profile official within the Roman Curia , is the head of the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace .
He served in the United States as the Vatican 's permanent observer to the United Nations from 1986 - 2002 .
During his 16 years in America , he told the reporter , " I was wondering why a big portion of the American people is deprived , have no health assistance at all .
I could never explain this . "
Between 10 - 15 percent of Americans do not have health - insurance in the United States , although all have access by law to emergency room health - care .
CNSNews.com reports that the Census Bureau puts the number of uninsured Americans at 35.92 million , although 9.1 million persons making over $ 75,000 per year voluntarily forgo insurance .
The Census Bureau 's numbers are lower than President Obama 's estimate of 47 million , because it does not include immigrants residing illegally within the US .
The Vatican Cardinal opined that " everywhere in the world [ health - care ] is a concern of the government first of all , and after there are possibilities also on the private sector , but those who are without anything … the central government must provide to that . "
" So I can not but applaud this initiative , " Martino concluded .
However , a number of American bishops are not applauding the Obama Administration initiative - saying that investing the central government with responsibility and ownership of an individual 's health - care violates Catholic social teaching and poses grave risk to the dignity and rights of the individual .
" There is a danger in being persuaded to think that the national government is the sole instrument of the common good , " Bishop Samuel J. Aquila of Fargo told his flock .
" Rather , according to the classic principle of subsidiarity in Catholic social thought , many different communities within society share this responsibility , " communities which acting together , he said , " build up a strong and cohesive social fabric that is the hallmark of a true communion of persons . "
Aquila continued , " States , towns , fraternal organizations , businesses , cooperatives , parishes and especially the family have not only legitimate freedom to provide the goods they are rightly capable of supplying , but often times do so with far greater efficiency , less bureaucracy and , most importantly , with personalized care and love . "
Bishop R. Walter Nickless of the Diocese of Sioux City has emphasized that the Church " does not teach that government should directly provide health care , " and argued that making health care " subject to federal monopolization " was a prudentially poor decision .
" While a government monopoly would not be motivated by profit , " he opined , " it would be motivated by such bureaucratic standards as quotas and defined ' best procedures , ' which are equally beyond the influence of most citizens . "
Bishop Doran of Rockford Illinois has also warned that Obama 's overhaul does little to give real health - care to patients , but instead simply expands government control of the private sector and violate Catholic principles of subsidiarity , solidarity , and interest in the common good - all indispensable elements to positive health care reform .
" Our federal bureaucracy is a vast wasteland strewn with the carcasses of absurd federal programs which proved infinitely worse than the problems they were established to correct , " wrote Doran .
" Modern socialist governments like to control not food but the means to protect and extend life , " continued Doran , adding , " we as Catholics should take care that health care does not morph into life control . "
The Kansas Bishops also made very clear that the principle of subsidiarity also guaranteed that the individual owns his own health , and that the communities closest to him in society , not the central government , are best equipped to give him the health - care he needs .
Referring to the health care legislation advocated by President Obama , Kansas City Archbishop Joseph F. Naumann and Kansas City - St. Joseph Bishop Robert W. Finn noted , " Many of the proposals which have been promoted would diminish the protection of human life and dignity and shift our health care costs and delivery to a centralized government bureaucracy . "
Neglecting the principle of subsidiarity in health - care reform " can lead to an excessive centralization of human services , which in turn leads to excessive costs , and loss of personal responsibility and quality of care . "
The Bishop of Cape - Girardeau and Springfield , Missouri has also stated that he cannot support President Obama 's health - care reforms as they stand , because of the dangers the reforms pose , not only to life , but especially to subsidiarity , " the principle of social dignity . "
Bishop James Vann Johnston quoted the Catholic Catechism to emphasize that subsidiarity is " opposed to all forms of collectivism " and " sets limits for state intervention . "
He explained , however , that " the higher order " of central government does have a role in health - care reform ; but it must only play a very limited and supporting role , not a dominant one , so as not to run the risk of crushing all the other necessary functions and expressions of society and trampling on the individual .
" Government may also be needed to see that no one , especially the working poor and the most destitute and forgotten , falls through the cracks , " wrote Johnston .
" But , the essential element of the principle of subsidiarity is the protection of individual freedoms from unjust micromanagement and manipulation by the state . "

Maybe I 'm just dense , but I can't for the life of me figure out what advantages this provides .
I definitely can't see why it would curb the demand for wireless access points , as the article states , unless the idea is that wi-fi NICs in hard - wired PCs will take their place , which ignores all the additional benefits of the AP / router model .
What advantage do I gain by being able to use my television as an access point that can't be gained by just connecting it and every other device that wants to talk to it to a single wi-fi network ?
Not to mention the security nightmare of people walking around with phones that are constantly broadcasting as an access point .
We have a big enough problem with people not securing the wireless access points they already have .
I guess it could replace Bluetooth as the way kids beam ringtones back and forth to each other , but beyond simplifying the ad - hoc connection methods that already exist , I just do n't get it .
“ But here ’s the most interesting question about today ’s Olympic vote :
Why did n’t Obama see this coming ?
He spends all this time , gets all this press , uses all this political capital to promote Chicago , and then loses ?
What an amateur .
Prosecutors do n’t ask witnesses questions in court unless they ’re sure of the answers .
Presidents do n’t stake their personal reputations on contests whose outcomes are uncertain .
Very foolish move .
No wonder he ca n’t get health care passed . ” – Tucker Carlson , The Washington Post
I wrote earlier in the week that I suspected he would n’t be taking this trip if it was n’t already a done deal .
Nope !
He was going in to dazzle .
He was risking his political capital and the prestige of the presidency , as this story puts it , because how could he fail ?
He ’s The One .
Throw in Michelle babbling about the “ sacrifice ” of a transatlantic flight attended by dozens of minions on one of the most luxurious airliners in the world ( I hope to God she had organic kale ) , and how children ’s athletic program funding drying up means kids ca n’t learn to ride bikes anymore ( huh ? ) , and clearly , the IOC heard enough .
It just was n’t the “ enough ” the Obamas thought it was .
Hey , want to talk timing ?
They ’re shilling for the Games while those horrible mob murder videos from Chicago are circulating .
Can you say “ tin ear ” ?
Sorry if the below is a repeat for you , but it ’s good .
Here are the Top 10 reasons and excuses Chicago did n’t get the Olympics :
10 . Dead people ca n’t vote at IOC meetings .
9 . Obama was distracted by his 25 - minute meeting with General McChrystal .
8 . “ That I could n’t talk the Olympics into Chicago does n’t mean I ca n’t talk Iran out of nukes . ”
7 . “ The impediment is that Israel is still building settlements . ”
6 . “ Obviously no president would have been able to accomplish this . ”
5 . “ We ’ve been quite clear and said all along that we did n’t want the Olympics . ”
4 . “ This is n’t about the number of Olympics ‘ lost ’ ; it ’s about the number of Olympics ‘ saved ’ or ‘ created . ' ”
3 . Clearly , there were n’t enough wise Latina judges on the committee .
2 . The IOC is racist .
1 . It ’s Bush ’s fault .
Here ’s one of the first pieces talking about what a victory this is for Obama ( yeah , I ’m serious ) .
Favorite quote :
Certainly one reason the United States got the high hat was the lingering bad taste of George W. Bush .
The global community , after eight years of sneering contempt from Washington , DC , is n’t ready to rinse with the Obama mouthwash .
Few things are as polemically entertaining as a floundering liberal .
I do n’t like the Olympics , and I do n’t like Barack Obama .
I love that he got pasted in Copenhagen .
This failure so effectively embodies the two traits that make Obama a rotten president : breathtaking arrogance and obscene inexperience .
Keep it up , Barry .
Might be time for another address to Congress .

With the home building industry in peril , you would think that legislators would come up with immediate solutions to help foster new home construction .
And there are now two well known Federal programs regarding housing : one is the $ 8,000 tax credit for first time home buyers , and the other is the 30 % energy tax credit for a select few components of home remodeling .
The $ 8,000 credit for first time home buyers is a good idea , and seems to have helped at least a few buyers purchase homes .
Of course , it ' s not clear how many purchased bargains on previously owned homes and how many actually purchased new homes .
The 30 % energy tax credits are a different matter .
I ’m against the current incarnation of the program for a host of reasons :
Problem No. 1 : The 30 % tax credit applies to only a few select items that somehow qualified , and there 's no ( simple ) way to get on the approved list .
In addition , Energy Star certification assures that the “ product ” has gone through some scrutiny on performance and reliability .
But what of the equally important installers ?
Problem No. 2 : New construction gets very limited tax credits .
When retrofitting existing houses , tax credits apply to the installation of efficient windows and insulation .
But new construction ( along with remodels ) is not eligible unless it includes Geothermal , Solar Hot Water , or Solar Electricity .
These benefits are meaningful only to those with enough income to make a credit of this size enticing .
The middle and upper class homeowners who are willing to finance these upgrades hope that the after - tax benefits will make the investment worthwhile .
In theory , of course , the ticky - tacky downtrodden neighborhoods built after World War II can also be upgraded ... to become energy efficient ticky - tacky downtrodden neighborhoods .
But the energy credit will not benefit those that need it the most : those in the lower income strata that find it difficult to survive from pay check to pay check .
A 30 % tax credit does them no good at all .
Even if the tax credit made sense for downtrodden neighborhoods , none of the older homes would ever become nearly as energy efficient as new construction .
As an example , let 's say 50 homes in a low income neighborhood did take advantage of the tax credits and upgraded their windows and insulation , and added geothermal design because that was the only option approved for the benefits .
This would easily add up to well over $ 50,000 per home – at least $ 2,500,000 – of which almost a million dollars is funded by you , the tax payer .
As an alternative , the 50 houses could be leveled , and excess streets abandoned to create a large developable contiguous tract of land .
New home builders on the verge of bankruptcy , and even corporate national builders , could easily reinvent their business to build new urban neighborhoods using more efficient development patterns .
To upgrade a new affordable home with more energy efficient windows would cost $ 2,000 , an inch of foam insulation added to exterior walls would be another $ 2,000 , and a high efficiency heating and cooling design just another $ 2,000 .
This highly efficient new home would use a fraction of the energy of an upgraded old home , and would add only $ 300,000 for all 50 homes .
New neighborhoods could also have a fraction of the environmental impact of older ones , if planned using newer techniques .
Low income families can live in new green neighborhoods , and the home building industry can find a new market while curbing sprawl at the same time ...
Any politicians reading this ?
( see study ) .
Problem No. 3 : The current tax credits promote overkill .
Almost all the recent Green Certified Homes sold in the Minneapolis area had geothermal design as part of their package .
Certainly a home builder increases profits by including a complex geothermal system instead of a simple , highly efficient and low cost conventional heating and cooling system .
Building a new , well insulated home results in a significant reduction of heating and cooling energy needs , and the upgrade to a highly efficient system on a new home costs as little as $ 3,000 extra .
But if the home design is not geothermal it will not get tax credits .
A passive solar designed home gets free heat on sunny days — also not eligible for tax credits — but a $ 50,000 geothermal system is .
Problem No. 4 : The current tax credits are creating a false economy for the very few businesses that manufacture approved items .
Without the tax credits , these suppliers and manufacturers would need to come in at a reasonable price point / payback ratio to generate the volume of sales necessary to be profitable .
In other words , they would have to invent , innovate , and deliver systems that make sense or fail in the marketplace .
As soon as the tax credit ends many will not survive .
An article on energy tax programs of the 1980s and the “ tin men ” that sold under - performing systems shows how 95 % of the manufacturers of that era went out of business when the Carter era tax benefits ended .
What happens to the warranty and guarantees when the company is no longer around ?
So what 's the solution to the problems ?
Either fix the tax credit program , or do away with it .
Make the program flexible enough so that new innovations can be accommodated , and make the system itself easy to access .
This would encourage companies to be competitive , and give hope to start - ups that can not right now get financing .
The current application system favors well - funded , big corporations , and is far too restrictive in its scope .
Have the tax credit apply to window and insulation upgrades above the " standard for code ” , and include all heating and cooling systems that are above the 90 % efficiency typically included in new construction .
Even a tax credit limited to the price difference created by the upgrade would jump start both the green industry and new home construction .
And while we 're jumpstarting ... let 's not forget a little history .
During the dot - com crash earlier this decade , unscrupulous promoters bilked investors out of billions of dollars on false promises .
These promoters did not disappear , they simply moved to the next opportunity : mortgage and real estate .
Quick profits from flipping real estate created an economy that was un-policed and unsustainable .
Let 's not permit energy upgrades supported with a 30 % tax credit to become the next unsustainable wave .

Gardasil , the vaccine used to immunize girls and young women against the sexually transmitted virus that causes cervical cancer , may now be given to boys and young men to protect them from genital warts , a federal advisory group recommended Wednesday .
But the panel of independent medical experts stopped short of urging its routine use in boys , as it has recommended for girls .
And members questioned whether vaccinating boys was a cost - effective way to protect their future sexual partners against cervical and other types of cancer caused by human papillomavirus , or HPV .
Gardasil , made by Merck , works against four strains of the virus  two strains that are responsible for 70 percent of cervical cancers and two strains responsible for about 90 percent of genital warts .
But it is expensive , requiring a series of three injections that cost $ 130 each .
The vaccine was approved last week by the Food and Drug Administration for use in boys and men ages 9 to 26 .
Wednesday ’s action , by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , is intended to guide national policy on use of the vaccine ; its recommendations are typically adopted by professional medical associations and set the standards of practice for physicians .
Andrew F comments on another thread that there are more important things to debate than “ other people ’s sexual choices and society ’s efforts to tolerate those choices ” and suggests I am becoming “ a very sick person ” .
Firstly , there are many important things to debate .
Andrew is still to this day , I believe , a New Labour supporter .
They spent a vast amount of parliamentary time and effort trying to ban hunting foxes with dogs at the expense of far more important things .
Secondly , should we be concerned about what other people do in their bedrooms ?
Forty years ago , homosexual behaviour was legalised between two adults over twenty - one .
In their own bedroom .
Here we are now with the behaviour having left the bedroom and now being promoted to schoolchildren as normal .
The age of consent has been reduced to sixteen for ‘ equality ’ purposes , in effect legalising pederasty .
Some adoption agencies have closed because they refused to consider homosexual couples as suitable foster parents .
So , yes , what goes on ‘ in the bedroom ’ has a wider impact .
One major problem caused by recognising homosexual behaviour as normal is the knock - on effect of devaluing family life .
Families are the basic building block of society .
Weaken these and you build a weak society .
Treat all ‘ relationships ’ the same as marriage and society will begin to collapse .
Following the attack by two Doncaster children on two of their peers , Iain Duncan Smith has warned against dismissing the episode with the usual calls for an inquiry and a tighter system , which he said would fail to tackle the root problem .
The Christian Institute reports on The Independent ’s Bruce Anderson comparing the circumstances of the Doncaster boys with those of 17 - month - old Baby Peter , who died at the hands of his mother and her live - in boyfriend .
We have allowed an underclass to come into being ” based on “ seven deadly sins ” .
First , the collapse of the family .
Second , the collapse of fatherhood ; Dad ’s sole role is impregnation .
Third , the collapse of all inhibitions about producing children .
Fourth , the collapse of the work ethic .
Fifth , crime .
Sixth , drugs .
Seventh , and underpinning the lot , promiscuous welfare .
The PC nonsense again manifests itself in other ways
Last month a social policy expert warned that the child protection system is ignoring background risk factors such as broken families because it fears stigmatising children .
Jill Kirby , Director of the Centre for Policy Studies , also referred to the case of Baby Peter .
His circumstances were “ typical of the average ‘ at risk ’ child ” , she said , listing other common “ background factors ” including “ having a mother who was a teenage lone parent , the presence of an unrelated male in the household , a history of domestic violence , a parent with a criminal record or a history of mental illness and substance abuse ” .
So what is the answer ?
It ’s easy : promote marriage between a man and a woman and consider all other ‘ lifestyles ’ to be of lesser value .
Ditch the blasted PC agenda once and for all and start teaching children the truth .
See through the fake charities like Stonewall and stop them using their ‘ bullying ’ campaign to get access to schools to recruit by process of normalising homosexual behaviour .

Have you ever been bitten by accidentally loading multiple instances of the same application in GNOME ?
When you click on the launcher of an already - running application in GNOME , it will load up another instance of the same application , instead of switching to the already running one .
This can lead to bugs and other unforeseen behaviour , which of course is n’t desirable .
In GNOME 3 , this issue has been resolved .
In a lot of cases , this behaviour is rather harmless .
If you launch two instances of Calculator , you ’ll end up with two gcalctool processes , but this wo n’t cause much damage or problems .
However , if you try this with more complex applications , you may run into problems ; for instance , they may overwrite each other ’s data or configuration files .
Or , if you launch XChat twice , you end up being logged in twice .
The GNOME 3 Shell will be application - based instead of task window - based .
Consider the Calculator example : currently , launching Calculator twice will leave you with two entries in the task list – an entry for each window .
In an application - based environment ( for example , Mac OS X ) , you would have only one entry for both instances of the application .
Since GNOME 3
Shell will be application - based , this is exactly what will happen .
An important aspect of the GNOME 3 Shell is that the “ window list ” and “ menu ” are combined into one ( similar to the new taskbar in Windows 7 , or the Dock in Mac OS X ) .
The distinction between “ running ” and “ not running ” is no longer the focal point ; if you click a launcher , and the application is not running , it will be loaded for you .
If you click the launcher of an already running application , you ’ll be switched to it .
But what if I want to load multiple instances of the same application ?
Applications for which this would make sense can implement a “ New window ” option , and this new window could then be run in the same process , or in a new one .
As minute as this change may seem , it is a very big shift for GNOME .
I personally thoroughly dislike the current behaviour , but I do know that many GNOME users prefer things the way they are , and they see true benefit in having launchers open new instances instead of switching to already running ones .
What are your thoughts on this ?
Which concept do you prefer , application - based or task - based ?
Special report Until the 16th century , educated opinion , as codified by Ptolemy , held that the Earth is at the centre of the universe .
Then along came Copernicus .
On 29 June 2009 , the Identity & Passport Service ( IPS ) published their latest paper on the National Identity Service ( NIS ) .
According to Safeguarding Identity ( pdf ) , " the vision for the NIS is that it will become an essential part of everyday life , underpinning interactions and transactions between individuals , public services and businesses and supporting people to protect their identity " ( para.3.32 ) .
Early adopter
Placing the NIS at the centre of social interaction like this makes IPS about 92 million miles wide of the mark .
How is the NIS supposed to achieve IPS 's vainglorious objective ?
“ Our intention is that , at the core of the information used to prove identity will be biometrics , such as photographs and fingerprints ” ( para.3.6 ) .
It follows that , in the eyes of IPS , the NIS stands or falls on the reliability of the biometrics chosen .
If they do n’t work , the NIS ca n’t work .
When he was Home Secretary , David Blunkett told us that biometrics " will make identity theft and multiple identity impossible .
Not nearly impossible .
Impossible " .
That is the commonly held view .
It may be the commonly held view , but is it correct ?
Ask the Home Office 's scientists
Not everyone agrees .
Dr Tony Mansfield and Mr Marek Rejman - Greene , for example , opened their February 2003 report to the Home Office by saying the exact opposite : “ Biometric methods do not offer 100 % certainty of authentication of individuals ” ( para .4 ) .
Tony Mansfield specialises in biometric device testing at the National Physical Laboratory and Marek Rejman - Greene is the Senior Biometrics Advisor at the Home Office Scientific Development Branch ( HOSDB ) .
Who is right ?
Those two individuals ?
Or David Blunkett and all the politicians and civil servants and journalists in the UK and abroad who agree with him ?
For Copernicans , the answer depends on the evidence .
There follows a review of the biometrics evidence that has come to light over the past six years .
Tony Mansfield and Marek Rejman - Greene ’s report makes the distinction between two different jobs for biometrics – identification ( section 2.1 ) and verification ( section 2.2 ) .
Identification is the job of proving that each person has one and only one entry on the population register .
Professor John Daugman , the father of biometrics based on the iris , demonstrates easily that that job is not feasible for large populations .
Crafting a final version of health insurance legislation to attract moderate Republican support would be a " waste of time , " according to the leader of the House Progressive Caucus .
Rep. Raul Grijalva ( D - Ariz . ) said on Wednesday that removing controversial provisions from the legislation , such as the public health insurance option , would weaken the bill and would sink the chances of the bill getting out of the House .
" Obviously it worries many of us a great deal , " he said on ABC's " Top Line " this afternoon .
" It is a waste of time for the White House and for leadership to cater to one vote . "
Grijalva said Republican support wo n't amount to much .
" In the end of the day , there is going to be more unanimity on the Republican side in the Senate
in opposition to the bill , " he said .
Yesterday , Sen. Olympia Snowe ( R - Maine ) helped vote the Senate Finance Committee 's version of healthcare reform , which did not include a government - run healthcare plan .
Snowe did not guarantee her vote for the final bill when speaking before the committee yesterday , causing some to suggest that Democratic leaders may remove controversial measures to attract her support down the line .
Centrist Sen. Susan Collins ( R - Maine ) said today she may also support a final bill .
The congressman reiterated that he would not vote for a final bill if the conference committee removes the public option from it .
" Without a robust public option , the bill can not get out of the House of Representatives , " he added .
If you think those town hall meetings over health care were fierce , wait until Americans come to understand the threat to our national financial survival posed by the interest on the government 's credit card .
When the government spends more than its revenue , there is a budget deficit .
These deficits are paid for by Washington selling interest bearing Treasury securities .
If the government were ever to default on its promise to pay periodic interest payments or to repay the debt at maturity , the United ...
LONDON , England ( CNN ) --
New data released Thursday suggests that the Arctic Ocean will be " largely ice free " during summer within a decade .
As the Arctic sea ice melts , polar bears face extinction .

The report , complied by the UK - based Catlin Arctic Survey and the World Wildlife Fund ( WWF ) , is the latest research into ice thickness in the Arctic .
Researchers predict that within 20 years ice cover will be completely gone during the warmer months .
The expedition , which was completed in May , was led by UK explorer Pen Hadow .
He and his team collected data by manually drilling into the ice and noting its thickness along a 450 - kilometer route across the northern part of the Beaufort Sea .
They found that the area surveyed was comprised almost exclusively of first year ice .
Scientists think this is significant because traditionally the region has been made up of much older , thicker ice .
" Discovering this area of younger ice provides another body of information that supports the rapidly emerging scientific consensus that it 's going to be nearer 10 years from now that we will see roughly 80 - 85 percent free waters in the Arctic Ocean , " Hadow told CNN .
Measurements taken by Hadow and his team report that the ice - floes were on average 1.8 meters thick -- which , according to scientists , is too thin to survive next summer 's ice melt .
Professor Peter Wadhams , head of the Polar Ocean Physics Group at the UK's University of Cambridge said : " With a large part of the region now first year ice , it is clearly more vulnerable .
The area is now more likely to become open water each summer , bringing forward the potential date when the summer sea ice will be completely gone . "
Professor Wadhams , who has analyzed the expedition data , added : " The Catlin Arctic Survey data supports the new consensus view that the Arctic will be ice - free in summer within about 20 years , and much of that decrease will be happening within 10 years . "

Martin Sommerkorn from the WWF International Arctic Program believes that the changes in sea-ice cover in the region are likely to increase global temperatures further .
" Such a loss of Arctic sea ice has recently been assessed to set in motion powerful climate feedbacks which will have an impact far beyond the Arctic itself , " Sommerkorn said .
" Arctic sea ice holds a central position in our Earth 's climate system .
Take it out of the equation and we are left with a dramatically warmer world , " he added .
Hadow fears that the current climate models developed by scientists may not be extreme enough .
But he is hopeful that this new data will spur world leaders into action .
" We are now in a loss period , " Hadow told CNN .
" Maybe losing this sea ice , this roof on the top of our planet in going to be an important moment , a big visual aid to the science that in combination can bring about some sort of global agreement on emissions . "
Scientists who returned to the Bay Area this week after an expedition to the “ Great Pacific Garbage Patch ” brought piles of plastic debris they pulled out of the ocean — soda bottles , cracked patio chairs , Styrofoam chunks , old toys , discarded fishing floats and tangled nets .
But what alarmed them most , they said Tuesday , was the nearly inconceivable amount of tiny , confettilike pieces of broken plastic .
They took hundreds of water samples between the Farallon Islands near San Francisco and the notorious garbage patch 1,000 miles west of California , and every one had tiny bits of plastic floating in it .
And the closer they sailed to the garbage patch , which some researchers have estimated to be twice the size of Texas , the more plastic pieces per gallon they found .
“ Marine debris is the new man -made epidemic .
It ’s that serious , ” said Andrea Neal , principal investigator on the Kaisei , a 151 - foot research ship on the trip .
Neal , a Santa Barbara researcher who has a doctorate in molecular genetics and biochemistry , said crews on the three - week voyage discovered tiny jellyfish eating bits of the plastic debris .
The jellyfish are , in turn , eaten by fish like salmon or tuna , which people eat .
Because the plastic pieces contain toxic chemicals — and are believed to be able to absorb now - banned chemicals such as DDT and PCBs , which can persist in the environment for decades — state toxicologists have taken hundreds of the objects , along with more than 300 fish , to an environmental chemistry lab in Berkeley to see if any chemicals are moving up the food chain .
“ Every day , every night , we ’d pull up samples and pour the water through a sieve .
It would be completely clogged with tiny pieces of plastic , ” said Margy Gassel , a research scientist with the California Environmental Protection Agency .
“ It was so disturbing . ”
The research was the most extensive look yet at the garbage patch , a collection of mostly plastic debris located 1,000 miles north of Hawaii .
The bobbing debris field , where currents swirl everything from discarded fishing line to plastic bottles into one soupy mess , was discovered in the mid-1990s .
Not much is known about it , including when it began forming or even its exact boundaries .
It can not be seen from the air or from satellites because most of the plastic has broken down into billions of tiny , confettilike pieces that float just below the surface .
Scientists believe the trash washes down storm drains and rivers from places such as the Bay Area or Japan , eventually drifting into several large ocean vortices where currents swirl together .
Two ships embarked a month ago to study the site .
The New Horizon , a 170 - foot vessel , was sent by the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California - San Diego .
The Kaisei — whose name means “ ocean planet ” in Japanese — left from Richmond .
It was sent by Ocean Voyages Institute , a Sausalito nonprofit that privately raised $ 500,000 for the voyage .
Both ships met at sea , collected water samples and took thousands of readings and photographs .
Their goal : to study the patch ’s size , how the plastic affects wildlife and whether it may be possible to one day clean up some of it .
Doug Woodring , a former Merrill Lynch financier and one of the founders of Project Kaisei , said Tuesday at a San Francisco news conference that one solution to the problem might be to dramatically increase the use of plant - based , biodegradable plastic and to beef up plastics - recycling programs .
Designing storm drains to catch plastic debris also is a possibility , he said .
“ We ’re not talking about a plastic - bag tax , ” he said .
“ We need to move the needle beyond that . ”
The garbage patch is emerging as a major international environmental concern .
Not only do its plastics pose a potential chemical threat , but birds , sea turtles and other marine life die when they eat or become entangled in floating plastic .
Invasive species such as crabs , barnacles and other marine life also can attach themselves to it and float across the globe .
In the central Pacific , there are up to six pounds of marine litter for every pound of plankton , according to a 2006 report from the United Nations Environment Programme .
And roughly 46,000 pieces of plastic litter are floating on every square mile of the oceans there , the report found .
John Chen , a spokesman for the Bureau of International Recycling , an industry group that contributed to the trip ’s costs , cited fees placed on bottles and new computers under California laws that help cover recycling costs .
He said such fees may be a model for recycling all plastic products .
Research papers from the expedition will not be published for several months .
But Mary Crowley , a Sausalito resident who owns a yacht chartering company , Ocean Voyages , and who cofounded Project Kaisei , said time is of the essence .
“ The floating pieces of plastic — large and small — are like a spreading cancer on the ocean , ” she said .
“ It ’s impossible for me to think of what the ocean might be like in another 30 years if we do n’t change . ”

BBC News , Adigene glacier
Geologist Bakutbek Ermenbaev points up through the pine trees at the glacier above us in Kyrgyzstan 's Alatau mountains .
" That one - called Adigene - has decreased in size by about 20 % over the last 50 years , " he says .
He adds that a neighbouring glacier , Aksai , has disappeared completely .
Mr Ermenbaev , who works for the government 's hydrogeology agency , says global warming is to blame .
And he warns that unless action is taken to reduce this warming , all of Kyrgyzstan 's 2,200 glaciers could have melted within a century .
The Kyrgyz glaciers and those in neighbouring Tajikistan are vital to the water supply of Central Asia .
" In normal circumstances the glaciers would melt in the summer season , but regain their size in the winter , " Mr Ermenbaev says .
But he adds that on average the glaciers are now decreasing in size by 15 - 20 m ( 50 - 65 ft ) annually .
One glacier , Petrova , is retreating by 50 m a year .
Overflowing lakes
The hydrogeology agency has been monitoring the melting of the glaciers for the past 50 years and has one of its monitoring stations on Adigene .
" On average , all around the country , we can say the glaciers have decreased in size by about 20 % .
It 's not good for the downstream countries to have a lot of water in their reservoirs which could evaporate without benefiting them
Bakutbek Ermenbaev
Kyrgyz hydrogeologist
" In the last 20 years this has been happening more rapidly than in the previous years , " Mr Ermenbaev says .
We are standing by a fast - flowing mountain stream , less than an hour 's drive from the capital , Bishkek , but we are already at more than 2,000 m above sea-level .
The majority of Kyrgyzstan is mountainous and we are surrounded by snow - capped peaks .
Mr Ermenbaev says the size of the surrounding mountain lakes is further evidence of the effects of global warming .
" When a glacier starts melting it creates small lakes , and each year the size of those lakes is growing , " he says .
He adds that when the lakes get too big , the water overflows and rushes down the valleys and gorges , potentially threatening the settlements in its path .
A number of homes and buildings were washed away in the gorge we are in , which is called Ala - Archa , in the late 1990s .
In Soviet times permanent building was banned in such areas and Mr Ermenbaev says the restrictions should be re-introduced .
He says the agency 's monitoring work has been complicated by the fact that it can no longer get access to some land that has been privatised since the collapse of the Soviet Union .
Regional tensions Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan 's neighbours , such as Uzbekistan - which has a thirsty cotton growing industry - rely on the glaciers for their water supplies .
Mr Ermenbaev says that although the melting may appear to be good news for the downstream countries , providing increased supplies , it will lead to water shortages in the long term .
The melting glaciers feed lakes which can overflow , causing floods Access to water resources has already created tension between countries in the region .
The glaciers provide a store of frozen water , which in the past was released gradually by the thawing and freezing process .
But even if the water is stored downstream in reservoirs it evaporates much more quickly than it would in colder temperatures at higher altitude .
" It 's not good for the downstream countries to have a lot of water in their reservoirs which could evaporate without benefiting them , " Mr Ermenbaev says .
He says that the short - term solution is to build dams on the mountain lakes , where the water can be stored for longer and its flow downstream can be regulated .
However , such projects are not popular with the downstream countries which do not want to see restrictions placed on their access to water .
Mr Ermenbaev says that the only long - term solution is to halt global warming , otherwise the mountain landscape could change for ever .

All those in Italy who oppose the Italian premiership – around half the country , I 'd say – cheered with relief when the news broke that Silvio Berlusconi had been stripped of his legal immunity and could now face prosecution in a number of trials .
But so did many other Italians – because it's a win for the Italian constitution , not for the " left wing " , as Berlusconi wants people to believe .
And many who cast their vote for Berlusconi , when faced with the choice between him and the constitution , would rather keep their pledge to the latter .
In La Stampa , Michele Ainis wrote that the judges ' decision was a lesson to politics , while Marcello Sorgi said Berlusconi 's reaction , attacking the president of the republic , Giorgio Napolitano , went " beyond all limits " .
Of course the prime minister has every right to fight back , but attacking these institutions makes him seem weak and indefensible – even to his friends .
The rightwing Gianfranco Fini , in his role as president of Italy 's chamber of deputies is also irritated by the attack against Napolitano .
According to Massimo Franco , a columnist at Il Corriere della Sera , Berlusconi 's fury is not out of control , but a calculated risk : battle is now fully declared between the government and the presidency , and Berlusconi is forcing his allies to come out in his support .
After all , a leader consecrated by popular elections who could now end up in court defending himself against some serious allegations weighs heavily on the political future of Italy .
Of course in La Repubblica , the newspaper that has been openly campaigning for the opposition and that organised the demonstration for freedom of the press last week in Rome , the tone is triumphant , with headlines such as " The force of democracy " and " The illegitimate immunity " .
But it was Massimo Gramellini who expressed what most Italians were feeling in his satirical column " Buongiorno " in La Stampa : " Disgrace is so leftwing " .
So what happens now ?
On the one hand , four trials will resume that Berlusconi will have to attend : the first is the so - called " Mills case " , to find out if Berlusconi bribed the British lawyer David Mills ; the second is about illegal funds for Mediaset TV rights , in which Berlusconi is accused of fiscal fraud ; the third concerns Mediatrade , where the premier might be called to answer charges of embezzlement ; and finally the judges in Rome have to decide on the accusation of corruption of leftwing senators .
On the other hand , the financial newspaper Il Sole 24 Ore points out that Berlusconi might benefit from new immunity legislation currently being considered by the government .
Columnist Stefano Folli comments :
Without immunity and with trials in progress , Berlusconi 's road is becoming a difficult one .
But there are no immediate alternatives .
It 's up to him to decide in the future if he feels he can still serenely govern Italy .
On paper there is a centre - right majority that can survive without its charismatic leader .
A post -Berlusconi centre - right .
But that 's not the immediate issue .
Right now it 's more important to stay calm and avoid extreme damage : the disconnect between democratic institutions and the people .
Seeing as Folli writes from the pages of the newspaper owned by Confindustria , the Italian leaders / industrialists ' organisation traditionally placed in the political centre , Berlusconi no longer appears to be in good health as a leader in Italy .
No wonder his opponents are starting to feel like they can allow themselves to cheer .
In the movies , androids are always taking over the world .
In real life , not so much .
The invasion began last October , when T - Mobile USA launched its G1 cellphone .
It was the first to feature Android , Google Inc. ’s operating system for smartphones that was supposed to offer a compelling alternative to Apple ’s superb iPhone .
The G1 has n’t done badly .
In April , T - Mobile said it had sold 1 million of the Android - based phones in six months .
It ’s an impressive performance , until you recall that Apple sold that many iPhone 3Gs in the first three days .
Still , the G1 made Android the fourth - most - popular smartphone operating system in the United States , trailing the iPhone , the BlackBerry OS from Research In Motion Ltd. , and Microsoft Corp . ’s Windows Mobile .
Now , Google and its partners are sending in reinforcements .
Verizon Wireless , the nation ’s largest cellular carrier , will begin selling Android phones this fall ; Sprint Nextel Corp. has also announced an upcoming Android handset .
Although T - Mobile is the only US source for Android phones right now , you ’ll soon have two models to choose from .
Next week , the company launches the MyTouch 3G , a thinner , lighter handset from HTC Corp. of Taiwan , which also made the original G1 .
The MyTouch slims down by eliminating the snap - out keyboard that gave the G1 its thick , chunky shape .
The new phone retains the same 3.2 - inch touchscreen , which now doubles as a virtual keyboard .
The MyTouch ’s screen is narrower than the one on the iPhone , which makes typing a challenge for the thick - fingered .
Still , I had little trouble pecking out messages .
The new Android phone does suffer from the same control clutter as the old G1 .
There are too many buttons , and it ’s not always obvious which ones to press .
But at least the MyTouch eliminates the G1 ’s button for snapping photos with the phone ’s 3.2 - megapixel camera ; now you just touch the screen instead .
In its place , the MyTouch provides a dedicated search button .
Press it anytime to launch a Google Internet search window .
Hold it down , and you launch voice search ; just speak your search terms into the microphone .
It ’s not a bad idea , but I found myself yearning for the iPhone ’s simplicity .
One promise T - Mobile has kept is its pledge to improve on the G1 ’s battery life .
After a day of hard use , the G1 died on me , but the MyTouch still had plenty of power in reserve .
That ’s even more impressive when you remember that Android phones can run multiple software programs simultaneously .
Apple generally blocks such multitasking because it reduces battery life , but the MyTouch embraces it .
As a result , Android software developers can write little programs , or “ apps , ’’ that run in the background while the phone performs some other job .
For instance , I had the task reminder program Astrid beeping away every 30 minutes , reminding me to write this column .
At the same time , I was running an environmental program called Ecorio , which used GPS to track my commute to work .
Ecorio calculated that I dumped 4 pounds of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere by driving to the office , and suggested I could save the planet by riding the Red Line in from Quincy .
These are just a couple of the 6,000 or so apps created for Android phones .
Granted , the iPhone has far more - over 65,000 at last count .
But Android ’s built up a pretty good library in less than a year , including adaptations of many of the best iPhone apps , and a lot of them are pretty good .
I got quite a kick out of SnapTell , a little program from Amazon.com that does comparison shopping for books , video games , music CDs , and DVDs .
Just point the phone ’s camera at the product ’s cover and shoot a picture of it .
SnapTell processes the image , identifies the product , and scours the Internet for other retailers that sell it and the prices they charge .
Other impressive apps are Android exclusives .
Last week , Apple refused to carry an iPhone app that lets the user route all his phone calls through Google ’s new telephone service , Google Voice - but there is an Android version .
While the iPhone is produced by just one company , Android is a software standard that can be offered by many companies .
Already , 30 cell carriers in 20 countries are peddling Android phones , and two of America ’s biggest carriers will start selling them this year .
The iPhone will easily outsell any one of these phones , but collectively , Google ’s cellphone technology could end up on tens of millions of handsets , and become the global standard for smartphones .
The Android invasion is just getting started .

A chat with Andrew Zimmern , Andrew Zimmern interview , Bizarre Foods , Bizarre World
TV Home / Entertainment Channel / Bullz - Eye Home
First , he brought you bizarre foods from hither and yon .
Now , Andrew Zimmern has expanded his sights to include a little bit of everything .
His new series , “ Andrew Zimmern ’s Bizarre World , ” premieres on the Travel Channel on September 1st , and Bullz - Eye leapt at the chance to speak with him again .
In addition to getting details on what to expect in the show ’s premiere episode , in which he travels to Cuba , we learned where else he visits in the first season , with his exploration of Florida leading to a photo that must be seen to be believed .
We also got Zimmern ’s take on the fact that his exploits have found families gathered around the television to see where he ’s going and what he ’s eating next .
Has he expanded your palate yet ?
If so , perhaps you ’d consider a bite of roasted hutia .
What ’s a hutia , you ask ?
Read on …
Bullz - Eye : Hey , Andrew , it ’s good to talk to you again !
Andrew Zimmern : Hello !
How are you ?
BE : I ’m doing great !
So what was the path that led you from “ Bizarre Foods ” to “ Bizarre World ” ?
" I ’m a food guy , first and foremost , but I think that if you showed a cut of a ' Bizarre World ' episode to a ' Bizarre Foods ' fan , they would never notice that there ’s less food .
They would just be , I think , really psyched that there ’s more non -food stories thrown in . "
AZ : Oh , wow .
Well , you know , someone much cleverer than I at the network actually phrased it the best , which is that it ’s sort of an evolution , not a revolution .
What happened , really , was …I ’m a food guy , first and foremost , but I think that if you showed a cut of a “ Bizarre World ” episode to a “ Bizarre Foods ” fan , they would never notice that there ’s less food .
They would just be , I think , really psyched that there ’s more non -food stories thrown in .
And , you know , that ’s the end result .
But what led us there was …I guess it was the third show we ever taped , which was in Ecuador , and we found ourselves in a small town .
We had done one of our stories , and we had about two or three hours of downtime , so we ’re just wandering around the back streets of Otavalo , Ecuador , and our fixer said to us , “ Hey , would you like to go to a real witch doctor ? ”
And when I said , “ There are no real witch doctors , ” he said , “ No , this is an Incan medicine man called a yachax , and we can get you in . ”
And it literally was one of those spur - of - the - moment things that we were n’t planning on shooting , but we got to this guy ’s house , where he did his readings and cleansings .
And he was willing to have the cameras there , and we fired them up , and we shot a great scene that ended up being an entire act in the Ecuador show .
And we got more audience response from that than anything else we did the entire first year .
It was one of our favorite acts … and we did n’t eat a thing in it !
I mean , the guy spat up on me , he beat me with poisonous branches , he beat a guinea pig to death against me , he blew smoke on me , he spat up on me again , he lit me on fire … and he did all of this stuff in the name of purging demons from me !
And I think everybody at the network and the production company … I think a big light bulb went off , which was basically that we take people along from the ride and immerse them in the culture , we love to tell stories through food , but we do n’t want to leave those witch - doctor moments on the ground , so to speak , and not tell them .
So for three years , really , we ’ve all been sort of working towards this moment where we would get enough “ Bizarre Foods ” in the can , so to speak .
We all felt that we had done that show and done a good job .
I think we have something like 52 or 54 episodes , including specials , of “ Bizarre Foods , ” and it let us go on to a show that will allow us to sort of stretch and tell the non -food stories .
BE : Now , I have not yet seen the first episode – I guess they ’re just sending them out today – but I did get a description of what went on during your trip to Cuba , and …I understand you got to sample some Cuban cigars .
AZ : I do sample Cuban cigars !
( Laughs )
You know , in the Cuba show … I mean , shooting in Cuba is different from any other place that we ’ve ever shot in the world .
Things we were allowed to do one day , we were n’t allowed to do the next day .
Stories that we were told from the beginning that we could shoot , when we got on the ground , we were n’t allowed to do .
And things that we were told , “ No , ” well , once we got there , we were told , “ Sure , no problem . ”
So Cuba was really one of those episodes where we just let the cameras roll for a week and went with it .
We visited a boxing training facility , we went to the Partagás factory , we went out into Viñales , where the finest tobacco in the world is grown , and picked the last tobacco of the season with a group of farmers and their families .
We cooked , we ate , we sang , we drank , we played music , I took dancing lessons all over the island , we got on a boat … a thing that Cubans are not allowed to do , but the government graciously loaned us a boat and a government driver … and we went out into the Queen ’s Garden , a series of 400 islands on the south side of Cuba , and we went out to some of the outer islands .
We went to Trinidad and danced the night away at the Café de Musica .
We had an absolute blast .
Cuba is an amazing country , amazing people .
And , really , Americans are Cubans ’ favorite tourist to meet .
There are very few of us there , and they ’re really excited about the “ palm curtain ” rising .
BE : I saw on the press release that you do , of course , try out some bizarre foods .
What was the big spotlight food that you tried ?
AZ : Probably the hutia , which is a probably 25 - pound jungle rat , much like a landlocked nutria , something that we sampled in the gulf .
It was…uh , it was something .
We trapped them at night , and then we roasted them whole with the famers in Viñales .
Everyone in Cuba eats hutia , especially outside of the city .
BE : So where else have you visited thus far on your “ Bizarre World ” trips ?
AZ : Well , we did Cuba , Belize , and the Kalahari Desert , which is the favorite hour of television that I ’ve ever been involved in .
In my life .
And we also did South Africa , Germany , Sulawesi , Bali , Florida , and Wisconsin .
And that ’s all of Season 1A .
But we have a whole bunch of other shows that will start again in the winter .
BE : So there is , clearly , a mixing - up between the US and the rest of the world .
AZ : Yeah , you know , it ’s interesting .
It was surprisingly so at first , though it ’s now been proven and is no longer a surprise to us , but the most popular shows that we do , ratings - wise , are the ones that we shoot here in the States .
The most popular episode of “ Bizarre Foods ” ever was our Appalachia episode , and the second most popular was our Minnesota episode .
And I think the third most popular was Cicily .
But it ’s amazing how popular the shows are that we do here .
“ The single greatest pleasure that I have in doing this show is when I meet families with 6 , 7 , 8 - year - olds , or teenagers , who say , ' It ’s something the whole family can watch , and it lets us show our younger children that one man ’s ‘ weird ’ is another man ’s ‘ wonderful , ’ and we all kind of live in the same place . '
It ’s just the best part of my day . ”
BE : I see that David Koechner is going to be in “ Fully Loaded . ”
BE : So I understand that they ’re trying to get Adam Richman to do a lutefisk challenge on “ Man vs. Food . ”
AZ : Oh , are they really ?
BE : No , not really .
AZ : ( Laughs )
That would be one of those foods … look , here ’s the thing .
It ’s funny that you say that , because I get to talk to Adam a lot , and we ’ve gotten friendly since his show started on the Travel Channel , and , y’know , a lot of the foods that he eats … ?
I mean , you have an adverse physical reaction from eating a lot , but I remember talking to him about the spicy wings or something that he ate that was very spicy and the adverse reaction , and …if you eat too much lutefisk , you could keel over and die .
I just think it ’s one of those things that no one should eat more than a few bites of .
BE : Did you enjoy the opportunity to turn up on Adam ’s show ?
AZ : Oh , my God , yes .
I absolutely adored it .
As a matter of fact … well , number one , it ’s fun to do someone else ’s show because the pressure ’s really off , so from that standpoint , I absolutely adored it .
And then in terms of the content , I got to take him to …his producers allowed me to pick the restaurants that we went to , and we ended up just focusing on one restaurant , which was one of my friend ’s places , in Minneapolis .
It was called Brasa , and it was wonderful !
BE : Given how busy you are , I ’m amazed that you update your “ Chow and Again ” blog as often as you do .
AZ : Oh , my God , thanks .
You know , “ Chow and Again ” … I try , and we ’re pretty good about updating once a week , and occasionally I get to it twice .
But , plus , I ’ve got my blog at TravelChannel.com , plus I ’ve got the stuff that I do at AndrewZimmern.com , so… ( Laughs ) … there ’s a lot of stuff to put on there !
BE : Not that you do n’t do quite a bit of it between those three places , but , still , with all of the TV work you do , do you once in awhile find yourself thinking , “ Wow , I kind of miss writing ” ?
AZ : Yeah , y’know , I always missed writing until I wrote my book ( The Bizarre Truth : How I Walked out the Door Mouth First . . . and Came Back Shaking My Head ) .
( Laughs )
Then I said , “ I do n’t miss writing so much . ”
But , yeah , I do .
There ’s something about being able to … ( Sighs ) Here ’s the thing .
You eat a lot of spaghetti , you want a steak .
You eat a lot of steak , you want spaghetti .
The grass is always greener .
When I ’m immersed in a lot of writing , I miss the spontaneity and the “ once it ’s over , it ’s done , and you move on to the next thing ” aspect of doing TV .
Somebody said it ’s as close to live TV as you can get .
We do n’t do any do - overs on our show .
We sort of go in , fire up the cameras , have the experience , and , yes , we edit back at the production company , and the shows are aired long after they ’re shot , but what you see is what you get on our show .
We do n’t do recreations , and we do n’t do do - overs .
I like the spontaneity some days , and some days I really like just being able to sit on top of something and come back to it and craft it , which is what I love about writing .
BE : When you and I talked last time , I mentioned how my daughter had enjoyed sharing the chocolate - covered crickets that we got from Travel Channel on your behalf …
AZ : Exactly !
BE : .. and we also talked about how , with your son , you had to approach him early on some things because you missed the …was it the bug window ?
AZ : Actually , I miss the worm window .
( Laughs )
He likes crickets , and he likes everything creepy - crawly but worms , because that kids ’ book , “ Yummy Yucky , ” was read to him three or four times before I offered him his first worm .
So he said , “ Dad , that ’s yucky ! ”
And I just went , “ D’oh !
They got to him ! ”
But he eats pretty much everything else !
BE : Do you hear from a lot of parents who tell you that they watch the show with their whole family ?
" You eat a lot of spaghetti , you want a steak .
You eat a lot of steak , you want spaghetti .
The grass is always greener .
When I ’m immersed in a lot of writing , I miss the spontaneity and the ' once it ’s over , it ’s done , and you move on to the next thing ' aspect of doing TV .
But some days I really like just being able to sit on top of something and come back to it and craft it , which is what I love about writing . "
AZ : It ’s staggering .
What shocks me more than any other aspect in the history of the show is how many families watch it together , and how many young people watch it .
I ’m delighted that college kids watch the show and do a drinking game every time I say the word “ interesting , ” you know ?
I love that there ’s dinner clubs that twentysomethings have in the Pacific Northwest around the show .
I adore the fact that teenagers and ‘ tweens love the yuck factor .
The show ’s extremely popular with the 10 – 13s in that sense .
But the single greatest pleasure that I have in doing this show is when I meet families with 6 , 7 , 8 - year - olds , or teenagers , who say , “ It ’s something the whole family can watch , and it lets us show our younger children that one man ’s ‘ weird ’ is another man ’s ‘ wonderful , ’ and we all kind of live in the same place . ”
It ’s just the best part of my day .
We ’re shooting Florida , doing a “ Bizarre World : Florida ” episode , and we just left the Weeki Wachi Mermaids show , where I was performing with the mermaids …
BE : Nice .
AZ : … and a lot of families were there , because it ’s very much a family - friendly atmosphere .
And the parents with little kids who said , “ Oh , my 7 - year - old just has to watch , she turned us on to you , ” I mean , that ’s staggering .
And the parents tell me that their kids are much more open - minded eaters now !
I get letters all the time at the office , probably three or four a week , from parents who said , “ My kids ate chicken nuggets and PB&J , and then we started watching your show , and we said to him over one dinner , ‘ Well , Mr. Zimmern would eat it . ’
And that just started him off .
He started shoving everything he could into his mouth . ”
I just think that ’s fantastic .
BE : Speaking of Florida , there ’s a lovely photo of you in full drag on AndrewZimmern.com as your new alter - ego , Pandora Lexington .
( Writer ’s note :
The full slew of shots can be found over at Miami - Gay - Blog.com , courtesy of their top - notch photographer , Juan Saco Miranoff . )
AZ : ( Laughs ) Oh , that was one of the greatest days , one of the best days that we ’ve ever had shooting .
What a miraculous story , and what a great bunch of guys … I mean ladies …at LIPS , in Fort Lauderdale .
I mean , it was just incredible for them to let us into their world and to let us really immerse ourselves .
And when we got there , the great surprise for us was how many families and what a straight – in every sense of the world – entertainment experience they ’re offering there , with a fabulous brunch .
And we got to share that with them .
And how excited the drag community at LIPS in Fort Lauderdale was that we were there , telling their story without a smirk and without any snark .
It ’s a fantastic , fantastic act in our show .
I think when people see the Florida episode on October 20th , they ’re absolutely going to be thrilled .
We did a lot of cool stuff here .
We went to a drag strip and raced the cops in a beat - the - heat race , we did the drag queen show , I got to perform with the Weeki Wachi mermaids in a mermaid suit …it ’s been a great trip so far .
BE : I ’m sure you ’ve been asked this before , but what ’s your favorite guilty - pleasure food ?
AZ : My favorite guilty - pleasure food …?
Oh , my gosh .
You know , being so consumed by what I do … I mean , I really live my brand .
I ’ll just tell you what ’s on my mind these days .
The Minnesota State Fair is coming up , and all I ’ve been thinking about literally for the last month are some of the foods that I only eat once a year there .
You know , the foot - long hot dogs and the cheese curds and all the sort of fun state fair / carnival foods .
Mini -donuts , stuff like that .
I happen to be a hamburger geek .
I ’m a bit Culver ’s Burgers guy .
We do Culver ’s at least once a week at our house .
The crew and I just stopped at Chick - Fil - A , which we do n’t have in Minnesota , and we ’re just …are you in the South ?
BE : I am .
I ’m in Virginia .
AZ : Do you have a Chick - Fil - A in your neighborhood ?
BE : Absolutely .
I love it .
AZ : Exactly .
I mean , it ’s the kind of thing where if you do n’t have one …well , anyway , we just stopped at Chick - Fil - A , and it ’s heaven .
BE : I saw that you ’d written about Brian Boitano ’s new Food Network series on your blog .
Has there been any talk of you appearing on the show ?
AZ : No .
I mean , I would if I was asked .
I do n’t like to judge a book by its cover , and I ’m all about checking out the experience , so in fairness to him , I have not seen the show yet and I ’m really anxious to check it out .
But one of the problems that I have with a lot of food and travel television is that I connect to people who are living their brand , and what I love about being a part of the Travel Channel …and this is not a corporate line , this is how I really feel and why I went to Travel Channel with my idea first and always wanted to be a Travel Channel guy …is that , when the cameras are off , Tony ( Bourdain ) is Tony , Samantha ( ) is Samantha , Adam is Adam , and I ’m me .
I hang out with these people , we ’ve all gotten friendly over the years , and so it ’s really fascinating to me how genuine the appeal is .
And that ’s why I think our shows are successful .
On a lot of other networks , people are hired to be hosts who I ’m not really sure are the way they portray themselves to be on camera , and that ’s what I relate to when I ’m watching TV .
But I ’m looking forward to checking out Brian ’s show .
And , plus , I also … I ’ve got a lot of stuff on the TiVo and the DVR that I ’ve got to watch .
There are a lot of imitators who have come across the airwaves thanks to the success of my show , people who are trying to do the same sort of thematic material that we covered with “ Bizarre Foods , ” and I ’m interested in seeing a lot of the food and travel shows that relate to that .
BE : So you do watch food - related shows , then ?
I was n’t sure if it would be overkill , given what you do for a living .
AZ : Oh , no , no !
( Laughs )
My wife and I , we watch all the “ Top Chef ” stuff , and I ’m friendly with ¾ of the people who were on “ Top Chef Masters . ”
I was thrilled to see my friend Rick Bayless win that .
He ’s just a delight .
So I watch that show , and I watch a lot of the PBS stuff , plus a lot of stuff on our network .
Yeah , I ’m pretty much … if it involves food and travel , I want to see it .
As a consumer !
BE : And , lastly , do you currently have ownership in any restaurant at this point ?
I know you certainly used to , but I did n’t know if you were just on the road too much these days .
AZ : I do n’t .
You know , what happened was that , eight or nine years ago , I left restaurants and I got into doing radio , writing , and television .
I said to myself , “ I ’m going to give this a couple years , but I can always go back to the restaurant business . ”
I just thought that there was a window that was going to shut , you know ?
I could just sense it .
And I ’m glad I got in when I got in , because I went to a radio station , a TV station , and a magazine , and with all three , I got an appointment with their HR people and said , “ I will work for free for three months , I just want to learn how to do what people do here . ”
And within three months , all of them started paying me because I was able to garner an audience .
My TV career started with doing one segment a week , ten years ago , on a UPN affiliate … back in old days when there was a UPN network in Minneapolis .
My radio career began by doing a five - minute segment on someone else ’s radio show , and my writing career began by doing a 300 - word column in a Minneapolis / St. Paul magazine .
And I think that , if you go to those types of entities now and offer yourself up for free , they just do n’t have room for people anymore !
When I started in the restaurant business , I went Europe and I walked in the back door of restaurants and said , “ I ’ll work for free ! ”
Just like any other eager young cook , I wanted to work in a great restaurant … and you could do that in those days .
I guess it was about three years ago , a guy I work for in New York named Thomas Keller , who ’s got a couple of restaurants now and is very famous in Northern California , Vegas , and New York , I asked about any opportunities that he had for apprenticeships and internships , and he told me that they were getting about 10,000 applications a year but that they only gave out two positions .
So the way in which I learned to become a chef , the old - fashioned way , side by side in really good kitchens , really is n’t available to people anymore .
And I do n’t think it ’s available on the media side of things any more , either , so I ’m glad I got into it when I did .
Right now , I ’m enjoying everything that I ’m doing .
The new show starts September 1st , the new book drops on September 8th , and I have no plans to stop doing that .
But , you know , if and when at some time that ends , and I still have the sand in my shoes , I can get back into the restaurant business .
BE : All right , Andrew , I ’ll keep you on your schedule , but it ’s been great talking to you again .
AZ : Oh , thank you .
I really enjoyed it .
And say “ hi ” to your daughter for me !
Tell her to keep eating those chocolate - covered crickets !
BE : I ’ll be sure to keep her supplied .
: ( Laughs )
All right , my friend .
Thanks again !
Delran , New Jersey ( CNN ) --
It 's a hot day as Jim Bintliff laces up his " mud shoes " -- a beat - up pair of sneakers still tinged with dirt -- and heads out for one of his last harvests of the year .
The tides are just right .
Armed with a stack of buckets , a shovel and a pushcart , Bintliff walk sthrough the woods on a narrow winding trail he has followed for the past 44 years .
Then , the forest opens up to reveal a secret fishing hole that lies on the banks of the Delaware River and in the sometimes - quirky pages of baseball history .
" Nobody knows this is where I get the magic mud , " Bintliff says .
Out of nine brothers and sisters , Bintliff was the one picked to carry on the family business -- Lena Blackburne Baseball Rubbing Mud .
The unique muck is the only brand used each year by Major League Baseball , and its minor - league affiliates , to abide by a line in the league 's rule book requiring umpires to inspect balls and make sure they 're " properly rubbed so the gloss is removed . "
The mud was n't officially introduced to Major League Baseball until 1938 , but its legacy began almost two decades earlier .
On August 16 , 1920 , Ray Chapman , a shortstop for the Cleveland Indians , was crowding the plate in the top of the fifth inning when he was struck in the head by an underhand curve ball from New York Yankees pitcher Carl Mays .
Days later , Chapman became the first and only player killed by a pitch in Major League history .
" From that point forward the umpires were looking for a way to get a better grip for the pitcher on a new baseball , " Bintliff says .
" They tried tobacco juice , shoe polish , dirt from the infield and all of those things scarred or damaged the leather . "
Lena Blackburne , a manager for the Philadelphia Athletics , had an idea .
He cured and aged mud from a fishing hole near his home and took it back to the Athletics clubhouse .
It worked , and soon Blackburne was getting telegrams from teams asking for the " magic mud . "
By 1938 it was used by every team in the majors .
With all of the advances in baseball equipment over the years , the mud is still important , says Atlanta Braves pitcher Tim Hudson .
" A brand new pearl has kind of a slick finish on it , " Hudson told CNN .
" I do n't think there 's a hitter that 's going to stand in the box without one being rubbed up because you just do n't get a real good grip on it .
It 's pretty dangerous . "
Baseball and spit
Chris Van
Zant earns part of his paycheck with his spit .
An assistant manager for the Braves , Chris is the team 's only baseball rubber .
Before each game , he mixes spit with the mud and rubs the factory gloss off of each new ball .
In his 10 years with the club , Van Zant estimates over 40,000 baseballs have passed through his hands .
" It seems kind of funny , " he said .
" When you see fans fighting for a souvenir ball that goes into the stands , you 're like , ' Well , that ball has my spit on it . '
There 's a little kid somewhere with a baseball on his nightstand and I spit on that ball . "
Surrounded by pictures of his kids , stacks of paperwork and articles clipped from newspapers and magazines , Van Zant sat recently in his office at Turner Field plying his trade .
Working up the spit to rub up nine dozen baseballs a game is no easy task , so he makes sure he has plenty of gum and soda on hand .
According to Van Zant , pitchers like the balls darker and hitters like the balls lighter , so the baseballs can vary from stadium to stadium .
" Every guy who does this has his own way of rubbing the baseballs , " Chris explains .
" But no matter what , you have to spit . "
Bintliff claims the secret geography and geology of his mud make it unique .
He skims it with his shovel , carefully removing the top layer and slowly gathering hundreds of pounds of the stuff in buckets before beginning the arduous trek back to his truck .
" If anybody happens to catch me in the act of harvesting mud , I come up with a story to give them a reason I 'm putting mud in a bucket , " Bintliff says .
" I 've told people I use it in my garden , I use it for my rose bushes , I use it for bee stings and poison ivy and any kind of story . "
He began venturing out with his father , Burns Bintliff in the 1960s after Burns inherited the business from his father - in - law , John Haas .
Haas was friends with Lena Blackburne , who passed the business on when he got too old to harvest the mud himself .
Using the same methods that Blackburne invented more than 70 years ago , Bintliff strains and cures the mud in his own backyard .
After it sits for months , he fills each plastic container and sticks on every label with his own mud-stained fingers , shipping out a season 's supply -- two 32 - ounce cans -- to each team .
Despite cornering the market , Bintliff has never been able to quit his full - time job .
He said the mud only brings in about $ 20,000 a year and that he still works the overnight shift as a printing press operator to support his family .
But settling for less has ensured that the mud he cures behind his home remains the mud tossed out from behind home plate .
" It 's the history and the tradition , " said Bintliff , who plans to one day hand the business down to his daughter , Rachel .
" It 's something I 've been doing since I was a kid and I would n't give it up for anything .
" From 1938 , on all those record home runs and those thousands of strikeouts , my mud 's been on every ball . "
That will be true tonight , when the first pitch in the World Series is tossed .

A few people have made the remark on this blog that overpopulation is an important cause of the increasing pressure on our planet .
It is self - explanatory that with an increasing population , we get an increasing usage of available space , resources and energy .
When I was born there were about 3 billion people , now close to 7 billion , and predictions are pointing towards stabilizing on approx .
9 to 10 billion souls on Earth .
Scientists assume that the planet will be able to deliver enough food supply and resources to sustain the whole lot in a fairly good lifestyle , but not to sustain our Western Wasting Way of life .
Sometimes people make the remark that the environmental pressure would be a lot less if there would be less little Africans , Indians or Chinese born .
We have however to account the personal eco-impact of each child born .
A baby born in India or Bolivia will at age 60 have produced an estimated 60 tons of CO 2 emissions .
Who is born in Belgium or The Netherlands will have produced no less than 900 tons of CO 2 emissions by the age of 60 , which is approximately 15 times .
It is for that reason a bit silly to demand from Third World countries to implement birth control and to stimulate the number of babies born here .
The best methods to slow down the growth of population in the South are well known an rather cheap :
Education ( especially for girls )
Healthcare ( especially related to reducing mortality of little children )
Access to affordable and reliable contraception
Employment ( especially for women )
Social services ( amongst which family planning and improvement of the economical situation of the poorest groups )
Access to drinking water and sanitary facilities .
It are these facilities which has contributed to the strong reduction of child birth in our regions in just a few generations .
So the best thing which could happen to reduce the demographic growth and worldwide environmental impact is to redistribute worldwide the available resources , combined with measures which limit population growth both in the North and South .
And if you would like to check the actual number of colleague humans walking on this globe , you can use this counter .
Notoriously anti-gay , anti-immigrant and anti-liberal radio host Michael “ Weiner ” Savage has been canned from his flagship station Talk 910 KNEW in San Francisco .
According to the station ’s Web site , “ We have decided to go in a different philosophical and ideological direction , featuring more contemporary content and more local information . ”
Savage is being replaced during the 3 p.m. - 7 p.m. drive - time slot by John and Ken , a couple of younger and conservative - leaning Southern California talkers .
Wikipedia check shows they are pro-death penalty , anti-tax , anti-illegal immigration and pro-gays in the military .
First banned in Britain , now SF .
This is great news , but KNEW still carries Glenn Beck .

Pissed - Off About Happiness
By Gina Simmons , Ph.D .
“ I hate happy people , ” said Mark , a former anger management client .
“ I just want to punch them in the face . ”
Mark wore his unhappiness with a hostile chip on his shoulder .
Unable to appreciate the joy in others , even the sweet innocence of a baby ’s laughter , he consumed himself with bitter envy .
Another client , Sandy , spit out her words like bullets while talking about a visit to her wealthy friends home .
“ She has the car.garden.house.husband.pool.clothes.and I.have.nothing .
I hate her ! ”
Sandy ’s envy about her friends good fortune robbed her of a happy visit .
Had Sandy been able to open her heart and feel a little of her friend ’s joy , she might have gotten ideas and inspiration to improve her own life .
Both Mark and Sandy suffer from severe depression , keeping them self - centered , pissed - off , and unable to feel joy and emotional connection with others .
This closed - off approach to life can rob you of the opening , building , problem - solving fuel of happiness .
Dr. Barbara Fredrickson found that increasing your joy opens your mind to greater possibilities and improves problem solving skills .
Happiness adds real practical value to our lives .
Research shows that about 50 % of our happiness appears to be a genetically determined “ set point . ”
Some babies are born smiling , others cranky based on hereditary predisposition .
Another 10 % of our capacity for joy is determined by our circumstances , rich or poor , healthy or unhealthy , etc .
The remaining 40 % of our ability for happiness is determined by our own actions and thoughts .
While Mark and Sandy struggled with genetic predispositions to depression , they needed help seeing the impact their own thoughts and actions made in their ability to feel good .
Dr. Sonia Lyubomirsky in her book The How of Happiness writes , “ … becoming lastingly happier demands making some permanent changes that require effort and commitment every day of your life . ”
One of those permanent changes include avoiding social comparison .
We often compare ourselves to others and find something lacking in ourselves .
This makes us feel down , discouraged , resentful .
Instead it ’s helpful to stop the thoughts of comparison and distract ourselves by thinking about something else , like a hobby , a personal goal , or a favorite movie or book .
If you find yourself pissed - off about the happiness of others , stop comparing and start living .
Happiness enhancing activities include : practicing acts of kindness , committing to your goals , learning to forgive and nurturing your relationships .
As you make efforts toward kindness and achieving personal goals , your life improves .
When your heart warms toward others , you can find joy in the happiness of others .
To paraphrase Oscar Wilde , it ’s best to cause happiness wherever you go , rather than whenever you go .
In a shining example of good government , NJDOT listened and responded to Millville and Cumberland County residents and elected officials opposed to a project which would have widened Route 49 by lengthening the Route 55 exit ramps .
The $ 28 million project was announced in April by Gov. Corzine , but fears that the project would increase traffic congestion spurred a petition from residents and a letter from State Sen.
Jeff Van Drew to Commissioner Stephen Dilts requesting a delay .
NJDOT obliged and held several community meetings to address residents ’ concerns , and the resulting amendments saved taxpayers $ 10 million by removing the widening .
The re-opened dialogue also protected a 230 - year - old White Oak tree that is older than the town itself , and refocused the Department ’s attention to congestion issues more germane to local residents , such as traffic on Route 57 .
Beyond the obvious victories for the Millville community , there is a great lesson to be learned from the Route 49 /55 project .
NJDOT ’s willingness to maintain an open dialogue with residents enabled the agency to save scarce transportation funds , make better planning decisions , and forced it to reevaluate the efficacy of its plans .
First designed 12 years ago , the Millville widening project became obsolete as it waited for state funds – a fate not unique to Route 49 .
Millville petitioners stated that traffic flow had improved significantly after the traffic signal timing was recalibrated , rendering state plans unnecessary .
It would be a shame if this successful cooperative process was not emulated elsewhere .
Millville Mayor Tim Shannon summed it up in a statement to The News of Cumberland County : “ I know most people do n’t have anything good to say about the government , but I just want to say I think this was an example of government at its best . ”

Internet Explorer 's dominance of the browser world continues to melt away at a steady but glacial pace — with Mozilla earnestly waving a hair dryer .
Mozilla Corporation CEO
John Lilly revealed in a Twitter post on Monday that Firefox gained over 30 million unique users over the past eight weeks .
He calls the recent growth spurt " amazing . "
Of course , that 's his job .
Tristan Nitot of Mozilla Europe later told ZDNet UK that Lily 's figure was an estimate based on the Firefox browser phoning home every 24 hours to check for updates .
Counting the requests gives Mozilla an idea of the number of active daily users .
The org then multiplies that number by three to accommodate for people not browsing every day .
Based on that assumption , Mozilla saw a mean increase of 10 million daily users for a total of 113 million , Nitot told the publication .
The x3 adjustment results in a total of 330 million users monthly .
He attributes much of the boost to the back - to - school cycle of students buying new computers along with the end of summer holidays .
It 's a healthy boost for Firefox , but Microsoft 's Internet Explorer remains the king - of - the - heap by a considerable proportion .
Browser counter NetApplications last reported that IE 's September market share slipped by 1.26 per cent from the previous month to 65.71 per cent of total web surfers .
Firefox , in the same timeframe , rose a modest 0.77 % to 23.75 per cent total in September .
Meanwhile , other leading browsers like Safari , Chrome , and Opera only hold single - digit percentages of the market , with Safari in third place with 4.24 per cent .
Whether IE can take back the slow erosion of users with Windows 7 should be an interesting statistic to follow in the months ahead . ®

I ’ve never seen anything like it , the marks were stuck for several days .
Simen could n’t find the owl in the area so it most likely survived the crash – but it must have hurt .

( AP ) --
A lone llama wandering near the summit of Pikes Peak for a month has been captured and is heading to a new home .
Tracy Ducharme and Mike Shealy , both of Black Forest , Colo. , trekked up the 14,110 - foot mountain Friday to find the little white beast of burden .
They took two llamas with them , hoping Homer 's herd instincts would lure him to them .
The two split up and Ducharme spotted the llama , which bounded after her llama , Dancer .
She then slipped a rope around his neck .
" I dubbed him ' Homer ' because of his little odyssey , " she said , referring to the classic Greek novel " Odyssey " by the poet Homer .
Ducharme said the llama might lose its ears to frostbite , but is otherwise fine .
" He 's going home , " said Ducharme , adding that she does n't expect to have any trouble finding him a permanent home .
The Southwest Llama Rescue group coordinated efforts to capture Homer before he fell prey to mountain lions , coyotes or the coming winter .
The group says llamas are domesticated animals and do n't have the instincts to survive in the wild .
Rescuers speculate that the llama might have escaped from a stock trailer on the plains below or from hikers who were using it as a pack animal .
But no one has reporting a missing llama .
Riders on a cog railway on the mountain first reported seeing the llama about a month ago .
It roamed the mountain 's south slope , living off alpine vegetation and trying to unsuccessfully to make friends with a herd of bighorn sheep .

Some days , the world of military whizz - tech can get to be a bit humdrum .
Awesome as missiles , robots etc. are , they can sometimes pall .
But today is no such day : today we on the Reg military whizz - tech desk have been interviewing the inventor of an actual , working powered exoskeleton - in his suit , powered up , with hundreds of pounds of armour and other military bric - a - brac strapped onto him .
The exoskeleton inventor was careful not to tread on any toes .
Russdon Angold is an engineer from California .
To the accompaniment of an occasional loudish whine as his suit 's electrically - driven hydraulics cut in and out , he briefed the Reg on the Human Universal Load Carrier ( HULC ™ ) exoskeleton this afternoon .
" We 're just at the right stage for this now , " said Angold .
" Batteries , hydraulics , controls , they 've all developed to the point where a machine like this becomes achievable . "
Angold and a few colleagues at first developed the HULC on their own through their company Berkeley Bionics .
However , the firm was acquired by US defence goliath Lockheed , who are now assisting with " ruggedisation " and further readying of the machine .
The HULC runs on Li-ion batteries , driving lightweight hydraulic legs with titanium structure .
A wearer can hang a 200 lb backpack from the back frame and heavy chest armour and kit from shoulder extensions .
" I 'm just standing here , " said Angold , carrying just such a load .
" All the weight 's carried by the structure . "
He demonstrated walking around without trouble , and was able to go down to one knee and recover to standing up easily despite having almost 300 lb of kit strapped onto him .
Readers with infantry experience will appreciate this last feature .
Angold himself has no such background , but his brother is a serving US Navy SEAL .
The machine does n't offer any help to the wearer 's arms , but an over - shoulder gantry can be fitted and heavy items such as artillery shells hung from it on a sling .
Battery life depends on usage - you can drain the batteries fast by running - but marching slowly at 4 kph will allow it to last for 5 hours .
According to Lockheed reps the HULC is n't ready for prime time yet , being still " in ruggedisation " .
However the company would envisage giving it to actual soldiers so as to get their input from next summer .
Field deployment in the event of a customer coming forward would happen at some point after that .
Overcoming inevitable military scepticism may be something of an issue .
A senior British officer , present to observe the HULC in action , joked that it would be a major threat to the Army as it could allow more female soldiers in combat roles .
He preferred to remain unnamed .
Meanwhile back in the States , rival arms behemoth Raytheon has bought up the competing Sarcos XOS exoskeleton .
We asked Angold why his suit 's better .
" Because it does n't have a tether , " he said bluntly , alluding to the XOS 's well - known inability to stray too far from a power socket . ®

2,300 police reports missing The San Antonio Police Department has misplaced more than 2,000 police reports ranging from thefts and car wrecks to more serious offenses of rapes and assaults .
The San Antonio Police Department has misplaced more than 2,000 police reports ranging from thefts and car wrecks to more serious offenses of rapes and assaults , according to internal police documents obtained by the San Antonio Express - News .
Now , the Police Department is scrambling to " recover and correct the open cases so all reports are properly received , entered and accounted for , " according to an internal memo that a deputy chief sent last week to Police Chief William McManus .
" We 've got to get our hands on a piece of paper .
That 's what it boils down to , " Assistant Chief Geraldine Garcia acknowledged Thursday .
" Our problem now is finding that report . "
Police discovered the lapses two months ago while trying to clean up the record - keeping system , Garcia said .
The memo to McManus listed 20 " major contributing factors " to the mess , including random errors by patrol officers and supervisors , incorrect coding of calls and a lack of oversight of records clerks and couriers .
Responding officers in many cases showed up at scenes , handwrote reports and tendered them to be tucked away in the records unit .
But at some point in the department 's process of managing records , the reports - about 2,300 in the first seven months of this year - went unaccounted for , documents show .
A police source familiar with the imbroglio but unauthorized to speak to media said some officers have been asked to rewrite reports on incidents to which they responded months ago .
" They do n't have the information , " the source said .
" This is very basic , but it affects just about everything . "
Police reports in some ways are the nexus of a law enforcement agency .
They provide raw data for conducting investigations , responding to troubled neighborhoods and calculating crime statistics .
They also serve as crucial resources for prosecutors and residents seeking insurance coverage for damaged or stolen property .
Cliff Herberg , first assistant district attorney for Bexar County , acknowledged police reports are essential to a prosecution , but added he was confident police would manage either to recreate the reports or recover copies of them .
" If there 's no police report , then no case gets investigated , and then no case gets filed with us , " he said .
But he also said : " I just do n't see ( a report ) falling through the cracks . "
Thomas Aveni , co-founder of the Police Policy Studies Council in Spofford , N.H. , stressed that the sheer volume of reports that police agencies generate on a daily basis can create " day - to - day pandemonium . "
" It 's just the chaos in which police departments are trying to manage tens of thousands of reports coming in from various sources , " Aveni said .
But he added that the situation in San Antonio appears problematic .
" If I have 2,000 reports missing in a fairly compressed period of time , I 'd be concerned , " Aveni said .
" This is an embarrassment to them on some level , and they should want to rectify it . "
This is not the first time problems have arisen with the Police Department 's handling of records .
In 2007 , McManus asked the city and FBI to review the department 's record - keeping practices after the Express - News questioned its homicide clearance rates for the previous year .
McManus said he planned to create a unit that would ensure accuracy in the department 's Uniform Crime Reporting system , the national standard for recording the numbers of crimes in a law enforcement agency 's jurisdiction .
Completed last year , the city audit found the department had " no true central records function in place to ensure accuracy , completeness and compliance " with FBI guidelines on submitting the statistics .
In attempting to fix the way they report crimes , police this year discovered " many cases " were unaccounted for , according to the memo to McManus .
The memo did n't specify how many , but police acknowledged Thursday that more than 2,000 reports had been misplaced .
" You get slapped when you try to do a good job , " said Garcia , the assistant police chief .
" We said we 're going to self - audit . "
Michael Gilbert , a University of Texas at San Antonio criminologist , stressed that the apparent number of missing reports is low compared to the estimated 1 million calls police here receive on an annual basis .
He called the missing reports ' impact on UCR numbers " negligible . "
Yet , lost reports could understate crime levels in neighborhoods , Gilbert said .
" It could affect response levels .
It could affect assignment of personnel , " he said .
" As a manager , I 'd want to know :
Is it the tip of an iceberg or is it just some random cases ? "
He said missing reports also could delay investigations .
The case " might not resurface unless somebody inquires , " he said .
The reasons for the missing reports are myriad , according to the memo to McManus .
Reporting officers often write reports illegibly and invert numerals when writing case numbers .
Patrol supervisors assigned to officer - complaint calls fail to follow up with a report , consigning the cases to a black hole .
In one case with a missing report , a man with bloodstains on his shirt showed up at a police station claiming an officer had assaulted him at the Saint nightclub , according to an internal police document .
Sometimes , officers in the field assign case numbers to incidents that they should n't , such as when they request wreckers for flat tires or dead batteries .
The memo also noted a lack of accountability for those who physically carry police reports to the records unit at police headquarters .
Unlike those in other Texas agencies , San Antonio police still handwrite most reports .
A computer system conceived a decade ago that would have allowed officers to type their reports into laptops never materialized .
Aveni pointed to the antiquated system as a possible monkey wrench .
" If you 're dealing with an old - fashioned paper system , in many respects you 've got more opportunity for a report to get misplaced , " he said .
" And the larger the agency , the more hands that are in the pie . "
Gilbert added that staffing levels could have contributed to the problems .
San Antonio has about 2,200 police officers for a city of about 1.3 million people .
" Rushed work can occur when a police department has too few people to do too much work , " Gilbert said .
For one , Garcia said she 's determined now to correct the problems .
" We found another way to audit ourselves , " the assistant chief said .
" I anticipate a couple hundred ( missing reports ) a month .
And I 'll be on top of it every month now . "
Attorneys for Apple have begun a legal response against the largest supermarket chain in Australia over a logo the electronics company says is too similar to its own iconic trademark .
Woolworths Supermarkets announced in August 2008 that it would revamp its corporate branding strategy ( PDF ) with a new logo , among other changes .
The Australian company has steered clear of mentioning apples in relation to its new mark , claiming the stylized ' W ' was been paired with " an abstract leaf symbol " to represent fresh food .
But others have noted its similarity to that particular fruit , including a trade publication that has twice compared the logo to a " peeling apple " ( 1 , 2 ) .
Apple , which has a long history of defending its world - famous bitten apple logo , has decided the similarities are a little too close for comfort .
At first glance , the chance for confusion between a computer company and a food seller seems remote , but Woolworths ' application asked for a blanket trademark extending even to electrical goods and technology .
" While we can't rule [ computers , musical players , or other devices ] out , we have n't got any plans at the moment , " said a Woolworths spokesman .
The companies ' trademarks could also clash in their respective retail presences .
Apple operates an expanding line of international retail stores , while Woolworths is the largest retail company in Australia and New Zealand .
Â
And although the latter it is named after the American F.W. Woolworth chain of " five and dime " stores , the two are not related .
Apple will make its case to IP Australia , the federal agency that governs trademarks in that country .
Almost one year ago , Apple challenged a Canadian school that used its own apple logo on a storefront with other logos , including Adobe and Microsoft Office , arguing that it could lead to confusion amongst customers expecting one of Apple 's stores .
In April 2008 , Apple similarly opposed a trademark filing for New York City 's GreeNYC campaign that incorporated a stylized apple with a stalk and leaf .
And , most notably , Apple and The Beatles ' parent company Apple Corps finally reached an agreement in 2007 after nearly thirty years of controversy about the use of the name " Apple " and related logos in various aspects of the music business .
Holy keee - rist .
The apocalypse approaches , because AT&T has opened their network up to VoIP applications running over the air on the iPhone .
In other words , AT&T is now totally cool with using Skype over 3G .
Advertisement
AT&T supposedly just told Apple and the FCC this afternoon that their network is ready for VoIP over 3G for the iPhone , meaning it might take a bit to show up in apps , but the floodgates are open now .
And yeah , whoa .
Skype over 3G has been okay on other phones that were n't the iPhone before this , but AT&T's now " taken the steps necessary so that Apple can enable VoIP applications on iPhone to run on AT&T 's wireless network . "
Since there 's no cap on iPhone data — and AT&T says it 's still unlimited with VoIP — that means you can get the cheapest possible voice plan and talk as much as you want through VoIP apps like Skype .
We would n't be totally surprised if AT&T suddenly discovering their network is ready for VoIP over 3G is at least partially motivated by the FCC 's recent crowing about net neutrality — even for mobile providers — and in reaction to the FCC 's investigation as to what exactly when down between AT&T , Apple and Google with Google Voice .
This is AT&T showing Mr. FCC that they play nice and fair , and pretty please , do n't drop some government regulation on their head , like mandated neutrality .
It also makes them look better as they point the finger at Google Voice for not following net neutrality conventions .
Advertisement
A couple of points to add : This is specifically about VoIP ( very likely because of the FCC's Google Voice curiosities ) , so there 's nothing to fapfapfap about on the SlingPlayer or tethering front .
While Skype is the most immediate woohoo context that comes to mind , we 're actually more interested now in the possibility of an app that is even more targeted to letting you get over on AT&T and replace your voice minutes with data for phone calls .

Whatever the cause or motivations , we 're just glad to see it happen , finally .
Now we 've just gotta wait for the apps to catch up .
AT&T EXTENDS VOIP TO 3G NETWORK FOR IPHONE DALLAS , October 6 , 2009 - AT&T * today announced it has taken the steps necessary so that Apple can enable VoIP applications on iPhone to run on AT&T 's wireless network .
Previously , VoIP applications on iPhone were enabled for Wi -Fi connectivity .
For some time , AT&T has offered a variety of other wireless devices that enable VoIP applications on 3G , 2G and Wi-Fi networks .
AT&T this afternoon informed Apple Inc. and the FCC of its decision .
In late summer , AT&T said it was taking a fresh look at VoIP capabilities on iPhone for use on AT&T 's 3G network , consistent with its regular review of device features and capabilities to ensure attractive options for consumers .
" iPhone is an innovative device that dramatically changed the game in wireless when it was introduced just two years ago , " said Ralph de la Vega , president and CEO , AT&T Mobility & Consumer Markets .
" Today 's decision was made after evaluating our customers ' expectations and use of the device compared to dozens of others we offer . "
AT&T allows customers to download or launch on their wireless devices a multitude of compatible applications directly from any lawful Internet website .
Additionally , because AT&T uses GSM technology , the most pervasive and open wireless technology platform in the world , we support customers using any GSM phone that works on AT&T 's frequencies .

Rhode Island will receive US$ 90 million in funding from the United States federal government to support unemployment benefits in the state .
Rhode Island 's Department of Labor and Training stated on Wednesday that it requested the line of credit because the account utilized to provide funding to unemployed individuals in the state had decreased to only $ 2 million ; enough to last only a few days .
Unemployment insurance customers will not experience any delays in receiving their weekly payments .

The Last Block in Harlem : A Review
-- Christopher Herz , " The Last Block in Harlem " -- Joan DidionI do n't think there is a realistic solution to the problem of " gentrification , " the process by which a neighborhood with a bad reputation becomes " cool , exciting , and real , " causing the prices to shoot up and causing the displacement of long - time residents .
It is frustrating to watch beloved things change , and perhaps the best we can hope for is to seize the present and to be constantly aware that nothing in this world is permanent .
OR IS IT ?
What do the pre-Socratic philosophers say ?
Thales says that neighborhoods with a bad reputation are all just water , changing and flowing like melting wax into different forms with the passage of time .
Alternatively , Anaximander says that neighborhoods with a bad reputation have no substance , and that gentrification occurs as a result of necessary cosmic differentiation : things must always become their opposite .
Pythagoras says gentrification is all about numbers .
Demographics .
Wages .
Rents .
Heraclitus says gentrification is all about fire .
All things are in perpetual flux , and neighborhoods with a bad reputation that originate from primordial fire also return there .
Parminides declares that the reputation of a neighborhood is simply a point of view and that all matter is part of one solid , unchanging block .
You know , THE BLOCK .
Xenophanes calls this uncarved block " God . "
Empedocles says that a neighborhood with a bad reputation is constantly in the grip of two powerful abstract forces : love ( which keeps a neighborhood together ) and strife ( which tears a neighborhood apart ) .
And then there is Zeno , the philosopher of paradoxes ...
" The Last Block in Harlem , " by Christopher Herz , is a novel that tosses us -- like a big - eyed blinking immigrant -- into the dizzying and paradoxical nature of living in a neighborhood with a bad reputation that you grow to love , taking us on a journey through all the intellectual contortions that one must pass through as a privileged person moving to a place where the inhabitants cannot afford to leave .
The daily torments and joys ; the feeling of belonging to something big ; the misty overlay that we slap across grim Death Holes and praise as " hard " and " true " and " strong .
" A sexy place .
A place with a history we do n't share .
" The Last Block in Harlem " is a first - person account of a tiny section of Manhattan and a look at how it changes over time as a result of manipulation by a marketing copywriter ( the narrator ) who has quit his job as a result of the soul - crushing nature of his advertising work .
After finding himself unemployed , the narrator is given an old typewriter by his neighbor and begins to write down his block 's stories in an effort to do something " great . "
In order to get these stories , he spends each day going down to street level to sweep and to pick up trash , turning himself into a neighborhood fixture and a living symbol of a new era for Harlem .
Spurred on by advice from other local street - level eccentrics , such as " The Chicken and Rice Man " and " Crossing Guard Lita , " he gets involved in the serpentine world of block politics and sees how charisma , power , greed , and manipulation shape the neighborhood around him .
He decides he wants to be a part of it .
As he learns how his neighborhood works , he begins to see trouble on the horizon .
Real - estate development is pricing out his " new friends " and leaving them without homes or hope .
He realizes that the stories he has collected are powerful demographic data , and he comes up with a marketing plan to turn neighborhood kids into armies fueled by social responsibility , doing a deal with a local political boss to help showcase each block in Harlem as something special , variegated , and unique in order to protect them .
As his plan begins to work , he sees that he is merely being used and that his plan has warped into something else behind his back : a method to sell Harlem to the rich as a reconstructed and palatable neighborhood in which to buy property .
He realizes that by throwing himself whole - heartedly into a world that he insufficiently understands he has helped to do more damage to his community than he could have ever done through casual neglect .
He is able to leverage his newfound insights to do some damage control that helps keep his own block safe from development ( hence " The Last Block in Harlem " ) but the world around him peels away , revealing something unrecognizable .
After destroying everything good by trying to " save " it , he realizes he is alone , having ignored his one - true - love for the sake of going after his dream of greatness .
In the end , he inhabits a world of ghosts and the dead , unable to cope with the living world around him and the vibrancy of change , flux , and progress .
He is a tragic figure , sucked dry by thinking himself bigger and smarter than the world around him , and in the end , he finally sees his true place in the neighborhood 's lifecycle .
The protagonist of this story , however , is the block itself -- a block which grows and changes and achieves some kind of serenity by the story 's end .
The narrator is the agent of this change , but not the recipient .
Some may identify with him ; some may find him monstrous . "
The Last Block in Harlem " is a novel with narrative problems , but with so much heart , enthusiasm , and strangeness that one can't help but sit back , smile , and enjoy the story , even as the horrors mount and cynicism seeps in .
The block goes on , no matter who calls it home .
Herz 's self - published novel is pure unrefined fiction : messy , incomplete , and savage .
There is some polish here , but the guts are what shine .
Because of the strong story and clean , unaffected prose , the goofy and audacious plot is forgivable .
This is a novel that takes a hell of a lot of risks , and while it does n't exactly crack out a home run , it is a solid base hit and deserves notice by anyone interested in pluck .
This is a story unfiltered by the modern publishing machine and it crackles with weird energy that the machine would have siphoned away .
The book is only available from Herz 's own start - up publishing company , Canal Publishing .
I would never have known about " The Last Block in Harlem " if it were n't for an article in " Publisher 's Weekly " about Herz 's mission to sell his self - published book on the streets , not returning home each day until he managed to unload ten copies to NYC tourists and residents .
You can feel this same energy and restlessness in his prose .
His passion is undeniable , and it is this enthusiasm which keeps you turning the pages .
However , " The Last Block in Harlem " is raw , and not always in a good way .
It frequently feels undercooked and -- especially with regard to some of the romantic components -- perfunctory .
The best parts of this novel are the sections about political maneuvering on the block and the small scale victories of small people fighting for small stakes .
That 's life .
That 's a block .
The worst parts are the scenes between the narrator and his wife , a couple who are constantly proclaiming undying love and who strive for a creepy ideal marriage that crosses over into true grotesquerie with the novel 's conclusion .
The gothic horror elements of their love are neat , but they do n't really feel like they belong in this book .
In many ways , the book is classic drug narrative .
The drug is marketing .
The narrator tries to go sober , but he can't help himself .
He does n't realize that it is manipulation that is the problem , and that manipulation can never be washed clean by good intentions or used in the service of the greater good .
If I had been editing this work , I would have made the main character single .
Herz is clearly not a romance novelist and his big strengths lie in politics and social realism .
He has a Dickensian flair for characterization that animates his block and turns it into something real and palpable .
It would be hard to write a book that delivers more " on the ground " insight and analysis of the balky and complex situation he decides to confront , and for this reason , the book is damned important .
The characters may stumble to life clumsily and through occasionally interminable digressions that do not serve the ends of the grander narrative , but they live and breathe on the page nonetheless .
This is no small feat .
I enjoyed " The Last Block in Harlem " as a piece of art and as a spectacle .
I think Herz will only get better as a writer as he learns to control his gifts for dialog and the artful sidestory .
That being said , this is a perfect book for anyone who intends to move to New York and make a lot of changes .
Our dreams of greatness must always be tempered by patience , respect , and wisdom .
We are n't the only ones dreaming .
A Dallas police officer who hit a 10 year old boy on a bike while speeding to a call out without his siren or lights on has received a one day suspension .
Sr. Cpl. Michael Vaughn hit Cole Berardi in October 2008 has he rounded a blind bend doing 69 miles ( 110 km ) per hour on an unlit section of road .
The local police force naturally is n’t taking responsibility , with a spokesman telling local media ( also picture credit ) before the inquiry that “ It was just a dark road , not well lit…
This sounds like a combination of factors that caused the accident . ”
The officer driving the car received the one day suspension not for killing the boy , but for ( and you ca n’t make this stuff up ) violating policy on using lights and sirens .
The link between the " consumer " of healthcare and the provider has been broken for decades .
There is no " free market " in healthcare -- there is n't any market at all .
We live in a Kafka - esque nightmare system in which " some are more equal than others " and hundreds of thousands of dollars are lavished on worthless tests , procedures and medications for two reasons :
1. because there 's " free money " to pay the bills
2. so - called " defensive medicine " in which worthless tests are administered to stave off random ( sometimes valid , sometimes nuisance ) malpractice lawsuits .
There is a solution so simple and so radical that it is " impossible " ( and of course you 're reading it here ) : shut down insurance and all government entitlements , and return to the " golden era " of the 1950s when everyone paid cash for healthcare .
Here are the costs of childbirth as of 1952 at one of the finest hospitals on the West Coast , The Santa Monica Hospital :
And here are the obstetrical rates :
Having a baby cost $ 30 , which is today 's dollars is $ 244 .
A private deluxe room cost $ 23 or $ 187 in today 's dollars .
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistic 's inflation calculator , $ 1 in 1952 is $ 8.14 in 2009 dollars .
What does it cost to have a baby now ?
$ 10,000 ?
Or is it $ 25,000 ?
Who even knows ?
I know all the reasons why " costs had to skyrocket " : we 're getting so much better care now , right ?
Actually , as measured by death rates and any other metric you want to select , there is simply no way to justify a 40 - fold increase ( or is it 100 - fold ? ) in medical care costs .
The returns on all the " miracles of modern medicine " are in fact exceedingly marginal -- but nobody wants to talk about that .
In 1952 , if something awful happened and a patient died , here was the response : " We 're very sorry . "
Families were n't outraged ; they expected people to die and interventions were not expected to be miraculous every single time .
Doctor Kildaire and all his imitators on TV had not brainwashed the public into reckoning that if someone died , a mistake had been made .
They also had n't been brainwashed by the mental disorder known as " the American Legal System " into thinking that in every possible circumstance in life , there is liability , and the only question is where to pin it for the big bucks jackpot .
Stories about people suing doctors and hospitals for 5 times the value of a house ( $ 1 million in today 's money would have been $ 120,000 in 1952 , when you could buy a nice house for $ 20,000 ) simply did not exist in the 1950s .
The cultural mindset that someone somewhere must be at fault and it's a " right " to go after them did not exist .
Since insurance was limited , there was no " free money jackpot " to go after , either .
I know you 're probably outraged at the suggestion that " modern safety nets " of insurance and entitlements are the cause of our ills , but follow this idea through :
With no insurance or government program to bill vast sums , then every clinic , doctor and hospital in the U.S. would instantly go broke .
Someone would pick up the pieces for $ 1 or whatever the auction price happened to be and start charging people $ 50 for a visit to the doctor -- not a " co-pay " which was accompanied by a bill for $ 500 or $ 1,500 or $ 15,000 to an insurance company or the government , but $ 50 cash -- that would be the total cost .
People might decide they did not need to see the doctor every time they got the sniffles .
They might ask the doctor if an MRI was really going to help diagnose their problem or if it was gilding the lily .
As for malpractice , maybe the clinics / hospitals would be non-profits .
Go ahead and sue the bejabbers out of them -- they have no insurance and no cash .
Go ahead and win a huge settlement : you 'll never collect because there 's simply no money .
The non -profit folds and another one buys the clinic for $ 1 .
With no giant pot of " free money " to pillage , the pillaging goes away .
Hospitals which sought stupendous profits would presumably charge more , and hence would have fewer customers .
It would be up to the consumer .
The solution to malpractice is information , not lawsuits .
Based on my conversations with the M.D.'s who frequent this site , here are some simple policy / regulatory steps which would have very low end costs :
1. License all M.D. 's nationally so they do n't need to go through the absurd waste of time and money being licensed in multiple states .
2 . Make all information on clinics , hositals , surgeries , etc. public on the Web .
Those doctors willing to take on the very ill will have more patients die than those who avoid the risky cases ; it will be up to consumers to sort out the track record of the people who they choose to hire to attend to their health .
Something magical would happen to prices : they would drop to what people could afford to pay cash .
Yes , those wonderful folks in the pharmaceutical industry could list their drugs for $ 10,000 a dose , but few would be buyers .
Just as in other countries with no " free money " to tap , the price of that drug would quickly drop to $ 50 .
That , or the pharmaceutical companies can go bankrupt and let others fill the vaccum .
What would happen is simple : marginal care would vanish because few would be willing to pay for it .
The cost of an MRI in China is a tiny percentage of the cost of an MRI in the U.S. , and the machine and training of the technicians is the same ; so why does it cost 25 times more for an MRI here ?
Because there 's a pot of " free money " available to tap .
If the entire system collapsed and everyone paid cash , the cost of an MRI would be $ 100 or so , regardless of any other conditions .
Or , the owners of the MRI machines could declare bankruptcy , sell the machines at auction and let someone else provide the service to those who decided it was worth the expense .
But what about the " poor people " who can't afford medical care now ?
Well right now they have to stand in line at emergency rooms -- the most wasteful , inefficient system possible .
Even " poor people " can afford a few dollars -- there 's endless excuses provided yet how many " poor people " have cell phones , eat costly fast - food , do costly illegal drugs , etc. etc .
Everybody has choices ; we 're not all deranged , and for those who are deranged , then clearly the government will have a role in their care when it exceeds the capacity of their family or if they have no family .
Everybody 's got an excuse in our current system , and perhaps that 's why it is morally and financially bankrupt .
The U.S. ( and certainly not Santa Monica ) was not a Third World nation in 1952 ; people did not feel their healthcare was deficient or poor .
There was simply no money to pursue marginal returns except perhaps for a few millionaires seeking exotic treatments .
Fine , it 's their money ; most died right along with the rest of us and at about the same lifespan .
As for " overall health " of the populace : what with the " diabesity " epidemic out of control due entirely to lifestyle changes , it 's hard to say we 've gotten 50 times healthier as a result of our healthcare costs rising 50 - fold .
When it comes right down to it , the current system is based on this premise : the average American is too dumb to figure out healthcare for themselves and so we need a gigantic structure of " experts " to figure out what should be done and what it should cost .
It 's not even really " insurance " because everyone gets old , ill and then dies .
This has resulted in the most brutally inefficient and even cruel system possible , one in which the very elderly are milked for hundreds of thousands of dollars of " healthcare " in the last days or weeks of their lives while tens of millions get no care at all except at the emergency room .
Since no one takes responsibility for their own health or healthcare costs , then people take poor care of themselves and thus many of our ills are self - inflicted .
People save little to nothing for emergencies because they 've learned to expect someone , somewhere , to pay for their healthcare .
( It 's a " right . " Really ?
At whose expense ?
The Chinese who buy our debt ? )
I know , I know -- going to a market / cash system is " impossible . "
But the irony is that 's where we 'll be in a few years , regardless of what anyone thinks or wants : " healthcare " in its present incarnation will bankrupt the nation just as surely as the sun rises .

I woke up from a nap to a loud pop and a smell of burning plastic .
The source turned out to be one of the most precious and important to me digital devices : a ReadyNAS NV + , a small silver box with over a terabyte of hard drives that store my backups , music , and photos .
Network attached storage ( NAS ) is an engineering compromise .
It ’s a storage solution that lets you keep a bunch of drives in a self - contained device .
It ’s redundant : you can lose a drive ( which is a statistical certainty ) and not lose your data .
There are also handy usb ports that let you connect usb drives and a button to run backup jobs onto these drives .
It also serves as a print server , and in theory it can be used as a streaming media server .
On the other hand it ’s slow ( gigabit networks are not fast enough when you need gigs of data fast ) , a complete nightmare to use with photo managers like Picasa , and an even worse nightmare if you want to use it as a Time Capsule .
I ’ve spent a lot of time babysitting my ReadyNAS NV + : changing the defective RAM that it shipped with , updating the buggy firmware , finding the right drives for it ( some do n’t have the right temperature sensors ) .
Do n’t get me started on what it took to make it work with Mac ’s Time Machine .
And after all that , the one box that was supposed to keep my precious digital archives safe was smoking .
This was preceeded by a few days of weird performance issues and a couple of hangs .
The power supply finally died a horrible death , and I realized that once again I was falling victim ( or “ mugu ” as Nigerians say ) to faulty capacitors .
According to Wikipedia , the name of this phenomenon is “ Capacitor Plague “ .
There is an epidemic of failure in electrolytic capacitors from certain shady manufacturers .
Electrolytic capacitors are usually found in power supplies .
They are little aluminum cylinders filled with special film and electrolytic liquid or gel .
Power supplies get very hot , and the liquid part of the capacitors , the electrolyte , always wants to either dry up or explode .
The formula for the electrolyte is very hard to get right .
The rumor is that one or a few companies resorted to industrial espionage to steal electrolyte formulations .
They were n’t entirely successful – they either got an incomplete formula or just plain Brawndo .
Spectrum Online did some digging :
“ According to the source , a scientist stole the formula for an electrolyte from his employer in Japan and began using it himself at the Chinese branch of a Taiwanese electrolyte manufacturer .
He or his colleagues then sold the formula to an electrolyte maker in Taiwan , which began producing it for Taiwanese and possibly other capacitor firms .
Unfortunately , the formula as sold was incomplete .
“ It did n’t have the right additives , ” says Dennis Zogbi , publisher of Passive Component Industry magazine ( Cary , N.C. ) , which broke the story last fall .
According to Zogbi ’s sources , the capacitors made from the formula become unstable when charged , generating hydrogen gas , bursting , and letting the electrolyte leak onto the circuit board .
Zogbi cites tests by Japanese manufacturers that indicate the capacitor ’s lifetimes are half or less of the 4000 hours of continuous ripple current they are rated for . ”
Wastefulness of today ’s society masks the problem : most people do n’t perform autopsies on their dead $ 70 DVD players or $ 500 computers , they just use that as an excuse to buy the new hottness .
The techies with ( or without ) spare time and soldering skills do the following : fill bulleten boards with tales of saving their devices by soldering in new capacitors ; search for instructions on how to solder and purchase capacitors ; and curse creatively after doing it for the 5th time .
The unique thing about the capacitor plague is how easy it is to identify : the capacitors literally blow their tops , venting electrolyte through the special stress relief indentations .
It ’s also unique in that anybody with a soldering iron has a very good chance of fixing it : the caps are easy to locate and solder .
In the age when most electronic components are of the “ surface mount ” type ( the size of a sesame seed ) or chips with dozens legs as fine as silk , soldering in a two legged capacitor is very refreshing .
Here ’s a nest of capacitors from my busted power supply : two in the left corner are clearly popped , the one on the right is probably ok :
In the last couple of years the following devices that I own fell prey to faulty caps : a cheap off - brand dvd player , a speed control on my Dodge Caravan ’s air conditioner , a Netgear network hub , a huge and expensive Air King window fan , and now , my ReadyNAS .
The interesting thing is that the problem exists in both high end and low end products , as well as in high tech and low tech ones ( I did not know there were electronic components in the window fan ) .
I am out of warranty on my ReadyNAS because I bought it in May of 07 .
The following passage leads me to believe that the shitty capacitors are a problem that they are aware of and ( maybe ) fixed in newer releases of the hardware ( they could not offer a 5 year warranty if they used the same capacitors – they ’d just go broke ) .
“ Please be aware that ReadyNAS purchased prior to August 21 , 2007 carries a one - year limited warranty .
Extended warranty purchased for these ReadyNAS will be honored by NETGEAR .
ReadyNAS NV + and 1100 purchased August 21 , 2007 and later have a 5 - year limited warranty , and the ReadyNAS Duo has a 3 - year warranty . ”
The brand name of the popped capacitors reads “ Fuhjyyu ” .
It lead me to the an urban dictionary entry that says that Fuhjyyu is either
“1) Chinese word for feces .
or
(2) Brand name of abysmal quality capacitors that are installed on logic boards , switching power supplies and various other electronic components . ”
There ’s also a post from a guy who implores ReadyNas to stop using those capacitors .
Then there ’s badcaps .
net – a global capacitor gripefest that is too depressing to read .
You can see a nice gallery of busted caps over here
There are broader implications of this : coupled with the fragile lead free solder , leaky capacitors do n’t only cause kajillions of dollars of damage , but will also make electronics of our era impossible to use in the near future .
The aluminum in burnable cds and dvds are rotting too , destroying the record of our time .
As US jobless toll tops 15 million
Unemployment crisis shows the failure of capitalism
5 October 2009
The staggering figures released Friday on the US labor market demonstrate that what has developed since the Wall Street crash one year ago is not a conjunctural downturn or recession , but an historic assault on working class living standards .
The official unemployment rate for September was 9.8 percent , up from 9.7 percent in August , amid predictions that the jobless rate would pass the 10 percent mark and remain in double digits for at least the next year .
The US Labor Department reported a net loss of 263,000 jobs in September , far more than predicted by government and business economists .
Another 571,000 workers dropped out of the labor market entirely , not looking for work during the month because they saw no prospect of finding a job .
Despite the claims of economic recovery , the combined total of 834,000 workers either losing their jobs or giving up the search for work is comparable to the 700,000 - plus job losses recorded in January and February .
September marked the 21st consecutive monthly decline in jobs — the longest continuous drop in US employment since the Labor Department began collecting such figures in 1939 .
Some 15 million American workers are unemployed , nearly double the number out of work when the recession began at the end of 2007 .
The average duration of unemployment is 26.2 weeks , more than half a year , the highest figure since the Labor Department began such statistics in 1948 .
One third of the unemployed , more than five million , have been out of work for 27 weeks or more .
This is another Labor Department record .
In addition to those totally without work , another 9.1 million workers are classified as involuntary part - time , working far fewer hours a week than they need to sustain their living standards .
The combined total of unemployed , discouraged and involuntary part - time workers has surpassed 25 million — a number that , in absolute terms , far exceeds the jobless toll during the Great Depression of the 1930s .
Virtually every sector of the economy showed job losses in September , including 53,000 in government , mainly due to layoffs by states and cities .
Only one sector , health care , showed an increase — and this is the sector being targeted by the Obama administration and Congress for major cost - cutting , which will inevitably take the form of a reduction in jobs .
There are now six unemployed workers for every job opening in America .
A survey by the Business Roundtable , an association of corporate CEOs , said 40 percent of its member companies intended to cut their payrolls during the next six months , while only 13 percent planned an expansion .
More than one million Americans have filed for bankruptcy in the first nine months of 2009 , according to the American Bankruptcy Institute .
September saw a 41 percent increase over the same month in 2008 , with 124,790 cases .
The institute predicted that a total of 1.4 million people will file for bankruptcy by the end of this year .
The derisory response of the Obama administration and Congress to the jobs disaster is a limited extension of unemployment benefits .
By one estimate , 400,000 workers exhausted their unemployment benefits in August and September , and one million will do so by the end of the year .
In his weekly Internet address Saturday , President Obama said he was considering “ additional options to promote job creation . ”
The measures outlined by White House spokesmen consisted merely of extended unemployment benefits and tax credits for laid - off workers to buy health coverage under the COBRA program .
Obama touted his health care restructuring as a boon to business , saying “ small business owners want to grow their companies and hire more people , but they can’t , because they can barely afford to insure the employees they have . ”
The White House has rejected calls for a second stimulus package , and the same position was voiced by former Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan in an interview on the ABC news program “ This Week . ”
Two leading senators , Democrat Charles Schumer of New York and Republican John Cornyn of Texas , speaking on the same program , endorsed Greenspan ’s opposition to any new funding for job creation .
Maintaining unemployment at the highest levels since the Great Depression is a deliberate policy of both big business parties and the ruling class as a whole .
While Democratic politicians and union bureaucrats invariably blame the economic collapse , particularly in manufacturing , on foreign competition and imports , the jobs crisis is of global dimensions .
According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) , which groups the 30 largest industrialized nations , the jobless rate for all 30 countries will approach 10 percent in 2010 — just about the projected average for the United States .
Some 57 million people will be out of work by the end of next year — a number equivalent to the total population of France , Italy or South Korea .
The jobs crisis demonstrates the failure of the capitalist system — not only in the United States , but internationally .
Not a single capitalist government , in any of the OECD countries , has lifted a finger to create jobs or put the unemployed to work .
In each country , the ruling elite is using mass unemployment as a club against the working class , to enforce demands for the destruction of wages , benefits and working conditions .
The working class must fight these demands by putting forward its own program for the defense of jobs , which starts with the needs of the masses , not the profit requirements of big business .
Workers must take direct action against layoffs , short - time working and the shutdown of factories and offices , by occupying their workplaces , preventing their closure and appealing for the widest possible support from all working people .
This must be combined with the demand for a multi-trillion - dollar program of public works — instead of limitless handouts to the banks — to provide good - paying jobs and rebuild the social infrastructure , including homes , hospitals and schools .
The demand must be raised for immediate measures of relief , including full pay for all laid - off workers , at their previous salaries , and a ban on foreclosures , evictions , utility shutoffs and other measures by which the burden of the capitalist crisis is imposed on working people .
These demands must be placed within the framework of the political struggle for the socialist reconstruction of society .
Make the capitalists pay for the crisis , not the workers !
Revoke all bailouts to Wall Street !
Place the giant corporations and banks under public ownership and democratic control , with no salary higher than that paid to a skilled worker !
Reorganize economic life to serve the needs of the working people , not corporate profits !
Establish a 30 hour work week at 40 hours pay to guarantee a decent - paying job to every person who wants one !
The axis of this struggle is a break with the two big business parties and the building of an independent mass party of the working class , based on a socialist and internationalist program .

In recent years , the economic hardships that have crippled newspapers and hurt other media outlets have taken a disproportionate toll on science journalism .
Many news establishments , including CNN , have entirely eliminated their science staff , while others have severely curtailed coverage or handed it off to journalists with no science experience .
The net result is that the press officers of major universities , whose job is to help increase the public 's recognition of the research that goes on there , increasingly feel like they 're speaking to an empty room .
Their solution has arrived in the form of Futurity.org , a site that aggregates a selection of the releases they used to feed to the press .
We talked to Lisa Lapin of Stanford 's University Communications office and Futurity 's Jenny Leonard about the new effort .
Although the effort may have been started by the decline of science journalism , they emphasized that , although the Internet may be driving the decline in traditional science journalism , it 's also providing many new opportunities .
" The success of bloggers and social media sites show that people are taking an active role in finding their own news sources , " Leonard said .
" Futurity give us the chance to reach them . "
They 'll be reached by the same sort of material that university press offices are already producing , primarily press releases , with a sprinkling of material that might be used in internal publications or newsletters .
The material will come from a consortium of partner institutions that are members of the Association of American Universities , an organization of leading research universities .
Although it was inspired by problems with science journalism , Futurity will host news about research in the humanities and other areas , as well .
But Futurity is n't simply going to aggregate anything those institutions produce .
Instead , Leonard will have an editorial role , choosing the content she feels will be most interesting to the public and making changes to the text that she feels are appropriate , a job that may include toning down the university 's self - promotion .
" We 've ceded editorial control , " Stanford 's Lapin said .
" She [ Leonard ] will take out multiple self - references and make sure it 's news . "
Leonard says she views her role as " balancing the interest of those involved against the reader 's interests .
Doing this well is critical to Futurity 's efforts . "
Blurring lines , or responding to the blur ?
The quality of press releases , like the quality of scientific journalism , can be extremely variable , so a degree of editorial control seems essential .
Still , Futurity may raise fears that the line between promotional materials meant for journalists and actual journalism will be further eroded .
According to both Lapin and Leonard , it 's too late for that — the lines have already been blurred .
It 's easy to see that they have a case .
For an illustrative example , it 's worth looking at some of the coverage of the neurobiology of torture story ( our own is here ) .
The coverage at Science Daily and PhysOrg is eerily similar , with many instances of identical phrasing , starting with the title itself .
That 's because both are using mildly edited versions of a press release made by the publisher , Cell Press , which was available via Eurekalert , an aggregator of science press releases .
If others are presenting science press releases as news , why should n't the universities cut out the middleman ?
Or , more accurately , middlemen , as the handling of science press releases has become increasingly complex .
Lapin described how Stanford has to pay for the right to post its releases to Eurekalert , but can host them on its own website essentially for free , given the marginal costs of increased traffic .
And Stanford 's research news site apparently gets hundreds of thousands of hits a month , with a recent release seeing over 60,000 hits .
That sort of traffic , she said , has led some private companies to approach the university about getting exclusive access to its content so that they could profit from the traffic .
It 's not simply the fact that press releases are being presented as journalism , either — in many cases , they 're being prepared by former journalists .
Because of the shrinking job market for these specialists , many of them are finding employment in the same places they used to work with in order to arrange coverage of science news .
" Lots of the staff used to work in journalism , " Leonard said .
" They often do a fantastic job . "
So , it 's clear that there 's a public interest in the research stories provided by universities , those stories are often accurate and well produced , and getting them to the public is in keeping with the general educational mission of the universities .
To an extent , Futurity seems to little more than an effort to organize a process , the presentation of press releases as news stories , that was already happening .
And some of its features , like direct links to the journal articles that the news stories are describing , are a very positive difference between it and many actual news sites .
Still , the process of preparing a press release is necessarily self - promotional , and no amount of editing is going to be able to fully eliminate that .
Futurity does credit the press office as the source of the material , but it could do a better job of describing the origin of the content on site , so that the public would be reading with the appropriate caution .
That said , Science Daily and PhysOrg do more or less the same thing , and they certainly do n't warn their readers .
This may be a case where it 's tempting to hold universities to a standard we do n't hold a private business to .
She may have been keeping a low profile recently , but Kylie Minogue certainly knows how to get tongues wagging again .
The pop princess was spotted out in London yesterday in a figure - hugging crocheted dress which clung in all the right places .
The 41 - year - old looked her sexiest for some time - and gave fans more than a cheeky glimpse of that famous bottom .
Kylie has been enjoying a series of romantic getaways with Spanish boyfriend Andres Velencoso recently .
The pint - sized star admitted she drove him crazy by studying bed linen every time they stayed in a different hotel .
She said : ' He 's always going " What are you doing ? " when I 'm at the end of a bed looking at the bedclothes close - up .
' I 'm sure he 's an influence because we do a lot of travelling together .
It 's not that difficult to get inspiration ... so many hotel rooms around the world , different restaurants .
' Minogue is about to embark on her first ever tour of the U.S. and Canada , which will kick off in California on September 30 .
The six - city For You , For Me tour takes in Los Angeles , Las Vegas , Chicago and Toronto .
The veteran performer has longed to tour the U.S. and said she was ' thrilled ' finally to have the opportunity .
' I ’ve wanted to tour in America and Canada for years and know that fans have been waiting a long time for this , ' said Minogue .
( CNN ) --
She had come alone to the Richmond High School homecoming dance , gorgeous in a sparkling purple dress and faux diamond baubles .
The DJ played salsa , meringue , rap .
When the teenager disappeared , her friends thought she had gone home early .
Except she never said goodbye .
" We were going to go look for her , " said Kami Baker , 16 , a junior at the school .
The next day , Baker learned the ugly truth about what had happened to her friend .
According to police , she had been gang raped and beaten for almost 2 ½ hours and left unconscious under a bench shortly before midnight Saturday night .
" I busted up crying , " Baker said .
The campus incident in the Bay Area city north of Oakland has shaken students and their families .
Baker was one of many people connected to the school and the community who lashed out at officials at a public safety hearing Wednesday .
Baker blamed school district officials for not doing enough to protect her school -- and her friend .
She said none of the four officers who were at the homecoming dance was patrolling the school premises even though there were a dozen young men hanging out just a few feet from the gym entrance .
She says school officials chose not to take any action .
" I looked outside of the gym and I saw 12 to 15 guys , sitting there , with no IDs , " Baker said at the hearing .
" The officers -- not only did they not check the IDs of those students or men sitting outside of of our campus , but the security officers who are employed here did no ... checking either .
The assistant principal looked outside and actually saw those men , and did nothing about it . "
Baker took the podium with her younger sister , Barbie , a freshman at the school , who had spent a chunk of Saturday evening with the rape victim .
" This story has disrupted the school 's morale greatly , including my own .
I am friends with the girl , " Baker said .
" When I started here , I felt extremely unsafe and so did she , due to the lack of police officers and security officers . "
Baker later described the 15 - year - old girl as a churchgoer who struggled to fit in at Richmond High .
Four teenagers were arraigned Thursday on charges connected to the incident .
Cody Ray Smith , described by the court as over 14 years old , pleaded not guilty to charges of rape with a foreign object and rape by force .
Two other juveniles , Ari Abdallah Morales and Marcelles James Peter , appeared together with Smith at the Contra Costa County Superior Court , but did not enter a plea .
The court described Morales as under 16 , and did not give an age for Peter .
All three juveniles , who wore bulletproof vests at the hearing , were charged as adults .
A fourth individual , Manuel Ortega , 19 , appeared separately without an attorney and did not enter a plea .
He did not wear a protective vest .
Another adult who was arrested has a different court date .
As many as 10 people were involved in the assault in a dimly lit back alley at the school , police have said .
Another 10 people watched , without calling 911 , police said .
The victim was released from a hospital Wednesday , police said .

Is there such a thing as self - CPR ?
According to this viral rumor circulating since 1999 , you can save your own life during a heart attack ... by coughing .
This is disputed by experts with mixed opinions .
The Genesis of Cough - CPR
The message below gives the impression that the technique described was endorsed by Rochester General Hospital and Mended Hearts , Inc. , a heart attack victims ' support group .
It was not .
Although the text was first published in a Mended Hearts newsletter , the organization has since retracted it .
Rochester General Hospital played no part in the creation or dissemination of the message , nor does it endorse its contents .
While " cough CPR " ( referred to in some variants as " self - CPR " ) is a real procedure occasionally used in emergency situations under professional supervision , it is not , however , taught in standard CPR courses , nor do most medical professionals presently recommend it as a " life - saving " measure for people who experience the most common types of heart attack while alone ( note : see update below ) .
Do Doctors Endorse Cough - CPR ?
Some doctors say they 're aware of the " cough CPR " technique but would only advise it under very specific circumstances .
For example , in certain cases where a patient has abnormal heart rhythms , coughing can help normalize them , according to Dr. Stephen Bohan of Brigham and Women 's Hospital in Boston .
However , most heart attacks are not of this type .
Dr. Bohan says the best course of action for a typical heart attack victim is to immediately take an aspirin ( which helps dissolve blood clots ) and call 911 .
This is a case where a nugget of truth has apparently been misunderstood and misrepresented to the public , though not intentionally .
A chapter of Mended Hearts published it without proper research .
It was then reprinted by other chapters and eventually found its way into email form .
Darla Bonham , the organization 's executive director , issued a statement afterward which read , in part :
I 've received email from people all across the country wanting to know if it is a valid medically approved procedure .
I contacted a scientist on staff with the American Heart Association Emergency Cardiac Care division , and he was able to track a possible source of the information .
The information comes from a professional textbook on emergency cardiac care .
This procedure is also known as " cough CPR " and is used in emergency situations by professional staff .
The American Heart Association does not recommend that the public use this method in a situation where there is no medical supervision .
As with all medical rumors , the most prudent course of action is to verify the information with your own doctor or other medical professional before acting upon it or sharing it with others .
A Second Opinion on Cough - CPR
In September 2003 , four years after this email rumor began circulating , Polish physician Tadeusz Petelenz presented the results of a study which he said demonstrates that cough CPR can indeed save the lives of some heart attack victims .
While not immediately embraced by all the members attending the European Society of Cardiology meeting where Petelenz spoke , the findings were characterized by some as " interesting . "
At least one heart specialist , Dr. Marten Rosenquist of Sweden , found fault with the study , objecting that Petelenz had presented no evidence that the subjects had actually experienced cardiac arythmias .
He called for further research .
Sample Email About Cough - CPR attribute to Rochester General Hospital
Here 's a forwarded email text on the topic circulated in 1999 :
This one is serious ...
Let 's say you 're driving home ( alone of course ) after an unusually hard day on the job .
Not only was the work load extraordinarily heavy , you also had a disagreement with your boss , and no matter how hard you tried he just would n't see your side of the situation .
You 're really upset and the more you think about it the more uptight you become .

HOW TO SURVIVE A HEART ATTACK WHEN ALONE
Since many people are alone when they suffer a heart attack , this article seemed in order .
Without help , the person whose heart stops beating properly and who begins to feel faint has only about 10 seconds left before losing consciousness .
However , these victims can help themselves by coughing repeatedly and very vigorously .
A deep breath should be taken before each cough , and the cough must be deep and prolonged , as when producing sputum from deep inside the chest .
A breath and a cough must be repeated about every two seconds without letting up until help arrives , or until the heart is felt to be beating normally again .
Deep breaths get oxygen into the lungs and coughing movements squeeze the heart and keep the blood circulating .
The squeezing pressure on the heart also helps it regain normal rhythm .
In this way , heart attack victims can get to a phone and , between breaths , call for help .
Tell as many other people as possible about this , it could save their lives !

Most British manufacturers and retailers including Boots , Morrisons and Waitrose have done little to limit the environmental damage done by the production of the world 's cheapest vegetable oil , according to research published today .
In a survey of leading European food and household firms , the World Wide Fund for Nature ( WWF ) said that only Sainsbury 's , Marks and Spencer and a handful of other companies had made substantial progress towards sourcing sustainable palm oil .
Continental retailers came out worst in the survey of 59 firms , with many French , German and Dutch chains making no effort to prevent the huge problems caused by the oil 's production .

Palm oil is found in chocolate , biscuits , cereals , soap , shampoo and dozens of other products , but is also widely used as a bio - fuel for cars and power stations .
While providing much needed income for developing countries , it has led to severe deforestation , human rights abuses and loss of endangered wildlife in Malaysia and Indonesia .
Orangutans , the arboreal great apes now restricted to the islands of Borneo and Sumatra , are threatened with extinction because of the loss of their habitats .
Deforestation – of which palm oil is the biggest cause in Indonesia and Malaysia – also generates 20 per cent of global climate change emissions .
The WWF disclosed that 40 of the 59 companies had not bought any oil certified sustainable by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil ( Rspo ) – which sets environmental standards for the £ 16 bn - a - year industry , the most important of which is a ban on planting new oil palms in virgin forests .
Of 25 UK companies , 14 had not bought any Rspo oil – Aldi , Associated British Foods , Croda international , Boots , Warburtons , Britannia Food Ingredients , Waitrose , Morrisons , Jordans Ryvita , Northern Foods , Reckitt Benckiser , Co-op , Premier Foods and Tesco .
Out of a maximum of 29 points , WWF scored them between 0 and 16 .
However , seven British firms were among the best 10 performers Europe - wide , including Sainsbury 's , Marks and Spencer and Cadbury .
Among foreign companies , Nestlé , ranked mid-table , this week committed to switching to 100 per cent Rspo oil by 2015 .
The WWF said it hoped the naming and shaming would raise awareness of palm oil 's environmental damage and encourage companies to act .
Presently , companies have bought only 19 per cent of the 1.3 m tonnes of certified oil .
The WWF believes palm oil will grow in importance in coming years , because production is forecast to rise by up to 10 per cent annually and the only place palm oil can be grown is in the tropics , home to the world 's great rainforests .
" The top - scoring companies have shown what 's possible , with some buying substantial quantities of certified oil , but now it 's a question of whether the majority will follow , " said Adam Harrison , WWF 's senior policy officer for food and agriculture .
" If they do , it will transform the market , giving producers the confidence to grow more sustainable palm oil .
If they do n't , there will be grave consequences for the environment . "
Waitrose said it recognised the importance of the issue and expected to make progress in the next 12 - 18 months , while Morrisons said : " We are working with our suppliers to ensure palm oil used as an ingredient in our own label products comes from sustainable sources . "
Lidl said it was working towards securing a sustainable supply by 2015 , while Warburtons said that in addition to joining the Rspo it would take advice from the WWF on sustainable sourcing .
Boots said it used only a small amount of derivatives that were not commercially available , " hence our score in this report which we do not feel reflects our commitment to this subject " .
Justin King , chief executive of Sainsbury 's , which sources sustainable oil for its fish , biscuits and soap , said : " Much more work now needs to be done , and it is vital that other retailers and food manufacturers follow our lead to ensure that the rainforests are preserved for future generations . "
The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil
* Established in 2003 , the RSPO aims to stop environmental damage from palm oil .
But not enough companies are paying the extra 10 to 20 per cent per tonne for this greener supply .
* By mid-2009 , certified plantations were able to produce 1.75 million tons – one third of the EU 's palm oil use .
By this month , only 200,000 tonnes had been traded – 5 per cent of Europe 's annual consumption .
After working on a few Java / JEE projects , your workspace really gets to become fat .
I mean , it gets very very slow .
This is because you opened and closed a lot of projects with a loooot of resources in it .
Also because every time you press that Ctrl + Shift+R , or Ctrl + Shift +O , or Ctrl + T in java or run some free text search , You are loading up eclipse 's cache of index .
Also JDT slowly keeps a track of it , for Type Hierarchies , Implementations .
The easiest way is to open a workspace for every unrelated project .
Keep it small .
But sometimes , it is not possible .
Dependencies .
Ease to work with one monolithic workspace ( opening and closing projects - yea that 's me ) .
For these cases ,
You could just clean up thefolder in your workspace .
If you are feeling even lucky , go ahead , clean up ... a. a. aa .
Wait ,
That folder , contains all that local history of files you have changed - LOCALLY ( NOT cvs or svn history ) .
So if you are working on some files without committing them in and rely on the local history to go back , Do not do this step .
Afghan journalist Sultan Munadi was abducted by the Taliban together with British journalist Stephen Farrell and killed in the Nato - led raid that freed the Briton .
In a recent blog entry for the New York Times , Mr Munadi spoke of the love he had for his country .
Mr Munadi said he had lived through the darkest days of his country I grew up in the Panjshir Valley , in a place that is a three - hour walk from the nearest road .
We do n't have a lot of iron there , we do n't have concrete , we do n't have these artificial things .
It 's a completely natural place .
I grew up there , and when I went to Germany to study for a master 's degree in public policy I saw concrete everywhere , a lot of glass , asphalt and artificial things .
It was depressing , very boring for me .
I was dreaming of the dust , I was dreaming of nature in my country , of the mountains .
It 's really nice to be back for a while , it 's very hard to be away for two years .
If I were a teenager , it would be easier to be integrated into the society in Germany , but now at the age of 34 , it is difficult to be away from my country .
I would not leave Afghanistan .
I have passed the very darkest times of my country , when there was war and insecurity .
I was maybe four or five years old when we went from my village into the mountains and the caves to hide , because the Soviets were bombing .
Being a journalist is not enough ; it will not solve the problems of Afghanistan
Four die in Afghan rescue mission I have passed those times , and the time of the Taliban when I could not even go to Kabul , inside my country .
It was like being in a prison .
Those times are past now .
Now I am hopeful of a better situation .
And if I leave this country , if other people like me leave this country , who will come to Afghanistan ?
Will it be the Taliban who come to govern this country ?
That is why I want to come back , even if it means cleaning the streets of Kabul .
That would be a better job for me , rather than working , for example , in a restaurant in Germany .
Being a journalist is not enough ; it will not solve the problems of Afghanistan .
I want to work for the education of the country , because the majority of people are illiterate .
That is the main problem facing many Afghans .
I am really committed to come back and work for my country .

The four most recent presidential approval polls :
Gallup ,
10/8 - 10/10 :
56 %
CBS News ,
10/5 - 10/8 :
56 %
Ipsos / McClatchy ,
10/1 - 10/5 :
56 %
Associated Press / GfK , 10/1 - 10/5 :
56 %
Got that ?
That 's the four most recent polls having the president at 56 % .
For some historical perspective , even Reagan had fallen to 48 % by November of his first term .
On Friday 's " Hardball " , Chris Matthews mentioned the Associated Press poll - the response from Charlie Cook on his panel was that it was simply an " outlier " .
As of today , there are three more with the exact same numbers .
The question is , when will the media start reporting the resurgence of Obama 's poll numbers ?
And will they also report that within the data of these four most recent polls is the fact that clear majorities now support both his handling of health care reform and the economy ?
We 'll see on Monday .
Mr. Ezzedine , 49 , remains a mysterious figure .
He was best known as the owner of Dar el - Hadi , a publishing house that specialized in religious titles and is based in the heart of Dahieh , Beirut ’s Shiite southern suburb .
More recently , in 2007 , he founded Al Mustathmir , a financial institution based in Beirut that focused on money management .
He was known as a deeply religious and charitable man , with a gift for winning people ’s friendship .

It is still not clear what happened to the money , according to a judicial official with knowledge of the case who spoke on condition of anonymity , saying he was not authorized to comment publicly .
Mr. Ezzedine , who is now in jail awaiting trial , invested in metals , oil and other commodities in Africa and the Middle East , according to several people who knew him .
“ Gold , steel , iron , ” said the investor , who regularly bundled smaller contributions from dozens or even hundreds of villagers and then presented packages  anywhere from $ 100,000 to $ 500,000  as a single investment to Mr. Ezzedine ’s assistants .
“ Every time , I ’d give them the money in a bag , and they ’d give me a check for the same amount . ”
He leaned forward and showed his cellphone , with a photograph on the screen of rows and rows of stacked $ 100 bills .
As he reeled off the project titles  zircon , titanium , African oil  the investor began to shake with melancholy laughter .
Two friends sitting across from him in his threadbare store  who also lost money with Mr. Ezzedine  laughed with him .
The laughs grew louder and louder , and soon all three men were collapsing into wild , helpless bouts of hilarity , tears forming in the corners of their eyes .
“ On the day we first heard , we met in the mosque , and we were laughing hysterically for 24 hours , ” the investor said .
He soon grew sober again .
“ I ’m telling you this like it ’s just a story , ” he said .
“ But for us , it ’s really hard .
We are expecting family problems , social problems .

Ben Firshman is the genius behind JSNES , a playable and fully - functioning Nintendo Entertainment System emulator written in pure JavaScript .
Craig interviews
Ben exclusively for SitePoint .
Craig Buckler : Hi Ben .
Tell us a little about yourself and what you do .
Ben Firshman :
At the moment , I ’m studying Computer Science at the University of Warwick , but as far as work goes , I ’m principally a Django / Python Web developer .
Last year , I worked on Django for Google ’s Summer of Code , and this summer I ’ve been doing Django development for Global Radio in London .
CB : Warwick ’s a great university for IT !
( Any guesses where Craig went ? ! )
How long have you been developing web pages and JavaScript in particular ?
BF : I first dipped my toes in Web development at quite an early age , perhaps 8 or 9 , experimenting with MS Frontpage on hosting provided by my ISP .
I was an inquisitive kid and needed to understand how things worked , so it was a natural progression to delve beneath the safety of a WYSIWYG editor and play around with the source .
After a brief grounding in BASIC and C , I recall starting backend development in PHP during my early teens .
As far as JavaScript development goes , it ’s a skill I ’ve developed alongside my other work .
The exception was a small chat application I wrote when Ajax was in its infancy .
At the time it was quite exciting that it did n’t have to refresh an iframe to update ; I wish I could find the code and put a date to it !
Apart from this , I ’ve only added spoonfuls of JavaScript sugar to my front - ends .
JSNES was a huge learning experience for me .
CB : Where did your inspiration to develop JSNES come from ?
BF : I stumbled across Matt Westcott ’s JSSpeccy and it sparked my imagination .
I have a tendency to get trapped by overly ambitious projects , and a JavaScript emulator was exactly one of those .
I played a NES for a brief period in my childhood , and based on some rigorous analysis of its speed in relation to the Spectrum ( they are more or less the same age ) , I thought it would be the best choice of platform .
That , and the fact there are vast numbers of emulators to gain inspiration from .
CB : Did you use any particular development tools or environment ?
BF : Nothing particularly fancy : my trusty copy of TextMate and Firefox 3 .
Firebug proved an invaluable tool for debugging and profiling ; nothing came close to its power at the time .
The new version of Safari has some shiny new development tools , but they do n’t quite hit the bar Firebug has set in terms of functionality .
CB : How long did it take to develop ?
BF : I spent a few months last year contemplating the idea and browsing the source of various NES emulators .
Once I found a suitable one to port ( vNES ) I had laid down the basics of a working emulator in a day or two .
After all , the early stages were just a huge selective copy and paste exercise .
From then on , it took 9 months of bug fixing and tweaking , culminating in the tiny fix enabling it to run at full speed on Chrome .
CB : It ’s an ambitious project — were there any tough technical hurdles or browser incompatibilities to overcome ?
BF : I did n’t hit any major hurdles .
The original only worked in Firefox 3.5 , but Safari 4 and the newer versions of Chrome solved the compatibility problems .
Although the earlier versions of those browsers supported the canvas element they did n’t allow direct manipulation of pixels with the imageData object .
There were only a few subtle differences between Java and JavaScript that caused problems , such as division between two integers returning a float in JavaScript .
CB : JSNES runs almost 10 x faster in Google Chrome and both the Mozilla and WebKit teams have been investigating the issues .
Why do you think Chrome is so much faster ?
BF : Interestingly enough , three independent problems originally caused bad performance on Chrome , Safari and Firefox .
Firefox has a complex issue to solve .
Firefox ’s TraceMonkey engine , as the name implies , uses a technique called tracing to compile blocks of code by attempting to work out what the possible paths of execution are .
Emulators branch heavily in traceable blocks such as loops and create a huge number of possible paths that could be followed .
As such , it ’s impractical to trace , so it runs without any of the optimization benefits .
There are a couple of bugs worth following if you are interested in the issue ( Bugzilla 509986 and 516264 ) .
The problem for Chrome was less critical .
For some reason , accessing the imageData object to directly manipulate pixels is very inefficient .
Simply minimizing the number of accesses caused the leap in performance .
Safari ’s performance issue has now been fixed , but the original cause was a completely different problem .
Some of the classes within the emulator had a huge number of properties ( the CPU and PPU for example ) , which caused the dictionary structure representing it not to be cached .
Accessing properties on those commonly used classes was inefficient , but this was recently fixed in WebKit ( changeset 48573 ) .
To answer the question , Chrome ’s JavaScript engine ( and Safari ’s to an extent ) is just far more efficient at running this sort of code .
But it originally ran at the same speed as Firefox and Safari because it had a slower canvas element .
CB : JSNES has attracted a lot of attention .
Has that been a positive or negative experience for you ?
Has Google thanked you for raising Chrome ’s profile ?!
BF : It has been quite an experience to have hundreds of thousands of eyes over my work and the response has been overwhelmingly positive .
In particular , numerous people have submitted patches for improving performance .
I owe great thanks to all of them !
Thankfully I have n’t received any takedown notices yet .
It ’s reassuring that emulators of obsolete systems are becoming widely accepted by major corporations .
Interestingly , I have n’t heard from Google .
But both Mozilla and the WebKit team have been in touch to try and fix the performance problems .
I suppose a cutting edge Web application running poorly in their browsers but not another is bad publicity for them .
CB : Do you have further plans for JSNES ?
BF : My next huge ambition is to get sound working .
That ’s quite a challenge because JavaScript has no direct sound support , but I ’m making headway .
If it ’s successful I hope it will open the doors to more interesting web audio applications .
I also attempted mouse support for Duck Hunt quite early on in development , but I could never get it working .
I would love to fix it although it makes the game tragically unchallenging !
There are also a number of performance improvements in the pipeline as well as more working games as the bugs get fixed .
CB : Are you working on any other exciting projects ?
JSPS2 perhaps ?!
BF : I have nothing specific in mind yet , but let ’s just say WebGL and Web workers will take JavaScript applications to a whole new level .
CB : Many thanks for your time and informative answers , Ben .
We ’ll all be watching JSNES and your next projects with interest .

During development of a new web application that required users to log in , we had problems with users being logged out too soon .
The cookies were configured to end when the sessions did , but the max life time given to sessions turned out to be completely ignored .
The application had a standard LAMP environment , the key element as we will see , being the OS : the Debian based distro Ubuntu Hardy .
How PHPs garbage collection handles sessions
The main issue behind our problem turned out to be garbage collection .
PHPs garbage collection also handles sessions .
This is necessary because sessions are usually stored as flat files at a given location , and since each session has a unique id they will accumulate into quite a large amount over time .
During the start up over every session , there is a chance the session garbage collection will run as well .
Session garbage collection deletes all session files if they are older than the set session max life time .
The default probability for a new session also running session garbage collection is one in a hundred , this probability is configurable in php.ini , along with the location of the session files .
The problem
The Ubuntu server running our web application was also running an additional application which did not always have the same PHP configuration .
Apache is fully capable of this when using virtual hosts – the point is , the max life time changes were not done in any of the php.ini files .
Despite of this , that is exactly were there is a clue to what was happening .
The PHP version we are using is an Ubuntu / Debian package , which has some changes to the original PHP default setup .
In all of the php.ini files , in the SESSION section just above the garbage collection probability setting , we found that the session garbage collection by default was actually turned off .
The reason given is Debians strict permissions on the default session save path .
Furthermore , the section informs that PHPs garbage collection has been replaced by a cron job .
A closer inspection of the cron job revealed this to be true , every half hour , it will look for a maxlifetime setting in all php.ini files it can find , see if it has found a value larger than its default of 24 minutes , and go on to delete all session files in the default session save path older than this value .
In our case our maxlifetime settings were not in either of the ini files , which means the default value of 24 minutes was effective .
The solution
The cron job calls / usr / lib / php5 / maxlifetime to determine how old sessions can be before they can be deleted , and in this file it is possible to set a new default max life time corresponding to the highest value set in either your web app or in an Apache virtual host configuration .
If you are uneasy with the OS entering territory on what arguably should be PHPs business , you can of course also remove or comment the cron job and activate PHPs session garbage collector instead .
Job levels wo n't rebound in state until 2013
Be prepared for a long haul .
California wo n't be returning to pre-Great Recession job levels until 2013 .
And it will have lost more jobs - over 1 million - than any other state in the union .
Almost twice as many as the next - hardest hit , Michigan .
This according to the latest forecast from IHS Global Insight , due to be released via Webcast today .
But the Tarnished State is not the only one projected to take a long time to recover .
Michigan , Ohio , Indiana , Rhode Island and Connecticut will have to wait until " after 2015 , " says the report .
That 's probably small comfort to California 's budgeteers as they wrestle with the state 's downward revenue projections .

Madoff - in - reverse :
An investment adviser sues his onetime client and wins .
Late last week , the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a $ 25.8 million award against Sandy Lerner and Leonard Bosack , the immensely wealthy co-founders of Cisco Systems Inc. , in favor of their one - time partner and investment manager , David Soward .
The couple had fired and then sued Soward for umpteen millions , claiming he had improperly documented two private loans he had taken out , along with a variety of other alleged misdeeds .
They also took all of Soward 's financial share of the partnership for themselves - a step way too far , an arbitration panel subsequently judged .
The panel also found the pair had " acted with malice and oppression , " which Soward 's lawyer , Daniel Sharp of San Francisco 's Folger Levin & Kahn LLP , translated for me as a " three - year scorched - earth campaign " against his client .
The panel , whose ruling was upheld by both a federal district court in 2008 and the Ninth Circuit last week , slammed Cisco 's co-founders with the whole nine yards - punitive as well as compensatory damages and attorneys fees .
Soward , who lives in San Francisco , has been unemployed for most of the six years he 's been fighting with Lerner and Bosack .
Who , after all , would prospective employers call for a reference , even though he made Cisco co-founders at least $ 280 million over the course of their 11 - year relationship , according to a court exhibit .
That seems not to have been enough for the couple , who are expected to file for a rehearing on the ruling .
" I got the full force of their take - no - prisoners attitude , " said Soward .
" It 's been a very difficult process . "

It is hard to think of a valid reason for Microsoft 's new Zune HD media player to exist .
Not that it is n't feature , spec and price competitive with Apple 's iPod , it 's just that being competitive is n't enough .
Microsoft needs a decisive win across the field of the media player battle and has little hope of achieving one .
Not in the next few years .
It 's not that I love my iPod so much -- and even with my iPhone I still use an iPod occasionally -- but the Zune has never gotten me very interested .
And I buy almost everything -- but never once a Zune .
I will stipulate for this discussion that the Zune is as nice a piece of hardware as an iPod .
And probably has been for a while .
Each seems to have a few feature or specification " wins " but neither knocks the other out .
Zune , however , clearly loses on ecosystem , at which Apple excels .
If you want access to the most content and applications , the best accessories , there is simply no comparison between Zune and iPod .
As a desktop application , iTunes can not be beat .
Windows Media
Player has lost ground and seems unable to gain it back .
So , regardless of how well Microsoft - - or any competitors -- does with hardware , Apple has such an embedded advantage that it will win in the marketplace .
I have previously suggested that Apple should be required to open its music store and iTunes software to other vendors ' hardware .
That would neutralize the desktop app and access to content as a major differentiator .
Given a more level playing field , other music players and smart phones , I am thinking Microsoft Zune and Palm Pre , could compete on their individual merits rather than against everything Apple has achieved .
Had Microsoft found the market position Apple enjoys there would have long ago been an investigation into its effect on competition .
Apple has played the underdog card so well -- and for so long -- that regulators are just beginning to change their sights from Redmond to Cupertino .
Harry McCracken has done a Zune hands - on and it does sound like a nice device .
However , in the world of music players , being nice is , well , nice .
Winning requires competition at a different level -- and one only Apple has conquered .
Sorry , Zune .
P.S. I do not mean this post as a slam against the talented people at Microsoft who created , market , do whatever , with Zune HD .
It looks like a great product , but a great product is n't enough anymore .
It is , however , the very best place to start .
Go kill Apple , make us proud .

The hard - hitting adverts , which are aimed at 15 to 19 - year - olds of African and African Caribbean heritage , are designed to combat a worrying growth in the number of young women being arrested and convicted of possessing weapons .
“ This year ’s campaign has been designed to tackle an emerging and concerning trend , ” said Detective Chief Superintendent Helen Ball , head of Trident , the Metropolitan Police unit that investigates gang shootings .
“ Those who store and carry guns for others are partly responsible for the crimes committed with those weapons .
The consequences for them , their families and their friends are not worth thinking about . ”
Police said Trident officers had charged 12 women with possessing a gun so far this year of which seven were teenagers .
That compares with 13 charged last year and two the year before .
One recent case saw a 16 - year - old girl from southeast London charged with possessing a gun with intent to endanger life and with supplying a firearm after a 9 mm
Browning self - loading pistol with one round was found in her bedroom .
The four - week campaign , which has the strap line “ Hide his gun and you help commit the crime , ” will run on radio , in cinemas and on billboards .
“ Sadly , young women have always been involved in carrying and storing firearms , ” said Claudia Webbe , chairman of Trident ’s Independent Advisory Group .
“ We are deeply concerned , however , that this involvement seems to be increasing and those who are involved seem to be younger and younger .
“ Vulnerable young women are sometimes pressurized into storing or transporting the weapons by men they know , or sometimes willingly do so . ”

The era when Jews were banned from living in different places has ended , " said Rabbi Waldman .
" Obama beware .
This insolence will bring about the downfall of the American leadership , " he said .
" Anyone who dares give an order to prevent Israeli life in Jerusalem or anywhere else in the Land of Israel is destined to fall . "

Yesha Council Director - General Pinchas Wallerstein said , " This week the American pressure reached new highs that are a shame to democratic societies .
We are brought here by America 's treatment of Israel as if it were a banana republic and its willingness to abandon us in order to gain the support of public opinion within the Islamic world . "
Yesha Council chairman Danny Dayan added , " We are here to call on the government to fend off US pressure to halt construction in Judea , Samaria and Jerusalem .
Not one construction plan has been approved since the inception of ( Prime Minister Benjamin ) Netanyahu 's government , yet the bulldozers are being readied to raze outposts .
" A government led by the Likud , Yisrael Beiteinu , Shas and Habayit Hayehudi cannot accept this .
Netanyahu should follow in the footsteps of his predecessors – from David Ben-Gurion , who established Israel despite pressure from the US , to Levi Eshkol , who launched the Six Day War in the face of American pressure , and Menachem Begin , who bombed the Iraqi nuclear reactor in defiance of US demands , " he said .
A display at Tate Modern has been withdrawn following a visit to the gallery by officers from the obscene publications unit of the Metropolitan police .
The display features a naked photograph of the actress Brooke Shields .
The pop artist Richard Prince first used the image in 1983 , by which time Shields was a household name , but the photograph itself was part of a set taken by Gary Gross seven years earlier , when she was only 10 .
Shields 's mother authorised the shoot for a fee of $ 450 , and the photographs appeared in a Playboy Press book entitled Sugar and Spice .
In 1981 Brookes launched an unsuccessful legal action aimed at preventing further usage of the pictures .
The story reveals the gaping divide between the culture of art in 21st century Britain and the culture of policing .
On one side the curators , who talk like this : " When Prince invites us to ogle Brooke Shields in her prepubescent nakedness , his impulse has less to do with his desire to savour the lubricious titillations that it was shot to spark in its original context … than with a profound fascination for the child star 's story . "
On the other side the police , who talk like this : " The officers have specialist experience in this field and are keen to work with gallery management to ensure that they do not inadvertently break the law or cause any offence to their visitors . "
You would n't go to an art gallery or a police station for beautiful prose ; nonetheless you would n't mind a bit of sense .
The curators should admit that , whatever Richard Prince had in his mind when he created the work , lubricious titillations are precisely what it will spark in many viewers .
On the other hand , the police have no business whatever ensuring that galleries do n't " cause any offence to their visitors " .
Who gave them the idea that gallery management was part of their job description ?
Well , we did .
Or , rather , parliament did , acting in our name through the " extreme pornography " clauses in the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 .
As Julian Petley showed in the March 2009 issue of Index on Censorship , these new measures remove the old distinction in the Obscene Publications Act 1959 between " pornography " and " literature " , leaving the police free to meddle in the moral maze of contemporary art .
They empower the state to ban material which is " grossly offensive " or " disgusting " .
There is no defence of artistic or cultural value .
This story breaks on the same day as news that the most banned books in American libraries include JK Rowling 's Harry Potter books , Philip Pullman 's His Dark Materials trilogy ( at number two ) and the true story of two male penguins at a New York zoo who form a couple and are given an egg to raise – And Tango Makes Three ( at number one ) .
Attempts to ban these books have been led by religious groups , who are , no doubt , deeply " offended " by their content , whether on grounds of sex , witchcraft or heresy .
The withdrawal of Prince 's work from Tate Modern is too close for comfort to the populist , mob-ruled approach to " gallery management " , which the Metropolitan police now seem to be espousing .
I 'm not particularly comfortable with this picture being displayed in a gallery that attracts huge numbers of children – particularly given Shields 's own objections .
But I 'm rather more uncomfortable with the idea that the police are equipped to curate art exhibitions .
Fantasy versions of urban life are on the rise , from a backwater , vamp - infested Louisiana town to Robert Rodiguez 's new privately - owned Black Falls .

[ The following is an exact transcript of this podcast . ]
Some people like to think there ’s something fated about who we fall in love with .
It ’s that perfect mix of attraction , compatibility , and of course timing .
But in some cases , fate may be taking its cues from birth control pills .
First , let ’s go over a woman ’s cycle and how that affects attraction .
When women are ovulating , their features change in ways that men unconsciously pick up .
So men are particularly attracted to women when they ’re fertile .
And it works the other way , too .
When a woman is fertile , she ’s more attracted to men with more traditionally masculine features and who are genetically dissimilar to her , or more compatible in terms of procreating .
Of course oral contraception changes a woman ’s hormonal cycles .
Her body thinks it ’s pregnant and does n’t go through ovulation - induced changes .
And in a study published this month in the journal Trends in Ecology and Evolution , researchers say that women on the pill do not show the ovulation - induced attraction to genetically dissimilar partners .
So they might be choosing men who are more genetically similar — which could lead to some of the problems with conception that have become increasingly common .
Because attraction is n’t fate .
It ’s chemistry .

A terrible disease that could drive many frogs to extinction appears to kill by interrupting the flow of nutrients through their normally porous skins , which ultimately causes their hearts to shut down , say scientists .
Until now , it was n't known how the disease , called chytridiomycosis , does its damage .
" Understanding the pathogenesis is fundamental to understanding this disease , " said Jamie Voyles , a James Cook University biologist and co-author of the paper published Thursday in Science .
" Now we can start to develop treatments for frogs in captivity .
If it works out , we could potentially treat frogs where outbreaks are happening .
We could perhaps help frogs get through the initial catastrophic declines . "
First identified in 1993 , chytridriomycosis — chytrid for short — is caused by Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis , a highly virulent fungus that remains in the environment , even after killing its amphibian hosts .
It does this with frightening efficiency :
In less than two decades , it has killed about 95 percent of all frogs in Colombia and Panama , and driven some 30 species in the Atelopus genus alone to extinction .
Frogs are especially vulnerable , but chytrid affects most amphibian species , and after being spread by the global trade in African clawed toads , is now found in every continent except Antarctica .
Though it's not the only threat faced by amphibians , who are also squeezed by climate change , habitat destruction and humanity 's harnessing of approximately one - half of Earth 's fresh water , chytrid is perhaps the worst .
Unless something can be done about it , many amphibians , whose evolutionary lineage can be directly traced to a time before birds or mammals or even dinosaurs , will almost certainly vanish .
Until now , it was n't clear how chytrid kills .
" It 's a fantastic paper , " said Paul Daszak , a disease ecologist with the Wildlife Trust who was not involved in the research .
" It finally clinches the cause of death .
This is n't any old disease ; it 's emerging on multiple continents , and is probably the most significant disease we 've ever seen in wildlife .
It 's a breakthrough . "
Chytrid has remained a mystery in part because amphibian researchers receive relatively little funding , but also because its victims ' bodies shut down so completely that it 's difficult to know the precise cause of death .
In earlier research on diseased frogs , Voyles ' team had noticed imbalances of electrolytes , the compounds that conduct electrical charges through cells .
In frogs as in humans , a healthy electrolyte balance is needed to keep the heart pumping .
Because amphibians absorb electrolytes through their skin , the researchers suspected that the fungus , which resides on their skin , was to blame .
To study the connection , they first measured electrolyte flow across the skin of infected green tree frogs , and found that it dropped by half as the disease progressed .
This produced a drop of 20 percent in blood levels of sodium and 50 percent in potassium , two key electrolytes .
Then the researchers implanted miniaturized cardiac activity recorders inside the chests of another group of frogs .
The monitors produced frog versions of electrocardiograms , readouts familiar to people who've had their hearts monitored .
When the frogs were infected , their cardiac systems malfunctioned in tandem with their falling electrolytes .
" Changes in sodium and potassium basically led to a failure of the electrical system .
This is exactly what we see in humans as well .
It 's a failure of the electrical system , leading to mechanical failure .
If you do n't have a normal electrical system pacing the heart , it wo n't pump blood , " said Wyatt Voyles , a University of New Mexico cardiologist and co-author of the study .
Exactly how the fungus interferes with electrolyte transport is unknown .
The researchers suspect it 's the result of direct cell damage , or the release of a fungal toxin .
" Helping us understand the cause of death is really a step forward , " said Louise Rollins - Smith , a Vanderbilt University microbiologist who studies amphibian immune systems .
She was not involved in the study .
Electrolyte supplements slightly prolonged the life of diseased frogs in the study , and Rollins - Smith said the findings may help scientists develop treatments for chytrid .
Though probably not practical at the ecosystem level , such treatments could be used on captive frogs bred to restore dwindling wild populations .
The research could also help researchers understand why some species or sub-species are especially resistant to chytrid , and help to guide conservation efforts .
But Jamie Voyles cautioned that stopping chytrid is n't enough to save amphibians .
" This disease is important , but it 's important to recognize that there are many threats .
Unfortunately , there 's no silver bullet . "

Emma had a piece and said it was good but opted for the left over ribs after that .
Sean and I scarfed the rest !!!
.
I had some frozen foccacia bread in the freezer that I used for the dough .
I rolled it out very thin and placed it on my pizza pan and grilled it for about 3 - 5 minutes .
I took it off , brushed with olive oil and added the topping ingredients .
I then placed it back on the grill for about 8 minutes .
The balsamic onions were the key , they were delicious .
This is definitely a pizza we will make again .

You may remember a couple of months back — during the Open Source Bridge conference — that Portland Mayor Sam Adams made a commitment to turn Portland into a “ hub for open source . ”
But conversing about a topic , as they say , is relatively easy .
Or to put it more bluntly : talk is cheap .
That ’s why it ’s incredibly heartening to see the City moving to get something on the books with a resolution that is designed to officially make Portland a more open city .
And if you care about open source — even remotely — it would be great to see you at the City Council meeting this Wednesday during the testimony and voting on the resolution .
“ Bottom line : the city government has unnecessarily been closed in proprietary software and has been a a laggard in using open source software , ” said Adams during his Open Source Bridge talk .
Now , the City is working to change that .
How ?
Well , they ’ve put together a resolution that formalizes their commitment to be more open — both with their data and the systems they use to manage the municipality .
If the resolution passes , not only will they work to make their efforts more transparent by opening City data to the outside world , they ’ll also make sure that open source choices are given consideration during purchasing decisions .
That , my friends , is a big deal .
And a step that will have Portland putting its money where its proverbial mouth is in regards to open source .
And making this step official — by making it a matter of public record — takes it out of “ yeah , Portland is kind of an open sourcey town ” to “ The City of Portland officially recognizes and strives to support the open source community . ”
And if the resolution passes , it becomes that official .
Wait a second .
What I am doing paraphrasing for you ?
You ’re a sharp cookie .
Let ’s just take a look at exactly what the resolution says .
The content of the resolution is as follows ( or you can download a PDF of the resolution ) :
Mobilize and expand the regional technology community of software , hardware and service professionals by promoting open and transparent government , open data , and partnership opportunities between the public , private and non-profit sectors , academia and labor
WHEREAS , the City of Portland is committed to engaging the community by working with citizens , soliciting their ideas , input , and creative energy ; and
WHEREAS , the City of Portland is committed to using technology to foster open , transparent , and accessible government ; and
WHEREAS , by sharing data freely , the City of Portland seeks to develop opportunities for economic development , commerce , increased investment , and civic engagement for Citizens of the Portland region ; and
WHEREAS , publishing structured standardized data in machine readable formats creates new opportunities for information from different sources to be combined and visualized in new and unexpected ways , for niche markets to be identified and developed , and for Citizens to browse , interpret and draw attention to trends or issues with greater efficiency ; and
WHEREAS the adoption of open standards improves transparency , access to public information , and improved coordination and efficiencies among bureaus and partner organizations across the public , non-profit and private sectors ; and
WHEREAS , the City of Portland seeks to encourage the local software community to develop software applications and tools to collect , organize , and share public data in new and innovative ways ; and
WHEREAS , Software applications and tools that enable Citizens to access , visualize , and analyze public information will promote greater civic engagement and encourage Citizens to provide feedback on local issues ; and
WHEREAS , the Portland region is a global leader of the Open Source Software industry , with leading foundations , businesses , and professionals located in and around Portland ; and
WHEREAS , supporting and encouraging the development of Open Source Software curricula in Portland area educational institutions will result in a “ Culture of Openness ” that will enable Portland to increase the momentum behind its efforts for the foreseeable future ; and
WHEREAS , Open Source Software can enable the City of Portland to use , copy , customize and redistribute software it deploys for government services ; and
WHEREAS , the City of Portland will consider Open Source Software as a potential alternative to existing commercial software solutions in its purchasing and contracting decisions ; and
WHEREAS , the City will promote the creation and continued evolution of innovative Open Source Software solutions to meet civic needs ;
NOW , THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED , that the Council of the City of Portland :
Directs the Bureau of Technology Services to :
Enter into agreements with our regional partners to publish and maintain public datasets that are open and freely available while respecting privacy and security concerns as identified by the City Attorney ; Develop a strategy to adopt prevailing open standards for data , documents , maps , and other formats of media ; Organize a regional contest to encourage the development of software applications to collect , organize , and share public data ; Establish best practices for analysis of business requirements in software review and selection processes , identify existing commercial software systems with licenses that are scheduled to expire in the near future , and encourage the consideration of Open Source Software in the review , replacement and continual improvement of business solutions ;
Work with Travel Portland and regional partners to promote Portland as a host city for leading Open Source Software conferences and related technology events , such as LinuxCon , Innotech , etc ; Directs the City ’s Purchasing Agent to notify and distribute all formal technology related purchasing and contract opportunities for publication and distribution by the Software Association of Oregon , Oregon Entrepreneurs Network and the open source community in addition to those public notice requirements required under Portland City Code 5.33.300 .
Show your support for open source
Even if you disagree with portions of the resolution , I think you ’ll have to agree that it ’s a good start .
And a step in the right direction .
What ’s more , I think it ’s an even stronger commitment to the open source community than the Portland Economic Development Strategy about which I was raving — because it names specific actions the City will take to resolve the issues .
Want to support it ?
Well , you ’re invited to the City Council meeting this Wednesday , September 30 , around 10:30 AM to witness the discussion of the resolution — and if you ’d like to provide testimony there might even be the opportunity to do that .
I ’m going to try to be there .
And I ’d love to see you there .
Where we can all keep our fingers crossed , together , that the City makes this commitment to open source and open data less lip service and more of a reality .

We already told you the Motorola Droid was going to launch on November 6th when a Google Search seemed to list that date in Verizon ads for the Droid .
But they pulled the ad quickly and hardly anyone has picked up on the happening .
Well we just posted about the BGR Preview and hudman5 in the comments made an interesting one :
Full page ad in the San Diego Union Tribune newspaper this morning says 11-06-09 .
So we followed up , and like a champ , hudman5 came through with the goods :
It should still be written in pencil but you can chuck your eraser in the trashcan .
I doubt you ’re going to see anything different than a Nov. 6th launch date or order date or whatever .
Told ya so !
Thanks Hudman5 !
I guess the classic printed newspaper DOES still have a purpose ;)
Touch screens are a great way to interact with applications on mobile devices .
With a touch screen , users can easily tap , drag , fling , or slide to quickly perform actions in their favorite applications .
But it 's not always that easy for developers .
With Android , it 's easy to recognize simple actions , like a swipe , but it 's much more difficult to handle complicated gestures , which also require developers to write a lot of code .
That 's why we have decided to introduce a new gestures API in Android 1.6 .
This API , located in the new package android. gesture , lets you store , load , draw and recognize gestures .
In this post I will show you how you can use the android . gesture API in your applications .
Before going any further , you should download the source code of the examples .
Creating a gestures library
The Android 1.6 SDK comes with a new application pre-installed on the emulator , called Gestures Builder .
You can use this application to create a set of pre-defined gestures for your own application .
It also serves as an example of how to let the user define his own gestures in your applications .
You can find the source code of Gestures Builders in the samples directory of Android 1.6 .
In our example we will use Gestures Builder to generate a set of gestures for us ( make sure to create an AVD with an SD card image to use Gestures Builder . )
The screenshot below shows what the application looks like after adding a few gestures :
As you can see , a gesture is always associated with a name .
That name is very important because it identifies each gesture within your application .
The names do not have to be unique .
Actually it can be very useful to have several gestures with the same name to increase the precision of the recognition .
Every time you add or edit a gesture in the Gestures Builder , a file is generated on the emulator 's SD card , / sdcard / gestures .
This file contains the description of all the gestures , and you will need to package it inside your application inside the resources directory , in /res /raw .
Loading the gestures library
Now that you have a set of pre-defined gestures , you must load it inside your application .
This can be achieved in several ways but the easiest is to use the GestureLibraries class :
m Library = GestureLibraries.fromRawResource( this , R.raw.spells ) ; if (!mLibrary.load ( ) ) { finish ( ) ; }
In this example , the gesture library is loaded from the file / res /raw / spells .
You can easily load libraries from other sources , like the SD card , which is very important if you want your application to be able to save the library ; a library loaded from a raw resource is read - only and cannot be modified .
The following diagram shows the structure of a library :
Recognizing gestures
To start recognizing gestures in your application , all you have to do is add a GestureOverlayView to your XML layout :
< android.gesture.GestureOverlayView android:id= " @+id/gestures " android:layout_width=" fill_parent " android:layout_height = " 0dip " android:layout_weight = " 1.0 " />
Notice that the GestureOverlayView is not part of the usual android .
widget package .
Therefore , you must use its fully qualified name .
A gesture overlay acts as a simple drawing board on which the user can draw his gestures .
You can tweak several visual properties , like the color and the width of the stroke used to draw gestures , and register various listeners to follow what the user is doing .
The most commonly used listener is GestureOverlayView .
OnGesturePerformedListener which fires whenever a user is done drawing a gesture :
GestureOverlayView gestures = ( GestureOverlayView ) findViewById(R.id.gestures ) ; gestures.addOnGesturePerformedListener(this ) ;
When the listener fires , you can ask the GestureLibrary to try to recognize the gesture .
In return , you will get a list of Prediction instances , each with a name - the same name you entered in the Gestures Builder - and a score .
The list is sorted by descending scores ; the higher the score , the more likely the associated gesture is the one the user intended to draw .
The following code snippet demonstrates how to retrieve the name of the first prediction :
public void on GesturePerformed ( GestureOverlayView overlay , Gesture gesture ) { ArrayList predictions = mLibrary.recognize( gesture ) ; //
We want at least one prediction if ( predictions.size ( ) >
0 ) { Prediction prediction = predictions.
get (0 ) ; //
We want at least some confidence in the result if ( prediction.score > 1.0 ) { //
Show the spell Toast.makeText ( this , prediction.name , Toast.LENGTH_SHORT ) .show ( ) ; } } }
In this example , the first prediction is taken into account only if it 's score is greater than 1.0 .
The threshold you use is entirely up to you but know that scores lower than 1.0 are typically poor matches .
And this is all the code you need to create a simple application that can recognize pre-defined gestures ( see the source code of the project Gestures Demo ) :
Gestures overlay
In the example above , the GestureOverlayView was used as a normal view , embedded inside a LinearLayout .
However , as its name suggests , it can also be used as an overlay on top of other views .
This can be useful to recognize gestures in a game or just anywhere in the UI of an application .
In the second example , called GesturesListDemo , we 'll create an overlay on top of a list of contacts .
We start again in Gestures Builder to create a new set of pre-defined gestures :
And here is what the XML layout looks like :
< android.gesture.GestureOverlayView xmlns:android= " http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android " android:id= " @+id/gestures " android:layout_width=" fill_parent " android:layout_height=" fill_parent " android:gestureStrokeType=" multiple " android:eventsInterceptionEnabled =" true " android:orientation =" vertical " >
< ListView android:id= " @android:id/list " android:layout_width=" fill_parent " android:layout_height=" fill_parent " /> </android.gesture.GestureOverlayView >
In this application , the gestures view is an overlay on top of a regular ListView .
The overlay also specifies a few properties that we did not need before :

: when set to true , this property tells the overlay to steal the events from its children as soon as it knows the user is really drawing a gesture .
This is useful when there 's a scrollable view under the overlay , to avoid scrolling the underlying child as the user draws his gesture orientation : indicates the scroll orientation of the views underneath .
In this case the list scrolls vertically , which means that any horizontal gestures ( like action_delete ) can immediately be recognized as a gesture .
Gestures that start with a vertical stroke must contain at least one horizontal component to be recognized .
In other words , a simple vertical line cannot be recognized as a gesture since it would conflict with the list 's scrolling .
The code used to load and set up the gestures library and overlay is exactly the same as before .
The only difference is that we now check the name of the predictions to know what the user intended to do :
public void on GesturePerformed ( GestureOverlayView overlay , Gesture gesture ) { ArrayList < Prediction > predictions = mLibrary.recognize( gesture ) ; if ( predictions.size ( ) > 0 && predictions.get (0 ) .score > 1.0 ) { String action = predictions.get ( 0 ) .name ; if ( " action_add " .equals ( action ) ) { Toast.makeText ( this , " Adding a contact " , Toast.LENGTH_SHORT ) .show ( ) ; } else if ( " action_delete" .equals ( action ) ) { Toast.makeText ( this , " Removing a contact " , Toast.LENGTH_SHORT ) .show ( ) ; } else if ( " action_refresh " .equals ( action ) ) { Toast.makeText ( this , " Reloading contacts " , Toast.LENGTH_SHORT ) .show ( ) ; } } }
The user is now able to draw his gestures on top of the list without interfering with the scrolling :
The overlay even gives visual clues as to whether the gesture is considered valid for recognition .
In the case of a vertical overlay , for instance , a single vertical stroke cannot be recognized as a gesture and is therefore drawn with a translucent color :
It 's your turn
Adding support for gestures in your application is easy and can be a valuable addition .
The gestures API does not even have to be used to recognize complex shapes ; it will work equally well to recognize simple swipes .
We are very excited by the possibilities the gestures API offers , and we 're eager to see what cool applications the community will create with it .
President Barack Obama is quietly deploying an extra 13,000 troops to Afghanistan , an unannounced move that is separate from a request by the US commander in the country for even more reinforcements .
The extra 13,000 is part of a gradual shift in priority since Obama became president away from Iraq to Afghanistan .
The White House and the Pentagon both announced earlier this year that the number of US troops in Afghanistan was to be raised by 21,000 , bringing the total at present to 62,000 , with the aim of 68,000 by the end of the year .
But the Washington Post , based on conversations with Pentagon officials , said that on top of those an extra 13,000 " enablers " are also being deployed .
They are mainly engineers , medical staff , intelligence officers and military police .
About 3,000 of them are specialists in explosives , being sent to try to combat the growing fatality rate from roadside bombs .
The deployment of such non -combat troops is in line with the professed aim of the new US commander , General Stanley McChrystal , to try to win the hearts and minds of the Afghanistan population .
In addition to the deployments under way , McChrystal has also requested an extra 40,000 troops he says are necessary to prevent the country falling into the hands of the Taliban .
That request has provoked an intense debate within Washington , with some political advisers in the White House opposed to any further escalation of a war that is already proving unpopular at home .
The Afghanistan president Hamid Karzai , today expressed support for McChrystal 's request .
" I 'm fully behind him for what he 's seeking in this report , " Karzai told ABC 's Good Morning America .
As part of the internal debate , the US defence secretary , Robert Gates , who is cautiously supporting McChrystal , is due to meet later today the vice - president Joe Biden , who is opposed to the troop increase and favours a shift in priority to tracking down al - Qaida in Pakistan .
A decision on McChrystal 's troop request appears to have been postponed for a few weeks .
Any extra troops will come as a result of a parallel reduction in the number of US troops in Iraq .
A US military planner told the Army Times : " We 've increased forces in Afghanistan before we 've reduced forces in Iraq in a meaningful way .
If they want forces sooner than 2010 , there are no additional forces available .
You 'll have to pull them from Iraq and put them in Afghanistan . "
The US spokesman in Iraq , Brigadier General Stephen Lanza , said yesterday that the number of US troops in Iraq will be down to 120,000 by the end of the month , down 23,000 since January .
But any further large - scale reductions will have to wait until after Iraqi elections next January .
He said the aim was to get all combat troops out of Iraq by August , leaving 50,000 troops to advise and support the Iraqis .
Intelligence in Public Literature
John M. Diamond : Stanford University Press , 2008 , 536 p. , photos , bibliography , index .
Reviewed by Roger Z. George
Rising above the “ gotcha ” or the “ connect the dots ” simplicity of the growing genre of “ intelligence - failure ” literature , John Diamond ’s
The CIA and the Culture of Failure is one book of the genre worth reading if one is all you choose to read .
While the title is off - putting and misleading , Diamond explains it early in a way that compelled this reviewer to see if the author could make his case .
The former Chicago Tribune and USA Today reporter on national security asserts in his introduction that “ failure refers not to alleged CIA incompetence , which , though it occurs in cases we will explore , is often overstated by the agency ’s critics . ”
What he explores instead is the product of an “ atmosphere of declining confidence in the abilities of U.S. intelligence to do its job . ”
Hence , the fault lies not only in the Agency ’s performance but in US politics since the collapse of the Soviet Union began in 1989 .
Diamond spent two years piecing together his story from information released in the Agency ’s declassification programs , congressional hearings , commission postmortems , policymaker memoirs , and interviews with former Agency officials .
He does not attempt to cover the Agency ’s entire history or to deal with every issue or controversy in which CIA has been involved since 1991 .
He says very little , for example , about collection or covert operations .
One exception is a chapter on Aldrich Ames in which Diamond tries to demonstrate how Ames put CIA “ in Chapter 11 , ” in the words of former Deputy Director of Central Intelligence John McLaughlin .
In his many sources , he detects a steady decline in CIA ’s status and performance .
The book unfolds in a discussion of the CIA ’s analytic record on the fall of the Soviet Union , which Diamond links to later problems in CIA ’s analysis on terrorism and Iraq .
Like other authors , he acknowledges the shock of the loss of CIA ’s main target and object of analysis , but unlike other Agency critics , he does not entirely blame the Agency for not predicting the USSR ’s fall .
“ In a sense , ” he writes , “ the CIA set itself up for later failures of analysis by its occasionally prescient early 1980s assessments of the pressures toward radical change in the Soviet bloc . ”
He credits CIA for forecasting the risks — including coup plotting — Mikhail Gorbachev ran in trying to right the sinking ship of socialism .
However , the Agency never fully appreciated the centrifugal forces at play in Soviet society and consequently could not anticipate or appreciate the far - reaching proposals that Gorbachev was to lay down in the late 1980s .
Rather than leave it at that , Diamond makes an observation few other critics acknowledge , namely , that analysis is not just about prediction .
As he puts it :
The scorn heaped on the Agency in the early 1990s — scorn that had a significant and damaging impact on intelligence spending at what we now know was a critical time in the emergence of militant Islam — is based on the dubious assumption that predicting the breakup should have been an easy call .
The Soviet breakup , he notes , involved both a complicated set of events in that society and significant interactions with the United States .
Hence , he believes that “ getting it right in the case of the Soviet breakup , required foresight about shifts in U.S. and Soviet policy as well as the interaction between those shifts . ”
Debates raged throughout the Reagan era over the proper way to deal with , if not bring down , the Soviet Union .
CIA ’s place , according to Diamond , “ was somewhere in the middle . ”
It wrote about structural economic flaws but consistently overestimated Soviet GNP , it accurately gauged many Soviet military programs but undervalued the overall strain defense placed on the economy , and it identified the falling quality of life as a major threat to stability but never questioned Moscow ’s ability to control the pressures .
Diamond asserts that CIA followed its natural instinct to find a middle course between hawks and doves .
The result satisfied no one , and CIA lost its credibility .
In the end , “ neither the political left nor right in America had a particular interest in defending the CIA against the charge of intelligence failure . ”
This description of CIA ’s political plight after 1989 sets the stage for the chapters on 9/11 and the Iraq War .
In them Diamond asserts that CIA analysis often tacked within the confines of a supercharged political environment in which every estimative misjudgment or mistaken analysis had its predictable and often over - compensating adjustment .
In many cases , CIA was judged to be changing its analytic course , flipping assumptions on their heads , or learning the next lesson in a way that guaranteed a future failure .
Diamond also notes that much of the fault for this zig - zagging is driven by the shifting priorities and preoccupations of the policymakers CIA serves .
“ Intelligence reporting , in no small degree , reflects less the views of analysts than the view implied by questions policymakers have asked those analysts to answer . ”
So , if the first Bush administration showed no interest in Iraq prior its invasion of Kuwait in 1990 , CIA was prone not to focus on it or to develop good sources ; likewise when “ containment ” was thought to be working against Iraq during the Clinton administration , there was little incentive for CIA to develop sources or focus on what was not known about Baghdad ’s WMD programs .
Along the way , Diamond applauds CIA for getting many things right and for trying to warn inattentive policymakers .
Stepping back from the argument itself , Diamond ’s account of the CIA ’s post -1989 analytic record deftly describes the interaction of intelligence with policy , making it a far more sophisticated and well - sourced treatment than many published critiques .
Even though the Culture of Failure does not presume to be comprehensive in examining the many issues CIA has had on its plate since 1989 , those who actually worked on the issues will have to admire Diamond ’s attention to detail , his meticulous sequencing of events , and his placement of events into their political contexts .
No doubt , practitioners aware of still - classified material will quibble with some details or inferences and conclusions , but most will still find the volume a handy update to Christopher Andrew ’s book , For the President ’s Eyes Only , which does not cover the Clinton and George W. Bush administrations .
But does Diamond ’s core thesis , his quasi - deterministic view of CIA ’s “ culture of failure , ” hold up on full reading ?
I am not convinced .
First , like many books in the “ failure ” genre , this one suffers from hindsight bias .
The author finds that certain events — once all the facts are known — seem so much clearer than they could have been at the time .
[ 1 ]
No analyst , and perhaps only a few senior Intelligence Community managers , could possibly have had the “ bigger picture ” in mind when formulating hypotheses about the Soviet Union , Bin Laden , or Iraq .
Analysts stay in their lanes , and , for reasons of analytic integrity , tend not to put themselves in the policymakers ’ position of understanding how their analyses will affect policy or how their analyses will be perceived by a particular policymaker .
To blame analysts for tailoring their work to fit what policymakers might think is acceptable or credible is unfair , attributing to them insight most are unlikely to have .
In any case , the thesis cannot explain why CIA and the Intelligence Community could get the Iraq WMD story so wrong but got its assessments of an alleged al - Qaeda–Iraq linkage and a post - Saddam Iraq so right .
Uneven analytic expertise and rigor is a likelier explanation . [ 2 ]
Second , Diamond seems to imply that “ lessons learned ” from one analytic experience are transmitted seamlessly to other analytic units .
His argument that the Agency ’s damaged reputation after the fall of the Berlin Wall haunted its terrorism analysis and later its analysis of Iraq WMD may sound plausible in the abstract , but is too simplistic .
Very few analysts and managers who lived through the Reagan - era intelligence - policy disputes over the Soviet Union were working the terrorism or Iraq issues .
So , somehow this “ culture of failure ” had to be transplanted in the younger generation of analysts who came to populate the DI in the 1990s .
Yet , there is no evidence in the book that any terrorism analyst or weapons analyst had such lessons in mind when they examined their particular targets .
Moreover , both in - house and outside critiques of the Agency ’s performance on the Iraq WMD issue fault analysts for not having learned earlier lessons — that is , they committed the same sort of cognitive errors made by earlier analysts during the Cuban Missile Crisis , 1973 Middle East War , the 1979 Iran Revolution , and indeed the fall of the Soviet Union .
So , how can Diamond conclude that a past era had such a dramatic impact on a more recent one ?
Third , despite Diamond ’s claim that prediction is not the sole metric of the Agency ’s performance , virtually all of his book seems to focus on whether the Agency ’s forecasts were more correct than not .
Again , this simplifies the role of analysis to a game of odds - making .
Like other critics , he dismisses or plays down the role of uncertainty in the analytic process ; that is , analysts often must warn policymakers less about the certainty of a bad outcome and more about the uncertainty surrounding any judgment about the future .
This is unsatisfying for policymakers but essential if analysts are to provide objective and transparent judgments .
If , in 1987 , CIA had predicted the end of the Soviet Union by the end of the decade , would anyone have listened ?
Exactly such a prediction was made regarding the breakup of Yugoslavia in 1990 — which he does not examine — and had almost no impact on the first Bush administration .
Analytic certitude does not guarantee an impact on policy , but raising the possibility of deeper change , as CIA did in its many analyses of the Soviet Union , at least prepares policymakers to hedge bets in dealing with uncertain futures .
Had Diamond considered this uncertainty factor , he might well have arrived at different conclusions regarding the agency ’s performance or continued relevance .
Indeed , he might have shifted more responsibility to the policymakers ’ side of the score sheet .
Fourth and finally , one wishes a seasoned journalist who has followed national security and intelligence policy for more than 20 years would have made an effort to address the media ’s contribution to the post - 9/11 political environment .
Was not the media part of the zeitgeist in which CIA became the whipping boy for failed policies ?
And in his discussion of the Iraq WMD story , should Diamond not have at least mentioned how readily prominent journalists bought into the mindset that Saddam had WMD and was cleverer than we all thought ?
[ 3 ]
If he is correct in arguing that analysts felt the burden of declining credibility over the years since 1989 , at least part of that culture of failure was being transmitted by a press that found it appealing to focus on the Agency ’s failings more than its successes .
Unlike this book , which acknowledges the difficulty of assessing the full record , the media have painted intelligence in black and white — either tainted by politicization or irrelevant to critical national decisions , when the truth lies elsewhere .
Despite these flaws , the book makes an important contribution by highlighting the inherently inseparable nature of policy and the intelligence work behind it .
Neither operates in a vacuum , and policymakers and intelligence officers work better when they understand and acknowledge the impact they have on each other .
Wisely , Diamond states , “ there is no bright line between success and failure , no column of intelligence activities on one side labeled ‘ successes ’ and another on the other side labeled ‘ failures . ’ ”
Thankfully , Diamond offers no over - simplified silver bullet as a solution to this intelligence - policy problem .
Nor does he offer much hope for improvement for the future .
Indeed , he acknowledges that the themes he examines — “ the politicization of intelligence , the error - prone nature of the business , the tendency of bureaucracies to stumble into new kinds of failure while striving to avoid repeating past mistakes ” — are not unique to the period after the Soviet Union or to intelligence .
More somberly , he sees and expects the gap between policy and intelligence to widen .
In providing this judgment , he performs the useful function of cautioning future administrations that they need to work on making this relationship as transparent and collaborative as possible .
His message is that using the CIA to justify future actions , or excuse past mistakes , inevitably makes the Agency less effective and ultimately can undermine the nation ’s security .
Footnotes
[ 1 ] Diamond notes the second - guessing game that scholars play with analysis once more is known .
He writes : “ Given the huge volume of CIA analysis of the Soviet Union now available to the public through declassification , it is easy for a scholar to find examples of intelligence analysis that make the Agency look either brilliant or foolish , depending on the scholar ’s predisposition . ” ( 89 )
[ 2 ] Diamond notes that CIA basically stood its ground on the lack of persuasive evidence for al - Qaeda links to Saddam and wrote two very prescient Intelligence Community assessments on the domestic and re­gional consequences of Saddam ’s fall .

Two working mothers have been banned from looking after each other ’s toddlers because they are not registered childminders .
The close friends ’ private arrangement had let them both return to part - time jobs at the same company .
However , a whistleblower reported them to the education watchdog Ofsted and it found their informal deal broke the law .
This was because little - known rules say friends cannot gain a ‘ reward ’ by looking after a child for more than two hours outside the child ’s home without agreeing to a number of checks including one from the Criminal Records Bureau .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
Although the mothers never paid each other , their job - sharing deal was judged to be a ‘ reward ’ .
Campaigners fear thousands of working families could be innocently breaking the rules by relying on close friends for informal childcare .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
A Downing Street petition in protest at the treatment of the two mothers has already received 1,600 signatures .
Educational campaigner Dr Richard House labelled the case as ‘ absolutely scandalous ’ .

Die Geschichte des Qualitätsjournalismus ist die Geschichte eines großen Missverständnisses :
Wann immer in den vergangenen Jahren auf Medienkongressen und seit Beginn der Werbekrise gerne sogar im Wochentakt auf allen Kanälen über die zunehmend schwierige Situation für Verlage von Tageszeitungen diskutiert und berichtet wird , wird immer wieder ein Fehler gemacht : Qualitätsjournalismus wird mit Print - Journalismus gleich gesetzt .
Daraus entstehende Ideen für lebensverlängernde Maßnahmen freuen zwar die betroffenen Verlage und gehen doch am ehrenwerten Kern der Debatte vorbei : Den Qualitätsjournalismus zu sichern , sollte in der Tat ein Anliegen sein .
Auf welchem
Wege dieser allerdings transportiert wird , bedarf nicht eines Urteils der Politik sondern des Endverbrauchers .
Und der entscheidet sich für die tiefergehende Information weiterhin auch ohne politische Hilfe für den gedruckten Journalismus : Hochwertige Wochenzeitungen wie etwa " Die Zeit " oder die " Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung " steigern in der Krise ihre Auflage .
Nur bei der Tageszeitung hingegen entscheidet sich der Endverbraucher in den vergangenen Jahren offenbar immer öfter gegen das Gedruckte und für die schnellere Information , beispielsweise im Internet .
Bei aktuellen Informationen ist nun einmal , und dieser naheliegende Aspekt wird offenbar gerne vergessen , auch die Aktualität ein Qualitätskriterium .
Nur wollen Medienpolitiker der Großen Koalition ihre Forderung nach mehr Qualitätsjournalismus nicht darauf bezogen wissen .
Sie meinen stattdessen : Stärkt Print !
Und das gleich ganz pauschal .

We have used atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) to measure the viscoelastic properties of individual Escherichia coli K12 cells under fully hydrated conditions by collecting AFM force–indentation and force–time curves .
Spherical colloidal tips were used to reduce the local strain ensuring that the measurements were performed in the linear viscoelastic regime .
We find that the cells exhibit a time - dependent viscoelastic response to the constant compressive force applied by the AFM tip .
The results are interpreted using the standard solid model which describes both an instantaneous and a delayed elastic deformation .
The values obtained for the three viscoelastic parameters were used to generate a full description of the dynamic viscoelastic behavior of the cells over a wide range of frequencies derived from the differential equation governing the standard solid model .
The results obtained using this methodology are compared to experimental data obtained for the E. coli K12 cells and these results are compared to previously reported viscoelastic data on Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 cells .
The differences between the viscoelastic behaviors of these two types of Gram - negative bacterial cells are discussed in terms of their structural differences .
" If it continues to go on like this , there is no question there will be conflict .
It 's just a question of what kind of conflict there will be , and is it going to be in three months , six months or one year ? , " he said .

Former Ontario attorney general Michael Bryant has been charged with criminal negligence causing death after a 33 - year - old cyclist was struck and killed last night .
He was also charged with dangerous operation of a vehicle causing death .
Friends identified the victim as bicycle courier Darcy Allan Sheppard , father of three .
Bryant , 43 , spent the night and morning in custody .
He stared straight ahead as he left the Traffic Services police station at about 2:30 p.m. today , amid the flash of cameras and buzz of reporters ' questions .
Dressed in a suit , but looking tired and distraught , he read a brief statement .
" May I ask for your understanding in not making a statement today on last night 's tragic events .
At an appropriate moment I will of course speak to you .
" I would , however , like to extend my deepest condolences to the family of Mr. Sheppard .
To all those who have offered support to my family in the past 12 hours , thank you , " Bryant said , choking up slightly .
Bryant is scheduled to appear in Old City Hall court on Oct. 19 .
Just after 5 p.m. today , more than a dozen cyclists blocked traffic on Bloor St. , laying down their bikes at the spot where Sheppard died , chanting " murder . "
The cyclists , mostly couriers , brought traffic in both directions to a standstill between Unviersity Ave. and Bay St . They also taunted motorists , yelling at them to turn around and give them space to mourn their friend .
Sheppard 's girlfriend Misty arrived and laid down flowers .
The cyclists dispersed at around 6:10 p.m. and traffic resumed .
Sheppard , who was called Al by friends , was likely heading to his new home in the Dupont and Dufferin Sts. area at the time of the incident , friends said .
They said Sheppard had just got back together with his on - again - off - again girlfriend , Misty , and had said he wanted to marry her .
" Things were starting to go well for him right around now .
Stuff was looking good for him , " said 24 - year - old Sana , who did not want to give her last name .
Witnesses on Bloor St. last night described a heated confrontation between the driver of a black Saab convertible and a cyclist that began near Bloor and Bay Sts. at about 9:45 p.m .
Police Sgt. Tim Burrows said that after a minor collision , the cyclist grabbed hold of the car , which drove west on Bloor toward Avenue Rd .
Witnesses said the cyclist clung to the driver 's side of the car , which had its top down , while the driver yelled at him to get off .
The vehicle veered into the eastbound lanes and mounted the curb , brushing against trees and poles .
The victim was apparently run over by the rear wheels of the vehicle , witnesses said .
The driver 's wife was a passenger in the car , police said .
" Lots of people were watching and they could n't believe what was happening , " said Ryan Brazeau , a worker with a crew laying sewer pipes on Bloor .
One construction worker told CTV News he heard the squeal of tires and saw the car racing the wrong way down the street past their construction site , with the cyclist hanging onto the car .
" The guy hanging onto the car , hit the mailbox , hit the road , ( then ) . . . the car ran over him with the back tires , " the witness said .
" The guy bounced and the car sped off . . . the person was there just bleeding . "
The witness said he felt sick to his stomach when he saw the cyclist " bleeding from his head , his mouth . "
Sheppard was taken to St. Michael 's Hospital with serious head injuries and died around midnight .
Burrows said a large portion of the incident was captured on surveillance video and that investigators are working to fill in the gaps .
Police said alcohol was not involved .
On the website Biking Toronto Forum , a message was posted that said cyclists planned to gather at the same spot Wednesday at 5 p.m .
This morning two of Sheppard 's friends sat on the sidewalk scrawling notes for their friend , which they taped to a tree .
" He had a rough go , " Will Pierson , 26 , said .
" And just this last week he had kind of turned his place around and all these things were starting to look up for him and that 's why it 's such a f- ing tragedy . "
Pierson said he saw a bike on the news on TV this morning and recognized the wheel set as Sheppard's .
He and Sana went to find him afterward at his home , but no one answered .
A friend called at that time and told them the news , Sana said .
The last time Pierson saw Sheppard was yesterday morning and they had chatted about guitar amps .

" He was totally getting his life back on track , which is the part that makes it really , really hard to deal with , " Pierson said .
Friends also said Sheppard was an amateur stand - up comedian who sometimes performed at open mike nights at local clubs .
Bryant was reportedly in contact with a lawyer .
Around 12:50 p.m. , lawyer Andrew Evangelista arrived at Traffic Services in a black Cadillac , saying he was visiting Bryant as counsel and as a friend .
Bryant was first elected MPP for St. Paul 's in 1999 and won re-election in 2003 and 2007 .
He was awarded Now Magazine 's Best Toronto MPP for 2008 .
Residents on a small street in the St. Paul 's riding said they were shocked to hear about the alleged incident .
" I just saw the headline , " said one man , who asked not to be named .
" He 's a busy guy , we do n't see him around very much . "
When a Star reporter visited Bryant 's two - storey Victorian home on Foxbar Rd. , at the intersection of St. Clair W. and Avenue Rd. , a woman closed the curtains .
She could then be seen in the window talking on the phone while two children played .
Bryant was Ontario's youngest - ever attorney general , serving throughout the McGuinty government 's first four - year term .
Bryant legalized paralegals , fixed election dates , banned pit bulls , overhauled the human rights system , re-created the Law Reform Commission , re-established civilian oversight of police and depoliticized Justice of the Peace appointments .
Bryant , who also served as aboriginal affairs minister , stepped down as Ontario 's economic development minister in May to become president and CEO of the new Invest Toronto corporation chaired by Mayor David Miller .
In a statement issued this morning , Miller expressed " sincere condolences to the family and friends of the cyclist who died last night following an incident in the Yorkville area . "
But citing the ongoing police investigation , he declined to comment further .
Bryant 's former boss , Premier Dalton McGuinty , also reacted to news of the accident at a press conference this morning calling it " very sad , very tragic .
" My thoughts are with the family and friends of the gentleman who lost his life , " he said .
McGuinty stayed away from answering questions as to how Bryant should be treated in court , given his former ministerial position with the Attorney General .
" With respect to the case itself , I think the best thing to do is let the investigation unfold , " said McGuinty .
" I have confidence that anyone who comes before Ontario courts will be treated with due process . "

According to the Iraqi newspaper Al - Quds al - Arabi , James Baker , the Bush familyâ€™s Mr. Fixit , recently met with one of Saddam Husseinâ€™s lawyers in Amman , Jordan , and told him that the former deputy prime minister of Iraq , Tariq Aziz , would be released from detention by December in order to negotiate with the US on behalf of factions of the Iraqi resistance movement still controlled by old Baâ€™ath Party leaders .
Sources in Jordan tell me that the first stage of such negotiations has indeed already taken place .
Two weeks ago , Aziz was whisked from his jail cell and , along with other representatives of Iraqâ€™s Sunni Resistance , taken for three daysâ€™ of secret discussions in Amman with senior US officials .
It is heartening to note that this course of action was advised by the Atlantic Free Press three weeks ago .
Aziz and his colleagues are currently discussing Americaâ€™s proposals with the divisional resistance leadership , whose response and counter - offers they will present to Washington early next month .
Jordanâ€™s Crown Prince Hassan tells me , furthermore , that Condoleeza Rice made a personal appeal to the Gulf Cooperation Council last month to act as intermediaries between the US and the armed Sunni resistance , not including Iraqi al - Qaeda leaders .
Rice evidently joked during the closed - door meeting that â€ œif Donald Rumsfeld could hear me now he would wage war against me fiercer and hotter than he waged in Iraq.â€ 
The official wing of US Government was represented in Gulf War 2 : Retreat from Iraq by George W. Bushâ€™s security adviser , Stephen Hadley , who presented the following proposals regarding the future to Iraqi officials during his recent trip to Baghdad :
Any initiative towards national reconciliation must now include Iraqi resistance and opposition leaders
There must be a general amnesty for armed resistance fighters
There must be a disbanding of militias and death squads
Any federalist proposals dividing Iraq into three states must be abandoned in favor of a strong centralist authority combined with greater self - rule for local governors
That oil revenues must be distributed more equitably for the benefit of all Iraqis , including the Sunnis whose region contains little of the resource
Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri Al - Maliki was evidently unable to accept these proposals , or so I am told , because his office ties him institutionally to the Shia parties , which view any concessions to the Sunni as a religious betrayal .
Iraqi Shia Muslims believe their moment in history has arrived and they have finally thrown off a millennium of Sunni domination .
Most chickens still remain in their eggs , however , so counting them may be misleading .
The view in Washington is that Al - Malikiâ€™s usefulness has ended , and a political coup is now underway to oust him and reorganize his regime along lines more amenable to a revival of Americaâ€™s old bias toward Sunni Arabs .
In the Situation Room , the situation always has room for change , and two opinions are better than one even when theyâ€™re mutually contradictory .
Along with burying Al - Maliki in Quislingâ€™s Graveyard , some of the Pentagonâ€™s less repentant serial killers feel that cranking up the battle of Baghdad a notch would make an even better prelude to withdrawal , since it might help prevent US troops being picked off like lame antelope by a triumphant resistance .
In this , as in all Middle Eastern political poker these days , Teheran holds better cards than Washington , Tel Aviv , Riyadh , or Baghdad .
While state media ply us with tales of Iranâ€™s profligacy as chief arms merchant to violent dissent , the real story is that of Iranâ€™s restraint .
There were larger shoulder - launched missiles to supply Hezbollah fighters in Lebanon â€ “ ones capable of reaching every city in Israel â€ “ yet Teheran chose not to make them available .
There is an awful lot more that the Iranian military could provide to Iraqi resistance groups , too , yet to date it is the Russians , via Syria , who have provided most of the weaponry .
Why is Iran so coy ?
One could speculate that the Islamic Republic will not play its hand until Iranâ€™s air force includes nuclear missiles ; or one could theorize that the Iranian clergy still hopes to extend national influence into Iraq along religious lines , without force .
But no one in Iran is going to let us see what cards his country holds because they arenâ€™t playing poker there at all , theyâ€™re playing chess , the national game .
Among its many shortcomings , the DC Situation Room lacks a really good chess player --- which is a pity , since chess is all they play in there .
Israel also used to display a blistering strategic chess game , where now all we see is a kosher ham - fisted version of checkers .
Particularly in response to the elegant gambit played from Teheran , whose President Ahmadinejad is used like a Queen to carry out showily distracting but inconsequential assaults into enemy terrain , while the Bishops position themselves for far more lethal operations .
The real power in Teheran is an oligarchy linked to oil and interwoven with senior clerics yet essentially secular in its goals .
Your media donâ€™t bother you with this reality , however , for reasons best known to themselves .
To retain the status quo , however , the oligarchs must placate the impoverished masses with a myth of spiritual warfare in which Iran fights for God against Satan .
God has just awarded one of Iranâ€™s citizens the deeds to Satanâ€™s embassy in Teheran in lieu of a cash payment for the fine imposed by a clerical court for wrongful imprisonment â€ “ so the war is going well !
At least no one in Teheranâ€™s corridors of power actually believes this yarn , though , while Washington is infested with religious psychopaths who seriously ( or rather comically ) think theyâ€™re up against a guy with horns who has set himself up as the Competition .
Of all the sins in existence , letting a human mind confuse fantasy with fact is right up there at the top .
These are the same people , one ought not to forget , who want God included in science courses where the Bible will also be chief text .
And they wonder why they are on a collision course with militant Islam --- not over basic principles , of course , but merely the choice of text ?
Hinduism didnâ€™t thrive during the Indian version of the Spanish Inquisition either , and the late Pope only apologized for the Holocaust a year before he died .
WE INTERRUPT THIS TO BRING YOU A MESSAGE FROM OUR SPONSOR :
â€ œHELLO , EARTHLINGS .
PLEASE TRY TO REMEMBER THAT TERMS LIKE â€œJIHADâ€ AND â€œARMAGEDDONâ€ ARE METAPHORICAL IN NATURE AND NOT â€ “ REPEAT NOT â€ “ TO BE TAKEN LITERALLY .
IF YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT A METAPHOR IS , YOU NEED TO RETURN TO SCHOOL , WHERE YOU OUGHT TO MAKE SURE YOU ARE BEING TAUGHT HOW TO THINK , RATHER THAN WHAT TO THINK .
IF YOU ARE NOT SURE YOU KNOW HOW TO THINK , IT IS FAIRLY CERTAIN YOU DO NOT KNOW .
RETURN TO AN INSTITUTION OF LEARNING IMMEDIATELY IF THIS IS THE CASE , BECAUSE YOU MAY POSE A SERIOUS THREAT TO YOURSELF AND OTHERS .
OUR MOTTO IS â€ ˜THINK BEFORE YOU ACT , AND BEFORE YOU THINK , LEARN HOW TO THINK.â€™ YOU KNOW IT MAKES SENSE.â€ 
WE NOW RETURN TO SCHEDULED PROGRAMMING .
President Ahmadinejad is not just a man of the Iranian people , he may well be the only man anyone in Qom has met who has actually worked for a living and possesses no kind of inherited wealth .
The trouble with studying nothing but the Holy Koran is that , while you learn much about maintaining tyrannical power , you learn nothing about obtaining it in the first place .
I have no doubts whatsoever about Ahmadinejadâ€™s loyalty to the Iranian masses , but I am not so certain about his loyalty to the clerical powers that be .
If he felt the military were behind him , he would mata his own shah in a trice , I think , and seize the reins of absolute power from a corrupt oligarchy that has betrayed Iranâ€ ™s revolution for its own ends .
He makes Machievelli look like Madeleine Albright : after all , the princely adviser never states that an eminence grise is obliged sometimes to give advice he knows is wrong in order to seize power himselfâ€ ¦
Good help is hard to find , however , and a good adviser is sometimes worth the risk that he will stab you in the back --- until he does , of course .
Since good advice is almost as rare as honesty in Washington , it would not surprise me if the Al - Maliki putsch incorporates a US plea for help to Grand Ayatollah Ali al - Sistani , Iraqâ€™s most influential Shia cleric , who will have to weigh carefully his debts to Teheran against the lure of real political power in Baghdad .
Washington has accepted it is not in any position to call the shots in Baghdad any more , yet that will not mean it wonâ€™t try to call them .
One major condition of the deal under which US troops will withdraw from Baghdad ( but only to their desert bases ) is that Iran does not try to extend its sphere of influence .
Since Iran alone has the power to make sure this deal goes through , the best that US negotiators can do is get an agreement that Iran will not try to extend its sphere of influence immediately .
This , and making sure Saddam isnâ€™t released from jail , is all that victory amounts to these days at mission control in the home of the brave .
But , as King Lear noticed : â€ œThe art of our necessities is strange and can make vile things seem precious .â€ 
Tariq
Aziz was never an especially vile thing , yet his negotiating skills must seem precious beyond price in the big house on Pennsylvania Avenue .
If I were Aziz , though , Iâ€™d assure myself a glorious page in the history books by insisting that pride of place be given to President Bush at the Grand Baghdad Banquet of Humble Pie , with George , Dick , Donny and Wolfo all helping to cut that first big slice , as they write checks handing back to Iraqis what they stole from them during the 21st Centuryâ€™s Greatest Crime So Far .
But Mr. Aziz is far too good a diplomat for such a ploy .
Besides , he spent the first few months of his captivity in Room 31 at Baghdad International Airport crying real tears over his involvement in Saddamâ€™s more notorious excesses .
How good his negotiating skills are , though , remains to be seen --- after all , he couldnâ€™t negotiate his own exile during the fall of Saddamâ€™s regime , and was thus forced to surrender unconditionally to US authorities .
Good to hear heâ€™s out on probation , though : three years is more than enough time for what he did .
Indeed , his greatest crime is being Saddamâ€™s oldest friend and most loyal ally .
I wonder what the status of that is now ?
The day America admits it no longer produces diplomats able to hold their own in a serious global match will be the day it might be allowed back into the world community with observer credentials .
Henry Kissinger was a better butcher than he was diplomat , but at least he knew how to sit down and deal .
As Saddam Hussein will tell you --- since The Godfather is his favorite movie â€ “ when the other mob leaders think Sonny has taken over the family , they start a war .
Putting John Bolton in the UN is like making The Terminator President : a very bad idea someone in Washington will always be enamored with until an even worse idea occurs to them .

Baker is also an erstwhile secretary of state and was US ambassador to Kuwait , a post in which he found no conflict of interest with his extensive business connections to Big Oil in Houston .
Last week I was in an inflation vs. deflation debate on Financial Sense with Daniel Amerman .
The debate was moderated by Jim Puplava .
It is a credit to Jim that he is willing to entertain both sides of an argument even though he himself is an inflationist .
Amerman took the inflation side , and of course I took the deflation side .
One of the main rules of any debate is to agree on definitions .
In this case , there was no agreement .
I believe inflation is an increase in money supply and credit while Amerman considers inflation to be a purchasing power phenomenon .
This lead to different opinions as to whether or not we are in deflation .
Furthermore , as with any audio discussion , there was an inability to point to charts or written material to make a case .
Let 's now explore some of the issues that came up in the debate starting with Amerman 's post Puncturing Deflation Myths
Japan & “ Where ’s The Beef ” ?
As discussed in Part One , someone who had attended one of my inflation solutions workshops asked me to debate deflation theory with him .
I said “ fine ” but with one condition : before I would debate theory , he needed to first provide a real word example of this problem actually having happened .
Could he answer this simple , real world question :
Name an example of a modern , major nation where the domestic purchasing power ( as measured by CPI ) of its purely symbolic & independent currency uncontrollably grew in value at a rapid rate over a sustained period , despite the best efforts of the nation to stop this rapid deflation ?
Six Fallacies
Fallacy One .
The belief that a “ dollar ” is a “ dollar ” and that the deflationary history of gold standard currencies applies to symbolic currencies ( an “ apples to oranges ” fallacy ) .
Fallacy Two .
The belief that the US Great Depression proves the case for unstoppable monetary deflation during depressions , when it in fact proves that a sufficiently determined government can immediately break monetary deflation at will , even in the midst of depression .
Fallacy Three .
The belief that inflation and deflation take wealth from all of us equally , when what they actually do is redistribute the wealth among us .
Fallacy Four .
The widespread belief that Japan experienced powerful price deflation that the government was powerless to fight .
It did n’t .
Fallacy Five .
The fundamental mistake of thinking that “ deflation ” is “ deflation ” , which leads to confusing price deflation with asset deflation , and means missing the real lessons and dangers of what happened in Japan , which is the persistent asset deflation that has defeated all government interventions ( another “ apples to oranges ” fallacy ) .
Fallacy Six .
The dangerous belief that deflation protects you from inflation .
Collapsing credit availability and the resulting collapsing money supply leading to an unstoppable and rapidly rising value for a symbolic currency ( price deflation ) is a popular theory – but it has never happened in the real world .
What Does and Should the CPI Reflect ?
What 's the Real CPI ?
Case Shiller CPI vs. CPI -U
CS -CPI
Year over year has now fallen for 8 consecutive months and 11 of the past 15 .
High Year over year comparison data points for the next several months will likely result in CPI deflation coming in at - 7 % to - 8 % in the coming months .

Humpty Dumpty On Inflation
Practical Definitions Of Inflation And Deflation
Most know my definitions by now but here they are again for convenience .
Inflation is a net increase in money supply and credit .
Deflation is a net decrease in money supply and credit .
In both cases credit must be marked to market to make any practical sense out of what is happening .
Those who focus solely on money supply cannot easily explain stock markets that have fallen in half ( this does not happen in disinflation ) , TIPs yields , a global race to ZIRP , or many other events that are happening .
Humpty Dumpty Defines Inflation
Unfortunately there are many definitions of inflation and deflation strewn about .
Some play the role of Humpty Dumpty changing meanings at whim , switching from commodity prices , to consumer prices , to expansion of base money or M3 or whatever measure of money seems to be expanding at the fastest rate .
Some do the inflationista two - step to avoid admitting that we are indeed in deflation , choosing instead to call it " disinflation "
In short : " We are going to have a period of deflation that we will instead call disinflation . "
' When I use a word , ' Humpty Dumpty said , in a rather scornful tone , ' it means just what I choose it to mean , neither more nor less . '
' The question is , ' said Alice , ' whether you can make words mean so many different things . '
' The question is , ' said Humpty Dumpty , ' which is to be master - that 's all . '

Mish Treasury Calls
Kass Says Sell Bonds Short .
Kass :
The bond market is in a bubble that is reminiscent of ( and quite possibly as extreme as ) other bubbles during previous eras .
From my perch , the only issue is the timing of this trade .
Mish : Timing is indeed everything and perhaps there is a temporary selloff .
But the primary trend is for lower yields .
Perhaps much lower yields .
There is no bubble in bonds .
Not yet .
There is no bubble in treasuries if you look closely at the fundamental issues .
Those who want to see how low treasury yields can get and stay there , need to look at Japan .
Yields in the US are going to go far lower and stay lower longer than nearly everyone thinks .
Those focused on the CPI failed to see any chance of the Fed Fund 's Rate at 2.00 again .
On the other hand , those focused on the destruction of credit from an Austrian economic perspective got this correct .
That is just one reason why it makes more sense to watch the credit markets than the CPI .
The second is the CPI is so distorted it is useless .
In my opinion , it is very likely new all time lows in the 10 - year treasury yield and 30 - year long bond are coming up .
It is quite possible the lows in treasury yields are in .
Unlike 2008 where I was constantly beating the drums for lower yields , 2009 could be different .
Here are the facts : 3 month and 6 month yields hit 0 % and the 10 year came close to hitting 2 % .
Could there be lower yields still ?
Yes , quite easily .
Is it worth playing for other than as a hedge or part of an overall investment strategy ?
No .

What Causes Eye Twitching and Why Does My Eye Twitch ?
There are a number of causes of eye twitching that may answer your
question , Why Does My Eye Twitch ?
Eye twitching , also known as blepharospasm , is a common but frustrating
eye problem where the upper or lower eyelid jumps and goes into a spasm .
Eyelid twitching has numerous causes , some harmless and others potentially
serious .
Someone who can't control eyelid spasms or twitching can find it very
distressing .
Often this condition is a simple eye muscle problem , but on
occasion it can represent a severe neurological disorder .
It 's important to distinguish that there are three main categories of eyelid twitching : Benign Eyelid Myokymia ( Simple Eyelid Twitching )
The most common form of eye lid twitching is called benign eyelid myokymia
which is also known as benign eyelid twitching .
Patients often describe
this common condition as a twitching or “ jumping ” of the eye .
In fact , it
usually involves only the eyelid .
It ’s important to ask yourself the following question : “ Is it the eye or
eyelid that ’s twitching ? " because if the eye itself is moving , that is a
potentially more serious neurological condition called nystagmus .
Do you notice the eyelid movements when looking in the mirror , or have
others have noticed it ?
Typically , the lid twitching that occurs with
benign eyelid twitching is so subtle that the you notice it , but others
rarely see it .
You may feel that the phenomenon causes lid drooping also ,
but this is rarely noticeable .
Benign eyelid twitching occurs in otherwise healthy individuals .
It
typically occurs on one side , but may alternate sides .
It may involve the
upper or lower eyelids .
The twitching may occur intermittently for hours ,
weeks , or even months .
The cause remains uncertain , but is frequently associated with stress ,
lack of sleep , fatigue , eyestrain , dry eye , localized eye irritation ,
dehydration and electrolyte imbalances or significant ingestion of
caffeine , alcohol , or nicotine .
The condition is usually temporary and
benign .
The best treatment is to reduce the precipitating factors .
However , in
more symptomatic or persistent cases , drug therapy , supplements , eyedrops ,
or botox injections may be indicated .

Oct. 22 , 209 , 2009 -- Since its inception in the 1950s , the Church of Scientology has rarely been far from controversy .
And now some senior insiders who have left the church are leveling disturbing accusations against the current leader , David Miscavige .
Marty Rathbun , Amy Scobee , Bruce Hines and Mike Rinder each dedicated more than 20 years to the Church of Scientology , as members of the Sea Organization , or Sea Org , the equivalent of the church 's clergy .
They tell co-anchor Martin Bashir they left in part because the 49 - year - old leader , Miscavige , struck subordinates numerous times and encouraged others to do the same .
In an interview with Bashir , scientology spokesman Tommy Davis vehemently denies that David Miscavige ever hit anyone and says the accusers are lying in an attempt to discredit Miscavige and to justify their own bad behavior within the church , which he says led to their dismissal .
Watch the full story on " Nightline " on Thursday , October 22nd and Friday , October 23rd .
Co-anchor Martin Bashir reports .
The young Tunisian was clear in his view .
" No , I 'm not going to vote this Sunday , " he said .
" What 's the point ?
We all know what the result will be .
In fact it would be the same result if nobody at all went to vote , " he added .
Welcome to the world of North Africa where ageing autocrats use elections for the sole purpose of keeping themselves in power and their family in riches .
Welcome indeed to countries right across the Islamic world from the Gulf through Azerbaijan and Kyrgyzstan and a great many other nations beside .
By these standards Tunisia could be said to be a relatively soft dictatorship or at least a relatively stable one .
Compared to the violent oppression of it's neighbours , Algeria and Libya as well as Egypt , Tunisian political control is more discrete and more legalistic .
But a closed political system it is .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
This will be the 73 - year - old president Abidine Ben Ali 's fifth election since he seized power from the ailing father of Tunisian independence , Habib Bourguiba , in 1987 and had him certified as incompetent to rule .
Nobody for a moment expects him to be seriously challenged .
The rules of representation and legalising a party ensure that the governing party retains an unassailable majority in parliament and only a token competition in the presidentials .
Just as in Morocco and Egypt it is the authorities that control the elections by registering voters , counting the votes and declaring the results .
Islamic parties are totally banned .
Just as in the neighbouring countries genuine opposition can be quickly countered by laws against defamation of the state or insult to the president or nation .
The government controls the airwaves , the administrators control the system .
The stifling of expression is made only worse by the pervasiveness of corruption .
Bourguiba , who hero worshipped Ataturk and tried to emulate his modernisation of Turkey in Tunisia , left a legacy of equal rights for women , free state education and health and a centrally controlled economy .
The women 's rights survive .
So too does the control of the economy .
But free education and health has been edged out by private schools and clinics which entrench the rich in their privileges while the continued size of the state sector has morphed into a vast enterprise for rewarding friends , family and cronies .
Little wonder that the one ambition of so many young men of the Maghreb is to get to Europe by whichever route is possible .
All sorts of academic studies , and reforming voices within the communities , have tried to explain just why it is that Muslim countries have failed to develop vibrant democracies or rapidly developing economies .
There 's the usual accusation that it is the fault of Western interference that left North African countries as the Middle East struggling to find a future for themselves .
And any reading of even the most neutral of histories of these regions must make one blanch at the way in which they were occupied and abused in the last century .
But it is not the West , nor indeed is it Islam , that has caused the steady encroachment of corruption through the body politic .
Decades of entrenched power have done that , as much south of the Sahara as north of it .
Where Europe is at fault has been in the way that we have taken advantage of bribery to further our business interests .
For the politicians within Britain , the question of Abdelbaset Ali al - Megrahi 's release back to Libya was one of who should take the blame , but for anyone who cares either about the decency of Britain or its responsibilities abroad , it was truly obscene to listen to revelation after revelation of the way we sacrificed all our principles to ingratiate ourselves with a loathsome dictator who has oppressed his own people and kept his country backward for the last 40 years .
It 's the wrong course for us and for them .
The countries of North Africa are n't going to stay fixed in time for ever , however much we may want them to do so .
Aside from the young King Mohammed VI of Morocco – at 46 now showing signs of a reversion to authoritarianism – the leaders are now growing old .
Ben Ali is in his seventies , Hosni Mubarak of Egypt is 81 , President Bouteflika of Algeria is 72 and Gaddafi of Libya looks a very raddled 67 .
Although each is making every effort to ensure a seamless succession , their demise is bound to make things different .
How different is not easy to estimate .
These countries have been held in their own constraint for so long , and have been deliberately encouraged to do so in the interests of Western security and stability , that it 's almost impossible to say whether a vacuum in power ushers forth anarchy or moderated adjustment .
Radical Islam has been ruthlessly and brutally suppressed by the North African countries .
But they , like so many other Muslim countries , are experiencing a broadly - based Muslim revival .
Speak to any Arab of whatever class and the story is the same .
Religious observance is on the increase from the mosque to the hijab .
It 's what happening in Turkey as well .
It may prove a breeding ground for extremism , as some fear .
Personally I think it 's far more to do with self worth than external aggression although it could become anti-Western if we react as if it is .
But it 's something we 're going to have to live with , if only because its happening right on Europe 's border and its visible expression in emigration is seen every day on southern Europe 's shores .
So far we 're not even close to understanding let alone coping with it .
President Nicolas Sarkozy 's vision of a club of Mediterranean countries , which might have at least pushed forward some trade and aid policies , has instead proved just another of the French President 's initiatives introduced to aggrandise himself and France .
He and Angela Merkel of Germany have made clear their determination to keep out Turkey – which holds the most approachable key to comprehending what is going on – on grounds that are implicitly , and sometimes explicitly , anti-Muslim .
The EU 's policy on immigration meanwhile is fractured , inhumane and more and more restrictive .
Its trade approach is riven with commercial rivalry and straight greed .
Europe does n't need a clash of civilisations but if we keep on like this we 're all too likely to get one .

One of the most popular forms of this investment are American coins .
Where there is a need , there is always someone to fill it and in this case , the filling consists of the massive counterfeiting of gold coins , silver coins , and even Swiss gold bars in China .
Initially , it appeared they were only faking Morgan dollars , but then it turned out they were also making $ 20 Liberty , and Indian Head gold $ 2.50 , $ 5 , and $ 10 coins , of all dates .
Evidently , this is extremely easy with today 's computer - and - laser - die - cutting technology , and the fakes are being die - struck in vast quantities , not cast , and visually at least , are superb copies .
� The good news is that these fakes are readily detectable with a 0.01 - gram scale , as the Chinese in their greed are using lower carats of gold and lower grades of silver than the genuine coins , to maximize profit , and thus , in most cases , the fake coins and bars are lighter than the real ones .
In a few cases , the silver coins of high numismatic interest are actually OVER weight - it appears that the supply of accurate planchet stock is a major difficulty for the forgers .�
An inquiry was made at a European bank on the problem .
The bank said that indeed � the Chinese are also faking sovereigns , half sovereigns , French 20 Franc gold , and various denominations of Nicholas II Russian Rubles , of all dates , as well as Swiss gold bars .
They said any gold bars they are offered for purchase are both weighed and the serial numbers checked with the manufacturers .
The Chinese do not know the serial and manufacture date numbering systems on the gold bars , and so that error is quickly detectable .�
In going on , the report noted that � The US Secret Service has just this week been made aware of this problem , which was new to them , and if they decide to launch an investigation , they have indicated that while they cannot do anything about the operations in China , they can , and will , seize any counterfeit US coins they come across .
Dealers in these fakes would also be liable to fines and jail time .
Foreign fakes are not under their purview , but if that business turns out to be substantial , there could conceivably be an FBI investigation of fraud in interstate commerce , targeting companies who are mail - ordering fake foreign coins .
Individuals who have been cheated might also sue their suppliers - in short , this could turn into a huge mess .
� General appearance aside , it is very easy to spot fakes - just with a scale reading to 1/00th of a gram , and a table of the correct weights and sizes of the coins or bars they are buying .
( In the case of large - size bar gold , unless buying from the manufacturer or a reputable bank , the serial numbers need to be verified , so that one does not buy a Chinese bar with a lead or mercury core ) .�
Here is a listing of some of the frauds uncovered so far : 1 . The U.S . Morgan silver dollar .
All dates and all mint marks 2 . The U.S. gold coins viz the $ 2.50 , $ 5.00 and $ 10.00 Indian head .
3 . The U.S. copper penny viz 1909 S vdb 4 .
Three gold Imperial Russian roubles from the reign of Nicholas II 5 .
A gold 20 franc coin with the head of Napoleon I on the obverse 6 . The South African Krugerrand 7 .
British sovereigns and half sovereigns of different monarchs and dates 8 .
And in addition , they are also making fake gold bars from the Credit Suisse people .
Rense.com had a second report from Susan Headley on the counterfeiting problem in China .
Without going into the details , it can be said that the Chinese have a particular skill at making reproductions of originals .
Suffice to say , they are given credit for up to 80 % of all worldwide counterfeiting .
In 2005 , US Customs seized $ 93 million worth of counterfeit goods from China .
Now the Question of What this may mean for the price of gold ?
Long term , probably this report on Chinese counterfeiting may not amount to much .
But there is likely some impact on gold and silver coins in the short term .
If the plutocrats elect to publicize it and play it up , it could particularly hurt gold and silver short term .
The very fact that a report like this is coming out now , when the manipulators may begin to have some problems in controlling gold and silver prices , may act to give them a boost in the next month or so .
In other words , it may especially scare off some rare gold and silver coin purchases which in turn will not set well with the overall gold and silver markets .
Unless the plutocrat controlled media overworks this story and continually brings it to the attention of Americans , it should soon die out for the benefit of the long term gold and silver markets .

HOUSTON – A missile may have just barely miss hitting a Continental Airlines flight on Friday .
Liberty County sheriff deputies are meeting with the FBI and FAA to discuss this incident .
Sheriff deputies say on Friday a missile may have been launched near Interstate 10 and mount Belview .
A continental flight which had just taken off from Bush Intercontinental Airport may have been the target .
“ If it was done deliberately , how much more dangerous can you get ? ” said Chief Deputy Ken DeFoor with the Liberty County Sheriff ’s Department .
He went on to explain , “ It was less than a hundred feet from the airplane itself , going underneath the cockpit of the airplane . ”

My colleague , who works for a major equipment vendor , was discussing how his employer was planning to lay off hundreds of developers over the coming months .
“ But I ’m safe , ” he said , “ as I ’m one of the two people in our group who really understand the code . ”
It seems that writing code that nobody else can comprehend can be a significant job security booster .
Here ’s some advice .
Unreadable Code
Start by focusing on your code ’s low - level details .
Nothing puts off maintainers trying to take over your job than code that brings tears to their eyes .
Be inconsistent in all aspects of your code : naming , spacing , indenting , commenting , style .
Every time there are multiple ways to implement something , throw dice and choose at random .
Avoid writing similar code in comparable situations .
Spend time coming up with coding tricks that nobody has ever used .
Why write a = 0 when you can write a ^= a ?
Apply this advice liberally in the way you format expressions and statements .
There ’s only one generally accepted way to space between operators and operands ; avoid it .
Control flow statements are more fun because there are two schools on where to put braces ; randomly switch between them to throw people off .
Unfortunately , these tricks wo n’t get you far , because beautifiers can readily bring your code up to scratch .
However , when naming your variables , methods , fields , and classes , your choices can persist for decades ; think of the Unix creat ( sic ) system call .
Some languages , such as Java , have well - established naming conventions regarding capitalization and the joining of words .
View them as an opportunity ; these rules were designed to be broken .
In other languages , such as C++ , naming conventions are already severely broken or nonexistent .
In this case , you can make your mark by using new names for existing concepts .
For instance , name the methods for an iterator ’s range start and finish , rather than begin and end .
Further innovate by making those ranges symmetric rather than following the customary asymmetric style .
You might think that simply avoiding comments is the way to go , but you can do a lot better than that .
If you change already - commented code , leave the existing comments in place without updating them .
This is a sure way to send your code ’s hapless readers on a wild - goose chase .
Surprisingly , IDEs can also help you here .
Many IDEs insert boilerplate comments at the beginning of each method and class .
Keeping them there unfilled occupies valuable screen real estate , making your code harder to follow .
Even better , this orderly boilerplate gives the initial impression that the code is well commented , thus increasing the unavoidable subsequent disappointment .
Painful Changes
Regrettably , many of the tricks I ’ve discussed so far can be overcome by the unfortunate practice of refactoring .
This allows a determined killjoy to slowly but surely improve your code ’s quality .
Guard against such accidents , while making the code even more unmaintainable , by ensuring that code changes really hurt .
Modern languages have brought with them the disturbing habit of declaring a specialized type for each different entity you want to model in the code .
Worryingly for you , this can make changes particularly easy , because after a change the compiler will automatically detect any nonmatching types .
You can code around this problem by representing most data as plain numbers and strings .
When you need to group more entities together , just separate them in the string with a delimiter or twiddle an integer ’s bits using the language ’s binary operators .
Also , give a special meaning to negative numbers and , of course , zero .
Some programmers have developed the nasty habit of adding assertions in their code .
Avoid these constructs like the plague .
They tend to provide an early warning when an algorithm or a class ’s state has gone south , depriving everybody the opportunity of countless interesting hours of debugging .
The same goes for providing unit - testing support .
Puzzling Interactions
An additional way to ensure your code is and remains unmaintainable is to booby - trap it , so that nobody ( but , hopefully , you ) can foresee a change ’s effects .
The keyword here is coupling — the more , the better .
Some types of coupling between modules are truly devious .
For instance , you can have two classes implicitly share knowledge of data formats and protocols , or have one class modify another ’s internal workings .
For this to work , it helps if you declare all variables , fields , and methods with the widest possible visibility .
Use globally visible static fields to good effect , communicating through them as if they were global variables , and make your code change its behavior depending on their value .
For added points , have a class ’s methods behave differently depending on the order in which they ’re called , and pass data around in large chunks , even if a method requires only a tiny bit of it .
This will prompt your code ’s readers to come to you to find out which part of the data is really needed .
Byzantine Design
There ’s also ample scope to tie your job security right into the code ’s design .
Deep and wide inheritance trees ; useless abstraction layers ( if anyone dares to ask , claim they might be needed in the future ) ; and incestuous , seemingly random , interactions between classes are your tools of the trade .
Also , lumping together many responsibilities in each class will make it easier for you to create surreptitious links between seemingly unrelated elements .
For added security , make dependencies between packages follow the path of unstable dependencies : everybody should depend on packages whose interfaces change at the slightest provocation .
Earn bonus points by introducing some cyclical dependencies so that changes cascade in a loop .
Icing the Cake
You can ensure that nobody will want to take your job , even without messing with your code , .
If the project takes hours to build ( does n’t support incremental builds ) , other developers will stay away .
Similarly , lack of a test infrastructure will make even the most trivial changes a risky proposition .
Nevertheless , if some brave souls manage to build and ( manually ) test your code , ensure that they wo n’t be able to release it .
Make the project ’s release a manual , lengthy , undocumented , and highly complex procedure that only you can pull off .
By now , you surely realize that providing any external documentation , especially those types that are automatically kept up to date , is a big no - no .
People should come to you for help .
Using a version control system is also problematic because this can leak valuable information regarding the code ’s evolution .
Team Effort
Creating bad code often requires team effort .
By hiring people who write awfully , you can increase the magnitude of the code base on which your job security depends a lot more effectively than you could on your own .
Even better , these developers typically also have difficulty understanding well - written code , further strengthening the case for retaining you .
If you ’re lucky , they ’ll bring their similarly mediocre friends to the team , institutionalizing the practice of writing code that nobody wants to touch .
If you ’re not responsible for hiring decisions , make sure your manager understands that hiring many low - paid , dreadful developers is vastly preferable to hiring a few good ones .
Do n’t waste any time or resources training , tutoring , or mentoring young recruits .
Instead , intimidate them by dumping a mountain of undocumented code on them and let them grapple with it .
When they turn to you for help or , even better , leave for another job , you ’ll appear even more indispensable .
Of course , the effort toward job security can go too far .
A company facing unmaintainable code can simply abandon the specific product ( firing its obviously dreadful development team ) or , failing to keep up with the competition , even go under .
The pity is that nobody will shed a tear for the horrible code that will be left behind .

Reading through some of the contributions on class and atheism I am struck by a glaring omission .
Brown 's opening salvo has been to argue that atheism can be a class thing worn for the status it presumably imparts in certain circles – thus implying that there might not be an intrinsic , intellectual reason for choosing atheism .
Nick Spencer shows that there is indeed a correlation between educational level and atheism .
In the US this phenomenon is far more pronounced : a recent Pew survey shows that among scientists in the US only one - third believe in God , as opposed to 83 % in the general population .
For some reasons it seems to be anathema to say that there might be an intrinsic reason for the correlation between educational level and the rejection of religion : atheism takes training , and is more difficult .
We accept that in medicine , physics and mathematics , but , for reasons of political correctness , it is very much considered a faux pas to say the old 19th - century thing : it takes education to develop a worldview based on science .
It would be even more outrageous to say that the reasons for choosing atheism over religion might actually be valid , as the so - called new atheists have dared to claim .
It seems that it has become something of a class - thing ( not necessarily socio- economic , but of belonging to the politically - correct elite ) to bash Dawkins , Dennett and Hitchens .
Let 's look at some facts and arguments , then .
According to the Pew survey , 85 % of humanity is religious in some way , and that 's probably a low estimate , since nobody knows the true figures about China .
This does n't mean that religion is true ( it can't , because religions contradict each other ) , but that there are strong cognitive and motivational factors that give religions an evolutionary advantage in the market of ideas .
A scientific worldview is cognitively and emotionally more difficult , and hence at a disadvantage .
Cognitive psychologist Howard Gardner has shown that there is an essential difference between the unschooled mind which picks up certain things without formal training and the mature , schooled mind .
The unschooled mind acquires sensorimotor and interpersonal skills , language – and stories .
The human mind is naturally inclined to think in anthropomorphic terms .
A child is more prone to explain the behaviour of dots on a computer screen through intentions and beliefs than through the workings of a computer programme .
Religions primarily function through stories that are easily remembered , because they 're counterintuitive .
We more easily remember stories about people going to heaven , resurrecting the dead and splitting the waters of the sea , because these events ( called " miracles " in religious parlance ) run against what we know about the world .
Hence religions are easily taught from age 3 onwards , and , as Richard Dawkins has pointed out angrily , it is very difficult for humans to let go of stories that have been inculcated by the authority figures we depend on as children .
Complex theories like classical physics ( let alone relativity and quantum physics ) and evolutionary theory can only be taught once the mind achieves the ability to abstract thought ( what Piaget called " formal operations " ) , ie in adolescence .
Understanding these theories requires training , and they are always at a disadvantage vis-a - vis anthropomorphic stories used by most religions .
The disadvantage of the scientific worldview becomes stronger when we include motivational factors .
Modern experimental existential psychology has shown to what extent we humans are incapable of accepting our mortality and the sheer contingency of our existence .
We try everything to hang on to worldviews that protect us from the terrifying knowledge that we might as well not have existed , that each of us will cease to exist as an individual with death , and that our species is but a passing episode on a tiny planet in a minor solar system in one of hundreds of billions of galaxies .
This puts religions at an enormous evolutionary advantage , because their worldviews almost invariably give humans a special place in the universe .
Our existence is wanted by the creator , and we are here for a reason .
The greatest advantage of religions is that almost all major religions promise some form of immortality .
Given our terror of death , this puts religions at a huge advantage over the scientific worldview .
None of what I have said here is new except for recent data .
It has become quite fashionable to bash Dawkins , Dennett , Hitchens et al and to call them " new atheists " as if they say something new .
It is even more fashionable to think that atheism betrays a lack of cultural sensitivity or sophistication , exemplified by Terry Eagleton 's moniker " Ditchkins " , used to make fun of Dawkins and Hitchens .
But basically they restate the very cogent analyses of thinkers like David Hume , Marx , John Stuart Mill , Nietzsche and Freud that explain why humans hang on to the strangest beliefs despite evidence to the contrary .
The critics of the new atheists like Terry Eagleton and Karen Armstrong keep arguing that the true function of religion is not to state facts about the world , but to structure our lives through rituals and to open our eyes to the transcendent dimension .
I beg to differ : while a small minority look for spiritual experience and ritual without buying into the factual assertions of religion , in the end most religious people just have certain beliefs about the world that are comforting , and that 's why they stick to their faiths .
So why , at the onset of the 21st century , is it so difficult to say in this ongoing discussion that religion is psychologically comforting and that this is the reason it has such a strong hold on the human mind ?
I think it is primarily because of the cultural imperative of political correctness not to offend the religious , and the mistaken belief that such pseudo - respect will prevent unrest and strife – even though appeasement has often been counterproductive , as in the case of the fatwa against Rushdie , the relentless fight of the Bible - belt against liberals and evolution in the US , and the ruthlessness of messianic right - wingers in Israel in colonising the West Bank .
While some critics of the " new atheists " have made valid arguments , primarily that their optimistic humanism is far from realistic , they are missing out on a simple point : adhering to a scientific worldview requires discipline ; it requires giving up on the certainties of childhood and the belief in ultimate protection .
I do n't know whether doing so turns us into better human beings , but it certainly makes us intellectually more responsible .

Sen. Susan Collins ( R - ME ) joins her fellow Senator from Maine Olympia Snowe in her support for health care reform .
The Republican Senator signaled Wednesday that she may be open to voting for health care legislation this year although she believes the Finance Committee bill needs substantial improvements .
The Associated Press reports that Collins said in an interview , " My hope is we that can fix the flaws in the bill and come together with a truly bipartisan bill that could garner widespread support , " the Senator continued by saying " I think this bill is far superior to the ones passed by the Senate ( health ) committee and the three House committees , but it needs substantial additional work .
" The $ 829 billion finance bill was approved on Tuesday by a vote of 14 - 9 , with Senator Snowe ( R - ME ) breaking ranks with her Republican colleagues to vote for the bill .
In her official statement released Wednesday Sen. Collins said " There simply is no question that our nation ’s health care system requires substantial reform .
The status quo of soaring health care costs , families struggling , millions uninsured , and health care provider shortages is unacceptable .
Maine families and small businesses are paying ever higher premiums , increased deductibles and greater co-pays .

Church leaders in Cambridge have reacted amusingly to the news that a self - styled “ King of All Witches ” plans to open an Occult Centre in the town .
Lynius Shadee , who claims he can bring back the dead ( “ I can prove it and any sceptic is more than welcome to join me ” ) , says his shop will offer exorcisms , psychic research , communication with ghosts , and witchcraft .
Father David Paul of St Laurence ’s Roman Catholic Church is sceptical of the claims , but still worried :
It will be a shockingly bad thing for Cambridge .
Whilst it is obviously a load of nonsense it will appeal to people who are in distress or are vulnerable .
It really is manipulation of people ’s fears and a complete fraud .
People who go to these things often end up with mental problems .
Another churchman is less concerned about the direct competition the woo - shop would present to his business than he is about the reality of the woo it peddles .
The Rev Ian Church has visited Shadee ’s Occult Centre in Normandy ( its website contains a Donations Page with a useful direct - debit form and last - will - and - testament templates to facilitate bequests to fund the “ groundbreaking work ” Shadee carries out ) .
And the Rev was obviously impressed :
It was quite an experience .
There were several ritual and séance rooms and what really struck us was the intense and extreme cold in the rooms .
Mr Shadee is most certainly an occultist in the truest form and I am of no doubt of the powers he can summon , within the paranormal .
My concerns are that if he is allowed to open an occult centre there would be an epidemic of anti-faiths .
Oh my god .
It would be like Ghostbusters – but in real life !
Shadee ’s claim to be the King of All Witches could also spark some controversy .
The rather large Kevin Carlyon already has a claim on witchy leadership in the UK , and might object to this upstart from Normandy coming over here and trying to take over .
Witch fight !
UPDATE : ( 11:45 ) Cambridge News has more on this Shadee character .
According to that jaw - droppingly credulous report , he used an invocation to call up a demon to prey on worshippers at the Church of Our Lady and the English Martyrs .
He said ,
It ’s an element , a hunter that will attach itself to an individual , then try to take the person , either send them insane and make them depressed , and the worst is to cause them to take their physical life .
All good publicity for his new shop , no doubt .

PHILADELPHIA , Pennsylvania ( CNN ) -- Wendell Potter says he is finished defending the insurance industry , which he says is " beholden to Wall Street . "
Wendell Potter once was a vice president in the public relations department for insurance giant Cigna .
At a hearing last week before the Senate Commerce Committee , the former vice president of corporate communications at the insurance giant Cigna testified , " I know from personal experience that members of Congress and the public have good reason to question the honesty and trustworthiness of the insurance industry . "
The committee 's chairman , Jay Rockefeller , D - West Virginia , told Potter , " You are better than Russell Crowe on ' The Insider , ' " referring to the award - winning 1999 film about cigarette company executive Jeffrey Wigand , who blew the whistle on the tobacco industry 's practices .
In his testimony and during an interview with CNN , Potter described how underwriters at his former company would drive small businesses with expensive insurance claims to dump their Cigna policies .
Industry executives refer to the practice as " purging , " Potter said .
" When that business comes up for renewal , the underwriters jack the rates up so much , the employer has no choice but to drop insurance , " Potter said .
CNN obtained a transcript of a 2008 Cigna conference call with investors in which company executives use the term " purge . "
But in an e-mail to CNN , Cigna spokesman Chris Curran denied the company engages in purging .
" We do not practice that .
We will offer rates that are reflective of the competitive group health insurance market .
We always encourage our clients to compare our proposed rates to those available from other carriers , " Curran wrote .
Cigna had revenue of $ 19.1 billion in 2008 , according to the company Web site .
P
" It was almost like an electrical jolt , " Potter said .
At the event , Potter took pictures of doctors offering free health care to the uninsured .
" The volunteer doctors were seeing patients in barns , people in animal stalls , " Potter said .
" It changed it for me . "
He says he finally decided to quit in 2007 after Cigna 's controversial handling of an insurance claim made by the family of a California teenager , Nataline Sarkysian .
The Sarkysian family made repeated appeals at news conferences for Cigna to approve a liver transplant for the 17 - year - old , who had leukemia .
Cigna initially declined to cover the operation , then reversed its decision .
Sarkysian died hours after the company 's reversal .
As Cigna 's spokesman during the controversy , Potter had no role in the decision to deny coverage .
But he was inundated with angry phone calls .
" After she died , my voice mail and my e-mail inbox were just filled with messages from people who were just outraged , " Potter said .
Do n't Miss In Depth : Money and Main Street
In Depth : Money and Main Street Potter 's blog
Now a senior fellow on health care for the nonpartisan watchdog group Center for Media and Democracy , Potter writes a blog on health care reform .
In particular , he is keeping an eye on efforts to defeat legislation that would give Americans the option of joining a government health care plan , something he now supports .
He says he witnessed how the insurance industry torpedoed health care reform efforts during the Clinton administration .
" They conduct what I call duplicitous PR campaigns .
They 'll say what people want to hear , " Potter says .
" It 's how they operate .
You can not trust these guys . "
Potter is also taking aim at some of the TV commercials aired by groups opposed to changes .
One such ad caught Potter 's eye .
Run by the conservative organization Patients United Now , the ad says that " now , Washington wants to bring Canadian - style health care to the U.S. "
" Sometimes you 'll see misleading information .
And sometimes you 'll see outright lies , like that [ ad ] is , " Potter said , referring to the spot .
Patients United Now spokeswoman Amy Menefee disagreed .
" We 're not saying there 's a Canada health care act of 2009 , " Menefee said .
" It is a trend .
It 's trending in that direction . "
Potter notes that the leading proposals for health care in Congress do not seek to set up Canadian - style health care in the United States .
He says claims that overhauling the system would lead to " rationing " of care are missing his point .
" What we have is rationing by corporate executives who are beholden to Wall Street .
And it happens all the time , " Potter said .

No pain , no gain applies to happiness , too , according to new research published online in the Journal of Happiness Studies .
People who work hard at improving a skill or ability , such as mastering a math problem or learning to drive , may experience stress in the moment , but experience greater happiness on a daily basis and longer term , the study suggests .
" No pain , no gain is the rule when it comes to gaining happiness from increasing our competence at something , " said Ryan Howell , assistant professor of psychology at San Francisco State University .
" People often give up their goals because they are stressful , but we found that there is benefit at the end of the day from learning to do something well .
And what 's striking is that you do n't have to reach your goal to see the benefits to your happiness and well - being . "
Contrary to previous research , the study found that people who engage in behaviors that increase competency , for example at work , school or the gym , experience decreased happiness in the moment , lower levels of enjoyment and higher levels of momentary stress .
Despite the negative effects felt on an hourly basis , participants reported that these same activities made them feel happy and satisfied when they looked back on their day as a whole .
This surprising find suggests that in the process of becoming proficient at something , individuals may need to endure temporary stress to reap the happiness benefits associated with increased competency .
The study examined whether people who spend time on activities that fulfill certain psychological needs , believed to be necessary for growth and well - being , experience greater happiness .
In addition to the need to be competent , the study focused on the need to feel connected to others and to be autonomous or self - directed , and it examined how fulfilling these three needs affects a person 's happiness moment by moment within a day .
For two days , participants reported how they spent each hour , the enjoyment and stress experienced in that hour , and whether the activity met their need for competency , connectedness to others or autonomy .
A second group of participants completed a similar survey , but reported on the day as a whole .
While behaviors that increase competency were associated with decreased happiness in the moment , people who spent time on activities that met the need for autonomy or feeling connected to others experienced increased happiness both an hourly and daily basis .
The greatest increase in momentary happiness was experienced by participants who engaged in something that met their need for autonomy -- any behavior that a person feels they have chosen , rather than ought to do , and that helps them further their interests and goals .
The authors suggest that shifting the balance of needs met in a day could help people find ways to cope with short term stress in the workplace .
" Our results suggest that you can decrease the momentary stress associated with improving your skill or ability by ensuring you are also meeting the need for autonomy and connectedness , for example performing the activity alongside other people or making sure it is something you have chosen to do and is true to who you are , " Howell said .
Relating these momentary gains in happiness to people 's long term life satisfaction , the study found that those who are already satisfied with their life in the long term stand to gain most from the momentary happiness that is derived from feeling connected to others and a sense of autonomy .
" Like a wine connoisseur whose experience means they can appreciate a fine wine more than a novice , people who are already satisfied with their life may have learned how to glean the satisfaction of these needs from their daily activities , " Howell said .
NEW YORK ( Reuters Health ) - Americans of Indian descent may have a heightened risk of diabetes , even when their weight is in the normal range , research suggests .
Researchers found that among more than 7,400 Asian Americans in a national health study , those of Indian descent had roughly three times the risk of diabetes as U.S. whites as a whole , and a higher prevalence of the disease than people of other Asian ethnicities .
Moreover , although type 2 diabetes is closely associated with obesity , Asian Indians ’ risk began to climb even at lower weights .
Among those with weights in the normal range -- as measured by body mass index ( BMI ) , a ratio of weight in relation to height -- about 7 percent had diabetes .
That compared with rates of anywhere from 2 percent to 4 percent among whites and people of other Asian ethnicities .
Among obese adults -- as defined as a BMI of 30 or higher -- one - third of Indian adults had diabetes .
Among other ethnicities , the rate ranged from 12 percent to 17 percent .
The reasons for the findings are not entirely clear , Dr. Reena Oza -Frank and colleagues at Emory University in Atlanta point out in the journal Diabetes Care .
However , the researchers note , ethnic differences in body fat levels and body fat distribution may play a role .
Studies have shown that compared with people of other races and ethnicities , Asians tend to have a higher proportion of body fat at any given weight -- along with a higher type 2 diabetes risk .
It ’s possible that people of Indian background are particularly likely to have body fat distributions -- including more abdominal fat -- that are closely associated with diabetes , according to Oza - Frank and colleagues .
Some studies , the researchers note , have suggested that this may be a factor in the higher diabetes risk seen in Indian adults compared with Europeans .
Because Asian adults tend to have more body fat -- and , therefore , greater health risks at relatively lower weights -- the World Health Organization ( WHO ) has proposed lowering the threshold for how “ overweight ” is defined in Asian populations .
The standard definition of overweight is a BMI of between 25 and 30 ; the WHO recommendation sets that at 23 to 27.5 for Asians .
However , the current findings , Oza -Frank and colleagues write , suggest that for Asian Indians , “ ethnicity alone may be as informative as BMI with regard to diabetes risk . ”
They call for more research into the “ complex relationships ” among body size , body fat and disease risks across different Asian populations .

Walt Disney World Using Native American $ 1 Coins
The Walt Disney World Resort in central Florida near Orlando has just announced plans it is participating in a pilot program with the US Mint .
Under this program , several merchandise and dining locations will now be giving back US Native American $ 1 coins instead of dollar bills as change .
" Our participation in the circulation pilot is part of a continued commitment to environmentality , " states Thomas Smith ( Social Media Director , Disney Parks ) in the official blog about the launch of the program .
" The coin is an environmentally responsible choice — it ’s recyclable and lasts decades longer than paper bills . "
Dollar coins are not a new idea in American coinage .
The US Mint has been producing one version or another off and on since 1794 .
Some familiar examples that you may recall are the Seated Liberty Dollars , the Morgan Dollars , the Peace Dollars and the Eisenhower Dollars .
More recently , the Mint started striking the Sacagawea Dollar in 2000 .
Also known as the " Golden Dollars " for their color , these coins were created as a replacement for the dollar bill .
These Sacagawea Dollars were modified in 2009 as part of the Native American $ 1 Coin Act to include annually changing reverse designs .
The Mint also introduced the Presidential Dollar coins which feature former Presidents of the United States .
The government could save billions if the dollar bill ( which has an average life span of less than two years ) was replaced by a coin ( which can last decades ) .
Most Americans , however , still prefer the bill over the coin , and the government has made little headway .
In an effort to persuade individuals to start using the dollar coins , the Mint has utilized marketing as well as programs such as the one starting in Disney World .
By introducing more of the public to the coins , it is felt they will become more accepted and a phase - out of the dollar bill could eventually occur .
According to Disney , the pilot program will be operated at the following locations now through December 13 , 2009 :
Epcot Theme Park
Liberty Inn
Fife and Drum
Heritage Manor
Kodak Kiosk
AA Carts
Magic Kingdom Park
Columbia Harbor House
Liberty Square Market
Liberty Square Popcorn
Liberty Square Hot Dog
Liberty Square Turkey
Sleepy Hollow
Ye Olde Christmas Shoppe
Haunted Mansion Cart
Heritage House
Yankee Trader

If you or anyone you know still believes the government ( or the media ) tell us only the truth , please pass them this direct admission that lying is a primary strategic device for so - called “ authority figures ” :
Translation : when our elected representatives and their appointed officials believe we need to be manipulated , they rationalize their lies based on whether they think we need them at the time .
I am not naive .
I firmly believe we have a problem with ignorance and sheeple in our country .
However , the only way to fix the problem is to distribute more accurate information — not the opposite .
Further , for those of us who work hard to stay educated , we expect to be treated like adults !
In this specific case , the Treasury Department ’s lies ( via Hank Paulson ) encouraged people to hold their investments .
Therefore , if you listened to Paulson et al , you literally lost your hard earned money and life savings .
Last time I checked , citizens should not expect to get fiscally hosed by their Treasury Secretary .
To be fair , this is not only a Wall Street and Washington problem .
Seemingly , most public discourse these days centers around complete lies , myths , and other rhetorical strategies aiming to put insular interests ahead of what ’s best for the nation .
It ’s time to demand at least our public stewards accurately explain the true state of affairs so we can make informed decisions .
The Church of England will come under more pressure to give up its stake in a controversial mining group after it emerged that the firm supplies materials to India 's nuclear missile programme .
Bauxite mined by Vedanta Resources from a sacred Indian mountain will be used to produce components for the country 's military , the Guardian has learned , bringing a potential conflict between the church 's ethical investment policy and £ 2.5 m stake in the company .
Several local councils also have stakes in the firm .
A spokesman for Vedanta confirmed that bauxite from the mine would be supplied to its Balco subsidiary but insisted that the company was only involved in the production of metals for the weapons , rather than the weapons themselves .
" What these guys sell is the refined aluminium which can then be used for all sorts of things , they are not actually involved in manufacturing weapons , " he said .
Balco supplies 90 % of the aluminium used in India 's nuclear - capable Agni , Prithvi and Akaash missiles .
Vedanta 's plan to mine at Niyamgiri in the eastern state of Orissa has prompted a barrage of criticism from environmental activists , who claim it will displace the 8,000 strong Dongria Kondh tribe and wreck the delicate ecosystem of the area .
The hill is regarded as sacred by the tribe .
Last week activists including Bianca Jagger targeted the British company 's annual meeting , hoping to persuade shareholders to force the company to abandon plans for the mine .
Those shareholders include the Church of England , which has a £ 2.5 m holding in Vedanta .
It has already promised that its Ethical Investment Advisory Group [ EIAG ] will hold talks with the company 's management over the mining plans .
But today 's revelation will heap further pressure on the church , which has a policy of not investing in companies that supply or manufacture armaments .
In a policy document entitled Church Investments and Armaments , the EIAG states that " the church has historically avoided armaments where these constituted the main business or focus of any company .
However a policy review resulted in new criteria being adopted that provides for the complete exclusion of armaments . "
A spokesman for the EIAG said : " We are taking the allegations about Vedanta 's Niyamgiri operations and plans very seriously and we will make our assessment as quickly as possible . "
He said the company had responded promptly to a request for a meeting but because of the holiday season a video conference was not likely to take place before September .
The EIAG is also planning to take up an offer from Vedanta to visit Lanjigarh in Orissa , where the firm has a bauxite refinery , to look at its operations .
Campaigners opposed to the mine said the company 's involvement in the production of nuclear missiles was further reason to oppose the project .
Meredith Alexander , head of trade and corporates at ActionAid said : " Vedanta 's commitment to sustainable development becomes ever more laughable .
The news that Vedanta provides raw materials for weapons systems is outrageous .
" This is just another reason why investors should take a hard look at their holdings in Vedanta .
The Church of England , for example , state that they will not invest in defence companies .
Vedanta 's involvement in missile production surely makes their investment even more controversial . "
Campaigners also want other high profile investors to rethink their involvement .
These include the pension funds of three councils – Hertfordshire and Suffolk county councils and Havering district council .
The list also includes leading fund managers such as Norwich Union Life and Pensions Ltd , Halifax pension fund and Axa Sun Life Assurance Society .
The aluminium alloys needed for India 's Agni , Prithvi and Akaash missiles were developed by Balco , purchased from the Indian government in 2001 by Sterlite Industries – which is owned by Vedanta Resources .
Vedanta has an alumina refinery at Lanjigarh , where from next year bauxite mined at Niyamgiri will be processed , according to its most recent company report .
Once that happens , the company plans to continue to supply part of Lanjigarh 's output to Balco , which states on its website that one of the key clients is the Indian missile programme .
Vedanta was allowed by the supreme court to go ahead with the mine at Niyamgiri despite advice from the court 's central committee that the use of the forest land in an ecologically sensitive area should not be permitted .
In its findings , the committee observed that " the casual approach , the lackadaisical manner and the haste with which the entire issue of forests and environmental clearance for the alumina refinery project has been dealt with smacks of undue favour / leniency " .
Campaigners still believe that they have a chance of overturning the decision , with ActionAid citing a 1989 protest which stopped a Balco mine in the Gandhamardan hill in neighbouring Bargarh district .
Last year the company made a renewed application to mine there too .
" Despite the supreme court ruling , the legal struggle against Vedanta 's proposed mine in Niyamgiri continues , " said Meredith Alexander .
" The Kondh people have now launched a fresh challenge which highlights Vedanta 's environmental record and its dogged refusal to listen to the local community .
Remember when Nokia wanted to give a lesson regarding software patents to Free Software people ?
Like « they ’re ‘m ’kay ?
We know best , m’kay ? »
Well , I was really anxious about the Nokia N900 , the 4th Nokia GNU / Linux internet device which now has the ability to make phone calls !
It ’s an impressive device … cell phone ( 3G , yay ) , camera with enough resolution , GPS , wifi , decent graphics card , powerful processor , a half - decent amount of memory , more than decent storage , etc …
It is also being branded as so “ open ” that software freedom lovers would love it .
This seemed like really good news , no ?
Well , like the saying goes … when it ’s too good to be true … it most probably ain’t .
I tried to figure out how “ open ” the device is , and was n’t really happy .
After more than 70 comments , Quim ( who works at Nokia ) spills the guts :
Nobody claims Maemo is the 100 % free mobile OS and the N900 is the 100 % free mobile device .
I claim is currently the most interesting combination for a free software lover thanks to its standard Linux stack , possibility to modify the platform and access to the root .
The % closed helps Nokia getting a sustainable business model and reaching consumer appeal .
Well , nice claim , but it is the idea that you ( and Nokia ) are selling .
And worse of all , you seem to pretend that in 100 % of an operating system , all % are of equal value .
They ’re not .
The minimum percentage that is proprietary is essential for Nokia ’s GNU / Linux devices to work .
Take it away , and they wo n’t work , or might even burn in your pocket .
Period .
If 100 % freedom is your goal Maemo 5 and N900 is a good starting point .
No it ’s not .
There ’s better if you want 100 % freedom , what OpenMoko started .
The company may now only be selling Freerunners to resellers who want to keep on with the business , but there ’s new sources of hardware showing up ( thanks go mainly to John ‘ MadDog ’ Hall who ’s been in talks with the University of São Paulo , in Brasil ) , so no , the phone is not dead .
It is actually growing a lot better and faster now it ’s free from the corporate strings of OpenMoko , which partly restricted the flow of things .
But I digress , let ’s get back to Nokia and its bullshit and insults to the Free Software community ( I use Free Software because I prefer to talk about freedom , but these insults and bulshit also apply to you , Open Source guys , so pay attention ) .
There ’s a wiki page in Maemo explaining why there are some proprietary software .
That page needs to be passed by the bullshit filter , like I said in my comment , Nokia is far from being friendly to Free Software .
They ’re actually quite aggressive and strongly lobby for the legalization of software patents in Europe .
Do n’t be fooled by the sugar coating , they are not your friend .
So what is in the wiki page after you pass the bullshit filter ?
Brand
We think that “ open source ” reduces our brand value
We think that “ open source ” reduces our brand value Differentiation Proprietary software is much better , just use it
Proprietary software is much better , just use it Legacy
We do n’t want to be shamed by the garbage we forcefeed upon you
We do n’t want to be shamed by the garbage we forcefeed upon you IPR & licensing issues Software Patents are good , just buy the freaking licenses from us .
Software Patents are good , just buy the freaking licenses from us .
Security Since we sell dangerous products , we take your freedom away so you do n’t make the mistake of getting proof they ’re crap ( like their batteries , which the phones must know the limits of )
Since we sell dangerous products , we take your freedom away so you do n’t make the mistake of getting proof they ’re crap ( like their batteries , which the phones must know the limits of )
Third party Just accept that we know best and choose from the best
While the “ security ” aspect could be of some value for some people , let me give you an example of how much crap it is :
Nokia ’s batteries are dumb .
So dumb , in fact , that their phones have to know what batteries they carry in order to not overcharge .
What if the battery was smarter , and had a way to tell the operating system it ’s full ?
If a little company like OpenMoko had it , why would n’t Nokia have it ?
It ’s one of the most dangerous equipments in the phone , so I guess that ’s what they refer to when they talk about security and some of the energy related software is * closed * .
That ’s evidence of crappy hardware .
Sorry , disappointing .
Will wait for the competition unless this changes .
BTW , someone said that even OpenMoko has some proprietary software … well , as Mickey Laurer explained it …
« There ’s a difference between closed firmware providing a standard protocol and a proprietary ASIC providing a closed - source binary driver using a proprietary command language to talk to the hardware .
None of the Nxx tablets are fully functional with free software .
The FreeRunner is . »
Indeed it is !
root@om - gta02 ~ $ cat / proc /sys / kernel / tainted 0
So there you go !
There ’s much better , in terms of freedom , so do n’t settle for less just because it ’s fancier .
Demand more !
It ’s your right as a software user , and your power as a consumer .
HDDs always say somewhere on them do not cover this hole .
However that only makes me want to plug it up and then laugh for a good 5 minutes like some evil genius from a movie .
But really what the heck is this hole for ?
If it allowed dust to get in then the drive would fubar so then how can it be used for anything ?
I have plugged it before on two old 40gb hdd that I wraped with duct tape to fit into a ramen box and .... they worked fine .
Its not like covering the hole made the drives implode or anything .
My only two guesses are that they allow it to cool better , but then again how could one little hole that cant allow dust in cool anything for # $ %^ , or that it allows the drive to equalize pressure with the outside .
so my question basically is what the heck is the hole for and does it matter if you cover it ?
Chatham Borough , New Jersey ( CNN ) --
The janitor charged in the slaying of a priest answered a call from a 911 operator and said , " Everything 's fine , " according to police .
Jose Feliciano stabbed the Rev. Ed Hinds 32 times with a knife after the two got into an argument on Thursday , Morris County Prosecutor Robert Bianchi said .
The Roman Catholic priest 's body was found in the rectory of at St. Patrick 's Church on Friday morning .
Feliciano , 64 , has been employed with the church for 17 years , Bianchi said .
Feliciano also faces two weapons charges , Bianchi said at a news conference .
It was not immediately known whether the janitor had retained legal counsel .
When the janitor was interviewed Saturday , after waiving his Miranda rights , he " confessed to the murder of Father Hinds , " an arrest affidavit said .
The priest 's body was discovered Friday morning in the rectory kitchen by Feliciano and others , according to the affidavit .
An autopsy had concluded that Hinds died of " multiple sharp force injuries . "
Hinds had stab wounds to his upper torso and the back of his head , Bianchi said .
The priest also had defensive wounds on his hands and contusions and bruises to his face , he said .
Hinds called 911 from his cell phone at 5:11 p.m.
Thursday , saying he was being attacked and asking for help , Bianchi said .
The call was cut off and the 911 operator called back , Bianchi said .
He said Feliciano answered the phone .
The operator could n't send authorities because the calls were made from a cell phone and could not be traced , Bianchi said .
Feliciano " made a half - hearted attempt to do CPR in front of police .
They said it was bizarre .
He made about two or three compressions and said something like , ' he 's dead , ' " Bianchi told CNN .
The affidavit said authorities discovered that Hinds ' cell phone had been used in Easton , Pennsylvania , about 40 miles west of Chatham .
Further investigation led them to a garbage can in a park there , where a T - shirt and rags " saturated with what appeared to be blood " were found , the affidavit said .
The garbage can was about 50 yards from Feliciano 's home , it said .
Feliciano told police that he entered the rectory around 5 p.m.
Thursday , where he and the priest argued , the affidavit said .
The two men got into an argument " over Feliciano 's continued employment , " Bianchi told CNN .
He said Feliciano " beat him up first , there was also bruising on his face , " said the prosecutor .
Feliciano left Hinds on the kitchen floor and went into the church to get a kitchen " steak or paring " knife , and returned and stabbed the priest , the prosecutor said .
After the slaying , Feliciano said he cleaned up the blood with rags and paper towels and put them in a black bag , which he put in the trash can , the affidavit said .
Feliciano also said he threw away the knife after returning home and destroyed Hinds ' cell phone .
Bianchi said the suspected weapon was found in a field near Feliciano 's home .
Hinds also oversaw the church 's Catholic grade school .
" When you 're the sole pastor and you do most of the baptisms and weddings and funerals , people end up loving you .
This will be a big loss for the parish and a big loss for the diocese , " said the Rev. Paul Manning from the Archdiocese of Paterson , New Jersey .
CNN 's Susan Candiotti contributed to this report .
What do you get when you combine the most outlandish gaffes of Anne Coulter , the most awkward monologues of Sarah Palin , the senility of the crazy McCain Lady , filter any remaining logic out of it and give it a keyboard in Manhattan ?
The answer is the looniest blogger ever : Pamela Geller .
If you are unaware of who Pamela Geller is then we apologize for bringing her being into your world , but she is all too familiar to those of us who browse the internet and have come across her shrill and plainly insane blogging on Atlas Shrugs .
( Given the amount of hallucinations on that blog , Atlas Shrugs should properly be renamed Atlas Drugs ) .
What is it though that Pamela believes in ?
What does she blog about ?
Pam has the distinction of being the originator and pusher of some of the most vile and obscene conspiracy theories on the internet .
Mostly dealing with Islam and Muslims but also Barack Obama , and the two are combined — A LOT .
In one of her recent tirades titled , CNN Tells , Sells More Lies About Palin — it ’s Time to Expose the truth about Obama , Geller writes ,
So why not tell the truth about Obama and his reported strange sexual predilections ?
My question is , it is well known that Obama allegedly was involved with a crack whore in his youth .
Very seedy stuff .
Why are n’t they pursuing that story ?
Find the ho , give her a show !
Here she calls on CNN to investigate Obama ’s “ strange sexual predilections . ”
She also says that it is “ well known ” but then sneaks in “ allegedly ” that Obama was “ involved with a crack whore in his youth . ”
This is just the beginning of the craziness .
She then goes on to state that she believes that President Obama ’s trip to Pakistan in the 80’s was originally to go for drugs but that he became indoctrinated into Jihad .
Back in the early 80 ’s , there were only two reasons to travel to Pakistan .
Jihad or drugs .
I think he went for the drugs and came back with jihad .
( He did , after all , change his name to Barack Hussein Obama from Barry Soetoro , upon his return from that trip ) .
Real good investigative work Pam !
He changed his name to what had always been his name and that shows that he is a Jihadist ?
For the uber - racist Pam Geller , drugs is a connotation for Black and Jihad is a connotation for Muslim ; a Black man can only travel to get drugs , and a Muslim country can only offer travelers Jihad .
Additionally , Pam Geller has an unhealthy obsession with Obama ’s mother , Stanley Ann Dunham .
For Pam the old adage do not speak ill of the dead has no resonance , in fact she ca n’t even stop her self from speaking slanderous lies about the dead .
Pam , that ever - vigilant firecracker of a reporter broke a story that “ even CNN did n’t care to touch . ”
What was this highly neglected breaking story ?
Obama is the illegitimate son of Malcolm X !
In her 50,000 word rant , Pam Geller toys with all sorts of theories including the suggestion that Obama ’s mom somehow had an amorous hook up with Malcolm ?
Barack Hussein Obama Jr Malcolm X Barack Hussein Obama Sr. Barack Hussein Obama Sr. , Tom Mboya , and Philip Ochieng , all share common physical features of the Kenyan Luo tribe : Modest stature under six feet , round faces , small chins , wide set eyes , slanted back foreheads , and retracted hairlines … none of these features are shared by Malcolm X and Barack Hussein Obama Jr .
She then goes on a long and wide conspiratorial line trying to link Barack ’s mother with Malcolm X , and all the possibilities of how they could have hooked up .
If you read the post , beware that it is long , like sleuthing through a swamp .
In a most bizarre jab at Obama ’s mom , Geller wonders aloud why CNN is n’t pursuing some “ story ” about the “ alleged ” nude “ pornographic ” pictures taken of Obama ’s mom by Frank Marshall Davis !
Why is n’t CNN pursuing the nude pornographic photos of Obama ’s mom … I never ran the pics , as it was unseemly and was n’t relevant .
But this assault on Palin is too disgusting .
It ’s time to tell the ugly truth about the enemy in the White House and his whores in the media .
Maybe CNN and the “ whores in the media ” are n’t running this story because it is a non-story with no news value ?
Or maybe because it is a figment of a loony blogger ’s imagination with no thread of truth in it ?
Or maybe because it has nothing to do with the job performance of that “ Negro Mooslim enemy ” in the White House ?
That is another card in the loonieness that is Pamela Geller .
She believes Obama is an enemy , i.e. according to her he is a Muslim .
On the end - of - times loon website World Net Daily , Geller wrote this hysterical post titled Obama ’s Islam : Now He Tells Us ,
We should have seen all this coming .
Obama deceitfully hid his Muslim background and schooling and his agenda .
I started writing about Obama ’s religious Muslim background in January 2007 , and throughout 2007 and 2008 I presented evidence of Obama ’s identification as a Muslim when he was a child , his extremist Muslim family and his Islamic schooling .
In December 2007 , I wrote , “ Barack Obama went to a madrassa in Jakarta .
A madrassa in a Muslim country .
Whether he was devout or secular , he knows what was taught .
He knows what is in the Quran .
Even if he is ambiguous , he knows the stakes involved .
His father was a Muslim who took three wives ( without divorcing ) .
His stepfather and close members of his family are devout Muslims .
Not an unimportant influence . ”
And who can forget Obama ’s bald - faced lies to the Jews ?
In February 2008 , Obama told Jewish leaders : “ If anyone is still puzzled about the facts , in fact I have never been a Muslim . ”
Yet he was registered as a Muslim in an Indonesian school …
And so now we have our first Muslim presidency , just eight years after 9/11 .
The media can spin their subjugation and adulation a million different ways , but America did not vote for a “ Muslim presidency , ” which is what this is .
Everything this president has done so far has helped foster America ’s submission to Islam .
If that were n’t enough then you could predict what comes next .
Not only is Obama the illegitimate son of Malcolm X , not born in America , on top of all that it is obvious that since he is a Muslim he must also be an anti-Semite !
Every decision , every move , every policy decision the President has made in regards to Israel has been the act of …. an anti-semite .
So there you have it the Mooslims are taking over !
In fact they have already taken over America , so much so that we have a Mooslim president , who is anti-Semitic , sired by the fire breathing Malcolm X , his mom was a whore , and oh yeah somewhere in there he is also a socialist !
That comes to you courtesy of the Looniest Blogger Ever !
Her blog remains “ popular , ” the adjective “ popular ” however may be a bit misleading as it seems to be popular only with crazies who espouse openly bigoted views .
A glance at her comments section demonstrates this ,
Posted by : En français | Monday , August 31 , 2009 at 07:56 AM
What is a man with the name Matthew Polombo doing as the secretaey general of something called the Somali Youth Action ?
To build this big Islamic style complex exclusively for Moslem Somalis in Minneapolis means someone thinks they are there to stay ….. but as soon as we get rid of the Monster in the White House , we will get rid of them .
Since they were imported , the crime rate has soared .
They were criminals in Somalia , so they are also criminals in America and have no idea of American ideals and way of life .
This sport center would be a hatching center for more crimes against Americans who do n’t want them , did n’t ask them to come and want to get rid of them .
The people of Minneapolis are insanely stupid if they allow this Obamanation to materialize .
Posted by : Sarastro | Monday , August 31 , 2009 at 07:57 AM
WTF ?!?!?
How many dang Somalis do we have here that they need a frickin’ Youth Center ?
WhoTF needs Somalis here anyway ?
What ?
Are they the world ’s best meat - packers ?!?!?
Yeah , and I know . . . when the Muslims say “ prevent ” violence they mean “ promote ” violence .
Yeah , right .
Separate gyms and pools , a place to get married , and maybe a hall or two in which to teach hatred and strategy for Islamic Supremacy ?
This article is just more evidence that Muslims , ( may their prophet be damned , ) have no desire to assimilate or become Americans in support of America .
These comments are just a sampling of what passes as polite discourse on Atlas Shrugs , to get further acquainted with her and the loonieness of her commenters just parse through the comment section there , you will be truly mortified .
Update : Pamela
Geller now claims she never penned the Malcolm X article , and that she does n’t support the theory that Malcolm X is the father of Barack Obama .
However , she never made any such qualifier when she originally posted the piece on her site .
Which begs the question , why , if she did n’t believe what was written did she post it under her name ?
How can she not understand how insane it is , even for someone who believes Obama was n’t born in America , to think he was the illegitimate son of Malcolm X , let alone give credence to such loony conspiracies by posting it on her site ?
Update II : Pamela Geller calls for the destruction of the Golden Dome .
Update III : Obama is a Mooslim , Jihadist , Pimp , anti-Semite who is aiding the Iranian Nuclear program
Update IV : Sharia
Coke is taking over the world , it is defamation of Judaism and Christianity for Islam to include Moses and Jesus as Prophets of Islam .
Update V : Pamela Geller is a Holocaust Revisionist who claims that Hitler and the Nazis adopted Jihad
Update VI : Not only is Obama a secret Muslim , but according to Pamela Geller , “ Obama is bringing his jihad to Illinois … Obama ’s treachery is breathtaking . “
Update VII : Pamela Geller calls for the nuking of Mecca , Medina , and Tehran
Update VIII : Pamela Geller promotes a genocidal video
Update IX : Pamela Geller shows sympathy towards white supremacist
Update X : Screenshot of Pamela Geller ’s post on June 25th wherein she posted a video claiming that Muslims engage in bestiality
Update XI : Pamela Geller left speechless when called out for drawing a picture of the Prophet Muhammad with a pig ’s face

Here are a few examples of how this approach pays off for clients :
What are investment firms with best returns ?
The world of the stock market is full of risks and financial tasks that are to be taken care of .
The rise and fall of stocks are an unpredictable job .
Therefore , companies , trusts , organizations , and even individuals hand over this task to investment or wealth management firms .
These firms consist of traders , brokers , and analysts who are experts and professionals in the stock market trading .
The job of these people is to invest the money of their clients in potential stocks that can result in maximum profit .
While doing so , they are allowed to take risks only to an extent that can be afforded by the client .
The firms work day and night to invest in the right stocks on behalf of their clients .
What are the tasks performed by Investment firms with the best returns ?
As mentioned above , the major tasks of investment firms include the following three steps :
Assess the financial condition of the client – Each person , company , or organization is one of their kind .
Therefore , it is important to assess their requirements , risk potential , and affording capacity by assessing their financial condition .
Investment firms cater to the needs of large global corporations as well as individuals .
Hence , it becomes mandatory to analyze the financial condition of each client and make investments accordingly .

Monitor potential investments – After investing the money of the client in the potential stocks and shares , the firm monitors it closely every moment to ensure no risk is taken and maximum profit can be extracted from each investment .
– After investing the money of the client in the potential stocks and shares , the firm monitors it closely every moment to ensure no risk is taken and maximum profit can be extracted from each investment .
Plan out investment strategies –
After analyzing the financial status of a client , the firm lays out a plan or investment strategy that defines the measures and guidelines to be followed while making investments for that particular client .
The firm can take risks on behalf of the client only to an extent that can be afforded by the client and that holds the minimum possible loss .
Advance financial near me .
How do investment firms with best returns make money ?
The whole concept , aim , and objective is to make maximum profit on investments made for the client .
The firm charges a management fee to the client that is fixed .
Apart from that , it is responsible for a fixed percentage of the amount that is earned from the investments in form of a profit .
Therefore , the more profit is earned on the investments , the more is given to the investment firms with the best returns .
Drawbacks of hiring an investment or wealth management firm
Investment or wealth management firms provide excellent service and assistance .
However , there are some qualities of their working mechanisms that create a negative impact on the client .
Some of the drawbacks of using a wealth or investment management firm with best returns are listed below :
Costs –
The investment firms charge very high fees and therefore , it becomes tough for clients and individuals that have started their business recently and are new in the market to afford these services .
– The investment firms charge very high fees and therefore , it becomes tough for clients and individuals that have started their business recently and are new in the market to afford these services .
Actively - managed investment –
The whole idea of subscribing to wealth management services is to invest in the right stocks at the right time .
As talked earlier , the stock market changes every second and one can never predict it .
Also , it is practically impossible for an individual or corporation to keep track of each and every fluctuation in the stock market while handling their work at the same time .
However , investment firms with the best returns are not that efficient in doing their job sometimes .
This drives the clients to look out for other options like standard stock market index agencies .
Account funding for investment firms
When a client signs up himself with an investment firm , the firm creates an account for the client .
The account contains all the necessary information about the client .
It can be an individual , a company , corporation , organization , trust , or any similar group .
All information and details about the investments made for the client are added to the account .
These include buying and selling shares , the names of the shares and companies where the money has been invested , details about that company , its performance in the stock market in recent times as well as in the long - term , and the profit or loss obtained from that particular investment .
The account holds all details of each and every single investment that is made for the client .
Also , these accounts are funded through the client directly to supplement their investments .
The money is transferred in the account by the owner and the same is used by the investment firms with best returns to make investments in stocks and shares of different companies on part of the client .
It is an all - in - one account where the client can access all his investments , profit , loss , and deposits in one place .
This makes the procedure very convenient as the client will not be required to spend hours studying the investments and their results .
Investment Firm Trading Costs
Trading costs are the costs that are incurred by the firm to perform the buying and selling of funds .
The firm takes care of all the investments on behalf of the client .
Therefore , the firm charges a minimum management fee for the same .
Additionally , all investments and funding require a maintenance cost that is required to be paid from time to time .
Trading costs cover the same .
These trading costs are paid by the client at the beginning when the client chooses an investment firm with the best returns to manage their assets .
Without traders , brokers , and analysts working round the clock for making investments , stock market trading cannot be performed effectively .
It is really beneficial for the client as it saves time and effort .
Investment or wealth management firms have grown immensely across the globe in recent times .
They have delivered excellent assistance and services to their clients from time to time .
With thousands of employees , analysts , professionals , and experts sitting in their offices and working round the clock , the client does not need to worry about missing an opportunity .
This is no small thing in Greece .
As Diane Kochilas wrote in the New York Times , " If there were a culinary equivalent of the Elgin Marbles for the Greeks , that would surely be their white , tangy national cheese , feta .
But unlike the famous carvings from the Parthenon , which Lord Elgin carted off two centuries ago , the country 's national cheese was recently returned to Greece by the European Union . "
The bottom line ?
If I had my way , people would start to put feta up there on their lists with all the other greats .
It 's already , as you can tell , on mine .
For what it 's worth , too , I can tell you that feta -- from the same artisan source we buy from at the Deli -- is one of only four non-British or Irish cheeses that they sell at Neal 's Yard Dairy in London .
So when you next think about the great cheeses of the world , at least give good feta a chance to get to the top .
But there are radical differences from one feta to another .
If one stops to think about this , it 's probably pretty obvious -- what traditional food item ( or any product for that matter ) can you think of that does n't appear in the marketplace with a wide variety of quality options ?
Everyone knows that raw milk farmhouse cheddar is likely to be radically better than some factory version .
But the problem is that , when it comes to feta , there 's generally been very little discussion of one brand being different or better tasting than another .
Recipes just call for " feta " as if it were some generic , insurance - subsidized drug .
My point here is that , in real life , there is a huge , huge range of feta qualities you can choose from .
And what you pick is going to have a radical impact on your eating experience .
The best fetas , quite simply , taste way , way better !
That 's all there is to it !
NEXT : All types of feta are not created equal -- here 's one that 's a cut above the rest

OBSOLETE CONTENT
This page documents the MELT branch ( which I previously called Basilys ) - see the paper in the 2007 GCC Summit Proceedings , Multi-stage construction of a global static analyser by Basile Starynkevitch , pages 143 - 152 and the MELT paper in the GROW09 workshop ( inside Hipeac09 ) .
Recent slides are gcc - melt - tutorial - oct2010.pdf ( MELT tutorial GCC Summit 2010 ) , here ( MELT slides november 2009 ) and RMLL 2010 slides ( july 2010 ) here .
This work is motived by static code analysis , and more generally any other middle - end specific processing ( which would go inside a plugin ) .
The basic insight of MELT is that C is a too low level language to code compilers ( and their plugins ) , in particular their middle end passes , notably those passes which are specific and should be prototyped quickly !
This view is in contrast with the popular ( and still wise ) opinion that a compiler should be coded in the language it compiles ( but MELT is coded in MELT ) .
MELT is a domain specific language to develop GCC extensions ( it is actually tailored to fit strongly into GCC ) .
You hopefully will increase your productivity by coding your GCC extensions in MELT , however you need to learn some basics of GCC internals ( major internal representations like Gimple and Tree , overview of GCC passes ) , and also to learn the MELT language .
Discussions in english about GCC MELT should go on the gcc@gcc.gnu.org mailing list .
A discussion group in French on GCC MELT is available on gcc-melt - french googlegroup .
availability and download
The MELT subversion repository is the GCC MELT branch on svn://gcc.gnu.org/svn/gcc/branches/melt-branch - a tarball snapshot for a GCC 4.5 MELT plugin is given in the MELT tutorial page ( but retrieving thru svn is much preferable ) .
The MELT branch has an incomplete but existing gcc-internals documentation ( run make pdf to get it ) .
An older version of this documentation is attached to the MELT tutorial wiki page .
Why MELT can be useful to you ?
MELT is useful for the same reasons that ( big ) GCC plugins ( or extensions ) will be useful , and MELT can be viewed as a tool to easier code GCC extensions ( like those provided by plugins ) in .
MELT permit ( perhaps more easily than coding big GCC plugins in C ) to tailor the GCC to suit it to your own specific need , e.g .
coding specific passes adding more diagnostics for a given software .
For instance , once could code in MELT ( easier than in C ) a GCC pass which checks that every call to fopen is tested against NULL in the same routine .
Such a pass is specific to the standard C library providing fopen .
One could imagine than major free software ( like the linux Kernel , the GTK or QT graphical toolkit , the Apache server , ... ) might want to develop their specific GCC extensions e.g. in MELT to do some checks specific to that software .
coding specific passes adding more optimizations for a particular software .
For instance , one could code in MELT ( easier than in C ) a few GCC passes which optimize every call to fprintf ( stdout , ... ) into printf ( .... ) .
Doing this inside the compiler ( in particular , in a pass called after inlining ) is easier than doing it outside .
Very probably , current big free software offer analogue optimization possibilities .
optimizing a given big software to some particular ( hardware or operating ) system .
GCC offers a wide set of tuning parameters , and one could probably tune them to fit into some particular variant of a target ( e.g. a system on chip with an ARM or PowerPC inside ) .
refactoring , or aspect oriented programming , or software metrics or quality or navigation can also be improved by your GCC extensions .
any other GCC extensions you want or need , in particular if it is big enough to justify learning a new specific language .
MELT can probably be useful to any person wanting to develop specific GCC extensions thru plugins , provided these are big enough to justify learning a new domain specific language .
MELT is probably not interesting if you want to develop a tiny GCC plugin ( but be aware that plugins tend to grow significantly ) , or if you want to develop a new feature for the core GCC ( not thru a plugin ) , i.e. some pass that you want to push inside the GCC trunk ( but you could prototype it in MELT ) .
Basic hints for coding GCC extensions in MELT
Some hints for newcomers ; most of the hints here also apply to people considering coding a GCC plugin in C .
You first need to grasp GCC main internal representations ( notably Tree & Gimple & Gimple / SSA ) .
There are several documents about them ( including the source files gcc / tree.def and gcc / gimple.def and their comments and the internal GCC documentation ) ; read them first !
You then need to understand a little bit the organization of the GCC passes .
Perhaps a good way to feel how GCC passes work is first to build a very small C ( or Fortran or Ada ) source code example yourexample .c illustrating your needs in a new ( otherwise empty ) directory , and to run there something like gcc - S - fverbose - asm - O2 - fdump - tree - all yourexample . c
This will fill your directory with a lot of dump files ( about a hundred or two ) like yourexample .
c.004t.gimple or yourexample.c.080t.copyprop3 .
These dump files are partial textual representations of the various intermediate representations ( usually Gimple ) of your code .
By glancing inside them with a textual editor , you will understand what the compiler did , and perhaps be able to choose the pass after which your MELT extension ( or GCC plugin in C ) has to work .
You will often have to add your own ( one or few ) passes , preferably coded in MELT , and you need to understand where ( after which existing GCC pass ) will you insert your own pass ( or passes ) coded in MELT .
You also have to look for examples of MELT processing , in files like melt / xtramelt *. melt .
Feel free to ask for help .
Small MELT overview
The MELT branch contains several ( related ) stuff .
It can also be compiled as a GCC plugin .
See MELT tutorial for details .
Everything can be enabled or disabled at GCC configure time or at GCC run time :
a Lisp dialect compiled into C code , with which one can code middle end passes a runtime which extends the GCC infrastructure to support the previous items , in particular a generational copying garbage collector well suited for the lisp dialect above , which is build above the existing GGC ( which deals with old values ) .
All this work was and is ( partly ) funded by the french Ministery of Economy ... in the past thru ITEA within the GlobalGCC project and in 2010 - 2011 by the OpenGPU project .
The MELT branch has been created on february 19th 2008 and you can get it for readonly with svn checkout svn://gcc.gnu.org/svn/gcc/branches/melt-branch/ and for read - write ( assuming you have an account ) with svn checkout svn+ssh://yourusername@gcc.gnu.org /svn/gcc/branches/melt-branch/
( replacing yourusername with appropriate login ) .
inkin My ( Basile Starynkevitch's ) contributions to GCC are covered by the copyright transfer signed by CEA to FSF , reference RT306238 which I have announced here
The MELT branch follows quite closely the GCC trunk ( which is usually merged more than weekly into MELT ) .
If you want to try quickly and easily MELT , you should use the Plugin version of MELT .
You can find the last build at the MELT page .
You need at least GCC 4.6 with plugin support ( compiled with -- enable - plugin ) and the related development package .
Installation is detailled in the README .
In practical terms , MELT is quite resource consuming ; more precisely , the compilation of the C generated code by a C compiler ( usually GCC itself ) is the major bottleneck .
However , some recent progress has been made ( by splitting some MELT files , and by improving the C code generator , notably by shrinking the huge initialization routine of each module by moving some code into several smaller static routines . ) .
We suggest compiling MELT on a 4Gb RAM machine , or not passing any optimization flag when compiling the generated C code .
( This is unrelated to the flags used to compile your own code in a MELT enabled GCC ) .
More details here .
You can find some performance tests here .
MELT motivation
MELT is a high - level Lisp - like language designed to fit very closely in GCC internal representations , thru an automated translation of MELT code into GCC specific C code , compiled by a C compiler ( usually some GCC ) and then loaded as plugins .
This enables easier development of high - level static analysis and transformation , working on GCC middle end representation ( GIMPLE tuple ) .
summary of motivations
The motivations are detailed in the GCC Summit 2007 papers ; in a few words
Coding passes in a LISP dialect is more fun and easier to the human developer .
Some of these MELT passes ( related to static analysis ) are expected to run for a very long time .
These peculiar passes are very rarely run ( and only explicitly ) .
It is worthwhile ( and in the spirit of Lisp ) to generate MELT / Lisp code during such very time consuming passes .
So some passes might profit of dynamic code generation ( at the meta - level ) during them .
Hence the MELT infrastructure should be able to generate some ( specialized ) code ( as C files ) , to compile it into a dynamically loadable stuff ( e.g. *. so shared objects on Linux / ELF ; or *.la file with libtool ) , and to dynamically load it ( all this during the same peculiar cc1 execution ) .
The MELT branch should generate C code during cc1 execution ( the C code is translated from LISP internally ) - it is important that it happens during execution of the cc1 process ( because the whole idea is to be able to generate and then execute code during some very time consuming MELT passes ) .
This C code is compiled into a dynamically loadable stuff ( usually a *.so ) and dynamically loaded by dlopen ( see function compile_to_dyl in file gcc / melt - runtime.c in the MELT branch ) .
MELT Lisp dialect
The Lisp dialect is a Lisp1 ( so more a Scheme than a Common Lisp w.r.t. names and bindings ) dialect able to handle both boxed and some unboxed values .
You can define primitives ( which get translated to C ) , for example the ( unboxed ) integer addition is already defined as ( defprimitive +i ( : long a b ) : long " ( ( " a " ) + ( " b " ) ) " ) the first : long occurrence describes the types of the formal arguments a and b , the second occurrence describes the result .
There is an minimal object system ( single - inheritance hierarchy , rooted at CLASS_ROOT .
S - exprs are objects .
Values can be MELT objects , closures , vectors , lists ( a linked list of pairs , with pointers to first and last pair ) , pairs , etc ... boxed integers or boxed GCC trees or hashtables ( of objects , of trees , .. ) etc ...
Every value has a discriminant ( a MELT object ) which is its class for objects .
Adding support for other GCC datatypes is very easy .
Tail - recursion is not handled ( looping should use the forever keyword , and loops are can be exit ed ) .
the let keyword is like let* in Scheme ( binding sequentially ) .
MELT compiler implementation
It should be stressed that the MELT compiler ( actually inside cc1 ) is translating MELT Lisp dialect S - exprs ( either from a file or in memory ) into a ( huge ) C file , which is usually compiled into a dynamically loadable stuff and then dynamically loaded ( all in the same cc1 process ) .
The MELT compiler is written in MELT ( files warmelt *.melt ) , and a CommonLisp variant ( file contrib / cold - basilys.lisp for Clisp ) was coded to bootstrap it .
The MELT compiler ( see function compile_list_sexpr in warmelt - outobj.melt ) proceeds in several steps .
a list of S - exprs ( these are MELT objects of CLASS_SEXPR ) is given , either by parsing a MELT file or because it is in memory .
An initial environment is also given ( could be empty for the particular case of warmelt - first. melt ) .
the first step is macro-expansion .
Every S - expr is macro expanded , usually into some subclass of CLASS_SRC ( it is a source element ) ; for example the if MELT keyword occurrence expands to an instance of CLASS_SRC_IF but most S - expr are just plain function or primitive applications .
Then a normalization phase occur .
Each source element is normalized ( into a subclass of CLASS_NREP ) by adding additional let bindings .
For example ( F ( G X ) 2 ) becomes something equivalent to ( LET ( ( GG ( G X ) ( FF ( F GG 2 ) ) ) FF ) where FF and GG are fresh .
Then a compilation phase is called .
It transforms the normalized stuff into some abstract syntax tree ( in subclasses of CLASS_OBJCODE ) which mimics a subset of C .
At last , this forest of OBJCODE -s is pretty - printed as C code .
The generated C code is compiled into a shared object which is dynamically loaded ( as any plugin ) .
The C code should be compilable without the GCC source or build directory ( once this GCC has been installed ) because included files for the C code plugin would be saved elsewhere ( e.g. in some melt - private - include / subdirectory ) .
This is discussed here
current state
You need , in addition of all libraries used by GCC trunk ( like mpfr and gmp ) :
the libtldl development ( ie with headers ) library from the libtool dynamic loader - libtldl is a dlopen replacement to dynamically load code at runtime .
The Parma Polyhedra Library ( PPL ) .
It is also needed by Graphite , recently ( end of August 2008 ) merged into trunk .
You need at least PPL version 0.10.2 or a very recent GIT snapshot .
PPL 0.10 wo n't work , so you probably would need to build PPL from its source .
Essentially a fairly recent GNU / Linux system .
I do n't know anything else .
Maybe it might later work on some other systems .
I 'm using Debian / Sid or Debian / Lenny on AMD64 .
Some nice guy ( named Rob ) was able to build MELT on a Solaris x86 system ( but I needed to correct some linuxisms in the code ) .
Some significant amount of RAM ( because the generated warmelt *.c ( or warmelt * - 0.c ) are huge and contain a big , but simple , routine ) .
I have a 4 Gb RAM machine .
A fairly recent version of GTK to compile the contrib / simple - probe.c
Current ( may 2009 ) state ( quite messy , notably for building ) :
* the configure .ac should be usable , but you have to rebuild all configure files ( see the Regenerating_GCC_Configuration page for details ) and re configure with -- with - ppl .
Currently I ( Basile ) use the following configure command : $ GCCTOP / configure --enable-maintainer -mode --enable-checks=tree , gc --enable-languages=c --disable-bootstrap --disable - multilib \
--with-ppl=/usr/local /
Regenerating the configure file is necessary because the configure file is not svn commit -ed on the branch ( to avoid conflicts when merging with the trunk ) .
* the runtime ( including a copying generational garbage collector ) should be usable ( but was painful to debug ) files gcc / melt - runtime.c and gcc/melt - runtime.h
and a melt / README -MELT
* Since rev136289 MELT has bootstrapped : the generated files warmelt *.c are compiled into warmelt *. so plugins which are able to generate the very same warmelt * - 0. c from melt / warmelt *. melt .
Hence the files warmelt -*- 0.c are in the SVN repository but they are quite big .
rev136409 corrected a bug ( crashing on x86/32 bits ) .
The generated gcc / warmelt -*- 0. c files are quite big , and generated by translating gcc / melt / warmelt -*. melt ( Lisp MELT ) files .
You probably need at least 2 Gb of RAM to have them compiled with gcc - fPIC - O2 into gcc / warmelt -*. so files in the build directory .
If you have less memory , consider compiling them without optimisations ( ie - O0 ) , e.g. by editing some * melt - cc - script shell script , or by compiling or configuring gcc with CFLAGS= - O0 .
tiny tutorial about MELT
A very incomplete tutorial about MELT .
Working knowledge of Scheme , CommonLisp ( or at least EmacsLisp ) is supposed .
See also preferably the MELT tutorial page which explains how to use and code in MELT .
MELT data
MELT data come in two flavors .
unboxed data - this data is not a MELT value ; typical examples are : : long ( the C long integer ) ;
: tree ( the naked GCC tree structure pointer , as defined in tree.h ) ;
: cstring ( constant C strings , outside of any heap or stack ) ; etc .
Adding new flavors of MELT unboxed data is quite simple but requires some C code .
boxed data are MELT values allocated in the MELT heap .
In particular : MELT objects
MELT integers are boxed integers .
MELT trees are boxed GCC trees .
MELT string maps ( hash tables associating strings to MELT values )
MELT object maps ( hash tables associating MELT objects to MELT values ) .
MELT tree maps ( hash tables associating GCC tree -s to MELT values ) .
This is the preferred way to associate information to GCC trees .
MELT tuples are sequence of MELT values .
MELT closures .
MELT lists are single - linked lists which keep the first & last node of the list ,
MELT pairs are like cons-es in LISP .
MELT lists ' nodes are MELT pairs .
etc .
See file melt - runtime.h for details .
Each MELT value ( i.e. boxed data ) is allocated by the MELT generational garbage collector .
The MELT object system has single inheritance , a tree ( not a forest ) of classes , rooted at CLASS_ROOT .
Notice that many MELT values ( e.g. boxed integers or trees , tuples , closures , object maps ... ) are not MELT objects .
MELT classes and fields and method selectors are themselves MELT objects , so the object system is somehow reflexive .
See CLASS_CLASS for the class of classes and CLASS_FIELD for the class of fields .
Every MELT values have a discriminant ( the first field in their C struct ) .
This discriminant is a MELT object ; for MELT objects , it is their class .
For MELT values which are not objects ( like MELT trees , MELT object maps , etc.. ) it is a MELT object instance of CLASS_DISCR .
Every discriminant ( including MELT classes ) have a dispatch table associating selectors to closures ( the method implementation ) .
Hence , method addition is very dynamic and can occur at runtime .
Every MELT object has not only a class , but also a fixed hash code and a magic number ( unsigned short ) .
For discriminants ( & classes ) , the magic number is used ( even by GGC & MELT garbage collectors ) to discriminate the actual structure of the data .
In particular , one can have several discriminants for MELT strings sharing the same magic , OBMAG_STRING .
Hence , we have DISCR_STRING for most strings , and DISCR_VERBATIMSTRING for some strings handled specially .
The nil MELT value , represented by a NULL C pointer , has DISCR_NULLRECV as its discriminant .
So it is possible to invoke ( via a MELT selector ) a MELT method on the null MELT value .
Be careful about the boxed vs unboxed data .
MELT functions
MELT functions take arguments and produce results .
The first argument is a MELT value ( it can not be an unboxed data ) .
Other arguments can be either MELT values or unboxed data .
The first result of a MELT function is a MELT value , but additional results can be unboxed .
It is expected that each MELT function ( and selector ) has an implicit , but well defined , signature describing its arguments and results .
There is no variable argument facility in MELT .
Here is a sample MELT function repeat - times applying a function f to an argument x some specified n times .
f and x are values , n is an unboxed long argument .
( defun repeat - times ( f x : long n ) ; n is an unboxed formal argument of type long ( forever reploop ; infinite loop called reploop ( if ( < =i n 0 ) ; test if the unboxed n is negative ( exit reploop ) ) ; exit the loop if yes ( f x ) ; call f ( setq n ( - i n 1 ) ) ) ) ; decrement n
The syntax of defun is ( defun function - name formal - argument - list body ... ) .
The formal - argument - list contains either formal arguments names , or type keywords like : value : long : tree etc .
A type keyword applies to all following formal arguments ( till end of list or other type keyword ) .
The body of a defun is a sequence of zero , one , or more expressions evaluated sequentially .
MELT functions can be anonymous .
For instance , assuming ( say s ) has the side effect of displaying the value s and evaluates to nil , and ( make_stringconst discr_string " hello " ) evaluates to a boxed string value , the following code would say hello ten times .
( repeat - times ( lambda ( msg ) ( say msg ) ( newline ) ) ( make_stringconst discr_string " hello " ) 10 )
MELT primitives
A primitive is something which expands into C code .
Primitives are defined using the defprimitive construct .
Their invocation expands to C code .
For instance the long integer substraction - i is defined by
( defprimitive - i ( : long x y ) : long " ( ( " x " ) - ( " y " ) ) " )
The syntax is ( defprimitive primitive - name formal - argument - list result - type expansion ) without any restriction on the formal argument list ( the first formal can be unboxed ) .
Expansions in primitive are strings ( verbatim C code fragment ) or formals .
The expansion can be given more simply as
( defprimitive - i ( : long x y ) : long # { ( $x ) - ( $y ) } # )
The characters sequence between #{ and }# ( we call that a macro - string ) is expanded by the MELT lexer into an s-expr of symbols ( id prefixed with a dollars ) and strings ( all the rest ) .
Once defined , a primitive is invoked syntactically as a function .
As with C macros , and for similar reasons , it is advised to add parenthesis in primitive expansions .
MELT citerators
A C-iterator is something expanding into a C loop , ( e.g. a for loop ) .
This construct permits description of arbitrary C loop - like instructions .
C-iterating expressions ( whose operator is a C - iterator ) are used for side effects .

A “ miracle ” baby has brought a kind of mystical hope to people in Russia ’s mostly Muslim southern fringe who are increasingly desperate in the face of Islamist violence .
From hunchbacked grandmas to schoolboys , hundreds of pilgrims lined up this week in blazing sunshine to get a glimpse of 9 - month - old baby Ali Yakubov , on whose body they say verses from the Koran appear and fade every few days .
( Photo :
Pinkish in color and several centimeters high , the Koranic verse “ Be thankful or grateful to Allah ” was printed on the infant ’s right leg in clearly legible Arabic script this week , religious leaders said .
Visiting foreign journalists later saw a single letter after the rest had vanished .
“ The fact that this miracle happened here is a signal to us to take the lead and help our brothers and sisters find peace , ” said Sagid Murtazaliyev , head of the Kizlyar region about 150 km ( 95 miles ) north of Makhachkala , the sprawling Dagestani capital on the Caspian Sea .
“ We must not forget there is a war going on here , ” he told Muslim leaders who had invited the press to witness what they unequivocally claim is a sign from God .
Up to 2,000 pilgrims from Russia ’s 20 million Muslim population come daily to see the docile , blue - eyed baby , whose pink brick house has become a shrine .

Vladimir Zakharov , deputy director of the Caucasus Research Centre at the Moscow State University of International Relations , said he was not in a position to judge the veracity of the claims , but that it was clear they were born out of desperation .
“ Islam and fear of terrorism now totally dominate the North Caucasus , and they are perhaps using this to escape from a certain reality , ” he told Reuters by telephone .

Police said a shooting that killed a 4 - month - old boy and wounded two others in Van Nuys early Sunday was prompted by an argument between rival gang members .
The baby , Andrew Garcia , was being fed by a family friend holding him in a car parked on Kittridge Street , near the site of a celebration .
Anna Contreras , 28 , the friend , and Eric Ramirez , who was standing outside the car , also were shot and wounded .
Det. James Nuttall of the Los Angeles Police Department said that the baby ’s father “ is linked to a criminal street gang ” and that Ramirez is a known gang member .
Contreras and the boy ’s mother have no criminal histories , he said .
The group had been at the celebration about a block and a half away , Nuttall said .
Two assailants , who are believed to be members of a rival gang , got into an argument with the group near the car between midnight and 12:30 a.m. , Nuttall said .

One of the two fired a shotgun six times at the group and both ran away , police said .
Ramirez , 18 , was shot along with Contreras and the baby .
The infant was “ caught in the middle of a gang confrontation , ” Nuttall said .
“ It ’s a disturbing crime scene . ”
Contreras , who is pregnant , and the baby were transported to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center , where the child died shortly afterward .
Contreras was in stable condition .
Ramirez walked to nearby Valley Presbyterian Hospital .

Nuttall said police were asking for the public ’s help in identifying the assailants , adding that “ somebody has to come forward . ”

The developer of the largest rare - earths mine in Australia , the Lynas Corporation , did not have the cash to finish its mine and processing facilities after Western investors deserted its bond offering last winter .
So Lynas agreed to sell about 52 percent of the company to the state - owned China Nonferrous Metal Mining Company on May 1 .
This month , the Foreign Investment Review Board of Australia demanded that the Chinese company take a smaller stake and accept fewer seats on the board under any deal ; Lynas announced on Thursday that China Nonferrous had refused and had instead withdrawn from the transaction , valued at $ 220 million .
Lynas said in a statement that it was “ well advanced in finalizing interim funding . ”
Nicholas Curtis , the executive chairman of Lynas , said in an interview on Friday that financing opportunities had improved in recent months , declining to elaborate because of a voluntary five - day suspension in its stock trading as the company reviews its options .
Mr. Curtis would not completely rule out the possibility of a transaction with another Chinese company .
But recent Australian government policies “ do n’t encourage you to go down that pathway , ” he said .
Patrick Colmer , the executive member of the investment review board , said in a speech on Thursday that the government wanted foreign state - owned companies to take stakes of less than 50 percent in small or undeveloped Australian mines and less than 15 percent of large mining operations .
Investors had indicated over the summer that the Chinese offer was too low .
Lynas ’s stock closed at 25.7 cents ( 29.5 Australian cents ) on April 28 , the last trading day before China Nonferrous made its offer of 31.3 cents ( 36 Australian cents ) for newly issued shares .
Before the deal was scuttled , the stock traded much higher than the offer , closing at 78.3 cents ( 90 Australian cents ) on Wednesday .
Mr. Curtis defended the Chinese government ’s desire to limit exports of its own minerals , saying that domestic demand was rising so fast that China had a dwindling surplus to meet other countries ’ needs .

Nelson Piquet
Jr claims that he has become the major victim of the Renault ' crashgate ' scandal and admits it will be tough to begin his Formula 1 career all over again .
The 24 - year - old says that despite team boss Flavio Briatore receiving a life ban and technical boss Pat Symonds being suspended for five years , he has been punished the most and could find it difficult to get another chance in F1 .
" Some people have suggested I should have been punished by the FIA but , in reality , no one has been punished more than I have , " Piquet said in The Times .
" I am at the beginning of my career , unlike the others who have been punished in this case .
I am going to have to overcome many obstacles .
I more or less have to start my career from scratch in Formula 1 or justify myself in whatever category I might race in . "
Piquet says the plan for him to crash to benefit team - mate Fernando Alonso 's strategy was only made shortly before the race , claiming he did not have time to think it through and that he was under pressure for his place in the team .
" It all happened so quickly , I must confess that I could never possibly have weighed up the consequences , " he said .
" I was in a difficult position at the time and the renegotiation of my contract was in play if I did n't accept the strategy .
I was taken by surprise by the request of the two most important people in the team — after all , one of them was my manager .
" The crash plan was only made hours before the race , I did not have time to think straight .
If the proposal had been made during free practice I would have had more time to think and to act in another way . "
Piquet suggested that had his father , Nelson Piquet Sr , been at the Singapore GP , the decision would not have been taken , and that Piquet Sr first told the FIA about the plot at the last race of the 2008 season .
" I do n't believe the plan to crash would have been made [ if Piquet Sr was in Singapore ] , " he said .
" After that , my father began to go to all the races .
" The first confession was made to the FIA by my father during the Brazil Grand Prix in 2008 .
During the first half of 2009 , both myself and my father spoke to other people about the subject .
But the formalisation of the allegations only came afterwards .
It was a very serious charge and , for that reason , we had to be very careful and take careful steps . "
He denied that he ever used the threat of implicating Renault to try to keep his place in the team .
" Some people have suggested that I was blackmailing Renault to continue my career but the situation was more complicated for a long time before .
At each race it was always the same story of threatening to withdraw my contract or the renewal for the next season ...
I made the allegation so that no other driver would go through what I went through and , more importantly , so that the whole episode would be clarified the way it has been . "
Piquet also claimed that he had been the victim of Briatore 's frustrations at the team being unable to return to its title winning form of 2005 and 2006 , but says Alonso was not part of the plan as far as he knows .
" As a result of Renault not being very competitive , Briatore channelled all his unhappiness on me .
He preferred to take it out on me during the two and a half seasons I was in Formula 1 .
I never saw other rookies being pushed as hard as I was .
The pressure for results is normal , but the mental harassment is another story .
" Alonso did not participate in the meeting when the idea of a crash was developed .
If he knew or not about the plan , is a detail that I do not know . "
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Leave no nest egg unscathed .
That seemed to be the mission statement of the market meltdown that began in 2008 .
On March 9 of this year , stocks hit a bottom , with both the S&P and the Dow closing at 12 - year lows .
The market has since had better days , but halfway through the year , the S&P was still down 37 % from where it was 18 months earlier .
Yet , there is some good news .
The balances of 401 ( k ) investors fared much better , according to calculations made for CNNMoney.com by Jack VanDerhei , research director of the Employee Benefit Research Institute .
Among all 401 ( k ) accounts , the average balance fell 8.75 % in the 18 months that ended June 30 .
EBRI , working with the Investment Company Institute , has the country 's most extensive information on 401 ( k ) performance and investor behavior -- a database covering more than 21 million participants .
The numbers offer some measure of hope for 401 ( k ) participants looking to get back to where they were .
They also provide snapshots of how different groups were affected .
Factors playing the biggest role were a participant 's age , tenure at a company and whether or not she started 2008 with a small balance or a large one .
For example , young workers with no more than 4 years ' tenure at a company fared the best .
That 's primarily because they had low balances to begin with and the power of their contributions easily trumped the downward pressure of the equity returns in their portfolios .
The average balance for this group was actually up 47 % over the past 18 months .
Hardest hit were those 401 ( k ) participants between the ages of 45 and 64 who had worked 20 years at a company .
Their balances were down an average of 17.5 % .
Balances of 401( k ) plans tended to outperform stocks as a whole in part because most 401 ( k ) participants were invested in a mix of stocks and bonds or stable value funds .
And some participants did grow more conservative in how they invested .
" Over the last 18 months , the allocation [ of new contributions ] to equities fell 12.7 % " at large companies , said Byron Beebe , a U.S. retirement market leader at Hewitt Associates , which keeps records for 500 retirement plans at the largest U.S. companies .
But the biggest factor bolstering 401 ( k ) balances against the riptides of the market was the fact that participants kept contributing to their accounts much as they had before the meltdown last fall .
" Almost everyone has stayed the course , " said Michael Doshier , vice president of workplace investing at Fidelity Investments , which tracks 17,500 defined contribution plans representing over 11 million participants .
Participants kept investing even though nearly 8 % of companies have suspended their matching contributions to employees since last August , according to Fidelity .
Hewitt estimates that between 6 % and 7 % of Fortune 500 companies were among them .
While the market meltdown challenged everyone 's investing assumptions , it did reaffirm one principle -- that when it comes to having enough for retirement , how much you save counts even more than how your investments do .
Recovering what 's been lost
Of course , knowing that your 401 ( k ) balance has n't fallen as far as the S&P does n't erase the cold fact of the downturn :
A big part of your nest egg is still in the red and it will take some time to recover what 's been lost .
Just how long it takes will depend on two main factors :
how much you and your employer contribute to your account as a percent of your current balance ;
how much of a return your portfolio will generate going forward .
In the two tables below , VanDerhei calculated roughly how long it would take for 401 ( k ) participants to restore their balances to their Jan. 1 , 2008 , levels .
One table assumes the participant 's portfolio generates annual returns of 4 % going forward ; the other assumes an 8 % return .
Say your 401( k ) was worth $ 100,000 at the start of last year and has fallen 20 % , leaving you with an $ 80,000 balance .
If your portfolio is generating an 8 % annual return and you and your employer combined contribute $ 8,000 to your account every year ( that is , 10 % of your current balance ) , VanDerhei estimates it will take you roughly 1 year and 4 months to restore your balance to $ 100,000 .
If your portfolio only generates 4 % , then it would take 1 year and 9 months .
If , however , you bumped up contributions to $ 12,000 ( or 15 % of your current balance ) , you could do it even sooner .
Once you 've gotten back to even you might be tempted to ratchet back your contributions .
But consider that even before the market meltdown , many workers -- both current 401 ( k ) participants and those who do n't participate -- were n't saving enough to begin with .
" A very large percentage were not saving anything close to what would be required to replace a significant percentage of their pre-retirement income by age 67 , " VanDerhei said .
" The recent market crisis has only exacerbated their dilemma to the extent they were invested in equities . "
Staci Cosner has been a great help in a time which was difficult for our family .
Knowing that estate planning was taken care of in a proper and efficient manner took away additional stress that we would have had to deal with .
Staci took extended time and continues to answer all questions as well as explain everything thoroughly as we estate plan for our family members .
We feel confident in the plan that we came up with together and felt a part of the process the entire step away .
Staci is very prompt and responsive .
We would recommend her for future cases pertaining to estate planning , elderly care , health coverage planning , etc .

Nothing , manifestly , can ever be taken for granted with this man .
So far , however , it must be said that Kieren Fallon 's comeback has not only been entirely in keeping with a career of extremes , but also far more suggestive of peaks than troughs .
After riding a treble at Folkestone on Monday , yesterday he began the Ladbrokes St Leger meeting with a 21 - 1 double in the sunshine .
If he carries on like this , he will look the bet of a lifetime for that seventh jockeys ' championship in 2010 .
He has quickly made Ryan Moore 's rivals , during his absence , seem either stale or dilettante .
It was only last Friday that Fallon ended an 18 - month worldwide suspension for a failed drugs test , having previously been prohibited from riding in Britain for a similar period on account of what proved a risible prosecution at the Old Bailey .
At first , moreover , he looked every bit as rusty as might be expected .
Individual cogs remained in place but the transmission , between instinct and deed , was no less clearly snagging and slipping .
Since riding that critical first winner , at Wolverhampton on Saturday night , something has snapped back into place .
His three winners at Folkestone came from four rides ; the other one was beaten in a photo .
After drawing a blank at Goodwood the next day , Fallon arrived here to ride a colt named Audacity Of Hope in the opener .
For much of the race , little seemed to be going right ; his mount was wasting energy , and short of room .
Once angled to the outside , however , he cut them all down with a flourish .

His next mount was Strike The Deal in the DFS Scarbrough Stakes , highlight of the meeting 's first day – not , admittedly , much of a distinction now that its best races have been loaded on to Saturday 's card .
Dropped to five furlongs , Strike The Deal was taken off his feet , still last and going nowhere with 300 yards to run .
But Fallon kept pushing , the horse suddenly began to flow , and they got up to win by a length , going away .
" I would n't say it 's there yet , but it 's coming , " he reflected .
" With every ride , there 's more confidence .
It 's about getting back into the rhythm .
In these bigger fields , especially , you 're trying to follow the right one .
It 's the breeches you follow , more than the colours – you get to know the other jockeys ' logos .
It 's like a game of chess , you 're watching every piece on the board , want to know they 're all covered . "
On Audacity Of Hope , for instance , his original intention was to head inside .
" That 's what I 'd have done last Friday , and I 'd have got stuck , " he admitted .
" But I could see plenty of them going nicely , and they would have got the splits before me , and then I 'd be chasing .
So I took him wide instead .
On the first day , I was trying to make things happen , but it's when you ride with confidence that you make least mistakes . "
Fallon 's morale had already been boosted by an approach from no less a trainer than Andre Fabre to ride in the Arc trials at Longchamp on Sunday .
His agent , however , has expressed a bemusing preference for sending him to Ffos Las instead .
In the meantime , he has some important mounts for Luca Cumani , the man who supplied him with all three of his Folkestone winners .
Today he rides Fantasia , brilliant winner of the Nell Gwyn Stakes in the spring before twice disappointing in Classics , in the JRA Sceptre Stakes ; and tomorrow he partners Seta , already favourite for the Stan James 1,000 Guineas after winning a Newmarket maiden by eight lengths , in the DFS May Hill Stakes .
What 's more , his mount in the opener today , Coordinated Cut , has already been backed for next year 's Investec Derby .
Like Monitor Closely , who runs in the big one on Saturday , this Montjeu colt is trained by Peter Chapple - Hyam for the young City lion , Lawrie Inman , who paid 325,000 guineas for him as a yearling .
Sky Bet have laid Coordinated Cut at 50 - 1 for Epsom , and offer 33 - 1 before his debut today .
Even by Fallon 's standards , finding a Derby colt within a week seems a bit much to ask .
Still , as he said himself : " In this game , the one thing you do need is luck .
I know you make your own , as well , but you can't do without it . "
Remarkably , despite being flat out , he got Strike The Deal home without once reaching for the whip .
It was almost as though he won by force of personality .
He still has a long way to go , of course , and it will always be day by day .
But whether or not he knows how Audacity Of Hope was named , he has plainly absorbed the message .
In everything he is doing , he is saying exactly the same : " Yes we can . "

Where the money 's going
Alfred Nobel is 13 - 8 from 9 - 4 with William Hill for the Ladbrokes National Stakes at the Curragh on Saturday .
When it was announced way back at the start of the casting process for JJ Abrams 's Star Trek in 2007 that Leonard Nimoy was to reprise his role as Spock , many of us had misgivings .
It seemed to me that the only hope the series reboot had of jettisoning the past and striking out on its own bold adventure was to start afresh with a completely new cast .
I was wrong .
Nimoy 's gentle , statesmanlike performance as the elder version of Spock was one of the movie 's highlights , and served to beautifully tie the film to its predecessors without burdening it with any of their negative aspects .
But even so , I 'm more than a little concerned by some of the reports currently coming out of LA , where Abrams yesterday held a press conference to promote the DVD release of Star Trek , and chat about possibilities for the forthcoming sequel .
It emerged that not only Nimoy , but the original Captain James T Kirk himself , William Shatner , were being considered for the followup , which Abrams is returning to direct .
" In terms of moving forward , I am open to anything , " Abrams said .
" I would love to figure out something , given the challenge of introducing these new characters and given the burden of having to cast these people .
I feel like the first movie did some of the heavy lifting that needed to be done , in order to free us to continue going forward .
Maybe there 's less of a burden and there 's going to be more opportunity to work with him again .
I would love to work with him . "
By burden , Abrams was referring to the reasons why Shatner was not cast in the previous film : namely , that his character died on screen in Star Trek Generations , and that reviving him would therefore be impossible other than through some form of flashback mechanism , a contrivance which would not have given the actor the size of role he was apparently demanding .
" It was this thing where it would have felt like a gimmick in order to get Shatner in the movie which would have honestly , to me , been distracting , " said Abrams .
" How do you put him in the movie when you want him in it so badly , and yet the story actually seems in counter purposes with the story you want to tell ? "
Exactly .
And furthermore , why would you want Shatner in the film in the first place ?
While Nimoy 's appearance in Star Trek served its purpose , the series surely now has its own legitimacy , which would make the introduction of a larger - than - life figure such as the original Kirk farcical .
Shatner made his bed when he went on YouTube to publically rail at Abrams and his team for not finding a place for him in the the first film , and while he may be making the right noises these days ( the actor said not long ago that he would be " pleased " to be in Star Trek 2 ) , one wonders whether he is capable of the humility required to take a smaller role , which would surely be the only one made available to him .
Also , with the timeline having been completely re-established in Star Trek due to the time travelling events of that movie , Shatner 's Kirk has presumably been completely wiped from the universe .
Were Shatner to appear as an elder version of Chris Pine 's character , he would not be the Kirk that outwitted Khan , or hung out with those whales , because that timeline no longer exists .
So what would be the point in bringing him back ?
I 'm more tempted by the prospect of a return for Nimoy , but even there I think the next film would be better served by avoiding further nostalgia .
Star
Trek made a fitting swansong for " Spock Prime " , and a cameo in the next movie would surely only diminish its value .
But perhaps you disagree .
Do you think Star Trek 2 should feature Shatner and Nimoy ?
And if so , how would you shoehorn the older versions into the plot ?
For that matter , why not bring back George Takei , Nichelle Nichols and Walter Koenig , aka Sulu , Uhura and Chekov ?

Berlusconi torna ad attaccare Repubblica e la stampa straniera e , ancora una volta , la seconda dopo la convention dei giovani industriali di Santa Margherita ( VIDEO ) lo fa davanti ad una platea di imprenditori che il premier invita alla " ribellione generalizzata " contro " un giornale che non ha avuto limiti nel gettare discredito sul governo e sul Paese e ad imbeccare i giornali stranieri " .
Un invito al boicottaggio di fronte alla Confindustria brianzola e una porta chiusa in faccia al presidente degli industriali che poco prima , dallo stesso palco , aveva chiesto al premier di " rimbalzare le polemiche " .
Il presidente del Consiglio non ci pensa un attimo e torna all 'attacco a testa bassa .
Tanto da dire agli industriali : " Voi pensate a creare benessere , per la libertà e la democrazia ' ghe pensi mi' " .
Finito con la stampa torna poi sul suo nemico storico : i magistrati .
" Ci sono frange della magistratura che mi attaccano da 15 anni .
No si può mettere sullo stesso piano chi attacca e chi è attaccato " .
Un altro no ad Emma Marcegaglia che gli aveva chiesto moderazione .
Il premier ha espresso la propria intenzione di proseguire nell ' azione di governo .
" Il governo andrà avanti fino alla fine della legislatura , per i prossimi 3 anni e mezzo .
Penso che potremo continuare anche dopo con la nostra parte politica , è una grande occasione per fare le riforme " .
Un Berlusconi a tutto campo che ha scherzosamente invitato la Marcegaglia a ricoprire il ruolo di vicepresidente del Consiglio , e che ha raccontato della solidarietà degli altri capi di governo : " I primi ministri stranieri mi dicono che io sono un duro , che ho una grande capacità di resistere e che altri politici nel mondo non avrebbero resistito alla metà degli attacchi cui sono stato oggetto " .- " Rispettiamo Giorgio Napolitano perché rispettando lui rispettiamo l'Italia " .
Così Emma Marcegaglia nel corso dell ' assemblea degli industriali monzesi .
" Approfitto della presenza del presidente del Consiglio - ha detto il leader degli industriali - per dirgli che deve andare avanti , deve fare le grandi riforme di cui ha bisogno questo Paese " .
" Le istituzioni non devono delegittimarsi reciprocamente - ha continuato - da questo esce meno forte tutto il Paese .
Non bisogna scassare le istituzioni .
Va rispettato il capo dello Stato ma va rispettato anche il governo che è una istituzione e che deve andare avanti " .

The shutout was funny .
The 3 attendees might be more telling
by Jeremy Hooper
So you know that NOM Facebook Fail that we 've been telling you about ?
The one where hundreds of non-attendees ( currently at 476 ) have registered their non-attendance and pro-equality thoughts ?
Yea , well we were a little annoyed today to see that the page now has a whopping 3 attendees .
However , once we saw what the " attendees " have to say on the page 's wall , we realized that their contributions might send an even better message for our side than their non-attendance ever would 've
Values Voter 's Summit '09 [ A NOM Facebook project ]
You just can't win , NOM .
** Ed. note :
There 's always the chance that these " attendees " are pro-equality people who are just trying to take the piss .
If so , it 's interesting the type of rhetoric they adopt to act like a NOM supporter .
** Ed. note 2 : It looks like the above comment was a hoax .
Someone just posted this to our comments .
Your thoughts
I occasionally log onto the NOM site as an alias and send emails like below to elected officials :
My response from that cutie Brian Brown :
Your message has been sent !
Thank you for joining this crucial effort to preserve marriage in the Garden State .
It is your voice , along with hundreds of your fellow citizens , which will ultimately will persuade our legislators to stand up for marriage in the face of a highly organized campaign to bring same - sex marriage to New Jersey .
Please ask your friends and neighbors to join this effort .
Together we can make a difference .
Your message was sent to : Assemblymember Joseph J. Roberts
Senator Richard J. Codey
I am writing to urge you to publicly support same sex marriage -- the union of 2 consenting adults that would like to receive the same benefits of marriage , that has flourished for thousands of years , across all cultural , ethnic , and religious lines .
I firmly disbelieve that a marriage bonds mothers and especially fathers to their children , giving children the greatest possible opportunity to be healthy , happy , educated , productive members of our society 's next generation .
Like Maggie Gallagher ...
Please help us to protect the time - honored definition of marriage , I URGE you to : ( a ) SUPPORT any bills which would create same - sex " marriage " .
( b ) Publicly endorse and vote to allow the state legislature to decide on Same Sex marriage I hope that you 'll respond quickly to affirm your support for same sex marriage .
If it were n't for same sex marriage , Maggie Gallagher might actually have to get a real job !

“ This is one of the biggest seizures of white liquor I ’ve seen come out of the mountains in my career , ” ALE Director John Ledford said in statement .
The arrest follows a two - month investigation by ALE agents , assisted by the state Highway Patrol .
In addition to the liquor , large amounts of sugar and other items were seized during a search of Nance 's property , authorities said .
Andrey Arshavin will miss Russia 's clash against Liechtenstein but could be fit to face Wales .
But forward could return for clash against Wales
Andrey Arshavin will miss Russia 's World Cup qualifier against Liechtenstein but could be fit to face Wales .
Arshavin sustained a groin injury in Arsenal 's 2 - 1 loss to Manchester United at Old Trafford on Saturday .
Russia boss Guus Hiddink has confirmed his captain will be absent from Saturday 's clash in St Petersburg but is hopeful he could return versus Wales four days later .
" Hopefully with some rest and intensive treatment we could get him ready for the Wales match , " Hiddink said .
" It 's hard to give a definite answer right now but we should know more about his injury in the next few days . "
Arshavin added : " I definitely wo n't be ready to play against Liechtenstein .
" But I think I have a good chance to play in Cardiff as we still have nine days before that match . "
Russia are second in Group Four and currently trail leaders Germany by four points with a game in hand .
Authors of serious books seldom have cause to celebrate , but Larry Stratton and I have two reasons to open the champagne .
Crown Publishing , a division of Random House , has announced a second printing of the second edition of The Tyranny of Good Intentions , and the noted civil libertarian and defense attorney , Harvey Silverglate , has just published a book covering many of the same legal cases and vetting our conclusion that in the United States every American is in grave danger from unscrupulous prosecutors who target the innocent .
For two decades I have been attempting to make Americans aware that the danger to their liberty comes not from foreign adversaries , terrorists , or criminals , but from prosecutors , who have destroyed law as a shield of the innocent and turned law into a weapon against the innocent .
The Tyranny of Good Intentions ( the publisher ’s title ) documents how the legal principles that protect our civil liberties were eroded by prosecutors even before the Bush regime obliterated what remained of the Bill of Rights .
The struggle has been uphill , because neither the right wing nor the left wing is emotionally content with the facts that Stratton and I present .
Conservatives tend to see civil liberties as liberal coddling devices for criminals and , today , for terrorists .
Predisposed to “ law and order , ” conservatives align with police and prosecutors .
They object to accounts of police misbehavior and prosecutorial abuse as propaganda on behalf of the criminal class .
The left wing tends to see law as a tool of oppression that “ the rich ” use to control the lower classes , and liberals fret that “ the rich ” get off by hiring good lawyers , while the poor and minorities are ground under .
Consequently , leftists object to the demonstration that even the very rich , such as Michael Milken , Martha Stewart , and Leona Helmsley , and even law and accounting firms , are victims of wrongful prosecution .
Confusing wealth with villainy , leftists cannot free themselves from the emotional predilection that a convicted rich person must have been so guilty that not even the best lawyers could get them off .
The Tyranny of Good Intentions had a second printing of a second edition because of word of mouth , not because of reviews .
Neither the Right nor the Left objects to wrongful prosecution as long as the victim is a bête noire .
Sir Thomas More ’s question ( A Man For All Seasons ) – what will happen to the innocent if we cut down the law in pursuit of devils ?
– rings no warning among Right or Left .
With this point made , I have come not to praise myself and my coauthor , but to praise Harvey Silverglate .
If The Tyranny of Good Intentions cannot convince you , then perhaps Three Felonies a Day : How the Feds Target the Innocent can , and , if not , then both together surely will .
The Tyranny of Good Intentions is a broad stroke .
It demonstrates how each civil liberty has been eroded away .
Prosecutorial abuse is one chapter in the book .
Silverglate ’s Three Felonies a Day focuses on how federal prosecutors invent creative interpretations of statutes , sometimes creating new felonies out of vague language or thin air , felonies never legislated by Congress .
Federal criminal law is today so vast and so poorly worded that Silverglate reports , truthfully , that each of us , every American , commits three felonies every day without knowing it .
Federal judges , an increasing number of whom are former federal prosecutors , permit the prosecution of Americans for crimes that the defendants did not know were crimes , crimes that never before existed until the federal prosecutor brought the charge .
The invention of crimes by prosecutors violates every known legal principle in Anglo - American law .
Yet it has become commonplace .
Defense attorneys , a group that also increasingly consists of former federal prosecutors , as Silverglate accurately reports , have lost confidence that it is possible to defend a client from a federal prosecution and see their role , not as the defense , but as negotiator of a plea bargain that reduces the charges and prison time of the defendant , no matter how innocent .
Silverglate shows that many of the plea bargains create precedents that prosecutors can exploit to trap more innocent victims .
The reader by now is asking why prosecutors would waste time on the innocent when there are so many real crimes .
Silverglate provides conclusive answers .
For example , politically ambitious federal prosecutors , such as Rudy Giuliani and William Weld , pick high - profile targets to frame in order to build name recognition for political careers .
Giuliani picked Michael Milken and Leona Helmsley .
Weld picked Boston mayor Kevin White .
Giuliani went on to be mayor of New York and a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination .
Weld went on to be a two - term governor of Massachusetts .
Leura Canary , perhaps at the urging of Karl Rove , picked Alabama governor Don Siegelman .
Michael J. Sullivan picked Thomas Finneran , speaker of the Massachusetts House of Representatives , and so on .
From Silverglate ’s book , the reader can learn how federal prosecutors manage their frame - ups of innocents .
For a targeted city or state political figure , the prosecutor first hunts for a criminal act somewhere in the bureaucracy .
Perhaps some low - level person has extorted a bribe for a permit .
Once such a person is caught , he or she is told that charges will be dropped if information is given that can be used to implicate the mayor or speaker of the House or governor .
As federal district court judges now permit hearsay and uncorroborated testimony , a totally innocent high - profile person can be snared on the basis of testimony by a petty crook low in the bureaucracy .
This is the way America works today .
Just as state and local police cannot stand up to the FBI , elected state and local officials are powerless in the face of their pursuit by corrupt federal prosecutors .
Silverglate himself was the attorney in some of the landmark cases that he reports .
The reader , even one with the usual illusions and delusions that blind Americans to their predicament , will be scared by Silverglate ’s documented account , case by case , of how easy it is in “ freedom and democracy ” America to frame the totally innocent .
In Silverglate ’s concluding chapter , “ For Whom the Bell Tolls , ” the answer is obvious even to a naïf : “ It tolls for all . ”
The last day for withdrawing the name of a candidate was Sept. 17 , the last day for naming a substitute was Sept. 21 , and absentee ballots were sent out weeks ago , Passarella said .
" We 've already printed the ballots and programmed the machines - it's too late in the game " for any change , he said .
I saw a recent advertising campaign for the new 2010 Mustang .
It featured a gentleman that had lost his sight years ago in an accident .
One of the things he missed most was the thrill of driving , so Ford created an opportunity for he and a few other vision impaired people to drive the new Mustang on a private strip with former Mustang Trans Am racer Tommy Kendall .
It ’s a terrific advertising campaign ( click here to view all of the videos ) , but it did get me thinking : what if you could n’t drive ?
Specifically , what if you could never again drive your muscle car ?
One of the things many automotive fans love is the ability to slip behind the wheel and connect with a machine .
It ’s a stress relief .
It ’s exciting .
It involves all of your senses ( unless you ’re a lousy driver …. but if you are , you are not likely reading this anyway ) .
When it comes to older muscle cars the challenge is even greater .
I once was listening to legendary test pilot General Chuck Yeager compare flying a modern day F - 15 to the WWI - era P - 51 .
Chuck said ( as only Chuck can ) that the F - 15 was relatively easy to fly ….. but you had to be careful with the P - 51 or it would jump up and “ bite ” you .
I think the same thing could easily be said for 1960 ’s and ’ 70 ’s muscle cars .
They take a little more conscious awareness to manage than a modern muscle car , which does not make them better or worse , but different .
But what if , all of a sudden , you did n’t have the ability to drive any more ?
I love to drive .
When I daydream , I dream about driving .
Driving my Chevelle .
Driving race cars .
Driving the General Lee even ( which I swear I will do some day ) .
During my younger days I had more moving violations than I can remember – and I lost my driving privileges 3 summers in a row as a result .
The first 2 times I was able to get the privileges immediately reinstated in exchange for probation … but was not so lucky on the 3rd offense .
Oddly enough , I was never caught driving in the triple digits ( luckily ) – it was always for something silly like a 10 - 15 mph speeding ticket , or rolling through a stop sign .
I place all of the blame on me …and a little on my Chevelle .
The experience of losing my driving privileges was a terrifying one though , which is what made the Ford advertisement hit home for me .
Being unable to drive ever again would not merely be an inconvenience for me – it would be somewhat akin to going without oxygen .
I only hope the day will never come when I ca n’t get behind the wheel and drop the hammer , and I honestly thank God for the opportunity .
I know that I ’m not alone in that sentiment !
Here ’s to happiness behind the wheel .
Drive your muscle car .
Enjoy it .
Be thankful for the experience – because it could be gone in the blink of an eye !

I recently had to set up wildcard hosting on one of my Ubuntu servers .
Previously I had only done this on FreeBSD so I had to do a bit of research to find out what the best method would be .
It turns out the solution is quite simple and elegant .
Now why would you need a setup like this ?
Well there are many reasons , perhaps you ’ve set up your own free webhosting company where each account gets their own subdomain , or you need to set up a large number of subdomains for your new website but you just ca n’t be bothered to enter them all by hand .
I will assume you already have your standard LAMP setup , with Bind9 installed .
Your first job will be to set up an A record for your wildcard domain .
Open up your zone file with your favourite editor , and add the following to the bottom :
*.yourdomain.com .
IN A 192.168.0.1
Naturally you ’ll be replacing both the domain name and IP with ones that are appropriate to your configuration .
Also , make sure you specify any other subdomains that you do n’t want to handled by the wildcard .
Your final zone record should look something like the following :
yourdomain.com .
86400 IN SOA yourdomain.com . hostmaster.yourdomain.com .
( 2009103004 10800 3600 3600000 86400 ) IN NS ns1.yourdomain.com .
IN NS ns2.yourdomain.com .
IN MX 10 mail.yourdomain.com .
IN A 192.168.0.1 mail IN A 192.168.0.1 ns1 IN A 192.168.0.1 ns2 IN A 192.168.1.1 *.example.com .
IN A 192.168.0.1
Great , now that we have our zone configured we need to enable it by reloading bind9 :
sudo /etc/init.d/bind9 reload
Next on the list is configuring your virtual host to handle all of these subdomains .
There are many ways you can do this , depending on the result you want .
You may want one virtual host for your primary subdomain ( www ) and one for all your subdomains , or you may want to combine them all into one and handle the subdomains with mod_rewrite .
For the purpose of this demonstration I will assume the later .
Open up your existing virtual host definition file or create a new one if needed .
These are stored in /etc / apache2 / sites - available / and are usually named the same as the domain .
You ’re going to be adding a ServerAlias definition , and your file should end up looking something like this :
< VirtualHost *> ServerName yourdomain.com ServerAlias *.yourdomain.com DocumentRoot /home/yourdomain.com/www .... </ VirtualHost >
I ’ve slimmed down this example , your virtual host file may have other declarations in it .
Once you ’ve finished editing this file , enable it if you have n’t done so already .
This involves creating a symlink of the configuration file in /etc / apache2 / sites - enabled , which can be done very easily by the use of the a2ensite command which is available only in Debian based distributions .
After adding the new site , reload Apache .
sudo a2ensite yourdomain.com sudo /etc/init.d/ apache reload
So now you ’ve set up your DNS to accept connections on any subdomain , and Apache is set up to direct these connections to a specific folder on your system .
Where do we go from here ?
Once again , that depends on what your trying to accomplish , but I ’ll give you a few suggestions .
The simplest way is to setup your index file to check what the subdomain is and generate the output based on that .
An example would be switching the database depending on which subdomain is used :
# Determine Subdomain $ domain = $ _SERVER [ ' HTTP_HOST ' ] ; $ domain_parts = explode ( " . " , $ domain ) ; $ subdomain = $ domain_parts [ 0 ] ; # Select Required Database mysql_connect ( " localhost " , " root " , " password " ) ; mysql_select_db($subdomain ) ;
Or if you have mod_rewrite enabled you can modify your .htaccess file and redirect any subdomain ’s traffic to a matching folder name in the DocumentRoot :
RewriteEngine on RewriteCond %{http_host} .
RewriteCond %{http_host} !^www.yourdomain.com [ NC ] RewriteCond %{http_host} ^([^.]+)\.yourdomain.com [ NC ] RewriteRule ^(.*)
http://www.yourdomain.com/%1/ [ R=301 , L, QSA ]
So if a visitor came to the URL http://example.yourdomain.com they would then be redirected to http://www.yourdomain.com/example/.
Beyond that , I ’ll let you use your own imagination .

One of the more annoying things we 've found when discussing how the entertainment industry needs to adapt and change and embrace new technologies in place of their old business model , is the repeated claim that it ' sto make money if the content is given away for free .
Impossible is a pretty absolute statement -- and all you need is one example to disprove it .
However , as we 've shown , there are many , many examples of entertainers who have learned how to make more money out of giving away their content -- which seems to disprove the whole " impossible " bit .
However , the industry folks do n't seem to know how to respond to that , so they just keep saying it 's impossible .
Witness this bizarre exchange between John Perry Barlow and the MPAA 's Dan Glickman debating the future of the entertainment industry .
Barlow notes that he made an awful lot of money as a songwriter for the Grateful Dead , which encouraged its fans to make tapes of its shows for free .
Glickman immediately responds by saying :
The problem , as always , is that Glickman has incorrectly defined his market -- which is a scary thought if he 's supposed to be the leading spokesperson for that industry .
He thinks they 're in the business of selling .
That 's not so .
It 's too narrowly defined .
The entertainment business is in the business of -- and that can include many things that still involve giving content away for free for promotional value .
We 've discussed plenty of examples in the recording industry -- and Barlow 's success helps prove that .
In Glickman 's own movie industry the examples are even more obvious .
They should be selling the experience of seeing a movie , not just the content .
However , when Glickman says things like the idea that giving away things for free is against " the laws of human nature , " we wonder if this means he 's never received anything for free in his life .
Does he turn down the free soda offered with the slice of pizza in the corner shop ?
Free dessert with dinner ?
Why that 's just crazy talk !
Those restaurants must be run by anti-capitalist extremists .
Their actions in giving away free food are against the laws of nature , and they must be on their way out of business .
