Successful politicians know how to attract attention , and how to avoid it , so it ’s worth noting that John McCain chose to give his speech about the future of the judiciary on May 6th , a day when the political world was preoccupied with the Democratic primaries in Indiana and North Carolina .
It is significant , too , that Senator McCain spoke mainly in generalities , rather than about such specific issues as abortion , affirmative action , and the death penalty .
But even if he hoped to sneak the speech past a distracted public , and have its coded references deciphered only by the activists who were its primary target , its message should not be lost on anyone .
McCain plans to continue , and perhaps even accelerate , George W. Bush ’s conservative counter - revolution at the Supreme Court .
McCain began the speech , at Wake Forest University , in Winston - Salem , North Carolina , with a paean to the wisdom of the framers of the Constitution in establishing the separation of powers .
“ The executive , legislative , and judicial branches are often wary of one another ’s excesses , and they should be , ” he said , before adding , in a comforting way , “ The system of checks and balances rarely disappoints . ”
Still , he warned against complacency , because “ there is one great exception in our day ” to the smooth functioning of the separation of powers .
This is surely true : the Bush Administration has sought to expand executive power in an unprecedented manner , especially with respect to the President ’s ability to authorize torture , ignore the Geneva conventions , and order the surveillance of citizens .
But that was not what McCain had in mind .
Instead , he pronounced that the great exception “ is the common and systematic abuse of our federal courts by the people we entrust with judicial power .
For decades now , some federal judges have taken it upon themselves to pronounce and rule on matters that were never intended to be heard in courts or decided by judges . ”
This , of course , is a view functionally identical to President Bush ’s often expressed contempt for judges who “ legislate from the bench . ”
McCain then cited what he saw as an example of such abuse .
“ Sometimes the expressed will of the voters is disregarded by federal judges , as in a 2005 case concerning an aggravated murder in the state of Missouri , ” he said .
“ As you might recall , the case inspired a Supreme Court opinion that left posterity with a lengthy discourse on international law , the constitutions of other nations , the meaning of life , and ‘ evolving standards of decency . ’
These meditations were in the tradition of ‘ penumbras , ’ ‘ emanations , ’ and other airy constructs the Court has employed over the years as poor substitutes for clear and rigorous constitutional reasoning . ”
The giveaway here was that McCain did not reveal the subject matter of this supposed judicial outrage .
The case was Roper v. Simmons , in which a seventeen - year - old boy murdered a woman after breaking into her home , and was sentenced to death .
Justice Anthony M. Kennedy ’s opinion overturned the sentence and held that the Constitution forbids the death penalty for juvenile offenders .
McCain ’s reference to the Court ’s “ discourse ” on the law of “ other nations ” refers to Kennedy ’s observation of the “ stark reality that the United States is the only country in the world that continues to give official sanction to the juvenile death penalty . ”
Likewise , Kennedy noted that the only other countries to execute juvenile offenders since 1990 have been China , Congo , Iran , Nigeria , Pakistan , Saudi Arabia , and Yemen .
According to McCain , the United States apparently belongs on this dismal list .
Nor were his references to penumbras and emanations accidental .
Those words come from Justice William O. Douglas ’s 1965 opinion for the Court in Griswold v. Connecticut , in which the Justices recognized for the first time a constitutional right to privacy , and ruled that a state could not deny married couples access to birth control .
The “ meaning of life ” was a specific reference , too .
It comes from the Court ’s 1992 opinion in Planned Parenthood v. Casey , which reaffirmed the central holding of Roe v. Wade , and forbade the states from banning abortion .
In short , this one passage in McCain ’s speech amounted to a dog whistle for the right — an implicit promise that he will appoint Justices who will eliminate the right to privacy , permit states to ban abortion , and allow the execution of teen - agers .
The question , as always with McCain these days , is whether he means it .
Might he really be a “ maverick ” when it comes to the Supreme Court ?
The answer , almost certainly , is no .
The Senator has long touted his opposition to Roe , and has voted for every one of Bush ’s judicial appointments ; the rhetoric of his speech shows that he is getting his advice on the Court from the most extreme elements of the conservative movement .
With the general election in mind , McCain had to express himself with such elaborate circumlocution because he knows that the constituency for such far - reaching change in our constellation of rights is small , and may be shrinking .
In 2004 , to stoke turnout among conservatives , Karl Rove engineered the addition of anti-gay - marriage voter initiatives to the ballots in Ohio and other states ; last week , though , when the California Supreme Court voted to allow gay marriage in that state , only hard - core activists were able to muster much outrage .
When it comes to the Constitution , McCain is on the wrong side of the voters , and of history ; thus , his obfuscations .
Still , the Bush - McCain agenda for the courts has made great strides .
Bush ’s conservative appointees to the Supreme Court — John G. Roberts , Jr. , and Samuel A. Alito , Jr. —have joined Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas in a phalanx that is more radical than any that the Court has seen since F.D.R. ’s appointments .
Those Justices allowed the New Deal to proceed , and set the stage for the noblest era in the Court ’s history , under Chief Justice Earl Warren , when the civil and individual rights of all citizens finally received their constitutional due .
By contrast , in just three years the Roberts Court has crippled school - desegregation efforts ( and hinted that affirmative action may be next ) ; approved a federal law that bans a form of abortion ; limited the reach of job - discrimination laws ; and made it more difficult to challenge the mixing of church and state .
It ’s difficult to quarrel with Justice Stephen Breyer ’s assessment of his new colleagues : “ It is not often in the law that so few have so quickly changed so much . ”
And more change is likely to come .
John Paul Stevens , the leader of the Court ’s four embattled liberals , just celebrated his eighty - eighth birthday ; Ruth Bader Ginsburg is seventy - five ; David Souter is only sixty - eight but longs for his home in New Hampshire .
For all the elisions in John McCain ’s speech , one unmistakable truth emerged : that the stakes in the election , for the Supreme Court and all who live by its rulings , are very , very high . ♦

The Pennsylvania Democratic Debate
PARTICIPANTS :
SENATOR HILLARY CLINTON
SENATOR BARACK OBAMA
MODERATORS :
CHARLIE GIBSON , ABC NEWS
GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS , ABC NEWS
LOCATION : THE NATIONAL CONSTITUTION CENTER , PHILADELPHIA
MR. GIBSON : So we 're going to begin with opening statements , and we had a flip of the coin , and the brief opening statement first from Senator Obama .
SENATOR OBAMA : Thank you very much , Charlie and George , and thanks to all in the audience and who are out there .
You know , Senator Clinton and I have been running for 15 months now .
We 've been traveling across Pennsylvania for at least the last five weeks .
And everywhere I go , what I 've been struck by is the core decency and generosity of people of Pennsylvania and the American people .
But what I 've also been struck by is the frustration .
You know , I met a gentleman in Latrobe who had lost his job and was trying to figure out how he could find the gas money to travel to find a job .
And that story , I think , is typical of what we 're seeing all across the country .
People are frustrated not only with jobs moving and incomes being flat , health care being too expensive , but also that special interests have come to dominate Washington , and they do n't feel like they 're being listened to .
I think this election offers us an opportunity to change that , to transform that frustration into something more hopeful , to bring about real change .
And I 'm running for president to ensure that the American people are heard in the White House .
That 's my commitment , if the people of Pennsylvania vote for me and the people of America vote for me .
MR. GIBSON : Senator Clinton ?
SENATOR CLINTON :
Well , we meet tonight here in Philadelphia where our founders determined that the promise of America would be available for future generations if we were willing and able to make it happen .
You know , I am here , as is Senator Obama .
Neither of us were included in those original documents .
But in a very real sense , we demonstrate that that promise of America is alive and well .
But it is at risk .
There is a lot of concern across Pennsylvania and America .
People do feel as though their government is not solving problems , that it is not standing up for them , that we 've got to do more to actually provide the good jobs that will support families , deal once and for all with health care for every American , make our education system the true passport to opportunity , restore our standing in the world .
I am running for president because I know we can meet the challenges of today , that we can continue to fulfill that promise that was offered to successive generations of Americans starting here so long ago .
And I hope that this evening , voters in Pennsylvania and others across the country will listen carefully to what we have to say , will look at our records , will look at the plans we have .
And I offer those on my website , hillaryclinton.com , for more detail .
Because I believe with all my heart that we the people can have the kind of future that our children and grandchildren so richly deserve .
MR. GIBSON : Thank you both .
And with that as preamble , we will take a very short commercial break .
And we will come back and begin 90 minutes of debate .
The Pennsylvania Democratic Debate continues after just one minute .
( Announcements . )
MR. GIBSON : We 'll begin each of the segments of this debate with short quotes from the Constitution that are apropos to what we 're going to talk about .
And it is good to be back here at the National Constitution Center .
So let 's start .
And I 'm going to give a general question , before we get to the issues , to both of you on politics .
There have already been many votes in many states , and you have each , as you analyze the vote , appealed disproportionately to different constituencies in the party , and that dismays many in the party .
Governor Cuomo , an elder statesman in your party , has come forward with a suggestion .
He has said , look , fight it to the end .
Let every vote be counted .
You contest every delegate .
Go at each other to the -- right till the end .
Do n't give an inch to one another .
But pledge now that whichever one of you wins this contest , you 'll take the other as your running mate , and that the other will agree if they lose , to take second place on the ticket .
So I put the question to both of you :
Why not ?
( Pause , laughter . )
Do n't all speak at once .
( Laughter . )
SENATOR OBAMA : Well , I 'm happy to start with a response .
Look , this has been an extraordinary journey that both Senator Clinton and I have been on and a number of other able candidates .
And I think very highly of Senator Clinton 's record .
But as I 've said before , I think it 's premature at this point for us to talk about who vice presidential candidates will be because we 're still trying to determine who the nominee will be .
But one thing I 'm absolutely certain of is that come August , when we 're in Denver , the Democratic Party will come together , because we have no choice if we want to deliver on the promises that not only we 've made but the founders made .
We are seeing peoples ' economic status slipping further and further behind .
We 've seen people who have not only lost their jobs but now are at risk of losing their homes .
We have a sharp contrast in terms of economic policies .
John McCain wants to continue four more years of George Bush policies and , on the foreign policy front , wants to continue George Bush 's foreign policy .
So I 'm confident that both Senator Clinton 's supporters and Senator Obama 's supporters will be supporting the Democratic nominee when we start engaging in that general election .
MR. GIBSON : But Senator Clinton , Governor Cuomo made that suggestion because he 's not so sure .
And other Democrats are not so sure .
Just to quote from the Constitution again , " In every case , " Article Two , Section One , " after the choice of the president , the person having the greatest number of votes of the electors shall be the vice president . "
If it was good enough in colonial times , why not in these times .
SENATOR CLINTON : Well , Charlie , I 'm going to do everything I possibly can to make sure that one of us takes the oath of office next January .
I think that has to be the overriding goal , whatever we have to do .
Obviously we are still contesting to determine who will be the nominee .
But once that is resolved , I think it is absolutely imperative that our entire party close ranks , that we become unified .
I will do everything to make sure that the people who supported me support our nominee .
I will go anywhere in the country to make the case .
And I know that Barack feels the same way , because both of us have spent 15 months traveling our country .
I have seen the damage of the Bush years .
I 've seen the extraordinary pain that people have suffered from because of the failed policies ; you know , those who have held my hands who have lost sons or daughters in Iraq , and those who have lost sons or daughters because they did n't have health insurance .
And so , regardless of the differences there may be between us , and they are differences , they pale in comparison to the differences between us and Senator McCain .
So we will certainly do whatever is necessary to make sure that a Democrat is in the White House next January .
MR. GIBSON : All right .
I will let this go .
I do n't think Governor Cuomo has any takers yet .
Let me start with a question to you , Senator Obama .
SENATOR OBAMA : Yes .
MR. GIBSON : Talking to a closed - door fundraiser in San Francisco 10 days ago , you got talking in California about small - town Pennsylvanians who have had tough economic times in recent years .
And you said they get bitter , and they cling to guns or they cling to their religion or they cling to antipathy toward people who are not like them .
Now , you 've said you misspoke ; you said you mangled what it was you wanted to say .
But we 've talked to a lot of voters .
Do you understand that some people in this state find that patronizing and think that you said actually what you meant ?
SENATOR OBAMA : Well , I think there 's no doubt that I can see how people were offended .
It 's not the first time that I 've made , you know , a statement that was mangled up .
It 's not going to be the last .
But let me be very clear about what I meant , because it 's something that I 've said in public , it 's something that I 've said in television , which is that people are going through very difficult times right now and we are seeing it all across the country .
And that was true even before the current economic hardships that are stemming from the housing crisis .
This is the first economic expansion that we just completed in which ordinary people 's incomes actually went down , when adjusted for inflation , at the same time as their costs of everything from health care to gas at the pump have skyrocketed .
And so the point I was making was that when people feel like Washington 's not listening to them , when they 're promised year after year , decade after decade , that their economic situation is going to change , and it does n't , then politically they end up focusing on those things that are constant , like religion .
They end up feeling " This is a place where I can find some refugee .
This is something that I can count on . "
They end up being much more concerned about votes around things like guns , where traditions have been passed on from generation to generation .
And those are incredibly important to them .
And yes , what is also true is that wedge issues , hot - button issues , end up taking prominence in our -- in our politics .
And part of the problem is that when those issues are exploited , we never get to solve the issues that people really have to get some relief on , whether it 's health care or education or jobs .
So this i something that I 've said before .
It is something that I will repeat again .
And yes , people are frustrated and angry about it , but what we 're seeing in this election is the opportunity to break through that frustration .
And that 's what our campaign has been about , saying that if the American people get involved and engaged , then we are going to start seeing change .
And that 's what makes this election unique .
MR. GIBSON : Senator Clinton ?
SENATOR CLINTON : Well , I am the granddaughter of a factory worker from Scranton who went to work in the Scranton lace mills when he was 11 years old , worked his entire life there , mostly six - day weeks .
He was also very active in the Court Street Methodist Church .
And he raised three sons and was very proud that he sent all of them to college .
I do n't believe that my grandfather or my father , or the many people whom I have had the privilege of knowing and meeting across Pennsylvania over many years , cling to religion when Washington is not listening to them .
I think that is a fundamental , sort of , misunderstanding of the role of religion and faith in times that are good and times that are bad .
And I similarly do n't think that people cling to their traditions , like hunting and guns , either when they are frustrated with the government .
I just do n't believe that 's how people live their lives .
Now , that does n't mean that people are not frustrated with the government .
We have every reason to be frustrated , particularly with this administration .
But I can see why people would be taken aback and offended by the remarks .
And I think what 's important is that we all listen to one another and we respect one another and we understand the different decisions that people make in life , because we 're a stronger country because of that .
And certainly the weeks that I have spent criss - crossing Pennsylvania , from Erie to Lancaster County , and meeting a lot of wonderful people , says to me that despite whatever frustration anyone has with our government , people are resilient , they are positive , and they 're ready for leadership again that will summon them to something greater than themselves , and that we will deliver on that if given a chance .
MR. GIBSON : We 're going to have some other questions on the same theme , so you 'll be able to get back that .
MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Let me pick up on this .
When these comments from Senator Obama broke on Friday , Senator McCain 's campaign immediately said that it was going to be a killer issue in November .
Senator Clinton , when Bill Richardson called you to say he was endorsing Barack Obama , you told him that Senator Obama can't win .
I 'm not going to ask you about that conversation .
I know you do n't want to talk about it .
But a simple yes - or - no question :
Do you think Senator Obama can beat John McCain or not ?
SENATOR CLINTON :
Well , I think we have to beat John McCain , and I have every reason to believe we 're going to have a Democratic president and it's going to be either Barack or me .
And we 're going to make that happen .
And what is important is that we understand exactly the challenges facing us in order to defeat Senator McCain .
He will be a formidable candidate .
There is n't any doubt about that .
He has a great American story to tell .
He 's a man who has served our country with distinction over many years , but he has the wrong ideas about America .
And those ideas will be tested in the cauldron of this campaign .
But I also know , having now gone through 16 years of being on the receiving end of what the Republican Party dishes out , how important it is that we try to go after every single vote everywhere we possibly can to get to those electoral votes that we 're going to need to have the next president elected .
MR. STEPHANOPOULOS :
But the question is , do you think Senator Obama can do that ?
Can he win ?
SENATOR CLINTON : Yes .
Yes .
Yes .
Now , I think that I can do a better job .
( Laughter . )
I mean , obviously , that 's why I 'm here .
I think I am better able and better prepared in large measure because of what I 've been through and the work that I 've done and the results that I 've produced for people and the coalition that I have put together in this campaign , that Charlie referred to earlier .
Obviously , I believe I would be the best president , or I would not still be here , standing on this stage , and I believe I 'm the better and stronger candidate against Senator McCain , to go toe to toe with him on national security and on how we turn the economy around .
MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Senator Obama , do yo think Senator Clinton can win ?
SENATOR OBAMA : Absolutely , and I 've said so before .
But I too think that I 'm the better candidate .
( Laughter . )
And I do n't think that surprises anybody .
Let me just pick up on a couple of things that Senator Clinton said , though , because during the course of the last few days , you know , she 's said I 'm elitist , out of touch , condescending .
Let me be absolutely clear .
It would be pretty hard for me to be condescending towards people of faith , since I 'm a person of faith and have done more than most other campaigns in reaching out specifically to people of faith , and have written about how Democrats make an error when they do n't show up and speak directly to people 's faith , because I think we can get those votes , and I have in the past .
The same is true with respect to gun owners .
I have large numbers of sportsmen and gun owners in my home state , and they have supported me precisely because I have listened to them , and I know them well .
So the problem that we have in our politics , which is fairly typical , is that you take one person 's statement , if it 's not properly phrased , and you just beat it to death .
And that 's what Senator Clinton 's been doing over the last four days .
And I understand that .
That 's politics , and I expect to have to go through this -- this process .
But I do think it 's important to recognize that it's not helping that person who 's sitting at the kitchen table who is trying to figure out how to pay the bills at the end of the month .
And Senator Clinton 's right .
She has gone through this .
You know , I recall when back in 1992 , when she made a statement about how , what do you expect , should I be at home baking cookies ?
And people attacked her for being elitist and this and that .
And I remember watching that on TV and saying , well , that 's not who she is ; that 's not what she believes ; that 's not what she meant .
And I 'm sure that that 's how she felt as well .
But the problem is that that 's the kind of politics that we 've been accustomed to .
And I think Senator Clinton learned the wrong lesson from it , because she 's adopting the same tactics .
What the American people want are not distractions .
They want to figure out , how are we actually going to deliver on health care ; how are we going to deliver better jobs for people ; how are we going to improve their incomes ; how are we going to send them to college ?
That 's what we have to focus on .
And yes , they are in part frustrated and angry , because this is what passes for our politics in terms -- instead of figuring out , how do we build coalitions to actually move things forward ?
SENATOR CLINTON : Well , could I --
MR. GIBSON : Senator Clinton , before I move on , do you want to do a brief response ?
SENATOR CLINTON : Oh , I do .
Well , first of all , I want to be very clear .
My comments were about your remarks .
And I think that 's important , because it was n't just me responding to them , it was people who heard them , people who felt as though they were aimed at their values , their quality of life , the decisions that they have made .
Now , obviously , what we have to do as Democrats is make sure we get enough votes to win in November .
And as George just said , you know , the Republicans , who are pretty shrewd about what it takes to win , certainly did jump on the comments .
But what 's important here is what we each stand for and what our records are and what we have done over the course of our lives to try to improve the circumstances of those who deserve to live up to their own potential , to make the decisions that are right for them and their families .
And I think year after year for now 35 years , I have a proven record of results .
And what I 'm taking into this campaign is my passion for empowering people , for giving people the feeling that they can make a better future for themselves .
And I think it 's important that that starts from a base of respect and connection in order to be able to get people to follow you and believe that you will lead them in the better direction .
MR. GIBSON : Senator Obama , since you last debated , you made a significant speech in this building on the subject of race and your former pastor , the Reverend Jeremiah Wright .
And you said subsequent to giving that speech that you never heard him say from the pulpit the kinds of things that so have offended people .
But more than a year ago , you rescinded the invitation to him to attend the event when you announced your candidacy .
He was to give the invocation .
And according to the reverend , I 'm quoting him , you said to him , " You can get kind of rough in sermons .
So what we 've decided is that it 's best for you not to be out there in public . "
I 'm quoting the reverend .
But what did you know about his statements that caused you to rescind that invitation ?
SENATOR OBAMA : Well --
MR. GIBSON : And if you knew he got rough in sermons , why did it take you more than a year to publicly disassociate yourself from his remarks ?
SENATOR OBAMA : Well , understand that I had n't seen the remarks that ended up playing on youTube repeatedly .
This was a set of remarks that had been quoted in Rolling Stone Magazine and we looked at them and I thought that they would be a distraction since he had just put them forward .
But , Charlie , I 've discussed this extensively .
Reverend Wright is somebody who made controversial statements but they were not of the sort that we saw that offended so many Americans .
And that 's why I specifically said that these comments were objectionable ; they 're not comments that I believe in .
And I disassociated myself with them .
What I also said was , the church and the body of Reverend Wright 's work , over the course of 30 years , were not represented in those snippets that were shown on television , and that the church has done outstanding work in ministries on HIV / AIDS , prison ministries , providing people with the kind of comfort that we expect in our churches .
And so what I think I tried to do in the speech here at the Constitution Center was speak to a broader context , which is that there is anger in the African American community that sometimes gets expressed , whether in the barbershop or in the church .
That 's true not just in the African American community .
That 's true in other communities as well .
But what we have the opportunity to do is to move beyond it .
And that 's what I think my candidacy represents .
And Senator Clinton mentioned earlier that we have to connect with people .
That 's exactly what we 've done throughout this campaign .
The reason we 've attracted new people into the process , the reason we 've generated so much excitement , the reason that we have been so successful in so many states across the country , bridging racial lines , bridging some of the old divisions , is because people recognize that unless we do , then we 're not going to be able to deliver on the promises that people hear every 4 years , every 8 years , every 12 years .
And it 's my job in this campaign to try to move beyond some of those divisions , because when we are unified , there is nothing that we cannot tackle .
MR. GIBSON : Senator Clinton , let me -- I 'm sorry , go ahead .
Senator Clinton , let me follow up , and let me add to that .
You have said that he would not have been my pastor , and you said that you have to speak out against those kinds of remarks , and implicitly by getting up and moving , and I presume you mean out of the church .
There are 8,000 members of Senator Obama 's church .
And we have heard the inflammatory remarks of Reverend Wright , but so too have we heard testament to many great things that he did .
Do you honestly believe that 8,000 people should have gotten up and walked out of that church ?
SENATOR CLINTON : I was asked a personal question , Charlie , and I gave a personal answer .
Obviously , one 's choice of church and pastor is rooted in what one believes is what you 're seeking in church and what kind of , you know , fellowship you find in church .
But I have to say that , you know , for Pastor Wright to have given his first sermon after 9/11 and to have blamed the United States for the attack , which happened in my city of New York , would have been intolerable for me .
And therefore I would have not been able to stay in the church , and maybe it's , you know , just , again , a personal reflection that regardless of whatever good is going on -- and I have no reason to doubt that a lot of good things were happening in that church -- you get to choose your pastor .
You do n't choose your family , but you get to choose your pastor .
And when asked a direct question , I said I would not have stayed in the church .
SENATOR OBAMA : Well , let me just respond to -- to two things .
Absolutely many of these remarks were objectionable .
I 've already said that I did n't hear them , because I was n't in church that day .
I did n't learn about those statements until much later .
But --
MR. GIBSON : But you did rescind the invitation to him --
SENATOR OBAMA : But that was on -- that was on something entirely different , Charlie .
That -- that was on a different statement .
And I think that what Senator Clinton referred to was extremely offensive , to me and a lot of people .
But what I should also point out is that Senator Clinton 's former pastor , I think , publicly talked about how Reverend Wright was being caricatured and that in fact this is somebody who had maintained an extraordinary ministry for many years .
And so there are two important points : Number one , I was n't aware of all these statements , and I can understand how people would take offense ; but number two , the church is a community that extends beyond the pastor and that church has done outstanding work for many , many years .
The third point I guess I would make is once again that unless we can bridge some of these divides we 're not going to solve problems in this country .
And what my entire body of work over the last 20 years has been devoted to is getting blacks , whites , Hispanics , Asians , Native Americans , young , old to work together , starting when I was a community organizer .
And my own life embodies that diversity .
That 's what America 's about and that 's what this campaign has been about .
MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Senator , two questions .
Number one , do you think Reverend Wright loves America as much as you do ?
And number two , if you get the nomination , what will you do when those sermons are played on television again and again and again ?
SENATOR OBAMA :
You know , George , look , if it 's not this , then it would be something else .
I promise you , if Senator Clinton got the nomination , there will be a whole bunch of video clips about other things .
In a general election , we know that there are going to be all kinds of attacks launched and leveled .
There have been quite a few leveled in this primary campaign .
And I have confidence in the American people that when you talk to the American people honestly and directly about what I believe in , what my plans are on health care , on energy , when they see my track record of the work that I 've done on behalf of people who really need help , I have absolute confidence that they can rally behind my campaign .
And , you know , the notion that somehow that the American people are going to be distracted once again by comments not made by me but by somebody who is associated with me , that I have disowned , I think does n't give the American people enough credit .
MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : You 've disowned him ?
SENATOR OBAMA :
The comments , comments that I 've disowned .
Then that is not something that I think --
MR. STEPHANOPOULOS :
But you do believe he 's as patriotic as you are ?
SENATOR OBAMA :
This is somebody who 's a former Marine .
And so I have -- I believe that he loves this country , but I also believe that he 's somebody who , because of the experiences he's had over the course of a lifetime , is also angry about the injustices that he 's seen .
MR. GIBSON : I 'm getting a little out of balance here .
Do you want to take a few seconds , or do you want to go to the next question ?
SENATOR CLINTON :
Well , I think , in addition to the questions about Reverend Wright and what he said and when he said it , and for whatever reason he might have said these things , there were so many different variations on the explanations that we heard .
And it is something that I think deserves further exploration , because clearly what we 've got to figure out is how we 're going to bring people together in a way that overcomes the anger , overcomes the divisiveness and whatever bitterness there may be out there .
It is clear that , as leaders , we have a choice who we associate with and who we apparently give some kind of seal of approval to .
And I think that it was n't only the specific remarks , but some of the relationships with Reverend Farrakhan , with giving the church bulletin over to the leader of Hamas to put a message in .
You know , these are problems , and they raise questions in people 's minds .
And so this is a legitimate area , as everything is when we run for office , for people to be exploring and trying to find answers .
MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Senator Clinton , we also did a poll today , and there are also questions about you raised in this poll .
About six in 10 voters that we talked to say they do n't believe you 're honest and trustworthy .
And we also asked a lot of Pennsylvania voters for questions they had .
A lot of them raised this honesty issue and your comments about being under sniper fire in Bosnia .
Here 's Tom Rooney from Pittsburgh .
Q Senator , I was in your court until a couple of weeks ago .
How do you reconcile the campaign of credibility that you have when you 've made those comments about what happened getting off the plane in Bosnia , which totally misrepresented what really happened on that day ?
You really lost my vote .
And what can you tell me to get that vote back ?
SENATOR CLINTON : Well , Tom , I can tell you that I may be a lot of things , but I 'm not dumb .
And I wrote about going to Bosnia in my book in 2004 .
I laid it all out there .
And you 're right .
On a couple of occasions in the last weeks I just said some things that were n't in keeping with what I knew to be the case and what I had written about in my book .
And , you know , I 'm embarrassed by it .
I have apologized for it .
I 've said it was a mistake .
And it is , I hope , something that you can look over , because clearly I am proud that I went to Bosnia .
It was a war zone .
General Wesley Clark is here in the audience with me as one of my major supporters .
He and I were talking about it before I came out .
You know , our soldiers were there to try to police and keep the peace in a very dangerous area .
They were totally in battle gear .
There were concerns about the potential dangers .
The former president of Bosnia has said that he was worried about the safety of the situation .
So I know that it is something that some people have said , " Wait a minute .
What happened here ? "
But I have talked about this and written about it .
And then , unfortunately , on a few occasions I was not as accurate as I have been in the past .
But I know too that , you know , being able to rely on my experience of having gone to Bosnia , gone to more than 80 countries , having represented the United States in so many different settings gives me a tremendous advantage going into this campaign , particularly against Senator McCain .
So I will either try to get more sleep , Tom , or , you know , have somebody who , you know , is there as a reminder to me .
You know , you can go back for the past 15 months .
We both have said things that , you know , turned out not to be accurate .
You know , that happens when you 're talking as much as we have talked .
But you know , I 'm very sorry that I said it .
And I have said that , you know , it just did n't jibe with what I had written about and knew to be the truth .
MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Senator Obama , your campaign has sent out a cascade of e-mails , just about every day , questioning Senator Clinton 's credibility .
And you yourself have said she has n't been fully truthful about what she would do as president .
Do you believe that Senator Clinton has been fully truthful about her past ?
SENATOR OBAMA : Well , look , I think that Senator Clinton has a strong record to run on .
She would n't be here if she did n't .
And you know , I have n't commented on the issue of Bosnia .
You know , I --
MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Your campaign has .
SENATOR OBAMA : Of course , but --
SENATOR CLINTON : ( Laughs . )
SENATOR OBAMA : Because we 're asked about it .
But look , the fact of the matter is , is that both of us are working as hard as we can to make sure that we 're delivering a message to the American people about what we would do as president .
Sometimes that message is going to be imperfectly delivered , because we are recorded every minute of every day .
And I think Senator Clinton deserves , you know , the right to make some errors once in a while .
I 'm -- obviously , I make some as well .
I think what 's important is to make sure that we do n't get so obsessed with gaffes that we lose sight of the fact that this is a defining moment in our history .
We are going to be tackling some of the biggest issues that any president has dealt with in the last 40 years .
Our economy is teetering not just on the edge of recession , but potentially worse .
Our foreign policy is in a shambles .
We are involved in two wars .
People 's incomes have not gone up , and their costs have .
And we 're seeing greater income inequality now than any time since the 1920s .
In those circumstances , for us to be obsessed with this -- these kinds of errors I think is a mistake .
And that 's not what our campaign has been about .
What our campaign has been about is offering some specific solutions to how we move these issues forward and identifying the need to change the culture in Washington , which we have n't talked at all about , but that has blocked real reform decade after decade after decade .
That , I think , is the job of the next president of the United States .
That 's what I intend to do .
That 's why I 'm running .
MR. GIBSON : And Senator Obama , I want to do one more question , which goes to the basic issue of electability .
And it is a question raised by a voter in Latrobe , Pennsylvania , a woman by the name of Nash McCabe .
Take a look .
NASH MCCABE ( Latrobe , Pennsylvania ) : ( From videotape . )
Senator Obama , I have a question , and I want to know if you believe in the American flag .
I am not questioning your patriotism , but all our servicemen , policemen and EMS wear the flag .
I want to know why you do n't .
MR. GIBSON : Just to add to that , I noticed you put one on yesterday .
But -- you 've talked about this before , but it comes up again and again when we talk to voters .
And as you may know , it is all over the Internet .
And it 's something of a theme that Senators Clinton and McCain 's advisers agree could give you a major vulnerability if you 're the candidate in November .
How do you convince Democrats that this would not be a vulnerability ?
SENATOR OBAMA : Well , look , I revere the American flag , and I would not be running for president if I did not revere this country .
This is -- I would not be standing here if it was n't for this country .
And I 've said this -- again , there 's no other country in which my story is even possible ; somebody who was born to a teenage mom , raised by a single mother and grandparents from small towns in Kansas , you know , who was able to get an education and rise to the point where I can run for the highest office in the land .
I could not help but love this country for all that it 's given me .
And so what I 've tried to do is to show my patriotism by how I treat veterans when I 'm working in the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee ; by making sure that I 'm speaking forcefully about how we need to bring this war in Iraq to a close , because I think it is not serving our national security well and it's not serving our military families and our troops well ; talking about how we need to restore a sense of economic fairness to this country because that 's what this country has always been about , is providing upward mobility and ladders to opportunity for all Americans .
That 's what I love about this country .
And so I will continue to fight for those issues .
And I am absolutely confident that during the general election that when I'm in a debate with John McCain , people are not going to be questioning my patriotism , they are going to be questioning how can you make people 's lives a little bit better .
And let me just make one last point on this issue of the flag pin .
As you noted , I wore one yesterday when a veteran handed it to me , who himself was disabled and works on behalf of disabled veterans .
I have never said that I do n't wear flag pins or refuse to wear flag pins .
This is the kind of manufactured issue that our politics has become obsessed with and , once again , distracts us from what should be my job when I 'm commander in chief , which is going to be figuring out how we get our troops out of Iraq and how we actually make our economy better for the American people .
MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Senator , if you get the nomination , you 'll have to -- ( applause ) -- ( inaudible ) .
I want to give Senator Clinton a chance to respond , but first a follow - up on this issue , the general theme of patriotism in your relationships .
A gentleman named William Ayers , he was part of the Weather Underground in the 1970s .
They bombed the Pentagon , the Capitol and other buildings .
He 's never apologized for that .
And in fact , on 9/11 he was quoted in The New York Times saying , " I do n't regret setting bombs ; I feel we did n't do enough . "
An early organizing meeting for your state senate campaign was held at his house , and your campaign has said you are friendly .
Can you explain that relationship for the voters , and explain to Democrats why it wo n't be a problem ?
SEN .
OBAMA : George , but this is an example of what I 'm talking about .
This is a guy who lives in my neighborhood , who 's a professor of English in Chicago , who I know and who I have not received some official endorsement from .
He 's not somebody who I exchange ideas from on a regular basis .
And the notion that somehow as a consequence of me knowing somebody who engaged in detestable acts 40 years ago when I was 8 years old , somehow reflects on me and my values , does n't make much sense , George .
The fact is , is that I 'm also friendly with Tom Coburn , one of the most conservative Republicans in the United States Senate , who during his campaign once said that it might be appropriate to apply the death penalty to those who carried out abortions .
Do I need to apologize for Mr. Coburn 's statements ?
Because I certainly do n't agree with those either .
So this kind of game , in which anybody who I know , regardless of how flimsy the relationship is , is somehow -- somehow their ideas could be attributed to me -- I think the American people are smarter than that .
They 're not going to suggest somehow that that is reflective of my views , because it obviously is n't .
SEN .
CLINTON : Well , I think that is a fair general statement , but I also believe that Senator Obama served on a board with Mr. Ayers for a period of time , the Woods Foundation , which was a paid directorship position .
And if I 'm not mistaken , that relationship with Mr. Ayers on this board continued after 9/11 and after his reported comments , which were deeply hurtful to people in New York , and I would hope to every American , because they were published on 9/11 and he said that he was just sorry they had n't done more .
And what they did was set bombs and in some instances people died .
So it is -- you know , I think it is , again , an issue that people will be asking about .
And I have no doubt -- I know Senator Obama 's a good man and I respect him greatly but I think that this is an issue that certainly the Republicans will be raising .
And it goes to this larger set of concerns about , you know , how we are going to run against John McCain .
You know , I wish the Republicans would apologize for the disaster of the Bush - Cheney years and not run anybody , just say that it 's time for the Democrats to go back into the White House .
( Laughter , applause . )
Unfortunately , they do n't seem to be willing to do that .
So we know that they 're going to be out there , full force .
And you know , I 've been in this arena for a long time .
I have a lot of baggage , and everybody has rummaged through it for years .
( Laughter . )
And so therefore , I have , you know , an opportunity to come to this campaign with a very strong conviction and feeling that I will be able to withstand whatever the Republican sends our way .
SENATOR OBAMA : I 'm going to have to respond to this just really quickly , but by Senator Clinton 's own vetting standards , I do n't think she would make it , since President Clinton pardoned or commuted the sentences of two members of the Weather Underground , which I think is a slightly more significant act than me --
AUDIENCE MEMBER : ( Applauds . )
MR. GIBSON : Please .
SENATOR OBAMA : -- than me serving on a board with somebody for actions that he did 40 years ago .
Look , there is no doubt that the Republicans will attack either of us .
What I 've been able to display during the course of this primary is that I can take a punch .
I 've taken some pretty good ones from Senator Clinton .
And I do n't begrudge her that .
That 's part of what the political contest is about .
I am looking forward to having a debate with John McCain , and I think every poll indicates that I am doing just as well , if not better , in pulling together the coalition that will defeat John McCain .
And when it comes to November , and people are going into the polling place , they 're going to be asking , are we going to go through four more years of George Bush economic policies ; are we going to go through four more years of George Bush foreign policy ?
And if we as Democrats and if I as the nominee have put forward a clear vision for how we 're going to move the country forward , deal with issues like energy dependence , lower gas prices , provide health care , get our troops out of Iraq , that is a debate that I 'm happy to have and a debate that I 'm confident I can win .
MR. GIBSON : And Senator Clinton , I 'm getting out of balance in terms of time .
SENATOR CLINTON : I 've noticed .
( Laughs . )
MR. GIBSON : And you 're getting shortchanged here .
And so if you want to reply here , fine .
If you want to wait , we 'll do it in the next half hour .
SENATOR CLINTON : We can wait .
MR. GIBSON : All right .
We will take a commercial break .
We will come back .
And the Democratic debate , from the city of Philadelphia before the Pennsylvania primary , will continue .
Stay with us .
( Applause . )
( Announcements . )
MR. GIBSON : Another quote from the Constitution , apropos because we are here , as you heard just a moment ago , at the Constitution Center .
Senator Clinton , a question for you .
We talked about the military applications from the Constitution and this is a question that involves the war in Iraq .
It comes from Mandy Garber of Pittsburgh .
Take a look .
MANDY GARBER ( Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania ) :
So , the real question is , I mean , do the candidates have a real plan to get us out of Iraq or is it just real campaign propaganda ?
And you know , it 's really unclear .
They keep saying we want to bring the troops back , but considering what 's happening on the ground , how is that going to happen ?
MR. GIBSON : Let me just add a little bit to that question , because your communications director in your campaign , Howard Wolfson on a conference call recently was asked , " Is Senator Clinton going to stick to her announced plan of bringing one or two brigades out of Iraq every month whatever the realities on the ground ? "
And Wolfson said , " I 'm giving you a one - word answer so we can be clear about it , the answer is yes . "
So if the military commanders in Iraq came to you on day one and said this kind of withdrawal would destabilize Iraq , it would set back all of the gains that we have made , no matter what , you 're going to order those troops to come home ?
SENATOR CLINTON : Yes , I am , Charlie .
And here 's why :
You know , thankfully we have a system in our country of civilian control of the military .
And our professional military are the best in the world .
They give their best advice and then they execute the policies of the president .
I have watched this president as he has continued to change the rationale and move the goalposts when it comes to Iraq .
And I am convinced that it is in America 's best interest , it is in the best interest of our military , and I even believe it is in the best interest of Iraq , that upon taking office , I will ask the secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff and my security advisers to immediately put together for me a plan so that I can begin to withdraw within 60 days .
I will make it very clear that we will do so in a responsible and careful manner , because obviously , withdrawing troops and equipment is dangerous .
I will also make it clear to the Iraqis that they no longer have a blank check from the president of the United States , because I believe that it will be only through our commitment to withdraw that the Iraqis will begin to do what they have failed to do for all of these years .
I will also begin an intensive diplomatic effort , both within the region and internationally , to begin to try to get other countries to understand the stakes that we all face when it comes to the future of Iraq .
But I have been convinced and very clear that I will begin to withdraw troops within 60 days .
And we 've had other instances in our history where some military commanders have been very publicly opposed to what a president was proposing to do .
But I think it 's important that this decision be made , and I intend to make it .
MR. GIBSON : But Senator Clinton , are n't you saying -- I mean , General Petraeus was in Washington .
You both were there when he testified , saying that the gains in Iraq are fragile and are reversible .
Are you essentially saying , " I know better than the military commanders here " ?
SENATOR CLINTON : No , what I 'm saying , Charlie , is that no one can predict what will happen .
There are many different scenarios .
But one thing I am sure of is that our staying in Iraq , our continuing to lose our men and women in uniform , having many injured , the Iraqi casualties that we are seeing as well , is -- is no way for us to maintain a strong position in the world .
It 's not only about Iraq .
It is about ending the war in Iraq , so that we can begin paying attention to all of the other problems we have .
There is n't any doubt that Afghanistan has been neglected .
It has not gotten the resources that it needs .
We hear that from our military commanders responsible for that region of the world .
And there are other problems that we have failed to address .
So the bottom line for me is , we do n't know what will happen as we withdraw .
We do know what will happen if we stay mired in Iraq .
The Iraqi government will not accept responsibility for its own future .
Our military will continue to be stretched thin , and our soldiers will be on their second , third , even their fourth deployment .
And we will not be able to reassert our leadership and our moral authority in the world .
And I think those are the kind of broad issues that a president has to take into account .
MR. GIBSON : And Senator Obama , your campaign manager , David Plouffe , said , when he is -- this is talking about you -- when he is elected president , we will be out of Iraq in 16 months at the most ; there should be no confusion about that .
So you 'd give the same rock - hard pledge , that no matter what the military commanders said , you would give the order : Bring them home .
SENATOR OBAMA : Because the commander in chief sets the mission , Charlie .
That 's not the role of the generals .
And one of the things that 's been interesting about the president 's approach lately has been to say , well , I 'm just taking cues from General Petraeus .
Well , the president sets the mission .
The general and our troops carry out that mission .
And unfortunately we have had a bad mission , set by our civilian leadership , which our military has performed brilliantly .
But it is time for us to set a strategy that is going to make the American people safer .
Now , I will always listen to our commanders on the ground with respect to tactics .
Once I 've given them a new mission , that we are going to proceed deliberately in an orderly fashion out of Iraq and we are going to have our combat troops out , we will not have permanent bases there , once I 've provided that mission , if they come to me and want to adjust tactics , then I will certainly take their recommendations into consideration ; but ultimately the buck stops with me as the commander in chief .
And what I have to look at is not just the situation in Iraq , but the fact that we continue to see al Qaeda getting stronger in Afghanistan and in Pakistan , we continue to see anti-American sentiment fanned all cross the Middle East , we are overstretched in a way -- we do not have a strategic reserve at this point .
If there was another crisis that was taking place , we would not have a brigade that we could send to deal with that crisis that is n't already scheduled to be deployed in Iraq .
That is not sustainable .
That 's not smart national security policy , and it 's going to change when I 'm president .
MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Senator Obama , let 's stay in the region .
Iran continues to pursue a nuclear option .
Those weapons , if they got them , would probably pose the greatest threat to Israel .
During the Cold War , it was the United States policy to extend deterrence to our NATO allies .
An attack on Great Britain would be treated as if it were an attack on the United States .
Should it be U.S. policy now to treat an Iranian attack on Israel as if it were an attack on the United States ?
SEN .
OBAMA : Well , our first step should be to keep nuclear weapons out of the hands of the Iranians , and that has to be one of our top priorities .
And I will make it one of our top priorities when I 'm president of the United States .
I have said I will do whatever is required to prevent the Iranians from obtaining nuclear weapons .
I believe that that includes direct talks with the Iranians where we are laying out very clearly for them , here are the issues that we find unacceptable , not only development of nuclear weapons but also funding terrorist organizations like Hamas and Hezbollah , as well as their anti-Israel rhetoric and threats towards Israel .
I believe that we can offer them carrots and sticks , but we 've got to directly engage and make absolutely clear to them what our posture is .
Now , my belief is that they should also know that I will take no options off the table when it comes to preventing them from using nuclear weapons or obtaining nuclear weapons , and that would include any threats directed at Israel or any of our allies in the region .
MR. STEPHANOPOULOS :
So you would extend our deterrent to Israel ?
SENATOR OBAMA : As I 've said before , I think it is very important that Iran understands that an attack on Israel is an attack on our strongest ally in the region , one that we -- one whose security we consider paramount , and that -- that would be an act of aggression that we -- that I would -- that I would consider an attack that is unacceptable , and the United States would take appropriate action .
MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Senator Clinton , would you ?
SENATOR CLINTON : Well , in fact , George , I think that we should be looking to create an umbrella of deterrence that goes much further than just Israel .
Of course I would make it clear to the Iranians that an attack on Israel would incur massive retaliation from the United States , but I would do the same with other countries in the region .
You know , we are at a very dangerous point with Iran .
The Bush policy has failed .
Iran has not been deterred .
They continue to try to not only obtain the fissile material for nuclear weapons but they are intent upon and using their efforts to intimidate the region and to have their way when it comes to the support of terrorism in Lebanon and elsewhere .
And I think that this is an opportunity , with skillful diplomacy , for the United States to go to the region and enlist the region in a security agreement vis-a - vis Iran .
It would give us three tools we do n't now have .
Number one , we 've got to begin diplomatic engagement with Iran , and we want the region and the world to understand how serious we are about it .
And I would begin those discussions at a low level .
I certainly would not meet with Ahmadinejad , because even again today he made light of 9/11 and said he's not even sure it happened and that people actually died .
He 's not someone who would have an opportunity to meet with me in the White House .
But I would have a diplomatic process that would engage him .
And secondly , we 've got to deter other countries from feeling that they have to acquire nuclear weapons .
You ca n't go to the Saudis or the Kuwaitis or UAE and others who have a legitimate concern about Iran and say :
Well , do n't acquire these weapons to defend yourself unless you 're also willing to say we will provide a deterrent backup and we will let the Iranians know that , yes , an attack on Israel would trigger massive retaliation , but so would an attack on those countries that are willing to go under this security umbrella and forswear their own nuclear ambitions .
And finally we cannot permit Iran to become a nuclear weapons power .
And this administration has failed in our efforts to convince the rest of the world that that is a danger , not only to us and not just to Israel but to the region and beyond .
Therefore we have got to have this process that reaches out , beyond even who we would put under the security umbrella , to get the rest of the world on our side to try to impose the kind of sanctions and diplomatic efforts that might prevent this from occurring .
MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Let me turn to the economy .
That is the number one issue on Americans ' minds right now .
Yesterday , Senator McCain singled that the number one issue , in the general election campaign on the economy , is going to be taxes .
And he says that both of you are going to raise taxes , not just on the wealthy but on everyone .
Here 's what he said in his speech yesterday .
SENATOR JOHN MCCAIN ( R - AZ ) : ( Pre-recorded remarks . )
All these tax increases are under the fine print of the slogan : hope .
They 're going to raise your taxes by thousands of dollars a year .
And they have the audacity to hope you do n't mind .
( Laughter . )
MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Senator Clinton , two - part question .
Two - part question :
Can you make an absolute , read - my - lips pledge that there will be no tax increases of any kind for anyone earning under $ 200,000 a year ?
And if the economy is as weak a year from now as it is today , will you -- will you persist in your plans to roll back President Bush 's tax cuts for wealthier Americans ?
SENATOR CLINTON : Well , George , I have made a commitment that I will let the taxes on people making more than $ 250,000 a year go back to the rates that they were paying in the 1990s .
MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Even if the economy is weak ?
SENATOR CLINTON : Yes .
And here 's why : Number one , I do not believe that it will detrimentally affect the economy by doing that .
As I recall , you know , we used that tool during the 1990s to very good effect and I think we can do so again .
I am absolutely committed to not raising a single tax on middle class Americans , people making less than $ 250,000 a year .
In fact , I have a very specific plan of $ 100 billion in tax cuts that would go to help people afford health care , security retirement plans , you know , make it possible for people to get long - term care insurance and care for their parents and grandparents who they are trying to support , making college affordable and so much else .
Well , if you look at how we'd have to sequence that , we might not be able to do all of that at once .
But if you go to my website , HillaryClinton.com , it is laid out there how I will pay for everything , because everything I have proposed , I have put in how I would pay for it .
MR. STEPHANOPOULOS :
An absolute commitment , no middle - class tax increases of any kind .
SENATOR CLINTON : No , that 's right .
That is my commitment .
MR. GIBSON : Senator Obama ?
MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Would you take the same pledge ?
SENATOR OBAMA : Well , I not only have pledged not to raise their taxes , I 've been the first candidate in this race to specifically say I would cut their taxes .
And one of the centerpieces of my economic plan would be to say that we are going to offset the payroll tax , the most regressive of our taxes , so that families who are earning -- who are middle - income individuals making $ 75,000 a year or less , that they would get a tax break so that families would see up to a thousand dollars worth of relief .
Senior citizens who have earnings of less than $ 50,000 would n't have to pay income tax on their Social Security .
And middle - class homeowners who currently do n't itemize on their tax filings , they would be able to get a deduction the same way that wealthy individuals do .
Now , here 's the reason why that 's important .
We have seen wages and incomes flat or declining at a time when costs have gone up .
And one of the things that we 've learned from George Bush 's economic policies , which John McCain now wants to follow , is that pain trickles up .
And so , partly because people have been strapped and have had a tough time making ends meet , we 're now seeing a deteriorating housing market .
That 's also as a consequence of the lack of oversight and regulation of these banks and financial institutions that gave loans that they should n't have .
And part of it has to do with the fact that you had $ 185 million by mortgage lenders spent on lobbyists and special interests who were writing these laws .
So the rules in Washington -- the tax code has been written on behalf of the well connected .
Our trade laws have -- same thing has happened .
And part of how we 're going to be able to deliver on middle - class tax relief is to change how business is done in Washington .
And that 's been a central focus of our campaign .
MR. GIBSON : Senator Obama , you both have now just taken this pledge on people under $ 250,000 and 200 - and - what , 250,000 .
SENATOR OBAMA : Well , it depends on how you calculate it .
But it would be between 200 and 250,000 .
MR. GIBSON : All right .
You have however said you would favor an increase in the capital gains tax .
As a matter of fact , you said on CNBC , and I quote , " I certainly would not go above what existed under Bill Clinton , which was 28 percent . "
It 's now 15 percent .
That 's almost a doubling if you went to 28 percent .
But actually Bill Clinton in 1997 signed legislation that dropped the capital gains tax to 20 percent .
SENATOR OBAMA : Right .
MR. GIBSON : And George Bush has taken it down to 15 percent .
SENATOR OBAMA : Right .
MR. GIBSON : And in each instance , when the rate dropped , revenues from the tax increased .
The government took in more money .
And in the 1980s , when the tax was increased to 28 percent , the revenues went down .
So why raise it at all , especially given the fact that 100 million people in this country own stock and would be affected ?
SENATOR OBAMA : Well , Charlie , what I 've said is that I would look at raising the capital gains tax for purposes of fairness .
We saw an article today which showed that the top 50 hedge fund managers made $ 29 billion last year -- $ 29 billion for 50 individuals .
And part of what has happened is that those who are able to work the stock market and amass huge fortunes on capital gains are paying a lower tax rate than their secretaries .
That 's not fair .
And what I want is not oppressive taxation .
I want businesses to thrive and I want people to be rewarded for their success .
But what I also want to make sure is that our tax system is fair and that we are able to finance health care for Americans who currently do n't have it and that we 're able to invest in our infrastructure and invest in our schools .
And you can't do that for free , and you can't take out a credit card from the Bank of China in the name of our children and our grandchildren and then say that you 're cutting taxes , which is essentially what John McCain has been talking about .
And that is irresponsible .
You know , I believe in the principle that you pay as you go , and you do n't propose tax cuts unless you are closing other tax breaks for individuals .
And you do n't increase spending unless you 're eliminating some spending or you 're finding some new revenue .
That 's how we got an additional $ 4 trillion worth of debt under George Bush .
That is helping to undermine our economy , and it 's going to change when I 'm president of the United States .
MR. GIBSON : But history shows that when you drop the capital gains tax , the revenues go up .
SENATOR OBAMA : Well , that might happen or it might not .
It depends on what 's happening on Wall Street and how business is going .
I think the biggest problem that we 've got on Wall Street right now is the fact that we 've got a housing crisis that this president has not been attentive to and that it took John McCain three tries before he got it right .
And if we can stabilize that market and we can get credit flowing again , then I think we 'll see stocks do well , and once again I think we can generate the revenue that we need to run this government and hopefully to pay down some of this debt .
MR. GIBSON : Senator Clinton .
SENATOR CLINTON :
Well , let me start by saying that I think we know that we 've got to get back to an economy that works for everyone .
The president has been very good for people who are doing well , and that 's great .
But it was better for our country when we had an economy that lifted everyone up at the same time , and we had that during the 1990s ; you know , 22.7 million new jobs , more people lifted out of poverty than any time in our recent history .
A typical family saw a $ 7,000 increase in income .
And we have lost that .
You know , now the typical family has lost at least $ 1,000 .
And the fact is that , you know , I do n't want to take one more penny of tax money from anybody .
But what I want to do is make some smart investments .
And I was the first to come out with a strategic energy fund , where we need to be investing in clean renewable energy .
And I think we could put 5 million Americans to work .
I think we have to invest in our infrastructure .
That also will get the economy moving again , and I believe we could put about 3 million people to work in good union jobs where people get a good wage with a good set of benefits that can support a middle - class family with a rising standard of living .
I want to see us actually tackle the housing crisis , something I 've been talking about for over a year .
If I had been president a year ago , I believe we would have begun to avoid some of the worst of the mortgage and credit crisis , because we would have started much earlier than we have -- in fact , I do n't think we 've really done very much at all yet -- in dealing with a way of freezing home foreclosures , of freezing interest rates , getting money into communities to be able to withstand the problems that are caused by foreclosures .
Governor Rendell has done a great job in Pennsylvania .
He saw this coming .
And unlike our current president , who either did n't know it or did n't care about it , he has really held the line , and Pennsylvania has been much less affected by home foreclosures .
But the president has n't done that , and what I have proposed would do that .
So you 've got to look at the entire economy .
And from my perspective , yes , taxes is a piece of it .
But you 've got to figure out what is it we would invest in that would make us richer and safer and stronger tomorrow , which would be helping everybody .
MR. GIBSON : I 'm going to go to a commercial break .
But I just want to come back to one thing you said , and I want to be clear .
The question was about capital gains tax .
Would you say , " No , I 'm not going to raise capital gains taxes " ?
SENATOR CLINTON : I would n't raise it above the 20 percent if I raised it at all .
I would not raise it above what it was during the Clinton administration .
MR. GIBSON : " If I raised it at all . "
Would you propose an increase in the capital gains tax ?
SENATOR CLINTON :
You know , Charlie , I 'm going to have to look and see what the revenue situation is .
You know , we now have the largest budget deficit we 've ever had , $ 311 billion .
We went from a $ 5.6 trillion projected surplus to what we have today , which is a $ 9 trillion debt .
I do n't want to raise taxes on anybody .
I 'm certainly against one of Senator Obama 's ideas , which is to lift the cap on the payroll tax , because that would impose additional taxes on people who are , you know , educators here in the Philadelphia area or in the suburbs , police officers , firefighters and the like .
So I think we have to be very careful about how we navigate this .
So the $ 250,000 mark is where I am sure we 're going .
But beyond that , we 're going to have to look and see where we are .
MR. GIBSON : Very quickly , because I owe Senator Clinton time , but , yeah , you wanted to respond .
SENATOR OBAMA : Well , Charlie , I just have to respond real quickly to Senator Clinton 's last comment .
What I have proposed is that we raise the cap on the payroll tax , because right now millionaires and billionaires do n't have to pay beyond $ 97,000 a year .
That 's where it 's kept .
Now most firefighters , most teachers , you know , they 're not making over $ 100,000 a year .
In fact , only 6 percent of the population does .
And I 've also said that I 'd be willing to look at exempting people who are making slightly above that .
But understand the alternative is that because we 're going to have fewer workers to more retirees , if we do n't do anything on Social Security , then those benefits will effectively be cut , because we 'll be running out of money .
MR. GIBSON : But Senator , that 's a tax .
That 's a tax on people under $ 250,000 .
SENATOR OBAMA : Well , no , look , let me -- let me finish my point here , Charlie .
Senator Clinton just said she certainly would n't do this ; this was a bad idea .
In Iowa she , when she was outside of camera range , said to an individual there she 'd certainly consider the idea .
And then that was recorded , and she apparently was n't aware that it was being recorded .
So this is an option that I would strongly consider , because the alternatives , like raising the retirement age , or cutting benefits , or raising the payroll tax on everybody , including people who make less than $ 97,000 a year --
MR. GIBSON : But there 's a heck of a lot of --
SENATOR OBAMA : -- those are not good policy options .
MR. GIBSON : Those are a heck of a lot of people between $ 97,000 and $ 200 ( ,000 ) and $ 250,000 .
If you raise the payroll taxes , that 's going to raise taxes on them .
SENATOR OBAMA :
And that 's -- and that 's -- and that 's why I 've said , Charlie , that I would look at potentially exempting those who are in between .
But the point is , we 're going to have to capture some revenue in order to stabilize the Social Security system .
You can't -- you can't get something for nothing .
And if we care about Social Security , which I do , and if we are firm in our commitment to make sure that it 's going to be there for the next generation , and not just for our generation , then we have an obligation to figure out how to stabilize the system .
And I think we should be honest in presenting our ideas in terms of how we 're going to do that and not just say that we 're going to form a commission and try to solve the problem some other way .
SENATOR CLINTON : Well , in fact , I am totally committed to making sure Social Security is solvent .
If we had stayed on the path we were on at the end of my husband 's administration , we sure would be in a lot better position because we had a plan to extend the life of the Social Security Trust Fund and again , President Bush decided that that was n't a priority , that the war in Iraq and tax cuts for the wealthiest of Americans were his priorities , neither of which he 's ever paid for .
I think it 's the first time we 've ever been taken to war and had a president who would n't pay for it .
But when it comes to Social Security , fiscal responsibility is the first and most important step .
You 've got to begin to reign in the budget , pay as you go , to try to replenish our Social Security Trust Fund .
And with all due respect , the last time we had a crisis in Social Security was 1983 .
President Reagan and Speaker Tip O'Neill came up with a commission .
That was the best and smartest way , because you 've got to get Republicans and Democrats together .
That 's what I will do .
And I will say , number one , do n't cut benefits on current beneficiaries ; they 're already having a hard enough time .
And number two , do not impose additional tax burdens on middle - class families .
There are lots of ways we can fix Social Security that do n't impose those burdens , and I will do that .
SENATOR OBAMA :
That commission raised the retirement age , Charlie , and also raised the payroll tax .
And so Senator Clinton , if she -- she can't have it both ways .
You can't come at me for proposing a solution that will save Social Security without burdening middle - income Americans , and then suggest that somehow she 's got a magic solution .
SENATOR CLINTON :
But there are more progressive ways of doing it than , you know , lifting the cap .
And I think we 'll work it out .
I have every confidence we 're going to work it out .
I know that we can make this happen .
MR. GIBSON : On that point , we 're going to take a break , a commercial break .
The Democratic debate from here in Philadelphia before the Pennsylvania primary will continue .
Stay with us .
We 'll be back .
( Applause . )
( Announcements . )
MR. GIBSON : Back to the Philadelphia Debate , the Democratic Debate , just less than a week now before the Pennsylvania primary .
And I would be remiss tonight if I did n't take note of the fact that today is the one - year anniversary of Virginia Tech .
And I think it 's fair to say that probably every American during this day , at one point or another , said a small prayer for the great people at that university and for those who died .
It also , I suspect , makes this an appropriate time to talk about guns .
And it has not been talked about much in this campaign and it's an important issue in the state of Pennsylvania .
Both of you , in the past , have supported strong gun control measures .
But now when I listen to you on the campaign , I hear you emphasizing that you believe in an individual 's right to bear arms .
Both of you were strong advocates for licensing of guns .
Both of you were strong advocates for the registration of guns .
Why do n't you emphasize that now , Senator Clinton ?
SENATOR CLINTON : Well , Charlie , on Friday , I was with Mayor Nutter , who 's here , in West Philadelphia at the YMCA there , to talk about what we could do together to bring down the crime rate that has ravaged Philadelphia .
You know , more than one person , on average , a day is murdered in Philadelphia .
And Mayor Nutter is very committed , as the mayor of this great city , to try to do what he can to stem the violence .
And what I said then is what I have been saying , that I will be a good partner , for cities like Philadelphia , as president .
Because I will bring back the COPS program , the so - called COPS program , where we had 100,000 police on the street , which really helped drive down the crime rate and also helped create better community relations .
I will also work to reinstate the assault weapons ban .
We had it during the 1990s .
It really was an aid to our police officers , who are now once again , because it has lapsed -- the Republicans will not reinstate it -- are being outgunned on our streets by these military - style weapons .
I will also work to make sure that police departments in Philadelphia , Pittsburgh , Harrisburg , across America get access to the federal information that will enable them to track illegal guns , because the numbers are astounding .
Probably 80 percent of the guns used in gun crimes are in the hands of that criminal , that gang member -- unfortunately , people who are sometimes , you know , mentally challenged -- because it got there illegally .
And under the Republicans , that information was kept from local law enforcement .
So I believe that we can balance what I think is the right equation .
I respect the Second Amendment .
I respect the rights of lawful gun owners to own guns , to use their guns , but I also believe that most lawful gun owners whom I have spoken with for many years across our country also want to be sure that we keep those guns out of the wrong hands .
And as president , I will work to try to bridge this divide , which I think has been polarizing and , frankly , does n't reflect the common sense of the American people .
So we will strike the right balance to protect the constitutional right but to give people the feeling and the reality that they will be protected from guns in the wrong hands .
MR. GIBSON : Senator Obama , the District of Columbia has a law , it 's had a law since 1976 , it 's now before the United States Supreme Court , that prohibits ownership of handguns , a sawed - off shotgun , a machine gun or a short - barreled rifle .
Is that law consistent with an individual 's right to bear arms ?
SENATOR OBAMA : Well , Charlie , I confess I obviously have n't listened to the briefs and looked at all the evidence .
As a general principle , I believe that the Constitution confers an individual right to bear arms .
But just because you have an individual right does not mean that the state or local government can't constrain the exercise of that right , and , you know , in the same way that we have a right to private property but local governments can establish zoning ordinances that determine how you can use it .
And I think that it is going to be important for us to reconcile what are two realities in this country .
There 's the reality of gun ownership and the tradition of gun ownership that 's passed on from generation to generation .
You know , when you listen to people who have hunted , and they talk about the fact that they went hunting with their fathers or their mothers , then that is something that is deeply important to them and , culturally , they care about deeply .
But you also have the reality of what 's happening here in Philadelphia and what 's happening in Chicago .
And ...
Mr. GIBSON : But do you still favor the registration of guns ?
Do you still favor the licensing of guns ?
And in 1996 , your campaign issued a questionnaire , and your writing was on the questionnaire that said you favored a ban on handguns .
SENATOR OBAMA : No , my writing was n't on that particular questionnaire , Charlie .
As I said , I have never favored an all - out ban on handguns .
What I think we can provide is common - sense approaches to the issue of illegal guns that are ending up on the streets .
We can make sure that criminals do n't have guns in their hands .
We can make certain that those who are mentally deranged are not getting a hold of handguns .
We can trace guns that have been used in crimes to unscrupulous gun dealers that may be selling to straw purchasers and dumping them on the streets .
The point is , is that what we have to do is get beyond the politics of this issue and figure out what , in fact , is working .
Look , in my hometown of Chicago , on the south side of Chicago , we 've had 34 gun deaths last year of Chicago public school children .
And I think that most law - abiding gun owners all across America would recognize that it is perfectly appropriate for local communities and states and the federal government to try to figure out , how do we stop that kind of killing ?
MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Senator Clinton , you have a home in D.C .
Do you support the D.C. ban ?
SENATOR CLINTON :
You know , George , I want to give local communities the opportunity to have some authority over determining how to keep their citizens safe .
This case you 're referring to , before the Supreme Court , is apparently dividing the Bush administration .
You know , the Bush administration basically said , we do n't have enough facts to know whether or not it is appropriate .
And Vice President Cheney who , you know , is a fourth special branch of government all unto himself -- ( laughter ) -- has actually filed a brief saying , oh , no , we have to , you know , we have to prevent D.C. from doing this .
So --
MR. STEPHANOPOULOS :
But what do you think ?
Do you support it or not ?
SENATOR CLINTON : Well , what I support is sensible regulation that is consistent with the constitutional right to own and bear arms .
MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Is the D.C. ban consistent with that right ?
SENATOR CLINTON :
Well , I think a total ban , with no exceptions under any circumstances , might be found by the court not to be .
But I do n't know the facts .
But I do n't think that should blow open a hole that says that D.C. or Philadelphia or anybody else cannot come up with sensible regulations to protect their people and keep , you know , machine guns and assault weapons out of the hands of folks who should n't have them .
MR. GIBSON : Well , with all due respect , and I 'm not sure I got an answer from Senator Obama .
But do you still favor licensing and registration of handguns ?
SENATOR CLINTON :
What I favor is what works in New York .
You know , we have a set of rules in New York City and we have a totally different set of rules in the rest of the state .
What might work in New York City is certainly not going to work in Montana .
So , for the federal government to be having any kind of , you know , blanket rules that they 're going to try to impose , I think does n't make sense .
MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : But Senator , you were for that when you ran for Senate in New York .
SENATOR CLINTON : I was for -- I was for the New York rules , that 's right .
I was for the New York rules because they have worked over time .
And there is n't a lot of uproar in New York about changing them , because I go to upstate New York , where we have a lot of hunters and people who are collectors and people who are sport shooters ; they have every reason to believe that their rights are being respected .
You walk down the street with a police officer in Manhattan ; he wants to be sure that there is some way of protecting him and protecting the people that are in his charge .
MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Senator Obama , last May we talked about affirmative action , ad you said at the time that affluent African Americans like your daughters should probably be treated as pretty advantaged when they apply to college , and that poor white children -- kids -- should get special consideration , affirmative action .
So , as president , how specifically would you recommend changing affirmative action policies so that affluent African Americans are not given advantages , and poor , less affluent whites are ?
SENATOR OBAMA : Well , I think that the basic principle that should guide discussions not just on affirmative action but how we are admitting young people to college generally is , how do we make sure that we 're providing ladders of opportunity for people ?
How do we make sure that every child in America has a decent shot in pursuing their dreams ?
And race is still a factor in our society .
And I think that for universities and other institutions to say , you know , we 're going to take into account the hardships that somebody has experienced because they 're black or Latino or because they 're women --
MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Even if they 're wealthy ?
SENATOR OBAMA : I think that 's something that they can take into account , but it can only be in the context of looking at the whole situation of the young person .
So if they look at my child and they say , you know , Malia and Sasha , they 've had a pretty good deal , then that should n't be factored in .
On the other hand , if there 's a young white person who has been working hard , struggling , and has overcome great odds , that 's something that should be taken into account .
So I still believe in affirmative action as a means of overcoming both historic and potentially current discrimination , but I think that it can't be a quota system and it can't be something that is simply applied without looking at the whole person , whether that person is black or white or Hispanic , male or female .
What we want to do is make sure that people who have been locked out of opportunity are going to be able to walk through those doors of opportunity in the future .
MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Senator Clinton , would you agree to that kind of change ?
SENATOR CLINTON : Well , here 's the way I 'd prefer to think about it .
I think we 've got to have affirmative action generally to try to give more opportunities to young people from disadvantaged backgrounds -- whoever they are .
That 's why I'm a strong supporter of early childhood education and universal pre-kindergarten .
That 's why I 'm against No Child Left Behind as it is currently operating .
And I would end it , because we can do so much better to have an education system that really focuses in on kids who need extra help .
That 's why I 'm in favor of much more college aid , not these outrageous predatory student loan rates that are charging people I 've met , across Pennsylvania , 20 , 25 , 28 percent interest rates .
Let 's make college affordable again .
See , I think we have to look at what we 're trying to achieve here somewhat differently .
We do have a real gap .
We have a gap in achievement .
We have a gap in income .
But we do n't have a potential gap .
I think our job should be to try to create the conditions that enable people to live up to their God - given potential .
And that means health care for everyone -- no exceptions , nobody left out .
And it means taking a hard look at what we need to do to compete and win in the global economy .
So that 's how I prefer to think about it .
You know , let 's affirmatively invest in our young people and make it possible for them to have a good middle - class life in today 's much more competitive economy .
MR. GIBSON : We 're running short on time .
Let me just give some quick questions here , and let me give you a minute each to answer .
What are you going to do about gas prices ?
It 's getting to $ 4 a gallon .
It is killing truckers .
SENATOR CLINTON : That 's right .
MR. GIBSON : People are in trouble .
And yet the whole world pays a whole lot more for gas than we do .
What are you going to do about it ?
SENATOR CLINTON :
Well , I met with a group of truckers in Harrisburg about a week and a half ago , and here 's what I told them .
Number one , we are going to investigate these gas prices .
The federal government has certain tools that this administration will not use , in the Federal Trade Commission and other ways , through the Justice Department , because I believe there is market manipulation going on , particularly among energy traders .
We 've seen this movie before , in Enron , and we 've got to get to the bottom to make sure we 're not being taken advantage of .
Number two , I would quit putting oil into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and I would release some to help drive the price down globally .
And thirdly , if there is any kind of gas tax moratorium , as some people are now proposing --
MR. GIBSON : Like John McCain .
SENATOR CLINTON : -- like John McCain , and some Democrats , frankly -- I think Senator Menendez and others have said that we may have to do something , because when you get to $ 4 - a - gallon gas , people are not going to be able to afford to drive to work .
And what I would like to see us do is to say if we have that , then we should have a windfall profits tax on these outrageous profits of the oil companies , and put that money back into the highway trust fund , so that we do n't lose out on repair and construction and rebuilding .
But ultimately , Charlie , we 've got to have a long - term energy strategy .
We are so much more dependent on foreign oil today than we were on 9/11 , and that is a real indictment of our leadership .
And I 've laid out a comprehensive plan to move us toward energy independence that I hope I will have the opportunity to implement as president .
MR. GIBSON : Very quickly , Senator Obama , I -- the same thing .
But we 've heard from politicians for a long time we 're going to end dependence on foreign oil .
I just have a quote : " The generation - long growth in our dependence on foreign oil will be stopped dead in its tracks right now . "
That was Jimmy Carter in 1979 .
And it 's gotten a whole lot worse since then .
SENATOR OBAMA : Well , you 're right .
And that 's why people are cynical , because decade after decade , we talk about energy policy or we talk about health care policy , and through Democratic and Republican administrations , nothing gets done .
Now , I think many of the steps that Senator Clinton outlined are similar to the plans that we talked about .
It is absolutely true that we 've got to investigate potential price gouging or market manipulation .
I have strongly called for a windfall profits tax that can provide both consumers relief and also invest in renewable energies .
I think that long term , we 're going to have to raise fuel efficiency standards on cars , because the only way that we 're going to be able to reduce gas prices is if we reduce demand .
You 've still got a billion people in China , and maybe 700 million in India , who still want cars .
And so the long - term trajectory is that we 're going to have to get serious about increasing our fuel efficiency standards and investing in new technologies .
That 's something I 'm committed to doing .
I 've talked about spending $ 150 billion over 10 years in an Apollo Project , a Manhattan Project to create the alternative energy strategies that will work not only for this generation but for the next .
MR. STEPHANOPOULOS :
We 're running out of time for this segment .
Very quickly , for each of you , 30 seconds .
Senator Clinton , you 've said that you believe in using former presidents .
How would you use George W. Bush if you were president ?
( Laughter . )
SENATOR CLINTON : I 'm going to have to give some serious thought to that .
( Laughter . )
You know , I do believe that it 's a way to unify our country .
I thought that President Bush was right when he asked his father and Bill to represent us during the aftermath of the tsunami .
I thought it sent a great message here at home and around the world .
And I 'm sure that there will be opportunities to ask all the former presidents to work on behalf of our nation .
You know , we 've got to come together .
And the former presidents really exemplify that , whether one agrees with them politically or not .
When they 're all together , representing our country , that sends a strong message .
And I would look for a way to use all our former presidents , but that 'll take some careful thought on my part .
( Laughter . )
MR. STEPHANOPOULOS : Senator Obama .
SENATOR OBAMA : Well , you know , I think that having the advice and counsel of all former presidents is important .
I 'm probably more likely to ask advice of the current president 's father than president himself because I think that when you look back at George H.W.
Bush 's foreign policy , it was a wise foreign policy .
And how we executed the Gulf War , how we managed the transition out of the Cold War , I think , is an example of how we can get bipartisan agreement .
I do n't think the Democrats have a monopoly on good ideas .
I think that there are a lot of thoughtful Republicans out there .
The problem is , we 've been locked in a divided politics for so long that we 've stopped listening to each other .
And I think that this president in particular has fed those divisions .
That 's something that we 've tried to end in this campaign , and I think we 're being successful .
MR. GIBSON : All right .
We 're going to take one more commercial break , come back with a final question for both of you in just a moment .
( Announcements . )
MR. GIBSON : Final question , now , to finish what I think has been a fascinating debate , and I appreciate both of you being here -- thanking you in advance .
I -- it is hard to see how either one of you win this nomination on the basis of pledged delegates in primaries .
And it could well come down to superdelegates .
And I know you 've been talking to them all along .
But let 's say you 're at the convention in Denver , and you 're talking to a group of 20 undecided superdelegates .
How are you going to make the case to them why you 're the better candidate and more electable in November ?
What do you say to them -- minute - and - a - half each .
And by a flip of the coin , Senator Clinton goes first .
SENATOR CLINTON :
Well , I say to them what I 've said to voters across America -- that we need a fighter back in the White House .
We need someone who 's going to take on the special interests .
And I have a plan to take away $ 55 billion of the giveaways and the subsidies that the president and Congress have lavished on the drug companies and the oil companies and the insurance companies and Wall Street .
And I have a plan to give that money back -- give it back in tax cuts to the middle class -- people who deserve it , who have been struggling under this president , who feel invisible , who feel like , you know , they 're not even seen anymore .
And we 're going to make everybody feel like they 're part of the American family again .
And we 're going to tackle the problems that have been waiting for a champion back in the White House .
Now , obviously , I can't do this alone .
I can only do it if I get people who believe in me and support me and who look at my track record and know that , you know , I 've spent a lifetime trying to empower people , trying to fight for them .
And I think it 's going to be challenging , but it is absolutely what we must do in order to keep faith with our country and to give our children the future that they deserve .
So I will tell everyone who listens that I 'm ready to be the commander in chief .
I 've 35 generals and admirals , including two former chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , General Wesley Clark and others , who believe that I am the person to lead us out of Iraq , to take on al Qaeda , to rebuild our military .
And I will turn this economy around .
We will get back to shared prosperity and we will see once again that we can do this the right way so it 's not just a government of the few , by the few and for the few .
And I need your help .
I need the help of the voters here in Pennsylvania , first and foremost , in order to be able to get to those conversations .
And I hope that I have demonstrated not just over the last weeks or even over the last hour and half but over a lifetime that you can count on me .
You know where I stand .
You know that I will fight for you and that together we 're going to take back our country .
MR. GIBSON : Senator Obama .
SENATOR OBAMA : Well , when we started this campaign 15 months ago , it was based on a couple of simple principles : number one , that we were in a defining moment in our history .
Our nation 's at war .
Our planet 's in peril .
Our economy is in a shambles .
And most importantly , the American people have lost trust in their government , not just Democrats but independents and Republicans who 've been disillusioned about promises that have been made election after election , decade after decade .
And the bet I was making was a bet on the American people ; that they were tired of a politics that was about tearing about each other down , but wanted a politics that was about lifting the country up ; that they did n't want spin and PR out of their elected officials , they wanted an honest conversation .
And most importantly , I believe that change does not happen from the top down , it happens from the bottom up .
And that 's why we decided we were n't going to take PAC money or money from federal registered lobbyists , that we were not going to be subject to special - interest influence , but instead were going to enlist the American people in a project of changing this country .
And during the course of these last 15 months , my bet 's paid off because the American people have responded in record numbers , and not just people who are accustomed to participating , but people who have n't participated in years .
I talked to a woman here in Pennsylvania , 70 years old , she whispered to me , " I 've never voted before , but I 'm going to vote in this election . "
And so my point to the super delegates would be that if we 're going to deliver on health care for every American , improve our schools , deliver on jobs , then it 's going to be absolutely vital we form a new political coalition in this country .
That 's what we 've been doing in this campaign , and that 's what I 'm going to do when I 'm president of the United States of America .
MR. GIBSON : The audience has been very good in restraining themselves .
I think a round of applause for Senators Obama and Clinton .
( Applause . )
And that concludes tonight 's Pennsylvania debate .
We appreciate both of you and wish you both the best .
Thank you very much .

Kieffe and Sons , a Ford dealership in Mojave , California , has a new radio ad in which they try to court Christian car buyers by announcing that they believe that non-Christians in America should " sit down and shut up . "
[ " Did you know that there are people in this country who want prayer out of schools , " Under God " out of the Pledge , and " In God We Trust " to be taken off our money ? " ]
" But did you know that 86 % of Americans say they believe in God ?
Since we all know that 86 out of every 100 of us are Christians , who believe in God , we at Kieffe & Sons Ford wonder why we do n't tell the other 14 % to sit down and shut up .
I guess I just offended 14 % of the people who are listening to this message .
Well , if that is the case then I say that 's tough , this is America folks , it 's called free speech .
None of us at Kieffe & Sons Ford is afraid to speak out .
Kieffe & Sons Ford on Sierra Highway in Mojave and Rosamond , if we do n't see you today , by the grace of God , we 'll be here tomorrow . "
The Guardian
In March this year , a man with a passion for Portuguese football , living in a city in Florida , was drinking heavily because his wife was having an affair .
He typed his troubles into the search window of his computer .
" My wife doesnt love animore , " he told the machine .
He searched for " Stop your divorce " and " I want revenge to my wife " before turning to self - examination with " alchool withdrawl " , " alchool withdrawl sintoms " ( at 10 in the morning ) and " disfunctional erection " .
On April 1 he was looking for a local medium who could " predict my future " .
But what could a psychic guess about him compared with what the world now knows ?
This story is one of hundreds , perhaps tens of thousands , revealed this month when AOL published the details of 23 m searches made by 650,000 of its customers during a three - month period earlier in the year .
The searches were actually carried out by Google - from which AOL buys in its search functions .
The gigantic database detailing these customers ' search inquiries was available on an AOL research site for just a few hours before the company realised that substituting numbers for users ' names did not really protect their identities enough .
The company apologised for its mistake - and removed the database from the internet .
The researcher who published the material has been sacked , as has his manager , and last week AOL 's chief technology officer , Maureen Govern , resigned .
But those few hours online were enough for the raw data files to be copied all over the internet , and there are now four or five sites where anyone can search through them using specialised software .
What was published by AOL represents only a tiny fraction of the accumulated knowledge warehoused within Google 's records - but it has given all of us , as users , a dramatic and unsettling glimpse of how much , and in what intimate detail , the big search engines know about us .
The number of searches Google carries out is a secret , but comScore , an independent firm , reckons that the search engine performed 2.7bn searches by American users alone in July this year .
Yahoo , its main rival , conducted around 1.8bn American searches in the same month ; Microsoft 's MSN around 800 m and AOL 366m .
All of this information is stored .
Google identifies every computer that connects to it with an implant ( known as a cookie ) which will not expire until 2038 .
If you also use Gmail , Google knows your email address - and , of course , keeps all your email searchable .
If you sign up to have Google ads on a website , then the company knows your bank account details and home address , as well as all your searches .
If you have a blog on the free blogger service , Google owns that .
The company also knows , of course , the routes you have looked up on Google maps .
Yahoo operates a similar range of services .
All this knowledge has been handed over quite freely by us as users .
It is the foundation of Google 's fortune because it allows the company to target very precisely the advertising it sends in our direction .
Other companies have equally ambitious plans : an application lodged on August 10 with the US Patent & Trademark Office showed that Amazon is hoping to patent ways of interrogating a database that would record not just what its 59 million customers have bought - which it already knows - or what they would like to buy ( which , with their wish lists , they tell the world ) but their income , sexual orientation , religion and ethnicity .
The company , of course , already knows who we are and where we live .
Even though the search logs that AOL released were made anonymous , by assigning a number to each user , it is not difficult in many cases to discover somebody 's name from their search queries .
And it is easy to follow exactly what users were thinking as they sat at their computers , in the apparent privacy of their own homes , since the time and date of every search is given .
On April 4 , for instance , user 14162375 , the melancholy Portuguese - American in Florida , seems to have passed out on the keyboard at 6.20 pm , when he asked , suddenly , " llllfkkgjnnvjjfokrb " then " vvvvbmkmjk " and " vvglhkitopppfoppr " .
An hour later he had recovered enough to search for variations on his wife 's name - he thought she might have moved to New England .
On the evening of April 16 , matters came to a head .
" My cheating wife , " he typed ; and then , five times , " I want to kill myself , " and then " I want to make my wife suffer , " followed quickly by " Kill my wifes mistress , " " My wifes ass , " " A cheating wife " .
Two days after that he was back looking for audio surveillance and bugging equipment and four weeks later he seemed to have cheered up and was looking for motorcycle insurance .
The story stops abruptly there , at the end of May , because that is when the three months ' worth of released AOL search records came to an end .
One of the first researchers to demonstrate that we will tell anything , however intimate , to a computer , was Joseph Weizenbaum of MIT , who in 1966 wrote a programme called " Eliza " that parodied non-directional psychotherapy .
If the user typed anything in , Eliza would appear to ask a question based on that cue .
In no time at all , unhappy students were telling the computer all their troubles as if there were a real and sympathetic person behind the screen .
Stories and jokes about this circulated for decades , but the men most successful at turning this concept into a fortune were the founders of Google , Larry Page and Sergei Brin .
As users , we think that the Google search engine is a way of supplying us with information about what 's on the web .
But the flow of information is two way .
We ask Google things that we would hesitate to ask anyone living .
The price for the answers is that Google remembers it all .
Take user 11110859 of New York City , who fell in love and then was sorry .
She was up early on March 7 to buy hip - hop clothes from G - Unit ; by March 26 , however , there was more excitement in her life .
Searches on " losing your virginity " were followed by three weeks of frantic worry about whether she was pregnant : stuff she might have hesitated to tell her best friend or her mother is all quite clear from the Google searches .
But by the end of April the pregnancy scare was over and had been replaced by a broken heart .
Even before she had stopped asking " Can you still be pregnant even though your period came ? " she was asking " Why do people hurt others " and this was the theme of almost all her questions throughout May , culminating on the afternoon of the 19th , when she asked " How to love someone who mistreated you ? " ;
" What does Jesus say about loving your enemies ? "
" What does God mean when he says bless those who spitefully use you ? "
Then she spent a couple of days trying to buy Betty Boop postage stamps , and the next thing we know , she was asking first for directions to the New York prison on Rikers Island , then " What items are we allowed to bring at Rikers Island " and finally for " uncoated playing cards " .
User 11110859 was not the only person interested in the prison but she seems to have been the youngest and , in some senses , the most innocent .
User 3745417 laid out her thoughts in detail just as graphic : on March 6 she made eight searches on child molestation and similar phrases .
A week later she was trying to find a prisoner in Rikers Island - nine searches in one evening - a subject she returned to at 9.30 am on March 25 , when she made another eight searches .
Between March 27 and March 29 she made 34 successive searches for M&M chocolates in the early evening , followed on the 30th , at 10 pm , by four searches for " Kid Party Games " .
By 10.15 pm she was searching for " Whitney Houston " ; then , in the course of the next hour , 29 searches on " black porn for women " and similar subjects .
By the end of April , she was looking for a legal aid lawyer in New York City , a swimsuit , a credit card and a holiday in the Bahamas .
These stories , with all the revealing information they contain , cannot always easily be tied to a specific individual , but sometimes they can .
The social security number , with which all Americans are issued , conforms to a recognisable pattern which is easy to search for in the data that AOL released .
So , too , are telephone numbers .
On the internet , you can buy anything from anywhere , but there are some things , such as pet care , which people mainly buy locally , so it is easy to spot where they live .
People often search for their own names , which can then be cross- referenced with the telephone book .
At least one person in the AOL group , a blameless grandmother in Alabama , was identified by the New York Times within days of the AOL data release .
And though it may be hard to identify complete strangers , it is very much easier to recognise in the AOL data details of someone you may already know .
A church lady in the midwest , whose quest for Christian quilted wall hangings was interspersed with inquiries about vibrators and arousing frigid wives , is probably easy for anyone in her congregation to identify .
This is knowledge beyond the dreams of any secret police in history .
Earlier this year Google fought a lawsuit to keep a week 's worth of random search data out of the hands of the US government , but other search companies have handed over their data without complaint and nobody has yet discovered what deals have been struck between search engines and the Chinese government .
China is generally thought of as attempting to censor the internet , which it does ; search engines that do business in China must censor their own results if they are to succeed .
But the real power for a totalitarian government is no longer just censorship .
It is to allow its citizens to search for anything they want - and then remember it .
No western government , so far as we know , has gone that far .
But if one ever does , it will know where the information is kept that will tell it almost everything about almost everyone .
This morning , as I logged in to Googletalk , to chat with my sister , the programme silently upgraded itself .
" Would you like to show friends what music you 're playing now ? " it asked .

âˆ ‘ AOL user search history data , released by AOL , August 2006 .
DALLAS ( Reuters ) -
The mainstream Mormon church renounced polygamy over a century ago , but it says the breakaway sects that practice plural marriage are giving it a public relations head ache .
A reflection of the Salt Lake Mormon Temple is seen in Salt Lake City , Utah May 27 , 2007 .
This picture has been rotated 180 degrees .

Attention has once again been drawn to the issue by the raids this month on a Texas compound run by followers of jailed polygamist leader Warren Jeffs .
More than 400 children were removed in the raids sparked by an abuse complaint and their fate remains in legal limbo .
Quentin Cook , a spiritual elder with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints , told Reuters in a telephone interview that his church of 13 million had to constantly contend with public misconceptions stirred by the actions of a few thousand polygamists who were not attached to it .
Members of the polygamist Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - Day Saints keep to themselves on compounds in remote parts of Arizona , Utah , Texas and elsewhere .
“ The confusion is of concern very much for the Church ... we have got over 13 million members and if you look at that membership the Church has doubled since 1987 , ” Cook said on Tuesday .
He said many of the faith ’s members did not have an ancestral link to polygamy , which the Church condoned until 1890 , and resented being lumped with those who practiced it .
“ The vast majority of those would be converts to the Church ; they would not be people who have any ancestors who would have been involved any way in polygamy ...
They work in normal occupations ; they are not living in compounds , ” he told Reuters from Salt Lake City , where the Church is based .
“ So for them it is a concern and they are always disappointed when people seem to think that somehow there is a connection , ” he said .
SUSPICIONS
Mormonism was founded in 1830 in New York state by Joseph Smith whom followers revere as a prophet who was instructed by God to set Christianity back on the right path .
Cook is an apostle or elder of the faith ’s second - highest governing body , the Quorum of the Twelve .
One of the world ’s fastest growing and most affluent religions , it also has to deal with suspicion in U.S. evangelical circles , where it is widely regarded as a cult .
Cook said the polygamist activities of its breakaway kin complicated matters further .
“ We have 53,000 missionaries out in the world ( and they do ) not even get a chance to talk because somebody is confusing us with a group that is not even attached to us , ” he said .
“ Our average age of marrying is 24.5 years for men and 22.5 for women .
We do n’t have these young marriages you see portrayed in this ( polygamist ) group . ”
Polygamy is outlawed everywhere in the United States but the male followers of such sects typically marry one woman officially and take the others as “ spiritual wives . ”
This makes the women single in the eyes of the state , which can entitle them and their children to welfare benefits .
Capturing images of fleeting events — a horse 's gallop , a bullet 's impact , an electron 's escape — is easy if you have the right equipment .
Faster camera shutters used to be enough , but recently lasers have let physicists break the femto- and attosecond barriers , compressing the temporal resolution of images down to the time it takes light to cross a hydrogen atom .

Shooter Eadweard Muybridge , 1887
Shutter speed 6 milliseconds ( 6 x 10 -3 )
The English inventor 's early high - speed shutters , powered by rubber bands , were tripped when a cart rolled over wires laid in its path .
As two plates slid past each other , holes drilled in their centers briefly aligned , letting light into the camera .
By the 1880s , electromagnets and dry chemical plates allowed exposures of just thousandths of a second .

Bullet impact
Shooter Harold " Doc " Edgerton , 1964
Shutter speed 1 microsecond ( 1 x 10 - 6 )
To capture a bullet erupting from its target , Edgerton developed a technique in the 1930s that dispensed with mechanical shutters entirely .
He kept the target in the dark until the firing of a rifle activated an extremely brief strobe .
His images , like the ubiquitous crown - shaped splash of a milk droplet , are now sold as poster art , and his method is still used .
3 ) Nuclear blast
Shooter Edgerton , 1952
Shutter speed 10 nanoseconds ( 10 x 10 - 9 )
To give the Atomic Energy Commission a peek at a nuke blast 's early stages ( in this case a 200 - foot fireball ) , Edgerton invented the rapatronic camera .
Polarizing filters on either side of a Kerr cell block all light until an electrical pulse passes through its liquid center , changing the polarity of the incoming light and exposing the film .

Shooter R. J. Dwayne Miller , 2007
Shutter speed 300 femtoseconds ( 300 x 10 - 15 )
By the 1980s , lasers could deliver bursts of light faster than a single molecular vibration .
A " pump " pulse triggers a reaction , and a " probe " pulse follows , acting like a strobe .
Miller , a University of Toronto chemist , melted aluminum with a laser and used an electron pulse to catch the action at a molecular level .
Now he 's working on silicon .
5 ) Electron drift
Shooter Ferenc Krausz , 2007
Shutter speed 110 attoseconds ( 110 x 10 - 18 )
The pump - probe technique has been modified to pare pulse times to attoseconds by using photons emitted when electrons get excited out of their orbit and crash back in .
That 's short enough to measure the movement of other electrons as they enter an extreme UV wave .
The pairs of dotted lines span the time between two electron crossings .

It 's been called the worst housing slump since the Great Depression .
But is the current downturn really anywhere near as bad ?
As old photos of bread lines and Dust Bowl migrants clearly attest , the economic downturn of the 1930s was — and still is — unprecedented .
While a far smaller percentage of Americans actually owned their homes back then , millions nonetheless lost both their jobs and the roofs over their heads .
Not so wonderful .
Hard numbers on exactly how far home prices fell nationwide are n't known .
( Government records go back only to the 1950s , and even then they 're a bit sketchy . )
Yet the government has kept statistics on the number of new homes built since the 1920s .
At its peak in 1925 , the roaring economy — the same one that helped George Bailey put scores of poor families into new subdivisions in the movie
It 's a Wonderful Life — produced about 900,000 new homes a year .
By 1933 , around the time Old Man Potter tried to get his hands on Bailey 's cash - strapped Building & Loan in Bedford Falls , that number had fallen to about 100,000 new homes , a 90 percent drop .
That 's about twice the size of the percentage decline in home building seen so far in the current downturn .
And although some economists still expect things to get worse , " I certainly do n't think we 're in for another Great Depression , " says economist Edward Leamer , whose UCLA Anderson Forecast has been predicting a real - estate swoon for the past two years .
That , of course , does n't mean he thinks things wo n't get as ugly as they did , say , in Los Angeles during the early 1990s .
After a real - estate boom that nearly doubled home prices between 1985 and 1989 , sales volume began to slump as big layoffs in the aircraft and defense industries crippled the local economy .
The decline — about equal to the sales falloff in the current downturn — took about three years to hit bottom in 1991 .
Only then did prices , too , begin to fall .
By the time the housing market stabilized five years later , home prices had fallen by about 27 percent in nominal terms and by 45 percent after accounting for inflation .
Tis the season for jewelers to tug at men's wallet strings .
Every man needs to show his woman he still loves her by buying diamonds this Valentine 's Day .
It 's a brilliant campaign , really , since they 're selling Love , and who can put a price tag on that ?
This is one I 've been seeing the most :
( link )
Pretty effective .
Who would n't want to be driving in a slightly snowy evening listening to Landon Pigg with a handsome man who can't keep his eyes off of you .
The diamond pendant is just the clincher , the finale , the proof that these people are in love , for reals .
De Beers really did a number on us , because we do n't question this idea that a diamond is a symbol of love .
We do n't question that an engagement ring has to be a diamond , and needs to be as big as the guy can possibly afford .
And we do n't question that the best stone to buy is a diamond because after all , they 're a girl 's best friend .
In reality , the fantasy that revolves around the diamond is a scam , an idea concocted by an advertising agency .
And that in itself is n't so bad .
Many companies brand themselves as fantasy ( buy Nike shoes because they will make you a sports superstar ) .
Many companies have also successfully sold very worthless items ( pet rock ) .
But what makes the diamond campaign the worse of the bunch is the harm they 've done , and continue to do , to make a ton of money in the name of love .
The true value of a diamond .
The reason diamonds cost so much ( in terms of dollars to the consumer ) , when they are n't really rare ( the value of a gem is supposed to be based on its rarity ) , is because De Beers is a monopoly .
They buy up and close down any diamond mines discovered by competitors .
The laws of supply and demand determine the price of any item .
De Beers controls the supply ( by limiting the amount of diamonds in the marketplace ) and demand ( by selling diamonds as a symbol of love ) .
Hard to believe that less than 70 years ago , people rarely gave diamond engagement rings .
Now it is the gold standard by which a man 's love and the stability of the relationship is based on .
Fine , who cares if people want to throw away thousands , or tens of thousands of dollars , on a diamond engagement ring , or a special gift , even if the diamond is n't " valuable " in the true sense of the word .
There are a lot of things people overpay for that 's not really worth anything .
There is such a thing as perceived value .
It makes people happy .
It makes the event special and memorable .
It conforms to the social normal , and what 's really wrong with that ?
The true cost of mining diamonds .
Blood Diamond is a movie that came out about a year ago dipicting the blood and war that has spanned the entire history of the De Beers ' diamond cartel .
The story of Sierra Leone is n't an isolated event , and the conflict is far from over .
Unrest and civil war in Angola , DRC , Sierra Leone , Liberia and the Ivory Coast funded by diamonds ( paid to terrorists ) have resulted in over 4 million deaths and millions more displaced .
There is blood from lost limbs and lives splashed across every diamond , and we are purchasing them so we can have something shiny to show our friends .
Why buying conflict - free diamonds does n't help .
You may have heard that you can ask for some certificate verifying a diamond as conflict - free .
The Kimberley Process is an agreement that is supposed to prevent blood diamonds from getting into the market but is pretty useless since it ’s based on a system of self - policing .
The UN reported in October 2006 that due to poor enforcement of the Kimberley Process , $ 23 million of conflict diamonds from Cote d’lvoire alone entered the legitimate market .
In April 2006 an internal review showed that 49 of 147 Kimberley Process certificates were fraudulent .
Besides these fraudulent certificates , real certificates could still be issued if conflict diamonds were smuggled and mixed with legally traded ones before being certified .
Doing the best we can .
We are consumers .
Our economy works and is maintained only by our power to purchase .
But many times we are bombarded with messages that tell us everything we buy have some terrible social impact across the world .
Driving SUVs mean we do n't support the troops in Iraq .
Buying clothes mean we are supporting child labor in Asia .
Buying meat contributes to the destruction of rain forests and pulic health dangers .
Is there anything at all we can buy that is really , truly conflict - free ?
So what most people do is they feel terrible upon hearing the argument , and then promptly forget about it .
There 's too much guilt to be carried .
And it 's happening far away .
The pressures closer to home take precedence .
I think Peter Birkenhead , in his Salon article , A hard rock says it best :
I realized that having a clue has n't ever motivated me to make significant sacrifices ... I thought , Would n't the easiest way to give a gift that was conflict - free be to not give a diamond at all ?
But the truth is I barely considered that choice , probably because nobody else I know has made it .
Giving diamonds as tokens of love is something people do these days .
Some people .
Insanely lucky , gravity - defying middle - class Westerners like me , and the people I know .
I did a quick mental survey of my married women friends and realized that all of them wore diamond engagement rings .
Yes , it 's all overwhelming .
We are attached to our spending power .
We are attached to our things and what they say about us .
Peter Walsh of TLC's Clean Sweep and author of It 's All Too Much often tells his clients to let go of the power that they 've given to their things .
If your only excuse of wanting a diamond is to show your girlfriends , feel special , and have what everyone else has , then you 're giving power to some thing .
The things you own , end up owning you .
- Tyler Durden , Fight Club
We can only do what we can , and it turns out , we can do a lot .
Do n't buy a diamond .

Not only does the Dogone Doggy Thong accentuate your canine 's ample buttockal curvatures , but it actually has a practical usage ( not that the first one is n't practical , dogs like to get attention at the beach , too ) .
The thong is made of a charcoal cloth that is designed to neutralize any of your dog 's anally - emitted odors .
In other words , it 's a magical diaper that captures dog farts and transforms them into non-hazardous air again .
One thing that is not for certain is whether or not it comes packaged with a doggy tramp - stamp butterfly tattoo and a propensity for making out with drunken frat boys .

We are n't completely sure who invented this device , but we 're pretty sure that somewhere in the world -- probably Canada -- there resides a former pee- wee hockey player who was forced to quit the game due to what can only be described as earth - shattering retardation .
He is now an inventor .
Either that , or this is somehow only the first in a long line of primate - engineered tactical assault weapons to be used in the great ape uprising of 2029 .
Our island is built on wheat and barley , in the form of bread and beer .
And although we think of bread as the staff of life , for centuries beer was no less important .
When a glass of water could mean a dose of typhoid , farm labourers and urban workers alike slaked their thirst with ale .
For them , beer was n't just a drink .
At the end of a long shift or a back - breaking day in the fields , they saw it as nutritious and vital , as well as thirst - quenching .
Beer was the smoothie of the pre-industrial age .
Given its place in our history , and in our hearts , it 's strange that in the kitchen we usually pass over our native drink in favour of wine .
We 've gone a long way towards shaking off our national culinary inferiority complex , and it 's time we took beer with us on our onward mission .
We make some of the finest beers in the world - OK , the finest - and as a cooking medium it is less acidic but more distinctly flavoured than wine .
Next time you steam some mussels , forget white wine and add a light beer along with the garlic and herbs .
In truth , beer can do pretty much all the things in the kitchen that we usually ask of wine : deglaze a pan , marinade a piece of meat , add body and flavour to everything from casseroles to cakes .
Darker beers and stouts are natural companions to meat , particularly beef .
Try this week 's stew , or any one of the many recipes for beef carbonnade , the classic beef and onion stew from that corner of Belgium where , in fairness , they also know a thing or two about beer .
A ham can be cured in beer , cooked in beer and even glazed in beer .
For the latter , stir light brown sugar , a pinch or two of mace and a tablespoon of mustard powder into a thick paste with a dark , malty beer and smother the criss - crossed fat with it before baking .
Then there is cheese .
I hardly need to tell you that beer is great to quaff with cheese , but it 's also great when you 're cooking with cheese .
I hope last week 's
Welsh rarebit recipe proved that point , but you can also add a good dash of ale to the sauce for macaroni cheese or even to a cheese soufflé .
It 's not so surprising that the savoury , bitter edge of many beers adds something to gutsy savoury dishes .
But you can exploit its malty elements in sweety , treaty baking , too .
A stout fruit cake is classic , and some of the best Christmas pudding recipes use stout .
I even add a good slug of Guinness to chocolate brownies ( see recipe overleaf ) .
Beer is brilliant in batters .
It not only adds a good , toasty flavour , but also acts as a raising agent , helping the batter to puff up pleasingly for outstanding crispness .
It 's perfect for chip shop - style fish , of course , and also works beautifully for apple fritters - use the same recipe as for our fish below , but instead of seasoning with salt and pepper , sweeten with a teaspoon of sugar .
Pollack in beer batter
The beer adds lightness and flavour to the batter .
Many recipes say to rest batter before using , but we had better , lighter , crispier results using it straight away , before the beer lost its bubbles .
This is also a great way to prepare squid rings .
Serves four .
200g plain flour , plus a little extra for dusting the fish
Groundnut oil , including plenty for deep frying ( about 2 litres )
About 290 ml good beer ( anything but cheap lager ) , very cold
Salt and ground black pepper
About 700g pollack fillets ( or mixed white fish of your choice )
Sift the flour into a bowl , add two tablespoons of groundnut oil , then gradually whisk in the beer , stopping when you have the consistency of thick emulsion paint .
Beat to get rid of any lumps , then season generously .
In a large , deep , heavy - based pan , heat the oil to 190C , or until a cube of bread dropped in turns golden brown in one and a half to two minutes .
Season the fish , then dust lightly with flour , shaking to remove any excess .
Immerse a piece of fish in the batter , then lift it out and hold over the bowl for a few seconds to let excess batter drop back in .
Lower the fish into the hot oil a piece at a time if using large portions , or in small batches for smaller pieces .
Fry large pieces of fish for four to five minutes , smaller ones such as squid rings for two minutes or so , until golden brown and crisp .
Scoop out with a wire basket or tongs , and transfer to a warmed dish lined with kitchen paper .
Keep warm while you fry the remaining fish , then serve .
Beef in ale stew
This simple dish shows that you do n't need a vast list of ingredients to create rich , rounded depth of flavour .
Serve with dumplings ( recipe follows ) , mash - or both .
Serves six .
50g butter ( or dripping )
250g salt pork , pancetta or slab bacon , cut into 2.5 cm cubes
500g white onions , peeled , halved and sliced
1.5 kg chuck or stewing beef , or shin ( boneless weight ) , cut into large chunks of about 4cm
Up to 50g plain flour
Salt and ground black pepper
500 ml good ale
500 ml good beef stock
2 bay leaves
A few parsley stalks
Heat the butter in a large frying pan over medium - high heat and brown the pancetta until the fat runs .
Transfer to a casserole .
Reduce the heat to low and in the same pan gently fry the onions , stirring occasionally , until soft and starting to turn golden - about 15 minutes .
Transfer to the casserole .
Toss the beef in seasoned flour , shaking off any excess , and in the same pan brown the meat in batches .
Transfer it to the casserole when nicely coloured on all sides .
Pour some ale into the pan to deglaze , making sure you scrape up the tasty bits stuck to the bottom , then tip into the casserole .
Pour the rest of the ale and stock over the meat , adding a little water if needed to cover the meat .
Add the herbs , tied into a bouquet garni , and season .
Bring to a boil , then simmer very gently , partially covered , for two and a half hours for chuck / stewing steak , three for shin , until the meat is really tender - do this on a hob or in a very low oven ( 120C / 235 F / gas mark ½ ) .
Add hot water if the meat gets exposed and starts to dry out .
If you 're making the dumplings , add to the stew for the last 45 minutes .
Herb dumplings
When we made these , we forgot to add the breadcrumbs and ended up with a really light and delicious dumpling .
So it 's up to you - for an airy dumpling , omit the breadcrumbs ; for a rib - sticking affair , keep them in .
Makes 12 .
115g self - raising flour
115g fresh white breadcrumbs
115g suet
1 small bunch chives , finely chopped
1 small bunch parsley , finely chopped
A few thyme sprigs , leaves picked and finely chopped
Salt and ground black pepper
2 eggs , lightly beaten
Mix the flour , breadcrumbs , suet , herbs and some seasoning in a large bowl .
Pour three - quarters of the egg into the bowl and stir to form a soft dough .
Use your hands to work it until smooth - add the rest of the egg if it seems too dry .
Divide the dough into 12 dumplings , drop into the stew and cook , covered , for 45 minutes .
Guinness and walnut chocolate brownies
A dark , intense and very grown - up treat - if you normally find brownies cloyingly sweet , these are the ones to convert you .
Makes 16 .
145g plain flour
80g unsweetened cocoa , plus a little extra for dusting
½ tsp salt
220g dark chocolate , around 70 % , broken into small pieces
90g unsalted butter , cubed , plus a little extra for greasing
80g light Muscovado sugar
80g dark Muscovado sugar
4 eggs ( at room temperature )
225 ml bottled stout ( ie , Guinness )
165g walnuts , in large pieces
Preheat the oven to 170C / 325 F / gas mark 3 .
Grease a 23 cm x 30 cm x 5 cm baking tin with a little butter , then dust with a little cocoa .
Sift the flour , cocoa and salt into a bowl .
Melt the butter and chocolate in a bowl over a pan of barely simmering water .
Remove from the heat and tip the sugars over the top .
Leave for two minutes , then stir .
Beat in the eggs one at a time until you have a gorgeously glossy mixture .
Stir in the stout , then fold in the flour , cocoa and two - thirds of the walnuts until just combined - do n't overmix .
Pour into the tin and sprinkle over the remaining walnuts .
Bake for 25 minutes until just set in the middle - a skewer should come out with a few moist crumbs clinging to it .
Leave to cool in the tin for 30 minutes before cutting into squares .

This past Tuesday , a DC - 9 jetliner crashed on takeoff in Goma , in the Democratic Republic of the Congo .
After failing to lift off , the plane crashed and burst into flame on the ground .
Among the passengers were the Mosiers , a family of Seventh - Day Adventist missionaries .
With the help of other passengers , they forced open a door and escaped as smoke filled the stricken plane ’s cabin .
The Mosiers ’ 3 - year - old son Andrew suffered a broken leg , but other than that , they got out with only bruises .
Surely , this was a miraculous escape – a tangible sign of God ’s supernatural protection – and the Mosiers did n’t hesitate to affirm that belief :
“ We could n’t believe that our family of four could all escape a plane that was crashed and on fire , but by God ’s mercy , we did , ” he said .
Mosier said he believes the family made it for a reason .
“ I think the Lord has a plan for us , otherwise we would n’t have survived , ” he said .
“ He still has work for us to do . ”
There ’s just one tiny little problem with this interpretation .
After failing to lift off , the plane overshot the end of the runway and crashed through a fence , into a crowded marketplace .
Most of those on board the plane got out , but the people on the ground had not been expecting a huge mass of tangled , flaming metal to suddenly come hurtling towards them .
The market was decimated , and at least 40 people died .
Read those sappy , self - congratulatory quotes again .
The missionaries made it out by God ’s mercy .
God has a plan for them .
He miraculously saved them from this catastrophe .
Now read the accounts of people on the ground :
Hundreds of people gathered at the morgue in Goma .
Annemarie Mulotwa , 19 , leaned against a wall and wept for her young nephew , Kikuni .
“ I saw his body inside , he is dead , he was burned , ” Mulotwa said , covering her face with her hands .
“ He was 12 years old , he was only in primary school .
He was n’t even on the plane . ”
Mary Rose Kiza , 33 , said she watched as her 15 - year - old son ran out of a shop , his clothes and body on fire .
She does not know if her three other sons were alive .
“ What have I done to God to deserve this ? ” she wailed outside the morgue , after leaving a hospital bed where she was treated for back injuries .
Apparently , God ’s mercy protected the family of white American missionaries on board the plane , but God did not have mercy on the 12 - year - old boy who was burned to death .
Evidently , God had no particular plan for the lives of the dozens of people in the marketplace , nor did he have any reason for them to continue living , so there was no reason for him not to violently kill them in a sudden , unexpected disaster .
This view makes us all out to be God ’s toys , to be used as he sees fit while we ’re useful and then thrown away without a second thought when we ’re no longer useful .
Do n’t these missionaries see the grotesque arrogance and ugly narcissism of believing that they rated God ’s special protection , while the people burning and dying all around them did not ?
In the real world , there are no demonstrable miracles , and in catastrophes like this one , blind chance rules the day .
The lack of any tangible evidence that a deity is protecting his followers makes it even more offensive for people to claim that their survival was due to some special worthiness or virtue .
A humbler , more ethical philosophy would refrain from drawing any conclusions about the relative moral worth of those who survived versus those who did n’t , and simply express happiness to be alive without demeaning those who were not so fortunate .
A New Zealand man has been sentenced to community service after telling police he had been raped by a wombat and the experience had caused him to start speaking " Australian " .
Arthur Cradock , a 48 - year - old orchard worker from Motueka on South Island , rang police on February 11 to say he was being raped by the slow - moving Australian marsupial at his home , The Nelson Mail reported .
He rang back soon afterwards to say he was withdrawing his complaint against the wombat , a court was told .
" Apart from speaking Australian now , I 'm pretty all right you know , " he told police in the second call .
Cradock pleaded guilty to using a phone for a fictitious purpose and was sentenced to 75 hours community work .
Prosecutors said alcohol played a large part in Cradock 's life , although his defence lawyer said he was not drunk on the afternoon of the phone calls .

New Bond novel launched in style

Entertainment reporter , BBC News
A new James Bond novel , published to mark the centenary of 007 creator Ian Fleming 's birth , has been launched onboard HMS Exeter in central London .
Seven copies of Devil May Care , written by Sebastian Faulks , were brought along the River Thames on a Royal Navy sea boat escorted by two Lynx helicopters .
They were then signed by the author in the presence of Fleming 's nieces , Lucy Fleming and Kate Grimond .
Out on Wednesday , the book takes 007 to London , Paris and the Middle East .
Plot details have been kept a closely - guarded secret , though it is known the story is set in 1967 during the Cold War .
Speaking to the BBC News website , Lucy Fleming revealed Bond 's love interest was named Poppy .
' Pleasure '
She also said the villain , named Gormah , was " a bit like Blofeld or Dr No - really sinister " .
Faulks , who was chosen to write the novel at the request of Fleming 's family , added it was a " pleasure to be aboard the ship Bond himself sailed on " .
Bond served as an intelligence officer on the HMS Exeter , finally holding the rank of commander .
Faulks , best known for his war novels Birdsong , The Girl at the Lion D'Or and Charlotte Gray , took six weeks to write the book , delivering it to publisher Penguin over a year ago .
Faulks ( r ) thanked the Flemings for their " tremendous enthusiasm " Alex Clarke , Penguin 's editorial director joked he had been plying the author with Vodka Martinis - 007's signature drink - in the hope he would write a follow - up .
But Faulks , one of several authors to write Bond novels since Fleming 's death in 1964 , told reporters he had no plans to pen another .
" One tribute , one centenary , one book , " he laughed as he sipped champagne with Tuuli Shipster , the model featured on his novel 's book jacket .
' Celebration ' Lucy Fleming - heard on Saturday in a BBC Radio 4 adaptation of Dr No - said her uncle would be " terribly amused that somebody like Sebastian is keeping his legacy going " .
" We wanted it to be a celebration of Ian 's writing , so to get somebody of his calibre says a lot about Ian and James Bond . "
Her husband , actor Simon Williams , agreed it was " a wonderful birthday present " for Fleming on what would have been his 100th birthday .
Shipster ( r ) is pictured on the Devil May Care book jacket The Bond books and the long - running movie franchise they spawned have often been attacked for their misogyny , violence and perceived cultural snobbery .
But Kate Grimond - the daughter of actress Celia Johnson - said any criticism was outweighed by the enjoyment readers have derived from her uncle 's fiction .
" You can criticise Bond in all manner of ways , " she told the BBC News website aboard HMS Exeter .
" But what you can't take away from him is he 's given people an enormous amount of pleasure through the books and the films . "
Fleming wrote 14 James Bond books in all , beginning with Casino Royale in 1953 .
The last , Octopussy and The Living Daylights , was published posthumously in 1966 .

What are these ?
By Chris Hogg
BBC News , Tokyo
Criticism of the documentary has disappointed Li Ying
An old man wearing a white tunic and a dark apron , steps into the frame from the right of the cinema screen .
From a scabbard he pulls a long ceremonial sword .
Calmly and with precision , he carves an arc in the air above his head with the blade , before bringing it down firmly , deliberately in the space in front of him .
Naoji Kariya , who is 90 , is the last living swordsmith at the Yasukuni shrine in Tokyo , the place where Japan remembers its war dead .
He is one of the characters interviewed at length for a new documentary , simply entitled Yasukuni , made by Chinese film - maker Li Ying .
The film has attracted criticism from some lawmakers in Japan , who have described it as " anti-Japanese . "
Those comments have been blamed for inciting right - wing activists to make threats of violence and stage protests against cinemas that planned to show the movie this weekend .
Five have cancelled screenings .
Publicly funded
For the moment , the film - which has won awards at festivals elsewhere in the world - will not be released in Japan .
But the criticism of his documentary has disappointed Li Ying - particularly the comments from some lawmakers , who demanded a special screening before it went to the cinemas .
Lots of cinemas decided themselves to cancel the film to avoid trouble .
Those who say politicians added to the pressure on them are wrong
Masahisa Sato , MP " ' Anti - Japanese ' was a phrase that was used here often before the Sino - Japanese War , " the director says .
" It was used to encourage nationalism .
It 's a very dangerous phrase .
Those who use it are irresponsible . "
The joint Sino - Japanese production was partly financed by the Japanese taxpayer .
The film - makers were given a grant of 7.5 million yen .
Some politicians have questioned whether this was an appropriate use of public funds , claiming that the film should have been more balanced .
In all , Li Ying has spent 10 years , on and off , making the film .
During visits to Yasukuni he says he was at times threatened , abused , and on occasion had his equipment confiscated .
Newspapers here have reported that he has received death threats .
He says he set out to try to understand better what the shrine means to Japanese people .
Those who gave their lives in the service of the Japanese emperor are honoured at the shrine .
Among them are 14 class A war criminals , convicted after the end of World War II .
It was the place where the kamikaze pilots promised each other they would meet again once their deadly missions were complete .
To many it is one of the most sacred places in Japan .
To others it is a place they feel glorifies war .
Legacy of war Li Ying includes both supporters and opponents of Yasukuni in his film .
YASUKUNI SHRINE Built in 1869 to honour victims of the Boshin Civil War Now venerates the souls of 2.5 m of Japan 's war dead
Those enshrined include 14 Class A war criminals
Controversial shrine Some incidents are hard to watch .
In one scene , left - wing activists trying to disrupt the singing of the national anthem during a public meeting at the shrine are pulled away and beaten up by right - wingers .
Others incidents are compelling .
The camera lingers as it watches the swordsmith carefully sharpening the blade of a ceremonial sword he has fired in a brazier .
Shinto priests stride through the darkness towards the innermost sanctum of the shrine to carry out their devotions .
A lone soldier , dressed in the uniform of the Imperial Army marches through the rain to salute his fallen comrades .
" The subject of the film is the aftermath - the legacy of the war , as defined in the space of Yasukuni , " Li Ying says .
" The debate over Yasukuni is a debate over symbols .
That 's why I focused on the swordsmith .
The sword is the symbol of Yasukuni . "
Some cinemas have been reluctant to show the film due to the public debate surrounding its content .
One is the Humax Cinema in Tokyo , where Akio Nakamura works .
" We had right - wingers with a loudspeaker van outside the cinema for three days , " he says .
" Since we can't stop them and it annoys our customers , we have had to give in . "
Right - wing objections Japan 's right - wing activists are noisy - and sometimes violent .
Although they are a tiny minority here , they know how to intimidate .
The film aims to explain what the shrine means to the Japanese " Yasukuni has become the touchstone of the Japanese right wing , " explains Professor Phil Deans , from Temple University in Tokyo .
" They are very concerned that a documentary made by a Chinese film - maker , a foreigner , will be critical , and that 's why it is such an important issue for them . "
But Masahisa Sato , a law - maker from the governing Liberal Democratic Party who is a defender of the shrine , believes the fault lies with the cinemas , not with the politicians who criticised the film .
" I do n't think the pressure of the protesters was that great , " he argues .
" Lots of cinemas decided themselves to cancel the film to avoid trouble .
Those who say politicians added to the pressure on them are wrong . "
However , the row may yet backfire on the film 's detractors .
Plans to show the film this weekend might have been dropped , but the distributors are confident that once the dust has settled , the film 's new - found notoriety will mean it gets shown in more than 20 cinemas nationwide .

Constitutional lawyer : Bush ' ordered war crimes '
Nick Juliano
Published : Friday April 4 , 2008

Print This Email This
This week 's revelation of another secret Bush administration memo that seemed to eliminate any boundaries on the treatment of detainees added to the already substantial evidence that US military and intelligence interrogators have abused and perhaps even tortured prisoners rounded up during the " war on terror . "
Former Justice Department lawyer John
Yoo wrote in 2003 that Bush 's seemingly supreme authority in wartime trumped federal laws " prohibiting assault , maiming and other crimes , " as the Washington Post reported .
For constitutional lawyer Jonathan Turley , the latest memo should be more than enough reason for Congress to begin some serious investigations , but hesitance to really dig into Bush - authorized " war crimes " have precluded them from doing so , he says .
" It is really amazing because Congress -- including the Democrats -- have avoided any type of investigation into torture because they do not want to deal with the fact that the president ordered war crimes , " Turley told MSNBC 's Keith Olbermann Thursday night .
" But evidence keeps on coming out ....
What you get from this is this was a premeditated and carefully orchestrated torture program .
Not torture , but a torture program . "
Gitmo commander ' sick of ' torture talk
All this talk about detainee mistreatment and torture has the current commander of US forces at the military prison at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , fed up .
Brig .
Gen. Gregory J. Zanetti told American Legion members this week that the mission of Gitmo guards is " misunderstood " and called the secluded prison , purposefully established off of US soil , " the most transparent detention facility in the world . "
" Quit talking to me about abuse and torture , " he said .
" Frankly , I 'm sick of it . "
Zanetti must be hearing quite a lot of complaints , or have a rather short fuse , to grow sick of torture lamentations so quickly .
He 's been commanding forces at Guantanamo for just two months ( since Feb . 4 ) .
Detainees rounded up as part of the War on Terror , launched just after 9/11 , began arriving in Guantanamo Bay in January of 2002 .
Documents obtained last year by the American Civil Liberties Union " describe prisoners shackled in excruciating ' stress positions , ' held in freezing - cold cells , forcibly stripped , hooded , terrorized with military dogs , and deprived of human contact for months . "
Zanetti told BlogTalkRadio that the only abuse he witnessed is " detainee on the guards . "
Regarding " the charges of mistreatment , abuse , torture , " he said , " I 'll just say this .
On my watch , I have n't seen anything like that , nor would I stand for it .
And we 're not going to allow that . "
Gitmo tactics partly inspired
Yoo memo
So while two of the last 64 months Guantanamo has been operating may have been torture - free , the Post notes that Yoo 's recently disclosed memo was drafted at least in partly in response to techniques that had been used at the notorious prison camp .
Yoo 's 2003 memo arrived amid strong Pentagon debate about which interrogation techniques should be allowed and which might lead to legal action in domestic and international courts .
After a rebellion by military lawyers , then - Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld in December 2002 suspended a list of aggressive techniques he had approved , the most extreme of which were used on a single detainee at the military prison at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
The prisoner , military investigators later would determine , was subjected to stress positions , nudity , hooding , exposure to dogs and other aggressive techniques .
Largely because of Yoo 's memo , however , a Pentagon working group in April 2003 endorsed the continued use of extremely aggressive tactics .
The top lawyers for each military service , who were largely excluded from the group , did not receive a final copy of Yoo 's March memo and did not know about the group 's final report for more than a year , officials said .
Turley said the memo had little basis in accepted legal theory and was little more than thinly veiled " spin " to cover for the president to do whatever he wants .
" The president and his aides were very , very careful to go to the lawyers first so they could make a claim they were acting under some assumption of actual authority , " he said .
" There really is none . "

[ Sex ] Retired Canadian pastor , Kenneth R. Cooke from Christian Missionary Alliance church , was sentenced to 3 years in prison for sexually abusing a 4 - year - old girl .
Cooke inflamed the judge during sentencing by claiming the four - year - old acted sexually provocative toward him .
“ I tried to avoid the encounters .
On a couple of times , I thought I was being sexually harassed , ” Kenneth R. Cooke , 73 , told a judge .
“ I think there is psychological evidence today that children , even in their younger years , could become interested in sex . ”
After listening to Cooke ’s statements , Judge Joseph Condon sentenced him to three years in prison .
Condon said the sentence was based partly on Cooke ’s attitude .
“ That just boggles my mind , ” Condon said to Cooke .
“ You are willing to say whatever is convenient to you and what is most likely to release the pressure of these proceedings against you . ”
Cooke pleaded guilty in November to aggravated criminal sexual abuse for abusing the girl in a Lake in the Hills home in 2003 while visiting from Canada .
“ She will never be the same , naive , innocent child she was before the crime , ” the girl ’s mother said in court .
“ She feels guilty and the sense of being a bad person because she has done things that she knows are wrong modeled after Mr. Cooke . ”
Before Cooke ever appeared in a U.S. courtroom to answer to the charges , he fought his extradition from Canada for years , prosecutors said .
The victim ’s mother said the prolonged legal proceedings had been mentally exhausting on her family .
“ Every year that passed without any resolution was extremely frustrating and prevented us from moving on , ” she said .
“ It ’s been 4 1 / 2 years and we are still dealing with the repercussions of this incident . ”
Also during the hour - long sentencing hearing , Cooke expressed remorse and said he was misrepresented and misunderstood .
When Condon asked Cooke what he meant , Cooke denied abusing the girl .
“ I never touched that child in an inappropriate manner , ” Cooke said .
Cooke said he pleaded guilty because he and his family did n’t believe that his ailing health could withstand a trial .
“ My family felt I ’d have a nervous breakdown or heart attack , so I had no other choice . ”
Prosecutors asked Condon to sentence Cooke to the maximum seven years in prison .
“ He is not accepting responsibility for his actions , ” McHenry County Assistant State ’s Attorney Sharyl Eisenstein said .
“ The defendant is blaming his criminal action on a 4 - year - old as the aggressor . ”

I was 35 at the time this happened , I had a 6 yr .
friend of my 7 yr.old dauhter come up to me when I was home alone at the time and pull my shorts down , if I had not grabbed her hands she would haved pulled my underwear down .
She told me that her father let her see him naked all the time when they were home by themsklves , shortly there after I was wakened from an afternoon nap with her touching my private parts and telling me how rubs daddy , s all the time .
I would , ve turned him in but was worried that I WOULD GET IN TROUBLE ALSO .
What would you have done ?

I would have got her to suck my cock Posted by Vic on 2011-09 - 27 06:37:56 I was wondering what is the atmosphere in the parents home .
Do they watch porn or leave porn magazines laying around the house where the child has access to them .
I am not blaming the child but questioning the parents and the atmosphere the child lives in .

It seems that Michael Dell is breathing new life into his company .
A year ago , Dell was brave enough to backtrack on its Vista - only policy for consumer machines ( Dell brings back XP on home systems ) .
It also showed some independence from Microsoft by offering Linux to consumers .
And again , Dell is innovating .
Fact 1 : As of June 30 , large computer manufacturers such as Dell and Hewlett - Packard can no longer offer Windows XP preinstalled on new computers , though Microsoft has said it would consider re-evaluating the deadline if there 's enough customer demand .
Fact 2 : Anyone who buys a copy of either the Business or Ultimate versions of Vista is entitled to also get Windows XP Professional .*
Each computer manufacturer decides whether , or how , to implement this .
Until now , consumers who exercised their right to get XP Professional when they purchased Vista got a computer with Vista preinstalled and an XP image CD in the box ( an image CD is very different from a retail Windows CD ) .
Dell 's innovation ?
It will do the XP image installation for you .
It may not sound like much , but the net result is that the computer leaves the factory with Windows XP Professional on it , rather than Vista .
Deadline ?
We do n't need no stinkin ' deadline .
Microsoft can't be happy about this , though a cynic would note that even though Dell computers leave the factory with XP on them , Microsoft can tally it as a sale for Vista .
It 's an interesting power play between the two companies .
Will other companies follow Dell or toe the Microsoft line ?
According to Randy Copeland , president and CEO of Velocity Micro , after the June 30 deadline , all of its computers will ship with Vista preinstalled .
The company will offer the XP Professional " downgrade " in the traditional way , by including an XP image CD in the box .
Interestingly , each XP image CD will be mated to one , and only one , computer .
Dell has a Web page devoted to its new policy , Windows XP Availability , which notes that the last day to buy a computer with Windows XP preinstalled under the current rules is June 18 .
Afterward :
When selecting your operating system , you will see an option called " Genuine Windows ® Vista Business BONUS " and " Genuine Windows Vista Ultimate BONUS . "
With these options , you may ... have Dell factory install Windows XP Professional .
You will also receive a backup media disc for Windows XP Professional , as well as the media for Windows Vista .
In other words , Dell provides optical discs for both XP and Vista , so you can change over at any time .
This is not like Apple 's Boot Camp , however ; the computer can have only one operating installed on the hard disk at a time .
But Dell provides technical support for both XP and Vista .
Whether its tech support is worthwhile is another matter .
According to Infoworld , Dell will offer this new " buy Vista , get XP Pro preinstalled " service on some Latitude , OptiPlex , and Precision systems for free .
It will also offer it on some Vostro and XPS systems for a small fee .
For more about getting Windows XP after the June 30 deadline , see my previous posting , Who 's selling Windows XP in July ?
* NOTE : Microsoft allows a " downgrade " only to XP Professional , not to the Home or Media Center editions .
According to InfoWorld , large organizations with site licenses can " downgrade " from any version of Vista .

Because many of the samples are quite sizable , Mr. Mitchell said it is not feasible to try to carry them in his own luggage .
“ I just do n’t have any other choice .
You ’ve got to be able to let the client touch it .
I have to bring them with me even if it costs $ 25 . ”
Jerry Bower , an entrepreneur who recently started a company , Wine Galaxy , that offers wine - of - the - month memberships for corporations to give to employees or clients , said he , too , often travels with more than one bag .
“ I have to travel quite a bit in order to build relationships , ” he said .
“ I do carry a lot of different literature and presentation pieces , and sometimes wine samples . ”
The new fee of $ 25 for a second bag is being levied by Continental , Delta , Northwest , United and US Airways .
The low - fare carrier AirTran has announced that it will charge $ 10 for a second checked bag .
Airlines have long levied fees for checking a third bag .
Some carriers have recently increased those as well , and the fees on the major carriers now run as high as $ 100 .
As the airlines struggle to stay in the black , charges for amenities formerly included in the ticket price are on the rise .
Depending on the carrier , travelers now can wind up paying extra for everything from food to curbside check - in to bulkhead seats that offer extra legroom .
As for the extra -bag fee , even those who say they pack lightly for their trips foresee problems caused by price - sensitive fliers overfilling their carry - on bags and using large amounts of scarce overhead - bin space .
I was interested to read that someone has managed to make BBC iPlayer work on the PS3 by pretending that it 's a Wii .
As you know , our aim is to make BBC iPlayer available on a broad range of devices .
We 'd love to be on every popular device tomorrow , including the PS3 , and it was on our roadmap .
However , the reality is that we only have finite developer resources , and we need to divide our development time between expanding the platforms iPlayer is available on versus all the other cool things that we 're working on ( better video quality , personalisation , new site features , etc ) .
For each new device that we plan to support , we look at both a short and long term strategy , starting with encoding our content in a suitable format for browser - enabled devices that can view the iPlayer site , and moving in the longer term to possible customised versions of the site or even full custom applications for that device .
So , while I 'm impressed that someone has done this , this does n't mean that it 's the best possible iPlayer proposition for that console .
We 're investigating the optimal video profile and browser proposition to enable us to officially make iPlayer available on PS3 in due course .
By the way , if the person who created the ps3iplayer port is looking for a job at the BBC , ( s ) he 's welcome to contact me ;-)

A new study appears to explain how humans , along with other higher primates , guinea pigs and fruit bats , get by with what some have called an “ inborn metabolic error ” : an inability to produce vitamin C from glucose .
Unlike the more than 4,000 other species of mammals who manufacture vitamin C , and lots of it , the red blood cells of the handful of vitamin C - defective species are specially equipped to suck up the vitamin ’s oxidized form , so - called L- dehydroascorbic acid ( DHA ) , the researchers report in the March21st issue of Cell , a publication of Cell Press .
Once inside the blood cells , that DHA - - which is immediately transformed back into ascorbic acid ( a.k.a. vitamin C ) -- can be efficiently carried through the bloodstream to the rest of the body , the researchers suggest .
“ Evolution is amazing .
Even though people talk about this as an ‘ inborn error ’ — a metabolic defect that all humans have — there is also this incredible manner in which we ’ve responded to the defect , using some of the body ’s most plentiful cells , ” said Naomi Taylor of Université Montpellier I and II in France , noting that the body harbors billions of red blood cells .
“ [ Through evolution ] , we ’ve created this system that takes out the oxidized form of vitamin C and transports the essential , antioxidant form . ”
Meanwhile , the red cells of other mammals apparently take up very little , if any , DHA , which might explain why they need to produce so much more vitamin C than we need to get from our diets , Taylor said .
The recommended daily dose of vitamin C for humans is just one mg / kg , while goats , for example , produce the vitamin at a striking rate of 200 mg / kg each day .
In essence , the red cells of animals that ca n’t make vitamin C recycle what little they ’ve got .
Earlier studies had described the recycling process , Taylor said .
“ Our contribution to the whole story is to show that this process of recycling exists specifically in mammals that do n’t make vitamin C. ”
Scientists knew that the protein called Glut1 , found in the membranes of cells throughout the body , is the primary transporter of glucose .
They also knew that Glut1 can transport DHA too , thanks to the structural similarities between the two molecules .
In biochemical assays , it appeared that the glucose transporter would move glucose and DHA interchangeably .
But , in the new study , Taylor ’s group made a surprising discovery :
The Glut1 on human red blood cells strongly favors DHA over glucose .
In fact , the human blood cells are known to carry more Glut1 than any other cell type , harboring more than 200,000 molecules on the surface of every cell .
Nevertheless , the researchers found , as red blood cells develop in the bone marrow , their transport of glucose declines even as Glut1 numbers skyrocket .
The key to the glucose transporters switch to DHA , they show , is the presence of another membrane protein called stomatin .
( Accordingly , in patients with a rare genetic disorder of red cell membrane permeability wherein stomatin is only present at low levels , DHA transport is decreased by 50 % while glucose uptake is significantly increased , they report . )
Then , another surprise :
The researchers found that the red cells of mice , a species that can produce vitamin C , do n’t carry Glut1 on their red blood cells at all .
They carry Glut4 instead .
They suspected that the differences in human red blood cells might be linked to our inability to synthesize the reduced form of DHA , vitamin C , from glucose .
In fact , they confirmed Glut1 expression on human , guinea pig and fruit bat red blood cells , but not on any other mammalian red cells tested , including rabbit , rat , cat , dog and chinchilla .
Next , they took a closer look at primates .
Primates belonging to the Haplorrhini suborder ( including prosimian tarsiers , new world monkeys , old world monkeys , humans and apes ) have lost the ability to synthesize vitamin C , whereas primates in the Strepsirrhini suborder ( including lemurs ) are reportedly able to produce this vitamin , Taylor explained .
Notably , they detected Glut1 on all tested red blood cells of primates within the higher primate group , including long - tailed macaques , rhesus monkeys , baboons and magot monkeys .
In marked contrast , Glut1 was not detected on lemur red blood cells .
Moreover , they report , although DHA uptake in human and magot red cells was similar , the level of transport in cells from three different lemur species was less than 10 % of that detected in higher primates .
“ Red blood cell - specific Glut1 expression and DHA transport are specific traits of the few vitamin C - deficient mammalian species , encompassing only higher primates , guinea pigs and fruit bats , ” the researchers concluded .
“ Indeed , the red cells of adult mice do not harbor Glut1 and do not transport DHA .
Rather , Glut4 is expressed on their cells .
Thus , the concomitant induction of Glut1 and stomatin during red blood cell differentiation constitutes a compensatory mechanism in mammals that are unable to synthesize the essential ascorbic acid metabolite , ” otherwise known as vitamin C .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) -
The chief executive officer of Costco Wholesale Corp said on Tuesday that the warehouse club operator has seen some unusual demand for certain items like rice and flour as customers , worried over global food shortages , look to stock up on basic items .

REUTERS / Rick Wilking
James Sinegal , Costco ’s chief executive officer , told Reuters in an interview that the retailer had seen increased demand in the past week and a half , and some of its stores , including certain locations in California ’s Bay Area , had put limits on the sales of these items .
“ There ’s been an increase in purchasing but we think it ’s manageable .
At the moment , we think we have it relatively under control , ” he said .
If a customer came in and said , “ I want 10 pallets of flour , we ’d probably say , ‘ No , we ca n’t give you that .
We can give you one pallet ’ , ” Sinegal said .
“ We ’ve tried to modify those , ” he said of the restrictions its store managers put in place .
“ So if somebody is buying a reasonable quantity , we let them have it . ”
Warehouse club operators like Costco cater to both individual shoppers as well as small business and restaurant owners looking to buy cheaper , bulk - sized goods for their operations .
Sinegal said customers can buy pallet - loads of products at its locations .
He said he believed the surge in demand was prompted by media reports in recent weeks discussing rising global demand and shortages in some countries for basic food items like rice and flour .
“ If we run out , we ’re usually back in stock the next day , ” he said of these popular items .
He said store managers may have taken “ precipitous action , ” by putting limits on sales of certain items , and he added : “ We do n’t want to add to the furor here . ”

Petitioners call for investigation after hospital destroys nearly 10,000 samples .
Bacterial collections can help to trace the origins of new infectious agents .
BARRY DOWSETT / SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY
A group of nearly 250 researchers is requesting an investigation into the destruction of thousands of samples from an infectious disease lab at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania .
The collection — which contained nearly 10,000 specimens — was the product of more than 20 years of work and included many different strains of infectious bacteria , some of them very rare .
“ They were priceless , ” says David Snydman , an infectious disease expert at Tufts Medical Center in Boston , Massachusetts .
Snydman had collaborated with the curators of the collection on several projects , and lost samples from patients with pneumococcal meningitis collected from sites around the world .
“ This is like a book burning , ” he says .
The specimens were destroyed after the medical centre closed down their Special Pathogens Laboratory , headed by Victor Yu , in July of 2006 .
Yu and colleagues were planning to move the samples to a new home , but the collection was meanwhile destroyed by the hospital as part of the closure .
Snydman and 242 others have now signed a petition , published in the April issue of Clinical Infectious Diseases1 , asking that an independent review committee investigate what led to the repository ’s destruction .
Unknown fever
The lab specialized in testing samples for Legionella bacteria , the agent that causes a deadly form of pneumonia called Legionnaire ’s disease .
Over the years , it had also become a repository of samples from patients infected with a variety of pathogens .
The collection contained samples of an emerging strain of Klebsiella pneumonia that was originally discovered in Asia , but has since been found around the globe .
And it also held specimens taken from patients diagnosed with ‘ fever of unknown origin’ .
These samples could one day have been used to trace the origins of new infectious agents , Yu says .
Yu and his colleague , Janet Stout , have since reopened the Special Pathogens Laboratory at the nearby University of Pittsburgh , but say there is no way to replace the full contents of their archive .
Mystery destruction
Exactly why the hospital chose to destroy the samples remains a mystery .
Hospital representatives declined to comment when contacted by Nature News , but did tell WTAE , a local television news station , that the hospital incinerated samples that were not clearly labeled to protect the safety of hospital patients and staff .
Stout and Yu chafe at this explanation .
Stout says the samples were " meticulously catalogued " , though the identity of the infectious agent in some samples was not known .
She says she was coordinating with hospital administrators to transfer the samples to the University of Pittsburgh , where she and Yu are now faculty members .
Both researchers say they were not alerted in any way that their samples were in danger .
“ No one from the administration ever discussed this with Yu or I , ” says Stout .
There were no complaints , she says , that the samples were still in storage at the medical centre .
Stout only learned of the destruction when she consulted an attorney to help negotiate the terms under which she would leave the hospital after the lab was closed .
She wanted to be sure that she could take her strains with her , and had her attorney contact the hospital ’s lawyers .
“ They told him we ca n’t do that because they ’ve already been destroyed , ” she says .
“ That ’s how I found out . ”
Quick exit
Discussions over whether the lab would be closed culminated in a decision that left Yu only 48 hours to shut down the lab .
“ On Wednesday they handed the notice to me , ” says Yu . “ On Friday they padlocked the lab . ”
Yu protested that there were samples in the lab that needed to be tested so that his clients could be told whether their water was contaminated .
Yu appealed to hospital administrators and US congressmen for more time .
This won him two weeks to finish the lab work , but did not win him any friends in the hospital ’s administration , he says .
ADVERTISEMENT
Yu ’s colleagues note that he is no stranger to controversy .
Yu has clashed with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the past over Legionella testing standards .
The agency advises hospitals to test their water only after a patient has been diagnosed with Legionnaire ’s disease ;
Yu thinks water should be tested once a year to prevent infections before they strike .
Regardless of the cause , the damage is done , says Stout .
“ What happened to Yu and I is one thing .
But the attack on the science is reprehensible , ” says Stout .
“ People need to be held accountable so that we can figure out how this can never happen again . ”

Europe 's Failed States John Horvath
The failed states of Europe reflect the failed state of Europe
Over the past few weeks three events seemed to underscore the awkward position of the European Union ( EU ) in terms of international relations .
These and other similar events continue to leave Europe in a schizophrenic state .
On the one hand the EU is made up of sovereign nations which have come together under a common purpose ; on the other , Eurocrats in Brussels bemoan the fact that Europe is unable to speak with one voice when it comes to foreign affairs .
This schizophrenic state was highlighted in 2003 with the American war against Iraq .
The EU was unable to find common ground , with many of the accession states ( Poland , Hungary , etc. ) supporting the war while the major EU states of France and Germany were opposed to it .
This split led to the notion of old Europe versus new Europe .
Soon , however , it became obvious that the so - called coalition of the willing was nothing more than a coalition of the billing ; each EU member state which supported the war in Iraq had done so out of self - interest , expecting some sort of return from Washington .
For countries like Hungary and Poland , this was in the form of preferential loans and other financial incentives .
Sadly , the political landscape has changed somewhat with the anti-war stance of France and Germany taking on an increasingly belligerent , pro-US tone .
This is mostly due to the rise of the right in these countries , with Merkel in Germany and Sarkozy in France rattling their sabres in the direction of Iran .
Indeed , the sabre rattling has become perceptibly louder , raising fears that George W. Bush , together with the blessings of Germany and France , will try and attack Iran before he leaves office .
Ticket to Freedom
Whether this will actually happen or not remains to be seen .
For now , Eurocrats are still concerned with trying to overcome their schizophrenia .
This was n't helped recently when Hungary negotiated and ultimately signed a memorandum of understanding with the US concerning visa - free travel to the US .
This agreement was similar to ones previously signed by the Czech Republic and Estonia .
After the fall of communism , one of the major goals of the countries of the former East Bloc was to secure visa - free travel to the US for their citizens .
The US has visa - free relations with all old EU member states except for Greece .
However , citizens from the new member states , with the exception of Slovenia , still need a visa for travel to the US .
At times , the objective of visa - free travel for the former countries of the East Bloc appeared even more important than EU membership .
However , just as with EU membership , the issue of visas was often dangled as a carrot before the salivating mouths of Central and Eastern Europeans .
Indubitably , the promise of visa - free travel to the US was one of the reasons why some members from the coalition of the billing supported the US invasion of Iraq .
After several false hopes , this dream of many within Central and Eastern Europe has come one step closer to being a reality .
In February of this year the Czech Republic was the first to sign a bilateral agreement with the US .
Subsequently , it 's expected that the Czech Republic will join the U.S. visa waiver programme probably this autumn .
Although the Czech step was supported by Hungary , Slovakia and the Baltic countries , not all states from Central and Eastern Europe supported this move .
Poland and Slovenia , as well as the so - called old EU member states , supported the idea that the European Commission should negotiate the visa issues on behalf of the EU instead of individual countries engaging in bilateral talks .
The problem was further compounded by the fact these countries would have liked to have postponed the talks on visas ; member states such as Hungary and the Czech Republic , however , were keen on a quick solution .
All this has aggravated the EU 's schizophrenic state .
In particular , Brussels was not happy because these bilateral agreements seriously undermine Europe 's stance on data protection and personal privacy .
It 's feared that the US will be able to use countries like Hungary and the Czech Republic to somehow circumvent European privacy laws .
The bilateral agreements signed by the Czech Republic , Hungary , and Estonia , therefore , further complicates efforts to find a joint EU position in talks on visas with the US , this according to Slovenian Interior Minister Dragutin Mate ( Slovenia currently holds the chair of the EU 's rotating presidency ) .
Mate pointed out that most EU members want to take a joint stance during the negotiations about US visa requirements and support the proposals prepared by the Slovenian EU presidency .
An Oily Situation
What tears Europe apart are not only contentious issues blowing in from the west , but those coming from the east also .
In particular , plans for rival oil and natural gas pipelines from the Caucuses to supply energy hungry markets in Europe have been a source of friction .
A few weeks ago Hungary surprised most observers when Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsany suddenly flew to Moscow and signed a deal allowing for a planned Russian pipeline to transit through the country .
The EU had already thrown its support behind the plan for a pipeline which would come from Turkey and traverse across the Balkans to the Adriatic or possibly further north to cross into the EU directly .
Russia , however , has its own plan for a pipeline which would cross the Black Sea to Bulgaria and then up through Serbia to the rest of Europe .
The advantage of this route for Hungary is that the country would benefit from the transit fees it would receive for maintaining the pipeline on its territory .
For the EU , the problem with the Russian pipeline is that it would diminish the importance of their plan .
Furthermore , Budapest 's quick and lightening reaction rendered a slap in the face to Brussels which has been struggling to formulate a comprehensive energy policy to be shared by all member states .
Hence , the unilateral action of the Hungarian government seriously undermined these efforts .
For his part , Gyurcsany remarked that Moscow came with the best offer and that he immediately pounced on it .
This is n't the first time , however , that the supply of oil has been a bone of contention among EU member states .
A few years back Germany did a similar move whereby a separate agreement was reached with Moscow for a pipeline which would run under the Baltic Sea from Russia , thereby by - passing Poland .
It goes without saying that Poland was very critical of the German move because it ended up losing out on the transit fees it would have gained by having the pipeline pass through its territory .
As the supply of energy continues to be a contentious issue for Europe , we can expect to see more such friction among EU member states in the future .
What is more , the EU appears to have no qualms about sacrificing its lofty ideals for the sake of securing new energy sources .
A case in point is its relationship with Algiers .
Despite the fact that the Algerian military had brutally suppressed the formation of a democratically elected government , and that the subsequent government has been responsible for gross human rights abuses and violations , the EU has barely raised its voice in protest .
This is because Algeria is one of the main suppliers of oil to the EU .
Human rights are one thing ; business is another .
Unfortunately , when it comes to resolving differences between the two , the latter often takes precedence .
Europe 's Achilles Heel
Apart from the issue of visas to the US and oil from Russia , perhaps the most pronounced issue of Europe 's schizophrenic state is that of Kosovo .
Two weeks ago Hungary , Croatia , and Bulgaria issued a joint declaration affirming their recognition of Kosovo 's independence , noting that this status of Kosovo was unavoidable .
This was soon followed by their official recognition of the breakaway province .
The joint declaration was also quick to stress the need for Serbia to quickly become integrated with the rest of Europe , and thus should be made a member of the EU as soon as possible .
Some observers believe that while initially relations between Serbia and the three countries may cool a bit , they nevertheless feel that recognising Kosovo wo n't lead to a permanent worsening of relations .
This may be so for some states such as Bulgaria which has n't had any major problems with Serbia , but for others such as Croatia and Hungary it ?s hard to imagine how the recognition of Kosovo wo n't have anything but a long - lasting effect on diplomatic and even social relations .
Still , many are optimistic that the worst wave Serb reaction has already passed , and that a rise in anti-ethnic violence , for instance against the Hungarian minority in Vojvodina , is unlikely .
Even so , the police have been on heightened alert in minority areas where Croats and Hungarians predominantly live -- just in case .
Serb radicals warned that incidents may take place if Croatia or Hungary recognises Kosovo , but so far this has proved to be nothing more than empty rhetoric .
Still , although there have been no large scale attacks against ethnic minorities in Vojvodina thus far some individual attacks have been reported .
Recently a student in the town of Subotica was beat up because of his Hungarian ethnicity .
As a result , despite claims by minority leaders that all is well , a certain amount of fear in some areas of Vojvodina and elsewhere in Serbia prevails .
To this extent , the Serb radicals have achieved their aim ; to instil an atmosphere of fear so that those with the ways and means will flee from the area of their accord , thereby aiding in the low - intensity ethnic cleansing of the area which has been already going on for the past decade or so .
While most believe that there wo n't be large - scale attacks in Serbia against the minorities of countries which have recognised the independence of Kosovo , this does n't mean that the existing violence and discrimination against minorities wo n't be further entrenched .
In other words , although we wo n't see a massive retaliation by Serb radicals , we wo n't see any form of reconciliation either .
In essence , the wounds of the past may not cut deeper , but they wo n't heal either .
For the EU , if the hope was that by recognising Kosovo it would have solved the Balkan crisis then it has seriously miscalculated .
The Hungarian minority in Serbia feel that they deserve special protection from the EU since Hungary is a member state .
This means Europe can't simply turn its back on what happens next in the Balkans and move on .
Meanwhile , Brussels is desperately trying to forget that it was primarily responsible for letting the tragedy of the former Yugoslavia unwind the way that it did .
In many ways , little has changed : the EU is still at a loss of how to deal with the ethnic problems which exist in its own backyard .
Moreover , it goes without saying that not all countries in Europe are happy about the situation in Kosovo , foremost Spain , Romania , and Slovakia which all have large minorities of their own .
The problem for them is that Kosovo may set a precedent even though the EU maintains that it won ?t.
Not only this , but independence does n't necessarily mean sovereignty .
This fine distinction is manifest in the need for recognition by the UN of Kosovo 's independence .
Along these lines , some observers maintain that Hungary could have waited with its recognition of Kosovo until the province was officially recognised by the UN .
While its recognition of Kosovo independence may have been largely symbolic , Hungary has now opened a Pandora 's Box of diplomatic and social unease with neighbouring EU states , namely Romania and Slovakia , both of whom have large ethnic minorities of clamouring for autonomy .
Consequently , a wave of xenophobic nationalism - sometimes supported by the government - has become apparent in these countries .
In Slovakia , for instance , the government has pushed through a new education policy which seeks to further curb the rights of minorities .
Not only does it seek to teach a biased view of the country 's history , it also does n't recognise Hungarian as an official language ; instead it 's treated as simply another foreign language .
Until recently , Hungarian has been recognised as an official language of sorts , with priority naturally given to Slovak .
Gradually , however , the right of minorities to use their own language has been curbed to the extent that in areas predominantly and traditionally Hungarian , the mother tongue of some citizens is not allowed to be used in public ( for example when a Hungarian patient visits a Hungarian doctor ) as Hungarian is now considered by the state to be a foreign language .
In Romania , meanwhile , nationalist extremism is slowly on the rise .
Hungarians still have to fight for their right to have bilingual signs ; when such signs are put up they are often either removed or defaced .
Also , physical attacks against minorities have increased .
During the March 15th anniversary commemorating the 1848 revolution against Habsburg rule , for instance , two Romanian youths beat up a Hungarian who was on his way to attend an official celebration .
Aside from being plagued by both ghosts of the past and present , the legacy of the EU 's schizophrenia and inability to deal with problems in its own backyard is evident in the failed states which have emerged as a result .
This is certainly true of Kosovo , which most likely will turn out to be like Bosnia , another failed state in the Balkans .
Unfortunately , the media ( and hence the public ) perception of a failed state is that of Afghanistan or Iraq , where terrorism and war is commonplace .
Ironically , akin to the Balkans , in those two countries NATO and US involvement was supposed to bring democracy , a beacon of hope for other countries in the area .
After relatively easy victories in the beginning , however , these wars are still going on and democracy is further away than ever .
In fact , the situation is so bad that some within the region look back to the good old days when Saddam Hussein and the Taliban were in power .
While there are many similarities between the situation in the Middle East and that of the Balkans , the situation in the former Yugoslavia is admittedly nowhere close to being as chaotic .
Nonetheless , in places such as Bosnia the state is unable to function on its own .
The country is basically a protectorate of the EU : the highest political authority in the country is the High Representative in Bosnia and Herzegovina , the chief executive officer for the international civilian presence in the country .
Since 1995 , the High Representative has been able to bypass the elected parliamentary assembly , and since 1997 has been able to remove elected officials .
On several occasions the actions of the High Representative have been criticized as undemocratic .
International supervision is to end when the country is deemed politically and democratically stable and self - sustaining .
Yet over ten years since the end of the civil war , the prospect of this happening any time soon is remote .
Just as remote is the dream of a European Union where the countries of Europe work together for a common goal , where co-operation lays the foundation for peace among the nations of Europe .
Alas self - interest and competition , both in the realms of economics and diplomacy , have replaced the notion of co-operation .
As a result , Europe is finding it increasingly difficult to speak with one voice .
The US visa issue , the trans - Balkan pipelines , and the status of Kosovo all have vividly demonstrated this .
Finally , it must be kept in mind that a failed state is not only one that fails to function because of war and civil strife .
Hungary itself is on the path to becoming the first failed member state of the EU thanks to the spiralling level of debt it finds itself in .
The economic prospects for the country looks gloomy and many are now talking about the possibility of the government becoming insolvent within the next five years or so unless something drastic is n?t done soon .
Unfortunately , efforts are hampered by EU regulations and its convergence programme for Hungary which seeks to put the rights of investors and big business ahead of ordinary citizens .
Given all these failures , Brussels needs to take a hard look at itself ; the concept of a European Union needs to be redefined with the support of the people it supposedly represents , as opposed to the present practice of pushing through reforms that few understand and that even fewer support .
Presently , the institutions of the EU are nothing more than forums for has - been and dying politicians who use them as a means to pump up their self - importance by engaging in prestige politics or to put the finishing touches to their mortal legacy .
Unless fundamental change occurs at the very heart of its institutions , and that the politicians within these institutions are replaced by ones elected directly by the people for the purpose of promoting the health and welfare of all Europeans , then the schizophrenia that the EU presently suffers from will end up driving Europe mad .

FBI investigates Continental pilot 's encounter with ' rocket ' Continental pilot startled by encounter with ' rocket '
A Continental Airlines pilot reported being startled by what he described as a rocket that shot past his cockpit window Monday when the plane was about eight miles north of George Bush Intercontinental Airport .
The Federal Aviation Administration and the FBI 's Joint Terrorism Task Force are investigating the incident , which occurred about 10:30 a.m .
" We do n't know for sure what the object was .
But we think it might be somebody doing model rocketing , " said Roland Herwig , an FAA spokesman .
" The pilot saw the rocket and some people saw the rocket 's trail ( of smoke ) . "
Continental Airlines spokeswoman Kelly Cripe said Monday night that she could not discuss what was seen by the crew of Flight 1544 .
She would only say that the Boeing 737 , with 148 passengers .
left Bush at 10:17 a.m. and arrived in Cleveland , Ohio at 2:13 p.m.
She said the pilot made no diversionary maneuvers , and she added the plane was not damaged , and nobody was injured .
The FAA does not yet know how close the object came to the plane or what altitude it reached .
" We will determine that by establishing a radar history , " Herwig said .
FBI spokeswoman Shauna Dunlap stressed that it is " routine " for the FBI to look into suspicious activity involving an aircraft .
" We do n't know if it was a rocket or what .
We will interview everyone and determine the validity of what was seen , " she said .
If it was model rocket , investigators want to know the type and who launched it .
" Building rockets is a legitimate hobby , but hobbyists have to let the FAA know what they 're doing , " Herwig said .
Robert Morehead , an engineer who is president of the Amateur Spaceflight Association in Houston , said the FAA would only need to be notified if a rocket would be entering controlled airspace .
He said the only danger to a plane might be if the rocket is ingested by a plane 's engine .
" But their engines are designed to ingest birds and not come apart , " said Morehead , who lives in Clear Lake .
" The real question is if the rocket would tear up the engine instead of just shutting it off . "
Model rockets can be made of cardboard and glue or have aluminum air frames , he said .
Rockets also have no difficulty reaching the 30,000 to 40,000 feet , the altitude at which an airliner may cruise .
" There is a guy who claims his rocket has reached the threshold of space or 75 miles , " Morehead said .
" But there are lots of models that could fly as high as an airliner .
You can do it with a 10 - to 15 - foot tall rocket and some little ones . "
But Flight 1544 had recently taken off and might not have been flying that high , he said .
The models can be fueled with everything from black powder to ammonium percholorate and aluminum , he said .
" It 's not rocket science when you use a kit , " he said .
His organization builds rockets from scratch to teach students the math and science behind it .
" We just built one using liquid fuel that had substantially more thrust than the models , " he said .
Laura Brown , an FAA spokeswoman in Washington D.C. , said the Monday incident is not the first time a rocket has crossed paths with an airliner .
But so far , no plane has been hit by a launched model rocket .
" There are model rocket clubs operating around the country .
This was a holiday weekend that would be good for a launch , " she said .

Poll : Obama ties Clinton in Indiana ; Leads N. Carolina by 14 RAW STORY
Published : Tuesday May 6 , 2008

Print This Email This Indiana is neck and neck in the final Zogby poll before the primaries .
North Carolina appears solidly in Barack Obama 's camp .
" The pair of surveys of the Democratic presidential contests shows Obama with a significant 14 - point lead in North Carolina , winning 51 % support to Hillary Clintons 37 % , " Zogby writes .
" Another 12 % said they were either favoring someone else or were as yet undecided .
In Indiana , the race is clear as mud , as Obama holds a statistically insignificant lead of two points , winning 45 % support to Clintons 43 % support , with 12 % either undecided or favoring someone else . "
A similar poll released yesterday by Boston - based Suffolk University put Clinton seven points over Obama in Indiana .
" The overall Obama advantage in Indiana though statistically insignificant comes after another strong day of polling Monday .
The one - day total , which comprises about half of the two - day tracking poll sample , saw Obama winning 47 % support to Clintons 41 % .
Mondays polling results are combined with Sundays numbers to produce the two - day tracking poll .
" Among voters age 55 - 64 , Obama has made a move forward and now wins 44 % support , compared to 43 % support for Clinton .
Yesterday , Clinton held a two - point edge among those voters .
This represents a key advance for Obama , who has had trouble winning support among older voters in earlier states . "
Democrats - Indiana 5-4/5 5-3/4 5-2/3 5-1/2 4-30/5-1 Clinton 43 % 42 % 41 % 42 % 42 % Obama 45 % 44 % 43 % 43 % 42 % Someone else 5 % 7 % 8 % 7 % 7 % Not sure 7 % 8 % 8 % 8 % 9 % " Obama dominated among men , leading 56 % to 34 % , and among women , where he won 47 % support to Clintons 40 % largely on the strength of Obamas support among African American women .
Obama also led among younger voters in the state , while Clinton enjoyed leads among older voters .
Among a key age demographic group those age 35 to 54  Obama leads by 58 % to 29 % margin . "
Democrats North Carolina 5-4/5 5-3/4 5-2/3 5-1/2 4-30/5-1 Clinton 37 % 40 % 39 % 37 % 34 % Obama 51 % 48 % 48 % 46 % 50 % Someone else 4 % 5 % 5 % 8 % 8 % Not sure 8 % 8 % 8 % 9 % 8 % " The telephone surveys , conducted May 4 - 5 , 2008 , are the final of Zogbys two - day daily tracking surveys , " he adds .
" In North Carolina , 643 likely Democratic primary election voters were polled .
In Indiana , 644 likely voting Democratic primary voters were surveyed .
Both surveys carry a margin of error of +/- 3.9 percentage points . "

LECCO , Italy ( Reuters ) -
An Italian man was given a suspended jail sentence for staring too intensely at a woman sitting in front of him on a train .
A judge sentenced the man in his 30s , whose name was not revealed , to 10 days in prison and a 40 euro ( $ 63 ) fine after a 55 - year old woman filed a complaint for sexual harassment .
His lawyer said on Friday he would appeal the sentence .
The court will explain its verdict later .
The two met on two separate occasions in 2005 on a commuter train going from Lecco , a town in northern Italy , to Milan .
The first time , the man sat next to the woman but she felt he had moved too close for comfort .
The next day , the man sat in front of the same woman and according to her complaint , stared at her for the whole journey .
The two did not speak .

Events in Iceland : Skating on thin ice ?
Thorvaldur Gylfason
Is Iceland in danger of financial collapse ?
The Wall Street Journal recently commented that “ Iceland looks like an ideal bearish bet . ”
But many economists disagree .
A bit of political history may help illuminate recent developments .
For decades , beginning in 1927 when a farmers ’ party gained majority in parliament with the support of just a third of the electorate , the Icelandic economy was more heavily regulated than most in Western Europe , with the possible exception of Ireland .
Interference and planning were the norm ; enterprise and markets were viewed with scepticism if not hostility .
Without much exaggeration , the state tried to restrain almost anything that moved .
The state owned the largest commercial banks and used them to allocate scarce funds to favoured industries and firms ; undervalued foreign exchange was rationed the same way .
Domestic saving dried up , which necessitated external borrowing on a large scale because , for nationalistic reasons , foreign investment was kept at bay ( and banned from the fishing industry , a ban still in force ) .
A radical liberalization of the policy regime in the 1960s helped modernize the nation by reducing subsidies to the fishing industry and devaluing the króna .
Even so , the liberalization was incomplete ; for one thing , it left the banks in the hands of the state .
Besides , the tight , almost suffocating , embrace of producers and the government remained intact , an embrace that helps explain why , to this day , the Confederation of Icelandic Employers remains unwilling to advocate EU membership and thus go against the wishes of the senior coalition party in government , the sole mainstream centre - right party in Europe so disinclined .
Iceland became Russia
The first wave of liberalization in the early 1960s was not accompanied by a necessary depolitisation of economic life , nor was the second wave that started in the late 1980 .
The second wave involved deregulation of domestic interest rates and foreign capital flows , indexation of financial obligations to prices , entry into the European Economic Area in 1994 , and privatisation of commercial banks and investment funds during 1998 to 2003 when two of the largest state banks were sold .
They were , however , sold both at once at a price deemed modest by the National Audit Office .
Moreover , the banks were sold not to foreign banks like in Eastern Europe – Estonia , for example – but to individuals closely linked to the political parties in power .
One beneficiary of the banks ’ privatisation – a politician whose private - sector experience consisted of running two small knitwear factories in the 1970s , a few months each – became an instant billionaire .
Another flew in Elton John for a birthday celebration .
I could go on , but you get my drift : Iceland became Russia .
A former prime minister 1991 - 2004 , demoted after an election loss to foreign minister 2004 - 5 , unilaterally announced his retirement from politics as well as his appointment , with immediate effect , as governor of the Central Bank in 2005 ; his salary was quickly lifted above that of the President of the Republic .
The banks and the borrowing public got the message :
The sky is the limit .
Escalating debts
Free at last from state control , the banks kicked up their heels like cows in spring and went on an unprecedented borrowing and lending spree that increased the amount of domestic credit from the banking system from 100 percent of GDP in 2000 to 450 percent in 2007 .
The banks ’ business model was in essence imported from abroad : with few questions asked , loan officers were rewarded according to the volume of loans they made and other transactions .
The banks appeared to believe , as did at least one international rating agency , that the state guarantees behind them while in public ownership were still in force , and the government did little to counter this impression .
The banks borrowed short at low interest in foreign markets to finance long - term loans , including 25 - 40 year mortgages , thereby creating maturity mismatches in their books .
Many customers who signed mortgages with variable interest rates – that is , four percent real rates subject to renegotiation after a five - year grace period – were unaware that their mortgages were being financed by short - term loans .
Household debt reached 240 percent of their disposable incomes in 2007 , up from 40 percent in 1983 and 80 percent in 1990 .
The boom in the housing market has now come to an abrupt halt .
Public debt , on the other hand , was cut in half from 55 percent of GDP in 1994 to 28 percent in 2007 as the government repaid earlier loans with receipts from privatisation and other revenue , including substantial tax payments by the banks .
More importantly , individual income tax receipts increased from 10 percent of GDP in 1995 to 14 percent in 2006 as the tax burden on low - and middle - income earners rose .
Government revenue from taxes and other sources , including privatisation , increased from 38 percent of GDP in 1990 to 49 percent in 2005 – that is , from five points below the OECD average in 1990 to four points above average in 2005 .
Yet , despite heavier taxation of all except the rich , in 2006 the government borrowed from abroad the equivalent of nearly 10 percent of GDP to more than double the Central Bank ’s gross foreign reserves and restore them to the equivalent of three to four months ’ import coverage ; this loan was recorded separately , and is , therefore , not included in the official public debt figures cited above .
During 2004 - 7 , the current account deficit averaged 18 percent of GDP as imports and interest payments surged ; exports , however , continued to hover around a third of GDP as they have done since 1870 ( this is not a misprint ) , a clear sign of systemic overvaluation of the króna .
External debt rose to 550 percent of GDP in 2007 , including short - term liabilities equivalent to 200 percent of GDP .
Net foreign debt in 2007 amounted to almost 250 percent of GDP , up from 50 percent in 1997 .
Further , the net investment position , including FDI and portfolio equities , deteriorated from - 47 percent of GDP in 1997 to - 125 percent in 2007 .
These numbers raise two related concerns .
First , the worth of some of the assets that were purchased with borrowed funds is intrinsically difficult to assess .
Second , the quality of the investments that were financed with borrowed funds is a crucial determinant of the sustainability of the long - term debts that Iceland has piled up .
The profitability of the new and , for Iceland , huge hydro-electric project to feed an associated aluminium smelting operation under construction is a matter of some controversy because the government is unwilling to disclose the price at which the energy will be sold to the smelter .
Besides , some of the borrowed money was used to finance consumption .
Further signs of overvaluation
Three further factors point to a systemic overvaluation of the króna .
First , Iceland remains a high - inflation country ( at present , the annual inflation rate is nine percent and rising ) ; high - inflation countries tend to have overvalued currencies .
Second , the government ’s unwavering support for agriculture through severe import restrictions and for the fisheries through gratis allocation of valuable catch quotas ( although , by law , fish in Icelandic waters is a common property resource ) exerts a further upward pressure on the exchange rate .
The mechanism is straightforward : by restricting food imports , the government reduces the demand for foreign exchange and thereby also its price .
Likewise , by indirectly subsidizing the fisheries , the government reduces the price of foreign exchange that is consistent with adequate profitability of the fishing industry to the detriment of other export industries .
Third , as Figure 1 shows , Iceland ’s per capita GDP measured in dollars bypassed the US level in 2002 , and , in 2007 , surpassed it by a half , flying off the chart .
In this light , the depreciation of the króna in 2008 must be viewed as a welcome correction .
Will it fall farther ?
How far ?
How rapidly ?
That is , as always , impossible to know , except overshooting seems likely .
Rather than try to reverse the recent depreciation , the authorities need to address the underlying sources of the króna ’s chronic overvaluation over the years .
Figure 1 . Iceland vs. the United States : GDP per capita , 1975 - 2006
Figure 2 shows that the foreign short - term liabilities of the banking system are now fifteen times larger than the Central Bank ’s foreign reserves .
In view of the lessons learned from the Asian crisis of 1997 - 8 , this should not have been allowed to happen .
This is not hindsight .
The government and the Central Bank were warned , publicly and unambiguously , every step of the way .
Their line was that Iceland is not Thailand .
Now , as in 2006 , they are looking for ways to bolster the Central Bank ’s reserves – again , through foreign borrowing .
Figure 2 . Ratio of foreign short - term bank liabilities to Central Bank foreign reserves , 1989 - 2006
The banks need more competition
The sudden depreciation of the króna in 2008 and the current liquidity problems of the banks , evidenced by their recent sky - high credit default swap ratings , need to be viewed as two different issues even if the banks ’ reckless accumulation of short - term liabilities seems to have triggered the recent fall of the króna .
The need for depreciation is not new , even if it recently became acute .
It was only a question of time .
Therefore , unfounded rumours seem unlikely to have undermined the króna .
The problems of the banks , by contrast , are new .
The turbulence in world markets following the subprime loan crisis triggered the Icelandic event , but it would have occurred anyway .
There is no other way to read Figure 2 .
Several factors contributed to the current situation , including weak financial supervision that seemed caught by surprise when foreign confidence in the banks began to falter , policy mistakes made by a politically run Central Bank without sufficient credibility and power of persuasion , poor advice from international rating agencies , lax fiscal policies ill - suited to an inflationary environment , and the failure of the authorities to react in time to rapidly escalating debts .
They heard the warnings but chose not to heed them .
How the banks and their creditors will fare is impossible to know , but their debtors and depositors will almost surely suffer as the spread between lending and deposit rates rises in a domestic market that remains insulated from foreign competition .
This is how a bank crisis was concealed once before , without any official acknowledgement , at the time of the Nordic bank crisis in the early 1990s .
At that time , the Icelandic state banks wrote off bad loans on a scale that was comparable with Iceland ’s crisis - stricken Nordic neighbours – that is , relative to GDP .
And this is one of the many reasons why EU membership , including protection under the EU ’s competition policy , is important for Iceland .
Icelandic banks need competition at home as well as abroad where they offer their customers significantly better terms than they do in Iceland .
Will Iceland go under ?
No !
Do n’t get me wrong : Iceland ’s fundamentals are strong .
Since achieving Home Rule in 1904 , Iceland 's per capita GDP has increased by a factor of fifteen .
Today , Iceland ’s per capita GDP is roughly on par with Denmark , the old ruler , compared with a gap of about 50 percent in Denmark ’s favor in 1900 ( see my Vox column When Iceland Was Ghana ) .
True , Iceland ’s transformation was attained at the cost of high inflation over extended periods , the pileup of foreign debts , and rundown of fish stocks in Icelandic waters .
On the other hand , the education and culture of the population improved markedly over the years .
Hard work also helps explain Iceland ’s rapid growth .
Icelanders , like Americans , still must work much longer hours than most other OECD nations to maintain a high standard of life despite various homegrown inefficiencies in the structure and organisation of economic life .
EU membership would help reduce these inefficiencies .
Discuss amongst yourselves .
Wow , major loathing of ABC on the Web tonight .
ABC better cancel the welcoming ceremony , I see sniper fire …
TPM : Looking around other sites , I guess I ’m not the only one that thought this debate was unmitigated travesty .
Maybe the embargo on debate rebroadcast was a pro-human rights stand .
From FDL : Well , that was really , really horrible .
Charlie Gibson and Mr. Snuffalupagus fed Clinton and Obama nothing but gotcha questions .
Torture never came up , China never came up , unchecked executive power never came up , and it was 50 + minutes in before they asked any questions that could be considered remotely substantive or issues - based .
Atrios : Aside from the lack of policy questions , so far this “ debate ” has been played entirely on wingnut ground .
If BillO and Sean Hannity hosted it the questions would ’ve been the same .
In a general election debate it would make sense to get questions from the right like that , but in a democratic primary it ’s just fucking stupid .
DKos :
The questioning in tonight ’s debate– — mostly straight out of 1988 — was an abomination .
Gun control .
60 ’s radicalism .
Inflammatory black pastors .
Respecting or disrespecting the flag .
Taxes .
Being out of touch with the military .
Affirmative Action .
I ’ll bet if they had more time , ABC anchors Charles Gibson and George Stephanopolus would probably have gotten around to asking Obama and Clinton about Willie Horton and Piss Christ .
Editor & Publisher :
In perhaps the most embarrassing performance by the media in a major presidential debate in years , ABC News hosts Charles Gibson and George Stephanopolous focused mainly on trivial issues as Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama faced off in Philadelphia .
OpenLeft : Halfway through the debate , not a single question on any policy issue had been asked , it was obvious that this debate was prime - time hit job on Obama .
The questions so far have been why he does n’t wear a flag pin , whether or not his pastor loves America , why he can’t win , and how many people were offended by his bittergate comments .
Except for Clinton being asked about why she was n’t trustworthy , and both of them being asked about their vice - presidential choices , that has been the entire debate .
As Master Jack said in the comments , nothing on Iraq , nothing on the economy , nothing on health care , nothing on housing , nothing on global warming , nothing on torture .
This is nothing but a prime - time hit job on Democrats , although mainly a hit job on Obama .
Tapped : Seriously “ does rev. wright love america as much as you ? ”
Really ?
REALLY ?!!!
Also , “ what will you do when clips ” of Wright “ play over an over ” on TV ? […
A woman asks if Obama “ believes in the American flag ” because he does n’t wear a flag pin .
Charlie Gibson says that questions about the flag are “ all over the internet ” — along with Pamela Anderson ’s sex tape , cats with bad grammar , and Rick Astley .
Journalism at it ’s finest .
Huff Post :
Why in the world George Stephanopoulos felt compelled to ask Barack Obama if Reverend Wright “ loved America ” after he had already been made to give another recitation of his repudiation of Wright ’s remarks is a question that simply defies the imagination .
What sort of sensible answer can be given to that question ?
It would require astral projection to properly gauge another man ’s emotional state .
And if you want to ask Hillary Clinton to account for the odd contortions she advanced on the matter of her Bosnia recollections , just sack up and ask .
Do n’t hide behind the additional , pointless cruelty of a random voter ’s scoldings that Clinton lost their vote .
What a wholly superfluous pile on !
And the flag lapel pin question came with this admonishment from Charles Gibson : “ It keeps coming up , again and again . ”
Well , no shit , Charlie !
It keeps “ coming up , again and again ” because the media resolutely refuses to obtain the necessary courage to stop doing so .
Aaron Wider , CEO of HTFC , a mortgage broker implicated in the subprime meltdown and embroiled in a lawsuit with GMAC Bank , was fined $ 29,000 after he said " fuck " 73 times during his deposition .
The cowboyism of the subprime boom is only starting to come to light — guys like Wider were part of a movement of savage rapine of the world 's economies and exploitation of the poor and disenfranchised , something that went all the way up to the big trading houses and their regulators .

ON April 11 , French commandos went in with guns blazing and captured a gang of pirates who days earlier had hijacked a luxury cruise ship , the Ponant , and held the crew for ransom .
This was the French solution to a crime wave that has threatened international shipping off Somalia ; those of us who have been on the business end of a pirate ’s gun can only applaud their action .
The British government on the other hand , to the incredulity of many in the maritime industry , has taken a curiously pathetic approach to piracy .
While the French were flying six of the captured pirates to Paris to face trial , the British Foreign Office issued a directive to the once vaunted Royal Navy not to detain any pirates , because doing so could violate their human rights .
British warships patrolling the pirate - infested waters off Somalia were advised that captured pirates could claim asylum in Britain and that those who were returned to Somalia faced beheading for murder or a hand chopped off for theft under Islamic law .
A violation of human rights ?
In 2007 , 433 crew members were either taken hostage , assaulted , injured or killed by pirates .
Three seafarers are still missing and presumed dead .
According to the International Maritime Bureau , the anti-piracy watchdog of the International Chamber of Commerce , over the past 10 years 3,200 seafarers have been kidnapped , 500 injured and 160 killed .
Modern - day pirates are not like Errol Flynn or Johnny Depp swinging through the rigging , but well - armed militiamen equipped with rocket - propelled grenades , assault rifles , global positioning systems and high - speed motorboats who have long terrorized the shipping lanes in the Gulf of Aden and literally gotten away with murder .
During the week before the French raid , half the pirate attacks in the world occurred in the gulf , a strategic waterway that leads into the Red Sea and thus to the Suez Canal and Europe .
Two weeks before the attack on the Ponant , a huge crude - oil carrier  a monster of a ship as long as the Chrysler Building is tall  en route to the Middle East was attacked by pirates firing automatic weapons .
The vessel managed to flee .

On Sunday , Karl Rove gave students of spin a prime example of a non-denial denial .
He was a guest on ABC News ’
This Week and after discussing the presidential campaign , he was asked by host George Stephanopoulos about the Don Siegelman controversy .
Siegelman is the former Democratic Alabama governor who was convicted and imprisoned for corruption and who charges that the Justice Department prosecution against him was part of a secret campaign mounted by Rove and other Republicans .
Last week , the House judiciary committee subpoenaed Rove in connection with the Siegelman case and the firings of U.S. attorneys .
One has to wonder if Siegelman has been trying to save himself by pinning his case to the U.S. attorneys scandal , but the way Rove answered ( that is , did not answer ) a question from Stephanopoulos about the Siegelman affair was quite suspicious .
Look at the entire exchange :
GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS :
As we know and our viewers probably know you were subpoenaed this week by the House Judiciary Committee to give testimony on any involvement you may have had with the prosecution of the former Alabama governor , Don Siegelman .
He ’s claiming there was selective prosecution .
He ’s out on bail now even though he was convicted .
He said your fingerprints are all over it .
Here ’s what the House report said .
It said , “ In May 2007 a Republican attorney from Northern Alabama named Jill Simpson wrote an affidavit stating that in November 2002 she heard a prominent Alabama Republican operative named Bill Canary say that Karl Rove had contacted the Justice Department about bringing a prosecution of Don Siegelman .
The question for Mr. Rove is whether he directly or indirectly discussed the possibility of prosecuting Don Siegelman with either the Justice Department or Alabama Republicans . ”
Did you ?
KARL ROVE : Let me say three things , first of all , I think it ’s interesting — everybody who was supposedly on that telephone call that Miss Simpson talks about says the call never took place .
I ’d say …
STEPHANOPOULOS : Although she produced a cell phone record according to the committee .
ROVE : Well , I would say three things .
First of all , I have – I learned about Don Siegelman ’s prosecution by reading about it in the newspaper .
Second of all , this is really about a constitutional question of the separation of powers .
Congress , the House Judiciary Committee wants to be able to call presidential aides on its whim up to testify , violating the separation of powers , executive privilege has been asserted by the White House .
In a similar instance in the Senate .
It will probably be asserted very quickly in the House .
Third , the White House and — has agreed , I ’m not — I ’m not asserting any personal privilege .
The White House has offered , and my lawyers offered several different ways in which if the House wants to find out information about this they can find out information about this .
And they ’ve refused to avail themselves of those opportunities .
We did n’t say , close off any option to do anything else that you want to do in the future .
We said if you want to hear about this let ’s sit down and talk about this and then you ’re entitled to do what you want to do in the future .
This is now tied up in court .
It ’s going to be tied up in court and settled in court .
And frankly the House last week doing this is , you know , is duplicating what the Senate has done that has already found its way into the report .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
But to be clear you did not contact the Justice Department about this case ?
ROVE : I read about —
I ’m going to simply say what I ’ve said before , which is I found out about Don Siegelman ’s investigation and indictment by reading about it in the newspaper .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
But that ’s not a denial .
ROVE : I ’ve — you know , I read – I heard about it , read about it , learned about it for the first time by reading about it in the newspaper .
STEPHANOPOULOS : Mr. Rove , thanks very much .
It ’s pretty damn obvious :
Rove would not say , “ I did not contact the Justice Department about the Siegelman case . ”
Confronted with this simple question , he first said that others supposedly on that particular phone call have denied the call took place .
Pressed by Stephanopoulos , he then twice said that he learned about the Siegelman investigation and indictment from newspaper reports .
Why would Rove not state that he had not contacted the Justice Department and egged it on to prosecute Siegelman ?
Two explanations come to mind .
( A ) He did do something like that .
Or , ( B ) he does n’t remember whether he made such a call but he knows it ’s the type of call he might have made .
So rather than plainly deny he contacted the Justice Department , Rove parries the question with a shifty formulation .
Stephanopoulos did call him on this , noting Rove was not actually denying the accusation .
But Stephanopoulos was too polite to say , “ Excuse me , Mr. Rove , this is BS .
Did you or did you not communicate with the Justice Department at all about the Siegelman matter at any time ? ”
No doubt , though , the House judiciary committee ’s investigators paid close attention to how Rove handled the question , and his non-answer ought to motivate them to dig further .

The Pitch : A recent trend in fitness has been the emphasis on developing core strength .
A popular way of doing this is to perform exercise movements while balancing yourself on a ball , which forces various muscles to help stabilize you .
The Bender Ball is a tiny version of the bigger ball that you can already find a typical gym , and it apparently gives you ridiculous abs and a sports bra .

One concern is that you have to inflate the Bender Ball yourself with a straw .
As one reviewer writes , " It hard to get a firm ball . "
A truer statement , if spoken , would unleash the rapture .
How much a mother eats at the time of conception may influence whether she gives birth to a boy or a girl , a new report shows .
The report , from researchers at Oxford and the University of Exeter in England , is said to be the first evidence that a child ’s sex is associated with a mother ’s diet .
Although sex is genetically determined by whether sperm from the father supplies an X or Y chromosome , it appears that a mother ’s body can favor the successful development of a male or female embryo .
The study , published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B : Biological Sciences , shows a link between higher energy intake around the time of conception and the birth of sons .
The difference is not huge , but it may be enough to help explain the falling birthrate of boys in industrialized countries , including the United States and Britain .
The reason food intake may influence the development of one sex of infant rather than another is n’t fully understood .
However , in vitro fertilization studies show that high levels of glucose encourage the growth of male embryos while inhibiting female embryos .
It may be that male embryos are less viable in women who regularly limit food intake , such as skipping breakfast , which is known to depress glucose levels .
A low glucose level may be interpreted by the body as indicating poor environmental conditions and low food availability , the researchers said .
The findings are based on a study of 740 first - time pregnant mothers in Britain who did n’t know the sex of their fetus .
They provided records of their eating habits before and during the early stages of pregnancy , and researchers analyzed the data based on estimated calorie intake at the time of conception .
Among women who ate the most , 56 percent had sons , compared with 45 percent among women who ate the least .
As well as consuming more calories , women who had sons were more likely to have eaten a higher quantity and wider range of nutrients , including potassium , calcium and vitamins C , E and B12 .
There was also a strong correlation between women eating breakfast cereals and producing sons .
The data are limited by the fact that they are based on self - reported food intake , which can be unreliable .
However , the consistency of the trend offers an explanation for the small but consistent decline in the proportion of boys born in industrialized countries over the last 40 years , where even though women in general appear to be consuming more , eating habits have changed .
In the United States , for instance , the proportion of adults eating breakfast fell from 86 percent to 75 percent between 1965 and 1991 .
And although women may be eating more overall , a nutrient - poor diet could be less favorable to a male embryo .
Glucose levels may also fluctuate in women who are dieting and trying to lose weight prior to pregnancy .
In animals , more sons are produced when a mother ranks high in the group or has plentiful food resources .
VATICAN CITY ( Reuters ) - Islam has overtaken Roman Catholicism as the biggest single religious denomination in the world , the Vatican said on Sunday .
Monsignor Vittorio Formenti , who compiled the Vatican ’s newly - released 2008 yearbook of statistics , said Muslims made up 19.2 percent of the world ’s population and Catholics 17.4 percent .
“ For the first time in history we are no longer at the top : the Muslims have overtaken us , ” Formenti told Vatican newspaper L’Osservatore Romano in an interview , saying the data referred to 2006 .
He said that if all Christian groups were considered , including Orthodox churches , Anglicans and Protestants , then Christians made up 33 percent of the world ’s population -- or about 2 billion people .
The Vatican recently put the number of Catholics in the world at 1.13 billion people .
It did not provide a figure for Muslims , generally estimated at around 1.3 billion .
Formenti said that while the number of Catholics as a proportion of the world ’s population was fairly stable , the percentage of Muslims was growing because of higher birth rates .
He said the data on Muslim populations had been compiled by individual countries and then released by the United Nations , adding the Vatican could only vouch for its own statistics .
When security officials tried to enter , they came under fire from gunmen and a woman barricaded in the basement .
Three intelligence officials were killed in the ensuing battle .
The security forces finally set off explosives , which killed all those inside  two men , a woman and a child  Mr. Saleh said .
In addition to the militant Homayoun , the two other adults killed in the house were a married couple and were not Afghan , Mr. Saleh said .
He said he suspected that the child would have also been used in a suicide attack they were planning in Kabul .
The group had been armed with guns , rocket - propelled grenades , mines and suicide vests , he said .
Six others suspects were arrested in a village on the eastern edge of the capital , he said , adding that another raid in a suburb of eastern Kabul was under way .
Interior Minister Zarar Ahmad Muqbil said that his ministry had been watching a group of police officers suspected of involvement in the attack on the Serena Hotel and that they had been arrested .
Mr. Saleh said none of the suspects arrested were from the intelligence service .
The group members killed inside the house had been in telephone contact with people in Miram Shah , the capital of North Waziristan , as well as Bajaur , another tribal region of Pakistan , and with people in Peshawar , the capital of Pakistan ’s North - West Frontier Province .
They were using Pakistani subscriber identity module cards in their cellphones , Mr. Saleh said .
“ Some contacts were made back and forth , and we have some evidence that they were receiving orders from the other side of the border until the last moments , ” he said .
“ Whether these orders were given through the government of Pakistan , we have no evidence , ” he added .
On Monday , Mr. Saleh told Parliament that the group of three gunmen who fired on the parade just as Mr. Karzai was preparing to speak had also been in contact with a central base through text messages , and that they were being urged to carry out their task .

AOL - Time Warner ’s popular social networking website Propeller.com has banned submission of all Prison Planet.com material – citing Prison Planet ’s " inflammatory " articles about 9/11 as its justification .
We were alerted to the ban by a reader who attempted to submit one of our articles today and sent us the following screenshot .
However , Digg and other user - driven information websites like Wikipedia have consistently been caught letting organized armies of trolls " game " their content by voting down or outright deleting legitimate content in an organized manner .
Last year we exposed how perfectly factual , documented and legitimate Wikipedia content such as " Republican sex scandals " was being deep - sixed by an organized army of Neo - Con trolls who also make it their 24/7 mission to delete and unfairly edit content about questions surrounding 9/11 and smear members of the 9/11 truth movement .
Wikipedia also did nothing to prevent government agencies and large corporations literally craft their own reality by altering unfavorable information about themselves .
Digg was embroiled in a controversy last year when it emerged that a " bury brigade " had been afforded privileges over and above normal users to aggressively dictate content on the Digg website , including censoring Ron Paul stories – a ploy that completely contradicts Digg ’s claim that it is a " digital democracy " .
Under these circumstances , for Propeller.com to claim that alternative news content is being gamed is completely hypocritical .
Propeller.com is ranked at 2,334 by Alexa , putting it well behind Digg in popularity but still bigger than most news websites .
As its website states , Propeller.com is part of the AOL Network owned and operated by AOL LLC , a Time - Warner company .
Digg.com banned all Prison Planet material in late 2006 but were forced to withdraw the ban after an outcry .
AOL - Time Warner has previously shut down access to our websites for their Internet subscribers on a whim , claiming they were " hate material " but in most cases quickly restored them after receiving complaints .
We are encouraging readers to e mail Propeller.com ’s Director Tom Drapeau at [ email protected ] and politely remind him that censorship of a legitimate alternative news website that outranks most medium - sized newspapers in traffic is not a sensible policy .
In addition , if " inflammatory " news articles about September 11th are so offensive then why do the majority of Americans doubt the official 9/11 story ?
Of course , it ’s far likelier that our articles about 9/11 are offensive not to the majority of Propeller.com ’s readers , but to the corporate behemoth that is AOL - Time Warne

The US - China Economic and Security Review Commission ( USCC ) released a report to the United States Congress late last week accusing China of waging an " aggressive and large - scale industrial espionage campaign " against American technology .
The report attempts to turn the tale of industrial espionage into a national security threat by stating that " sophisticated weapon platforms are coming off production lines at an impressive pace and with impressive quality . "
It also urged Congress to protect " critical American computer networks and sensitive information " from Chinese cyber - attacks .
The report is not the first of its kind to come out of the USCC , which has been producing similar papers for over five years .
Back in 2006 , the USCC issued dire warnings about a government deal to purchase Lenovo ThinkPads , claiming that the Chinese - based company could be shipping the laptops with top - secret bugging devices .
The deal went through anyway , and so far , no bugs or backdoors have been found .
Concerns about Chinese espionage are hardly limited to the USCC or even to the United States : both the UK and German security agencies have been investigating alleged Chinese attempts to spy on government agencies by breaking into computer networks .
The Australian government is also concerned about Chinese espionage , after defector Chen Yonglin alleged that over 1,000 Chinese agents were active in that country .
Defector Chen meets the media .

Industrial espionage is as old as industry itself , and it should hardly be considered surprising that foreign companies and even governments try to steal the enemy 's secret sauce whenever they can .
Back in the dying days of the Cold War , IT administrator Clifford Stoll wrote a best - selling book about how he uncovered a KGB - backed plan to get East German hackers to steal the source code for Digital Equipment Corporation 's VMS operating system .
While their cunning plan failed , rival Data General was a little more successful : in The Soul of a New Machine author Tracy Kidder recalled how Data General engineer Tom West walked into DEC 's offices posing as a technician and proceeded to disassemble a brand - new VAX computer .
Somehow the world survived the threat of industrial espionage back then , but it 's a different world today , right ?
In some ways it is : our reliance on technology and networking , in both industry and the military , is higher now than it has ever been ( please do n't tell the Cylons ) .
However , the global economy is also far more connected than it has been in the past , and this changes the motivations for industrial nations wanting to go to war with one another .
In the past , Russian companies built sturdy but unimpressive Russian computers with Russian parts , and the Americans did all their manufacturing at home .
These days , the companies themselves are multinational entities , and simply move manufacturing to wherever will provide the highest profit margin .
These days , this means building computers in China , although any other country could be substituted should circumstances change and another nation 's manufacturing base prove more efficient .
Because of this interdependency , concerns about industrial espionage from China are difficult to assess .
Chinese companies hardly need to send out vast shadowy networks of spies across the globe to steal technological secrets when they already have the contracts to produce almost every electronic device being sold in the United States .
So far , no solid evidence has been produced linking the Chinese to military espionage , either ( but there have been plenty of accusations ) .
However , with Pentagon officials talking about the problem , we know we have n't heard that last of this .

April 24 , 2008 ( venezuelanalysis.com ) -- During the Fifth Iranian - Venezuelan Mixed Commission meeting in Caracas Wednesday , Venezuela and Iran signed 6 bilateral cooperation accords in the areas of industry , energy , agriculture , housing , infrastructure and physical education .
“ The alliances between Iran and Venezuela are to plant the seeds of a pluripolar world of the future , to establish its base and construct its pillars , ” Venezuelan Foreign Minister Nicolás Maduro declared .
Iranian Mining Industries Minister Ali Akbar Mehrabian commented , “ The freedom - seeking peoples are waking up in various parts of the world and they are witness to a very profound evolution in international relations . ”
Regarding industry , the two nations signed a knowledge sharing agreement to assist Venezuela in developing its mining industry in the south - central region known as the Apure - Orinoco axis .
A memorandum of understanding was also signed so that when the countries exchange machinery and other technology , they will exchange knowledge as well to ensure their autonomous use of the products .
The two countries also agreed to mutually promote sports and physical education by way of exchanges among specialists in the area , trainers , and sports medicine experts , and sharing experiences in the promotion of athletic activity .
A housing policy committee was formed in order to promote housing and urban development in both countries , including the construction of 15,000 homes in the Caracas community of Mariche as part of the new Misión Villanueva , named after a famous Venezuelan architect .
Along that line , the Venezuelan Housing Ministry and the Iranian Ministry of Industry and Mining agreed to increase the supply of cement and concrete for housing construction .
In addition , the countries confirmed their plans to create a series of mixed enterprises to produce tractors and other agricultural machinery in Venezuela and process prime materials such as aluminum .
Finally , Iran will assist Venezuela in augmenting its sugar production in a region of the state of Lara where 2,460 hectares ( 6075 acres ) of largely idle farmland were expropriated by the Venezuelan government two weeks ago for the purpose of increasing national food production .
“ This mixed commission is a good sign of what the alliance between Venezuela and Iran is all about , ” Maduro stated Wednesday , “ it is an alliance to construct peace , scientific and technological independence , as well as energy , food , and industrial development . ”
It was also proposed that Iran help member countries of the Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas ( ALBA ) produce tractors and promote agriculture based on the cooperation model it has constructed with Venezuela .
ALBA countries including Venezuela , Nicaragua , Bolivia , and Cuba created a $ 100 million dollar agricultural development fund Tuesday as a response to the world ’s food crisis .
But in the same three decades as Ulster 's " Troubles , " the hitherto moderate Muslim populations of south Asia were radicalized by a politicized form of Islam ; previously formally un-Islamic societies such as Nigeria became semi-Islamist ; and large Muslim populations settled in parts of Europe that had little or no experience of mass immigration .
On the Continent and elsewhere in the West , native populations are aging and fading and being supplanted remorselessly by a young Muslim demographic .
Time for the obligatory " of courses " : of course , not all Muslims are terrorists — though enough are hot for jihad to provide an impressive support network of mosques from Vienna to Stockholm to Toronto to Seattle .
Of course , not all Muslims support terrorists — though enough of them share their basic objectives ( the wish to live under Islamic law in Europe and North America ) to function wittingly or otherwise as the " good cop " end of an Islamic good cop / bad cop routine .
But , at the very minimum , this fast - moving demographic transformation provides a huge comfort zone for the jihad to move around in .
And in a more profound way it rationalizes what would otherwise be the nuttiness of the terrorists ' demands .
An IRA man blows up a pub in defiance of democratic reality — because he knows that at the ballot box the Ulster Loyalists win the elections and the Irish Republicans lose .
When a European jihadist blows something up , that 's not in defiance of democratic reality but merely a portent of democratic reality to come .
He 's jumping the gun , but in every respect things are moving his way .
You may vaguely remember seeing some flaming cars on the evening news toward the end of 2005 .
Something going on in France , apparently .
Something to do with — what 's the word ? — " youths . "
When I pointed out the media 's strange reluctance to use the M - word vis -à - vis the rioting " youths , " I received a ton of emails arguing there 's no Islamist component , they 're not the madrasa crowd , they may be Muslim but they 're secular and Westernized and into drugs and rap and meaningless sex with no emotional commitment , and rioting and looting and torching and trashing , just like any normal healthy Western teenagers .
These guys have economic concerns , it 's the lack of jobs , it 's conditions peculiar to France , etc .
As one correspondent wrote , " You right - wing shit - for - brains think everything 's about jihad . "
Actually , I do n't think everything 's about jihad .
But I do think , as I said , that a good 90 per cent of everything 's about demography .
Take that media characterization of those French rioters : " youths . "
What 's the salient point about youths ?
They 're youthful .
Very few octogenarians want to go torching Renaults every night .
It 's not easy lobbing a Molotov cocktail into a police station and then hobbling back with your walker across the street before the searing heat of the explosion melts your hip replacement .
Civil disobedience is a young man 's game .
In June 2006 , a 54 - year - old Flemish train conductor called Guido Demoor got on the Number 23 bus in Antwerp to go to work .
Six — what 's that word again ? — " youths " boarded the bus and commenced intimidating the other riders .
There were some 40 passengers aboard .
But the " youths " were youthful and the other passengers less so .
Nonetheless , Mr. Demoor asked the lads to cut it out and so they turned on him , thumping and kicking him .
Of those 40 other passengers , none intervened to help the man under attack .
Instead , at the next stop , 30 of the 40 scrammed , leaving Mr. Demoor to be beaten to death .
Three " youths " were arrested , and proved to be — quelle surprise ! — of Moroccan origin .
The ringleader escaped and , despite police assurances of complete confidentiality , of those 40 passengers only four came forward to speak to investigators .
" You see what happens if you intervene , " a fellow rail worker told the Belgian newspaper De Morgen .
" If Guido had not opened his mouth he would still be alive . "
No , he would n't .
He would be as dead as those 40 passengers are , as the Belgian state is , keeping his head down , trying not to make eye contact , cowering behind his newspaper in the corner seat and hoping just to be left alone .
What future in " their " country do Mr. Demoor 's two children have ?
My mother and grandparents came from Sint - Niklaas , a town I remember well from many childhood visits .
When we stayed with great - aunts and other relatives , the upstairs floors of the row houses had no bathrooms , just chamber pots .
My sister and I were left to mooch around cobbled streets with our little cousin for hours on end , wandering aimlessly past smoke - wreathed bars and cafes , occasionally buying frites with mayonnaise .
With hindsight it seemed as parochially Flemish as could be imagined .
Not anymore .
The week before Mr. Demoor was murdered in plain sight , bus drivers in Sint - Niklaas walked off the job to protest the thuggery of the — here it comes again — " youths . "
In little more than a generation , a town has been transformed .
Of the ethnic Belgian population , some 17 per cent are under 18 years old .
Of the country 's Turkish and Moroccan population , 35 per cent are under 18 years old .
The " youths " get ever more numerous , the non -youths get older .
To avoid the ruthless arithmetic posited by Benjamin Franklin , it is necessary for those " youths " to feel more Belgian .
Is that likely ?
Colonel Gadhafi does n't think so :
There are signs that Allah will grant Islam victory in Europe — without swords , without guns , without conquests .
The fifty million Muslims of Europe will turn it into a Muslim continent within a few decades .
On Sept. 11 , 2001 , the American mainland was attacked for the first time since the War of 1812 .
The perpetrators were foreign — Saudis and Egyptians .
Since 9/11 , Europe has seen the London Tube bombings , the French riots , Dutch murders of nationalist politicians .
The perpetrators are their own citizens — British subjects , citoyens de la République française .
In Linz , Austria , Muslims are demanding that all female teachers , believers or infidels , wear head scarves in class .
The Muslim Council of Britain wants Holocaust Day abolished because it focuses " only " on the Nazis ' ( alleged ) Holocaust of the Jews and not the Israelis ' ongoing Holocaust of the Palestinians .
How does the state react ?
In Seville , King Ferdinand III is no longer patron saint of the annual fiesta because his splendid record in fighting for Spanish independence from the Moors was felt to be insensitive to Muslims .
In London , a judge agreed to the removal of Jews and Hindus from a trial jury because the Muslim defendant 's counsel argued he could n't get a fair verdict from them .
The Church of England is considering removing St. George as the country 's patron saint on the grounds that , according to various Anglican clergy , he 's too " militaristic " and " offensive to Muslims . "
They wish to replace him with St. Alban , and replace St. George 's cross on the revamped Union Flag , which would instead show St. Alban 's cross as a thin yellow streak .
In a few years , as millions of Muslim teenagers are entering their voting booths , some European countries will not be living formally under sharia , but — as much as parts of Nigeria , they will have reached an accommodation with their radicalized Islamic compatriots , who like many intolerant types are expert at exploiting the " tolerance " of pluralist societies .
In other Continental countries , things are likely to play out in more traditional fashion , though without a significantly different ending .
Wherever one 's sympathies lie on Islam 's multiple battle fronts the fact is the jihad has held out a long time against very tough enemies .
If you 're not shy about taking on the Israelis and Russians , why would n't you fancy your chances against the Belgians and Spaniards ?
" We 're the ones who will change you , " the Norwegian imam Mullah Krekar told the Oslo newspaper Dagbladet in 2006 .
" Just look at the development within Europe , where the number of Muslims is expanding like mosquitoes .
Every Western woman in the EU is producing an average of 1.4 children .
Every Muslim woman in the same countries is producing 3.5 children . "
As he summed it up : " Our way of thinking will prove more powerful than yours . "
( CNN ) -- South Korea 's new president has pledged to donate his salary to the underprivileged .
South Korean leader Lee Myung - Bak says he would donate his salary to help the underprivileged .
Lee Myung - Bak made the pledge during an unscheduled meeting with reporters Sunday in the press room of his presidential office , the state news agency reported .
The president said he would donate his salary during his entire five - year term .
Lee is a former CEO of an engineering and construction company with a vast personal fortune .
As mayor of Seoul from 2002 to 2004 , Lee donated his salary to the children of street cleaners and firefighters .
" I promised to spend my whole salary earned as a public official on public welfare , " Lee told reporters .
" My plan to donate the presidential salary to the underprivileged is an extension of that promise . "
The news agency did not say how much the president earns in a year .
During the election campaign , Lee , 66 , vowed to donate his entire personal fortune of more than 30 billion won ( $ 30.2 million ) to the poor .
He said at the time he would keep only a retirement house in Seoul .

Inside Higher Edという高等教育関係者向けのサイトに掲載されている、ミズーリ理工大学の違法P2Pファイル共有対策がなかなか興味深い。
今現在もRIAAから大学に向けて大学キャンパスネットワーク内からの違法ファイル共有に対して、警告状が送付され続けている。大学側は様々な手を講じて、そうした警告状を送付させまいとしているが*1、いずれにしてもキャンパスネットワーク内からの違法ファイル共有が絶えることはない。
ミズーリ理工大学もまた、そうした大学の1つであった。先学期、同大学がレコード産業から受け取ったデジタルミレニアム著作権法に基づく著作権クレームは約200通であったという。
しかし、他の大学では依然としてそうした警告状が送付されている中、ミズーリ理工大学が今学期受け取った警告状はほんの8通にまで減少した。いかにして同大学は著作権侵害クレームを大幅に減少させることができたのだろうか。
同大学のシステムセキュリティアナリストのKarl F. Lutzenは、学生のネットワーク利用を管理する同大学の一風変わった方法を公開している。
ど のP2Pネットワークからファイルのダウンロード（またはアップロード）を行うためにも、学内から接続するすべてのユーザは、著作権侵害についてのオンラインクイズを答えなければならない
というものであるという。これは1度回答を済ませればよい、というものではなく、学内からP2Pネットワークに接続するごとに行わなければならない。たとえばどんな種類の作品が著作権で保護されているか、とか、CDをコピーすることと音楽をダウンロードすることに違いは何か、といった問題が出される。
そしてそのクイズに全問正解することで、6時間の間だけP2Pネットワークへのアクセスが可能となる。これは合法的なテレビ番組、音楽、電子ブックをダウンロードするためには十分な時間だろうと考えているようだ。こうしたP2Pの利用は、月に8回までと限定されており、休暇中でも最大で20回となっている。やはりその都度、このクイズに回答しなければならない*2。
これまでに見てきたP2P制限の中では最もユニークなものだなぁと思える。Lutzenはこのように述べている。
また、細かい点でも工夫が凝らされているようだ。Lutzenは学生には問題を暗記するという選択肢もあることを示唆しているが、問題の解答はしばしばアレンジされており、きちんと理解していないと解けないようになっている。
All of this comes against the backdrop of a troubling Congressional antiterrorism bill that also focuses on the Internet .
The Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act , which passed the House last year by a 404 - to - 6 vote , would establish a commission to study the terrorist threat and propose legislation .
The bill , which the Senate has not acted on , has a finding that the Internet promotes radicalization and terrorism .
Although the report by the homeland security committee stopped short of making recommendations for reining in online speech , it did ask “ what , if any , new laws ” were needed .
The answer is that no new laws are needed  or justifiable  any more than it would be tolerable to enact laws restricting speech over the telephone , in a newspaper or a book , on a street corner , or in a church , mosque or synagogue .
While it is fortunate that Mr. Lieberman does not have the power to tell YouTube that it must remove videos , it is profoundly disturbing that an influential senator would even consider telling a media company to shut down constitutionally protected speech .
The American Civil Liberties Union has warned that the “ Homegrown Terrorism ” bill and related efforts “ could be a precursor to proposals to censor and regulate speech on the Internet . ”
Not only do these efforts contradict fundamental American values , it is not clear if they would help fight terrorism .
Even if YouTube pulled down every video Mr. Lieberman did not like , radical groups could post the same videos on their own Web sites .
Trying to restrain the Internet is a game of “ whack - a - mole ” that cannot be won , says John Morris of the Center for Democracy and Technology .
Having the videos on YouTube may even be a good thing , because it makes it easier for law enforcement officials , the media and the public to monitor the groups and their messages .
Terrorism is a real concern .
All Americans know that .
They also know that if we give up our fundamental rights , the terrorists win .
If people use speech to engage in criminal acts , they should be prosecuted .
Cutting off free speech is never the right answer .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Eight of the 10 largest donors so far to the U.S. presidential campaigns are Wall Street banks , led by Goldman Sachs , according to research on Thursday from a political watchdog group .

Goldman and its executives have pumped $ 1.7 million into the races , with 70 percent going to Democrats Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton , despite former CEO Henry Paulson ’s present job as treasury secretary for the Republican Bush administration .
The Center for Responsive Politics said that securities and investment firms altogether have donated about $ 33 million to presidential campaign coffers , more than any other sector of corporate America , except lawyers , the center said .
After Goldman , top - giving banks are Citigroup , Morgan Stanley , Lehman Brothers , Merrill Lynch and JPMorgan Chase , which is buying troubled rival Bear Stearns in a government - engineered bailout .
As the housing market crisis spreads and the economy stumbles , traditionally Republican - leaning Wall Street banks , many hit hard by bad bets on high - risk mortgage debt , are scrambling to shore up their ties with Democrats .
Sixty percent or more of contributions coming from Citi , Morgan , Lehman , JPMorgan and UBS AG have gone to Democrats , while Republicans have been favored by donors at Merrill and Credit Suisse , the center said .
Obama , a senator from Illinois , has taken in $ 6.7 million from securities and investment firms , with New York Sen .
Clinton not far behind at $ 6.6 million , the center said in a report .
Arizona Sen . John McCain , the presumptive Republican nominee , has collected about $ 3 million from Wall Street .
Counting all sources of giving , Obama and Clinton have continued to raise more money in total than McCain , based on February fund - raising reports , the most recently available .
In that month , Obama collected $ 55.4 million ; Clinton , $ 34.5 million ; and McCain , $ 10.9 million , the center said , noting that the 2008 campaign will be the costliest ever .
“ Obama and Clinton continue to take turns collecting the most from the securities and investment industry , ” reflecting a pattern of the past few months , the center ’s report said .
So far in the 2008 presidential campaign , the largest donor of all is ActBlue , a political action committee that has channeled $ 2.4 million in mostly small contributions to Democrats exclusively , including Obama and Clinton .
Besides ActBlue and the banks , other top givers include the law firms DLA Piper , Skadden Arps and Greenberg Traurig , as well as corporate giants Microsoft Corp and General Electric .
More than 90 percent of gifts from media group Time Warner and its employees have gone to Democrats .
Another top giver , with donations so far of $ 569,000 , is National Amusements Inc , a privately held movie theaters chain controlled by media mogul Sumner Redstone and the parent company of both CBS Corp and Viacom Inc .
The University of California and Harvard University have also been among the 25 largest contributors , the center said .
Siege continues in Iraq as US escalates threats against Iran
By Joe Kay
26 April 2008
The United States military ’s brutal offensive in Sadr City continued this week , with overnight raids killing dozens of people , including many civilians .
The US offensive against the impoverished Baghdad neighborhood of 2 million people is entering its second month .
The direct target of US operations in Sadr City is the Mahdi Army militia led by Moqtada al - Sadr .
Sadr ’s followers are drawn from the largely working class Shiite population in Sadr City .
He also has substantial support in southern Iraq , including Basra .
The recent wave of violence in Iraq was triggered last month , when the Iraqi government of Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki launched an offensive , backed by the US , against Sadr ’s forces in Basra .
According to media reports , the US military killed at least 11 people in Sadr City on Thursday night , and wounded another 74 .
“ Criminals ” have replaced “ terrorists ” as the label affixed by the US military to those it has slaughtered , but many are ordinary civilians .
According to a report by Agence France - Presse ( AFP ) , a Sadr City medic “ said the dead included four old men , two women and a child ” and that women and children were among the wounded .
The US military is employing helicopters armed with Hellfire rocket missiles to terrorize the population of Sadr City and target anyone it claims may be preparing rockets or roadside bombs .
According to figures tabulated by AFP from reports by the Iraqi government and the US military , at least 383 people have been killed in Sadr City over the past month .
This figure , however , substantially underestimates the real death toll , since it is based only on official reports .
The International Committee of the Red Cross has reported that the main market in Sadr City has been severely damaged in the fighting , exacerbating food and water shortages .
Several hospitals have also run out of supplies while attempting to treat the wounded .
Concurrent with the siege on Sadr City , Bush administration and military officials are also escalating their threats against Iran .
On Friday , a ship contracted by the US military fired warning shots at what it said were Iranian boats in the Persian Gulf .
Iranian officials denied that any of its vessels were involved .
Referring to the claim that the boats were Iranian , a military official said , “ We do n’t have complete confirmation of that , but we suspect it . ”
The incident mirrors an earlier one in January involving US Navy ships near the Strait of Hormuz .
The military claimed then that two Iranian boats headed towards its ships , threatening to blow themselves up .
These claims were later debunked , but the incident was used to ratchet up pressure on Iran .
Earlier this month , a US coastal patrol ship fired a flare at an Iranian boat , and in December the USS Whidbey Island fired warning shots at another Iranian vessel .
The administration has also claimed that Iran is behind most of the attacks on US forces in Iraq , creating the pretext for some form of possible military action .
On Friday , Navy Admiral Michael Mullen , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , claimed at a press conference that the US had acquired evidence of weapons in Iraq that had been recently manufactured in Iran .
An article published in the Wall Street Journal on Friday reported , “ Officials in Washington and Baghdad said the purported Iranian mortars , rockets and explosives had date stamps indicating they were manufactured in the past two months .
The US plans to launch a public campaign over the alleged weapons caches in coming days .
A pair of senior commanders said a presentation was tentatively planned for Monday . ”
“ I believe recent events , especially the Basra operation , have revealed just how much and just how far Iran is reaching into Iraq to foment instability , ” Mullen declared .
“ Their support to criminal groups in the form of munitions and training , as well as other assistance they are providing and the attacks they are encouraging continues to kill coalition and Iraqi personnel . ”
The head of a military that has carried out a five - year occupation of Iraq , killing over 1 million people and turning 4 million into refugees , denounced Iran for continuing to “ meddle ” in the country .
Mullen said that the US was not planning a military operation in the immediate future , and that any such action would pose problems for the strained US military .
He said , however , “ It would be a mistake to think we are out of combat capacity . ”
He added , “ We have military options .
That kind of planning activity has been going on for a long time .
I think it will go on for some time into the future . ”
Mullen ’s press conference is only the latest in a series of provocative statements and actions directed against Iran .
On Wednesday , Defense Secretary Robert Gates said , “ What the Iranians are doing is killing American servicemen and women inside Iraq . ”
This month , Gates said for the first time that he thinks Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad knew about the alleged arms transfers .
Bush announced this week that he would nominate General David Petraeus to fill the position of head of US Central Command , which oversees US military operations throughout the Middle East and Central Asia .
Petraeus is currently the top commander in Iraq and is overseeing the US offensive in Sadr City .
If confirmed by the Democratic - controlled Congress — a virtual certainty — Petraeus will replace Admiral William Fallon , who announced his resignation last month after coming into conflict with the Bush administration over military policy , including in relation to Iran .
An Esquire magazine article published shortly before Fallon resigned stated that the admiral was the main obstacle to war against Iran .
Petraeus , on the other hand , has associated himself with the hard - line policy against Iran promoted within the administration .
In congressional testimony earlier this month , Petraeus said that he believed Iran was responsible for killing hundreds of American soldiers .
Petraeus also helped develop the theory of “ special groups ” operating in Iraq — a term invented to designate rogue factions within Sadr ’s militia who are supposedly taking orders from the Iranian government .
In his Congressional testimony , Petraeus said that the “ special groups ” “ pose the greatest long - term threat to the viability of a democratic Iraq . ”
The theory of the “ special groups ” has been developed to justify the contradictory character of US policy in Iraq .
Of the major Shiite organizations , the Sadr militia is the most distant from Iran , or at least from the principal organs of the Iranian government and military .
Sadr is traditionally associated with Iraqi nationalism rather than Shiite sectarianism .
In fact , Iran has supported the operations of the Iraqi government and US military in Basra .
The Iranian Foreign Minister Manuchehr Mottaki told a press conference this week , “ Weapons should be only in the hands of the Iraqi army , ” supporting the disarmament of the Sadr militia .
The Iranian government is more closely tied with the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq ( ISCI ) , which is itself closely integrated into the Maliki government and the Iraqi military .
The US is carrying out an offensive against Sadr ’s militia not because of ties with Iran , but because of its base among the more impoverished sections of the Shiite working class , which is deeply opposed to the US occupation and the selling off of the country ’s oil .
Following the operations in Basra , the Iraqi government has moved quickly to open up the region ’s oil and gas resources for exploitation by international companies .
At the same time , the US is seeking to undermine Iran as part of its overreaching plan to control the energy resources of the entire region .
For these reasons , American imperialism finds itself in the position of supporting Iranian - backed political factions in Iraq even as it beats the drums for war against Iran .
For his part , Sadr is caught between an increasingly restive popular base , furious over the offensive launched by the Iraqi government and the US military , and his own desire to reach some form of accommodation with this same Iraqi government and the US occupation .
Earlier this week , Sadr threatened “ open war ” against the US , but he has since backtracked .
On Friday , Sadr asked his followers to continue to observe a ceasefire .
Democrats and youth organizers have been crowing for four months about the record turnout among voters under 30 .
Despite that , voters over 60 are still a much more reliable voting bloc , and they do n't need to get a text message to remind them to go to the polls .
The over - 60 set has comprised at least a third of the voters in most of this year 's primaries , according to exit polls , and 40 percent or more in states such as Ohio , Massachusetts and California .
The percentage of the turnout of voters under 30 - while increasing since 2004 - has generally been half that of the older voter bloc .
" The battle over the senior vote will be one of the most intense in the fall because they do come out and vote , " said Lawrence Jacobs , director of the Center for the Study of Politics at the University of Minnesota , who has researched patterns among older voters .
" The new is always more interesting , and the new story is about the increase of younger voters , which is very impressive .
But any campaign that relies heavily on younger voters is running a risk , " Jacobs said .
" Younger voters are a difficult lover to have .
They 're a voting bloc that can betray you and is often quite whimsical .
The nastiness that occurs in a campaign is something that could turn young voters off . "
Young become disillusioned
When campaigns turn nasty - for example , the North Carolina Republican Party 's recent TV ad about Sen. Barack Obama 's former pastor , the Rev. Jeremiah Wright - young people can grow disillusioned with politics , analysts said .
Older voters , having seen negativity for decades , are n't as likely to not vote when a campaign 's tone gets harsh .
In a national survey of 514 GOP and independent voters released Thursday , 52 percent of Republicans said they felt irritated while viewing the anti-Obama North Carolina ad .
Regardless , 46 percent of Republicans felt it would help McCain 's chances in the general election compared to 37 percent of independents , according to the HCD Research survey .
To younger voters , " policy issues matter more than character , " said Karlo Barrios Marcelo , a researcher at CIRCLE , which analyzes youth voter trends .
" Young people , particularly college students , feel government is corrupt .
They 're tired of people not getting things done and government being so inefficient . "
Candidates value older voters because they show up and , because of their more secure finances , typically give more money to a campaign , said Scott Keeter , director of survey research at the Pew Research Center in Washington , D.C .
Younger people face more hurdles to voting than older people .
Under - 30 voters change addresses more often than seniors , so they need to more regularly update their registration information .
And college students often are residents of a state different from the one where they attend college , further complicating the ballot - punching process .
" This is not a shot at young people , " Keeter said .
" They just have n't developed the habits of voting yet . "
Analysts say the two ends of the age spectrum have different perspectives on the same issues .
While voters say the economy is their top issue , youth organizer Marcelo said that " to a younger person that means getting a job , while to an older person that may mean something else . "
To an older American , worries about the economy translate into disappearing pensions and lost home equity , said Drew Nannis , a spokesman for AARP , the 39 million - member national organization of Americans over 50 .
Later this spring , AARP will hold dozens of voter forums across the country to talk to older Americans about health care and financial security .
War more important to youth
The Iraq war is high on the agenda for young people , many of whom may know or be related to someone stationed overseas , Marcelo said .
While the older generation might oppose the direction of the war , neither Iraq nor the environment - also a favorite issue among younger voters - ranks high on their list of concerns .
For politicians , it is easier to pinpoint the issues of older Americans and to offer policy prescriptions that fit the problems , Nannis said .
" That can be harder to do with younger voters . "
Obama acknowledged this while campaigning in Indiana this week , saying he and his staff were looking at ways to reach out to older voters .
" Our problem has less to do with white working - class voters ; the problem , to the extent there is a problem , is with older voters , " Obama said after getting beaten in this week 's Pennsylvania Democratic primary .
He said he planned to focus more on older voter issues , such as prescription drugs , pension and retirement security .
So who will older voters support in November ?
Seniors favor Clinton
In a Pew Research survey taken last month , Obama ( 44 percent ) and McCain ( 45 percent ) were roughly even among voters over 65 .
But voters of that vintage vastly preferred Clinton ( 51 percent ) over McCain ( 40 percent ) , according to the survey .
However , Gary Langer , a pollster for ABC News , said Thursday that while age has been a dividing line among Democrats in the primaries , " it 's equally clear that socioeconomic status , as measured by education and income alike , is independently a factor , and a big one . "
Writing on his blog ( blogs.abcnews.com / thenumbers / 2008/04/is-it-age.html )
Thursday , Langer said that " among less well - off white seniors ( those with less than $ 50,000 in household incomes ) , Clinton has beaten Obama by 70 to 22 percent .
Among white seniors with more than $ 100,000 in household incomes , by contrast , Obama 's actually run ahead , by 50 to 45 percent . "
Despite the differences , those who study the young voter bloc are pleased that for the first time in recent memory , the candidates are not just paying attention to older voters .
Youth organizers sense the three campaigns are more willing to invest in young voters , even if they do n't have a long , steady history of voting .
" That 's been a worry in years past , " said youth researcher Marcelo .
" I think that people see there is so much ground to be gained in doing that .
" But , " Marcelo said , acknowledging the historical tendency of politicians to court older voters more than younger ones , " it 's always tough to think long term . "
Walter Bender , the One Laptop Per Child ( OLPC ) project 's former president of software , is launching a non-profit foundation that will continue development of OLPC's Sugar software platform .
The new organization , which is called Sugar Labs , will coordinate ongoing community - driven Sugar development and will assist hardware makers that want to ship the platform .
" This is a very exciting time in the development of software for children 's education , " Bender said in a statement .
" In the first generation of the Sugar UI , the free and open - source community has demonstrated an exceptional ability to create a platform that enables children to explore the world , share their discoveries and express themselves .
As a separate foundation , we will be able to advance Sugar 's development even further and make it available on multiple distributions and hardware platforms . "
OLPC , which develops low - cost mobile education computers for developing countries , is suffering from a divisive internal battle over the future of the project 's software platform .
The dispute compelled Bender and other key figures to depart from the project .
OLPC founder Nicholas Negroponte has recently announced plans to make Microsoft 's Windows XP operating system available on OLPC 's XO laptop , leading some to argue that education is no longer on the project 's agenda .
The Sugar software platform , which is built on top of Red Hat 's Linux stack , includes a unique and distinctive user interface that offers " activities " instead of programs and a chronological journal instead of a conventional filesystem interface .
Much of Sugar is written in the Python programming language which makes it easy to modify and extend .
The activities included with the system provide support for word processing , web browsing , and multimedia .
The system also includes an interactive Squeak - based programming environment that introduces young students to the basics of software development .
Sugar Labs intends to continue building and promoting the software and hopes that major hardware vendors will help it reach a broader audience .
Bender recently told BetaNews that Sugar Labs is having " informal discussions " with at least four laptop manufacturers .
In addition to collaborating with hardware vendors , Sugar Labs could also help schools and other education organizations install it on their existing Linux - compatible hardware .
The software is already available for several Linux distributions , including Ubuntu .
The future of the OLPC project is presently in doubt as a result of significant manufacturing and deployment problems .
The Sugar Labs strategy offers a more practical and realistic approach because it focuses largely on software and allows the hardware vendors to handle the production and deployment issues .
Sugar Labs still faces some challenges of its own , however , because many critics — including OLPC 's former security director — believe that the education theories behind Sugar are unproven .
Although Sugar Labs is a distinct and separate entity from OLPC with its own goals and priorities , the two projects are not competitors .
As long as OLPC remains committed to making Sugar available to laptop buyers , the two organizations will be able to benefit from each others ' work .
( Fortune Magazine ) --
My friend Dana , a former real estate investment banker who got out of investment banking comfortably before subprime mortgages hit the fan , has a personal inflation index .
It 's pegged entirely to the price of filet mignon at the Palm Too , his favorite steak house on the East Side of Manhattan .
If the filet mignon is reasonable , all is right with the world .
If it seems unduly expensive , Dana gets worried that inflation is spinning out of control .
So a couple of months ago he returned from a month in Paris to find that the price of pricey steak had jumped to $ 38 , up from $ 36 .
To hear him tell it , not since the Last Supper has an evening meal emanated so pervasive a sense of impending doom .
To be fair , Dana 's professional background lends itself to price scrutiny of nearly everything , and being able to afford high - end steak at all puts you in that segment of the population that is n't relying on inflation - sensitive Social Security checks .
But it 's a little frightening when a guy who just spent several weeks spending euros ( now 1.58 to the dollar and climbing ) comes back to New York , switches to dollars , and finds himself " aghast " that everything 's so expensive .
And Dana 's not alone .
A March CNN poll indicates that 91 % of the population is concerned about inflation .
I 'd ask a member of the remaining 9 % what they 're thinking - and what levels of relative fiscal comfort allow one not to be concerned about inflation - but I 'm entirely surrounded by 91 - percenters .
So how do we account for the discrepancy between the Federal Reserve 's recent assurances that inflation is under control and the 91 % of the population that 's worried it is n't ?
There are several possibilities :
The first is that we 're all paranoid .
We simply need reassurance from the authorities : Inflation rates are fine , nothing to see here , move along quietly .
The second is that the Fed 's insistence on focusing on " core " inflation - a measure that strips energy and food from the consumer price index ( CPI ) because they 're theoretically subject to short - term volatility - makes inflation seem smaller than it is , or than we feel it to be when our gallon of milk that was 12 % cheaper last year gets swiped across the grocery store scanner , beeping ominously like a tiny alarm bell .
( While core inflation was just 2.3 % in February , the CPI was 4 % . )
The third and most disconcerting possibility is that the CPI systemically understates inflation , in which case we 're paying for it taxwise , and the government is underpaying Social Security recipients .
In the words of many a UFO spotter , it is n't paranoia if they 're really out to get you .
The first possibility is not to be completely discounted .
Thanks to financial paranoia , Bear Stearns ( BSC , Fortune 500 ) found itself hemorrhaging cash a few weeks ago , prompting a rare but always terrifying run on the bank and the eventual sale of the firm at a price that led one anonymous observer to tape a $ 2 bill to the front door of Bear headquarters , a tongue - in - cheek bid for the remaining assets at a competitive rate .
And while merely thinking that inflation is going up is unlikely to cause it to do so , there are certainly real - world consequences from misplaced anxieties .
Consumer confidence is the first casualty .
When they think their money 's not going as far in the future , nervous consumers pull back spending .
But are nine out of ten of us really just paranoid ?
Or are we just irritated at the Fed 's insistence that if we hold still , interest - rate cuts wo n't hurt a bit , when historical experience tells us the resulting inflation will hurt like hell ?
If we focus on core inflation , we 're told , the underlying trends are n't so disturbing .
Take energy and food out of the basket of goods used to calculate the CPI , which is what the Fed does when it reports the numbers to Congress , and things do n't look so bad .
Just look at the spot on the wall , says the Fed , and ignore the giant needle .
It 's true that by focusing on core inflation we can detect certain underlying trends that may be masked by the price volatility of some of the goods in the CPI basket .
Post - Katrina natural - gas spikes , for instance , would have distorted long - term CPI trends , even though they were event - related outliers .
It makes sense to remove such rarities when looking for underlying patterns in the natural - gas market .
But does that mean the entire energy category should be removed ?
Food and energy are more subject to short - term price fluctuations , but not taking them into consideration at all when thinking about underlying trends precludes the possibility of significant long - term changes that are n't consistent with long - term trend lines for core goods and services .
The fact is , food and energy have been going up for quite a while .
At what point does a consistent trend upward stop being " price volatility " and start being a material " trend upward " ?
And what if some of those trends - particularly in the energy sector - are irreversible ?
As the usually grim - and - bearish Merrill Lynch ( MER , Fortune 500 ) economist David Rosenberg noted recently to the firm 's clients , we 've seen similar sustained increases in food and energy before .
In the mid-'70s .
Just before the Big Recession .
But they 're not materially important , says the Fed .
Pay no attention .
One of my favorite 91 - percenters , Fusion IQ's Barry Ritholtz , puts it amusingly : " If you take everything out of the CPI basket that 's going up in price , sure , you have no inflation ! "
Which is sort of like suggesting that if you take away insurgent fighting and the large U.S. military presence , there 's no war in Iraq .
Not that I want to give anyone in the Oval Office ideas for creative rhetorical devices .
But Ritholtz is more concerned about the third scenario , in which the CPI is n't accurate in the first place .
And the difference between the second and third scenario is the difference between miserable and horrible .
People like Ritholtz are thinking of the 1996 Boskin Commission , which was established to determine the accuracy of the CPI .
The commission concluded that the CPI overstated inflation by 1.1 % , and methodologies were adjusted to reflect that .
Critics of the Boskin Commission suggest that the basis upon which the CPI was revised does n't account for the way people actually purchase and consume products .
The commission pointed to four biases inherent in the way the CPI was determined that supposedly contribute to overstatement - among them , a bias that does n't take into account substitution of one good for another and a bias that fails to take into account increases in quality that are reflected in price increases .
But the Boskin critics note several reasonable exceptions to those biases .
The Boskin Commission suggests that when customers substitute one good for another , the CPI should treat those goods equally .
If Dana orders a hanger steak instead of his beloved filet mignon because the hanger steak is cheaper , Boskin argues that the hanger steak prices should be compared with previous filet mignon prices .
It 's all beef , right ?
But critics of the Boskin report point to areas where substitution is so price - driven that consumers are pushed out of the category altogether .
What happens when the consumer gives up steak entirely and switches to chicken ?
( Or to use a scarier example , goes from some health insurance to no health insurance ? )
Boskin also says that whatever you 're paying in price increases is offset by the additional pleasure you get from better goods .
To put it another way , you adjust for improvement in quality over time - a practice called hedonic pricing .
So , for example , energy price increases due to federally mandated environmental measures are offset by how much we all sit around enjoying the cleaner environment .
( And there 's a lot of sitting , because it 's not like we can afford to go anywhere anymore . )
But , as critics note , quality increases over time are also a reflection of the fact that increased production typically means lower prices , thanks to economies of scale .
This may be a matter of splitting methodological hairs , but if it is n't , aggressive estimates put the non-Boskinized actual inflation rate north of 7 % .
( The We 're All Gonna Die estimate is more like 10 % , but let 's not push it . )
Lest you worry about your future purchasing power , rest assured that your $ 600 Bush - administered tax rebate will be in the mail shortly , at which point you may be able to afford filet mignon at the Palm .
On the downside , it may cost $ 600 by the time you get that check .

C&L has been covering today 's testimony from General David Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker on Capitol Hill about the progress in Iraq .
As always , the best analysis of the day comes from Keith Olbermann on Countdown .

Keith spoke with former Director of the NSA retired Lt. General William Odom , who says that Petraeus & Crocker 's testimony did little more than confirm what he has believed all along -- that the situation in Iraq is actually worse than is being reported .
Odom praised members of the Senate who finally pushed back hard against the Bush / McCain surge propaganda , but scorned the media for failing to report the realities in Iraq .
9.1 Physical and virtual memory
Traditionally , one has physical memory , that is , memory that is actually present in the machine , and virtual memory , that is , address space .
Usually the virtual memory is much larger than the physical memory , and some hardware or software mechanism makes sure that a program can transparently use this much larger virtual space while in fact only the physical memory is available .
Nowadays things are reversed : on a Pentium II one can have 64 GB physical memory , while addresses have 32 bits , so that the virtual memory has a size of 4 GB .
We 'll have to wait for a 64 - bit architecture to get large amounts of virtual memory again .
The present situation on a Pentium with more than 4 GB is that using the PAE ( Physical Address Extension ) it is possible to place the addressable 4 GB anywhere in the available memory , but it is impossible to have access to more than 4 GB at once .
9.2 Kinds of memory
Kernel and user space work with virtual addresses ( also called linear addresses ) that are mapped to physical addresses by the memory management hardware .
This mapping is defined by page tables , set up by the operating system .
DMA devices use bus addresses .
On an i386 PC , bus addresses are the same as physical addresses , but other architectures may have special address mapping hardware to convert bus addresses to physical addresses .
Under Linux one has
#include < asm / io.h > phys_addr = virt_to_phys ( virt_addr ) ; virt_addr = phys_to_virt ( phys_addr ) ; bus_addr = virt_to_bus ( virt_addr ) ; virt_addr = bus_to_virt ( bus_addr ) ;
All this is about accessing ordinary memory .
There is also " shared memory " on the PCI or ISA bus .
It can be mapped inside a 32 - bit address space using ioremap ( ) , and then used via the readb ( ) , writeb ( ) ( etc. ) functions .
Life is complicated by the fact that there are various caches around , so that different ways to access the same physical address need not give the same result .
See asm /io.h and Documentation / {IO - mapping.txt , DMA-mapping.txt , DMA-API.txt} .
9.3 Kernel memory handling
Pages
The basic unit of memory is the page .
Nobody knows how large a page is ( that is why the Linux swapspace structure , with a signature at the end of a page , is so unfortunate ) , this is architecture - dependent , but typically PAGE_SIZE = 4096 .
( PAGE_SIZE equals 1 << PAGE_SHIFT , and PAGE_SHIFT is 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 on the various architectures ) .
If one is lucky , the getpagesize ( ) system call returns the page size .
Usually , the page size is determined by the hardware : the relation between virtual addresses and physical addresses is given by page tables , and when a virtual address is referenced that does not ( yet ) correspond to a physical address , a page fault occurs , and the operating system can take appropriate action .
Most hardware allows a very limited choice of page sizes .
( For example , a Pentium II knows about 4 KiB and 4MiB pages . )
Kernel memory allocation
Buddy system
The kernel uses a buddy system with power - of - two sizes .
For order 0 , 1 , 2 , ... , 9 it has lists of areas containing 2 ^order pages .
If a small area is needed and only a larger area is available , the larger area is split into two halves ( buddies ) , possibly repeatedly .
In this way the waste is at most 50 % .
Since 2.5.40 , the number of free areas of each order can be seen in / proc / buddyinfo .
When an area is freed , it is checked whether its buddy is free as well , and if so they are merged .
Read the code in mm/page_alloc.c .
get_free_page
The routine __get_free_page ( ) will give us a page .
The routine __get_free_pages ( ) will give a number of consecutive pages .
( A power of two , from 1 to 512 or so .
The above buddy system is used . )
kmalloc
The routine kmalloc( ) is good for an area of unknown , arbitrary , smallish length , in the range 32- 131072 ( more precisely : 1/128 of a page up to 32 pages ) , preferably below 4096 .
For the sizes , see < linux / kmalloc_sizes.h > .
Because of fragmentation , it will be difficult to get large consecutive areas from kmalloc ( ) .
These days kmalloc ( ) returns memory from one of a series of slab caches ( see below ) with names like " size - 32 " , ... , " size-131072 " .
Priority
Each of the above routines has a flags parameter ( a bit mask ) indicating what behaviour is allowed .
Deadlock is possible when , in order to free memory , some pages must be swapped out , or some I /O must be completed , and the driver needs memory for that .
This parameter also indicated where we want the memory ( below 16 M for ISA DMA , or ordinary memory , or high memory ) .
Finally , there is a bit specifying whether we would like a hot or a cold page ( that is , a page likely to be in the CPU cache , or a page not likely to be there ) .
If the page will be used by the CPU , a hot page will be faster .
If the page will be used for device DMA the CPU cache would be invalidated anyway , and a cold page does not waste precious cache contents .
Some common flag values ( see linux / gfp.h ) :
/* Zone modifiers in GFP_ZONEMASK ( see linux / mmzone.h - low four bits ) */ #define __GFP_DMA
0x01 /* Action modifiers - does n't change the zoning */ #define __GFP_WAIT 0x10 /* Can wait and reschedule ?
*/ #define __GFP_HIGH
0x20 /*
Should access emergency pools ?
*/ #define __GFP_IO 0x40 /*
Can start low memory physical IO ?
*/ #define __GFP_FS
0x100 /*
Can call down to low - level FS ? */ #define __GFP_COLD
0x200 /*
Cache - cold page required */ #define GFP_NOIO ( __GFP_WAIT ) #define GFP_NOFS ( __GFP_WAIT | __GFP_IO ) # define GFP_ATOMIC ( __GFP_HIGH ) # define GFP_USER ( __GFP_WAIT | __GFP_IO | __GFP_FS ) #define GFP_KERNEL ( __GFP_WAIT | __GFP_IO | __GFP_FS )
Uses :
GFP_KERNEL is the default flag .

vmalloc
The routine vmalloc ( ) has a similar purpose , but has a better chance of being able to return larger consecutive areas , and is more expensive .
It uses page table manipulation to create an area of memory that is consecutive in virtual memory , but not necessarily in physical memory .
Device I/ O to such an area is a bad idea .
It uses the above calls with GFP_KERNEL to get its memory , so can not be used in interrupt context .
bigphysarea
There is a patch around , the " bigphysarea patch " , allowing one to reserve a large area at boot time .
Some devices need a lot of room ( for video frame grabbing , scanned images , wavetable synthesis , etc. ) .
See , e.g. , video / zr36067.c .
The slab cache
The routine kmalloc is general purpose , and may waste up to 50 % space .
If certain size areas are needed very frequently , it makes sense to have separate pools for them .
For example , Linux has separate pools for inodes , dentries , buffer heads .
The pool is created using kmem_cache_create ( ) , and allocation is by kmem_cache_alloc ( ) .
The number of special purpose caches is increasing quickly .
I have here a 2.4.18 system with 63 slab caches , and a 2.5.56 one with 149 slab caches .
Probably this number should be reduced a bit again .
Statistics is found in / proc / slabinfo ( and here also statistics on the kmalloc caches is given ) .
From the man page :
% man 5 slabinfo ...
Frequently used objects in the Linux kernel ( buffer heads , inodes , dentries , etc. ) have their own cache .
The file / proc / slabinfo gives statistics .
For example : % cat / proc / slabinfo slabinfo - version : 1.1 kmem_cache 60 78 100 2 2 1 blkdev_requests 5120 5120 96 128 128 1 mnt_cache 20 40 96 1 1 1 inode_cache 7005 14792 480 1598 1849 1 dentry_cache 5469 5880 128 183 196 1 filp 726 760 96 19 19 1 buffer_head 67131 71240 96 1776 1781 1 vm_area_struct 1204 1652 64 23 28 1 ... size - 8192 1 17 8192 1 17 2 size-4096 41 73 4096 41 73 1 ...
For each slab cache , the cache name , the number of cur­ rently active objects , the total number of available objects , the size of each object in bytes , the number of pages with at least one active object , the total number of allocated pages , and the number of pages per slab are given .
The utility slabtop displays slab usage .
Question
One of the reasons given for a slab cache is that it will give areas of the precise required size , and thus reduce memory waste .
In the man page example above , look at how many pages are used for each slab cache , and how much space it would have cost to kmalloc ( ) everything .
Does the slab cache do better ?
Having a slab cache has some other advantages besides reducing waste .
Allocation and freeing is faster than with the buddy system .
There is an attempt at doing some cache colouring .
9.4 i386 addressing
Let us look at an explicit machine to see how addressing is done .
This is only a very brief description .
For all details , see some Intel manual .
( I have here 24547209.pdf , entitled IA - 32 Intel Architecture Software Developer 's Manual Volume 3 , with Chapter 3 : Protected Mode Memory Management .
It can be downloaded from developer.intel.com . )
Addressing goes in two stages : a logical address determined by segment and offset is translated into a linear address , and next the linear address is translated into a physical address .
Real mode assembler programmers may be familiar with the first stage : one has a 16 - bit segment register with value S and 16 - or 32 - bit offset O , that produce a 20 - or 32 - bit linear address A = 16 * S + O , and this is also the physical address .
There are six segment registers : CS , SS , DS , ES , FS , GS .
The first is used when instructions are fetched , the second for stack access , the third for data access , and override prefixes allow one to specify any of the six .
Segmentation
In protected mode one still has segmentation ( although most systems do not use it - the corresponding hardware is just wasted and present only for compatibility reasons ) , but one also has paging .
The paging is optional ( it can be enabled / disabled ) , but this unused segmentation is always present , and much more complicated than in real mode .
Instead of a single 16 - bit value , the segmentation register S is now a 13 - bit index I followed by the single bit value TI ( Table Index ) and the 2 - bit value RPL ( Requested Protection Level ) .
The bit TI selects one of two tables : the GDT ( Global Descriptor Table ) or the LDT ( Local Descriptor Table ) .
Each can have up to 8192 entries , and the 13 - bit index I selects an entry in one of these tables .
Such an entry is an 8 - byte struct that has a 32 - byte field base , and a 20 - byte field limit and several small fields .
Here base gives the start of the segment , and limit its length minus one .
One of the small fields is a 1 - bit value G ( Granularity ) .
If this is zero then limit is measured in bytes , if it is one then limit is measured in 4 KiB units .
Now that we have the base address B of the segment , add the 32 - bit offset O to obtain the linear address .
Paging
When paging is enabled ( as it is under Linux ) we are only halfway , and this useless segmentation stuff is followed by the extremely useful paging .
The linear address A is divided into three parts : a 10 - bit directory AD , a 10 - bit table AT and a 12 - bit offset AO .
The corresponding physical address is now found in four stages .
( i) The CR3 processor register points at the page directory .
( ii ) Index the page directory with AD to find a page table .
( iii ) Index the page table with AT to find the page .
( iv ) Index the page with AO to find the physical address .
Thus , the page directory is a table with up to 1024 entries .
Each of these entries points to a page table that itself has up to 1024 entries .
Each of these point to a page .
The entries in page directory and page table have 32 bits , but only the first 20 are needed for the address since by convention pages and page tables start at a 4 KiB boundary so that the last 12 address bits are zero .
In page directory and page table these last bits are used for bookkeeping purposes .
By far the most important bit is the " present " bit .
If the user program refers to a page that is not actually present ( according to this bit in the page table ) a page fault is generated , and the operating system might fetch the page , map it somewhere in memory , and continue the user program .
Apart from the " present " bit there is the " dirty " bit , that indicates whether the page was modified , the " accessed " bit , that indicates that the page was read , and permission bits .
The above was for 4 KiB pages .
There are also 4 MiB pages , where one indexing stage is absent and the offset part has 22 bits .
( With PAE one also has 2 MiB pages . )
For many pages of detail , see the Intel manuals .
Recently Mel Gorman released his thesis , a detailed description and commentary of the virtual memory management of Linux 2.4 .
9.6 Overcommit and OOM
Normally , a user - space program reserves ( virtual ) memory by calling malloc ( ) .
If the return value is NULL , the program knows that no more memory is available , and can do something appropriate .
Most programs will print an error message and exit , some first need to clean up lockfiles or so , and some smarter programs can do garbage collection , or adapt the computation to the amount of available memory .
This is life under Unix , and all is well .
Linux on the other hand is seriously broken .
It will by default answer " yes " to most requests for memory , in the hope that programs ask for more than they actually need .
If the hope is fulfilled Linux can run more programs in the same memory , or can run a program that requires more virtual memory than is available .
And if not then very bad things happen .
What happens is that the OOM killer ( OOM = out - of - memory ) is invoked , and it will select some process and kill it .
One holds long discussions about the choice of the victim .
Maybe not a root process , maybe not a process doing raw I/O , maybe not a process that has already spent weeks doing some computation .
And thus it can happen that one 's emacs is killed when someone else starts more stuff than the kernel can handle .
Ach .
Very , very primitive .
Of course , the very existence of an OOM killer is a bug .
A typical case : I do umount - a in a situation where 30000 filesystems are mounted .
Now umount runs out of memory and the kernel log reports
Sep 19 00:33:10 mette kernel : Out of Memory : Killed process 8631 ( xterm ) .
Sep 19 00:33:34 mette kernel : Out of Memory : Killed process 9154 ( xterm ) .
Sep 19 00:34:05 mette kernel : Out of Memory : Killed process 6840 ( xterm ) .
Sep 19 00:34:42 mette kernel : Out of Memory : Killed process 9066 ( xterm ) .
Sep 19 00:35:15 mette kernel : Out of Memory : Killed process 9269 ( xterm ) .
Sep 19 00:35:43 mette kernel : Out of Memory : Killed process 9351 ( xterm ) .
Sep 19 00:36:05 mette kernel : Out of Memory : Killed process 6752 ( xterm ) .

OK .
This is very bad .
People lose long - running processes , lose weeks of computation , just because the kernel is an optimist .
Demo program 1 : allocate memory without using it .
#include < stdio.h > # include < stdlib.h > int main ( void ) { int n = 0 ; while ( 1 ) { if ( malloc ( 1 < < 20 ) == NULL ) { printf ( " malloc failure after %d MiB
" , n ) ; return 0 ; } printf ( " got %d MiB
" , ++n ) ; } }
Demo program 2 : allocate memory and actually touch it all .
#include < stdio.h > # include < string.h> # include < stdlib.h > int main ( void ) { int n = 0 ; char * p ; while ( 1 ) { if ( ( p = malloc ( 1 < < 20 ) ) == NULL ) { printf ( " malloc failure after %d MiB
" , n ) ; return 0 ; } memset ( p , 0 , ( 1 < < 20 ) ) ; printf ( " got %d MiB
" , ++n ) ; } }
Demo program 3 : first allocate , and use later .
#include < stdio.h > # include < string.h > # include < stdlib.h > # define N 10000 int main ( void ) { int i , n = 0 ; char * pp [ N ] ; for ( n = 0 ; n < N ; n++) { pp [ n ] = malloc ( 1 < < 20 ) ; if ( pp [ n ] == NULL ) break ; } printf ( " malloc failure after %d MiB
" , n ) ; for ( i = 0 ; i < n ; i++ ) { memset ( pp[i ] , 0 , ( 1< < 20 ) ) ; printf ( " %d
" , i+1 ) ; } return 0 ; }

For example :
On an 8 MiB machine without swap running 1.2.11 :
demo1 : 274 MiB , demo2 : 4 MiB , demo3 : 270 / oom after 1 MiB : Killed .
demo1 : 274 MiB , demo2 : 4 MiB , demo3 : 270 / oom after 1 MiB : Idem , with 32 MiB swap :
demo1 : 1528 MiB , demo2 : 36 MiB , demo3 : 1528 / oom after 23 MiB : Killed .
demo1 : 1528 MiB , demo2 : 36 MiB , demo3 : 1528 / oom after 23 MiB : On a 32 MiB machine without swap running 2.0.34 :
demo1 : 1919 MiB , demo2 : 11 MiB , demo3 : 1919 / oom after 4 MiB : Bus error .
demo1 : 1919 MiB , demo2 : 11 MiB , demo3 : 1919 / oom after 4 MiB : Idem , with 62 MiB swap :
demo1 : 1919 MiB , demo2 : 81 MiB , demo3 : 1919 / oom after 74 MiB : The machine hangs .
After several seconds :
Out of memory for bash .
Out of memory for crond .
Bus error .
demo1 : 1919 MiB , demo2 : 81 MiB , demo3 : 1919 / oom after 74 MiB : The machine hangs .
After several seconds :
On a 256 MiB machine without swap running 2.6.8.1 :
demo1 : 2933 MiB , demo2 : after 98 MiB : Killed .
Also : Out of Memory : Killed process 17384 ( java_vm ) .
demo3 : 2933 / oom after 135 MiB : Killed .
demo1 : 2933 MiB , demo2 : after 98 MiB : Also : demo3 : 2933 / oom after 135 MiB : Idem , with 539 MiB swap :
demo1 : 2933 MiB , demo2 : after 635 MiB : Killed .
demo3 : oom after 624 MiB : Killed .
Other kernels have other strategies .
Sometimes processes get a segfault when accessing memory that the kernel is unable to provide , sometimes they are killed , sometimes other processes are killed , sometimes the kernel hangs .
Turning off overcommit
Going in the wrong direction
Since 2.1.27 there are a sysctl VM_OVERCOMMIT_MEMORY and proc file / proc / sys / vm / overcommit_memory with values 1 : do overcommit , and 0 ( default ) : do n't .
Unfortunately , this does not allow you to tell the kernel to be more careful , it only allows you to tell the kernel to be less careful .
With overcommit_memory set to 1 every malloc ( ) will succeed .
When set to 0 the old heuristics are used , the kernel still overcommits .
Going in the right direction
Since 2.5.30 the values are : 0 ( default ) : as before : guess about how much overcommitment is reasonable , 1 : never refuse any malloc ( ) , 2 : be precise about the overcommit - never commit a virtual address space larger than swap space plus a fraction overcommit_ratio of the physical memory .
Here / proc / sys /vm/overcommit_ratio ( by default 50 ) is another user - settable parameter .
It is possible to set overcommit_ratio to values larger than 100 .
( See also Documentation / vm / overcommit - accounting . )
After
# echo 2 > / proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory
However , without swap , no more processes could be started - already more than half of the memory was committed .
After
# echo 80 > / proc/sys/vm/overcommit_ratio
One can view the currently committed amount of memory in / proc / meminfo , in the field Committed_AS .
9.7 Stack overflow
Processes use memory on the stack and on the heap .
Heap memory is provided by malloc ( ) or the underlying mechanisms .
The stack grows until it no longer can , and the process is hit by a SIGSEGV signal , a segmentation violation ( because of the access of a location just beyond the end of the stack ) , and is killed .
Sometimes people quote this as a phenomenon roughly similar to OOM .
But this is very different .
The OOM killer will kill some random process , say rpm or syslog , because the system is short on memory , and the programmer is unable to do anything about it .
A stack overflow happens because of something the program does itself , and if necessary the programmer can do something .
Each process has a soft and a hard limit on the stack size .
The soft limit can be changed , but must stay below the hard limit .
The hard limit can be decreased , but can be increased only by root .
% ulimit -s unlimited % ulimit -s 10 % ls Segmentation fault % ulimit -s 100 - bash : ulimit : stack size : cannot modify limit : Operation not permitted % su Segmentation fault :-)
/* getstklim.c */ #include < stdio.h > # include < sys/resource .h> int main ( ) { struct rlimit rlim ; if ( getrlimit ( RLIMIT_STACK , &rlim ) ) return 1 ; printf ( " stack size : current %ld max : %ld
" , rlim.rlim_cur , rlim.rlim_max ) ; return 0 ; }
ulimit
% ulimit -s 8192 % ./ getstklim stack size : current 8388608 max : - 1 % ulimit -s 100 % ./ getstklim stack size : current 102400 max : 102400 % su # ulimit -s unlimited # ./ getstklim stack size : current - 1 max : - 1
. profile
It is not common to worry about stack overflow , and sometimes one can compromise the security of a system by starting a setuid binary with low resource limits :
% ulimit -s 15 ; mount Segmentation fault % ulimit -s 10 ; mount Killed
But a programmer can catch signals and do something about the SIGSEGV .
( This was even the technique the Bourne shell used for memory management : do n't use malloc but just store stuff in the data area past the end of what was used before .
If that gives a SIGSEGV , then extend the data area in the signal handler and return from the signal handler .
Unfortunately , as it turned out , this would not correctly restart the faulting instruction on all architectures . )
A simple demo that catches SIGSEGV :
#include < stdio.h > # include < stdlib.h > # include < signal.h > void segfault ( int dummy ) { printf ( " Help !
" ) ; exit ( 1 ) ; } int main ( ) { int * p = 0 ; signal ( SIGSEGV , segfault ) ; *p = 17 ; return 0 ; }
exit ( )
This simple demo fails to catch stack overflow , because there is no stack space for a call frame for the segfault ( ) interrupt handler .
If it is desired to catch stack overflow one first must set up an alternative stack .
As follows :
... int main ( ) { char myaltstack [ SIGSTKSZ ] ; struct sigaction act ; stack_t ss ; ss.ss_sp = myaltstack ; ss.ss_size = sizeof ( myaltstack ) ; ss.ss_flags = 0 ; if ( sigaltstack ( &ss , NULL ) ) errexit ( " sigaltstack failed " ) ; act.sa_handler = segfault ; act.sa_flags = SA_ONSTACK ; if ( sigaction ( SIGSEGV , &act , NULL ) ) errexit ( " sigaction failed " ) ; ...

The morning after , the Clinton crew was unbowed .
As Hillary Clinton on Tuesday night was being creamed by Barack Obama in North Carolina and eking out a narrow victory in Indiana , pundits throughout Cable News Land were pronouncing her dead , dead , dead .
Tim Russert said the race was over .
But when a reporter on the campaign ’s morning conference call , asked Howard Wolfson , Clinton ’s communications director , if there had been “ any discussions about not going forward , ” he said , “ No discussions . ”
And he seemed to mean it .
On the call , Wolfson , deputy communications director Phil Singer , and chief strategist Geoff Garin were forward - looking .
They claimed to be “ happy ” about the 1.8 - percent win in Indiana–but without sounding at all jubilant about the squeaker .
As for North Carolina–where she lost by 14 points –they claimed “ progress ” there and pointed to the fact that she beat Obama among white voters by 24 points ( as if the increasing racial polarization within the Democratic primary electorate is something to celebrate ) .
They acknowledged that Clinton had in recent weeks loaned her campaign nearly $ 6.5 million–and claimed it was a sign of her commitment to moving ahead and , of course , fighting for real people .
They repeated the campaign ’s call to seat the disputed delegations of Florida and Michigan , and they indicated they were ready to rumble in the upcoming primaries .
Voters in those states , Garin said , should be given the ability “ to express their voice . ”
He added , “ All we are doing is suggesting the process ought to play out . ”
In other words , damn the pundits , full speed ahead .
It appeared that Clinton–faced with three alternatives : fighting on as if nothing has changed , dropping out , or planning a graceful exit strategy –has for the time being settled on option one .
But the voyage got a lot rockier after Indiana and North Carolina .
As the cable news analysts pointed out , it is now practically a mathematical certainty that Obama will end the primaries next month with a lead in pledged delegates and the popular vote , even if the results in Florida and Michigan are included .
So Clinton has run out of metrics .
The days of fuzzy math are over .
There will be no measure by which she will be able to argue she is the voters ’ choice .
All the campaign is left with is an opinion : Clinton can do better than Obama against John McCain in the fall .
Clinton and her lieutenants do have stats to cite , notably her performance among working - class voters ( meaning , white working - class voters ) .
She has demonstrated , Wolfson maintained on the call , “ a proven ability ” to win over these voters , while Obama has not .
This is , he added , “ the crux of the argument ” that the Clinton campaign will be making to the superdelegates .
And in the next primary states –West Virginia ( May 13 ) , Kentucky ( May 20 ) , Oregon ( May 20 ) –Clinton will try to show once more that she fares better among lunch - pail Democrats .
So now Clinton , who passionately insists that democracy demands that the Florida and Michigan contest be counted and that voters in the last few states be granted the opportunity to state their preferences , is left with nothing but the most elitist of strategies : she must convince party insiders –the 300 or so not - yet - committed superdelegates –to vote against the popular will of the voters who participated in the Democratic primaries and caucuses .
On the conference call , I asked Garin whether his campaign is essentially stuck with a “ nullification strategy . ”
He disputed his campaign ’s game plan was anything like a “ nullification strategy . ”
All delegates–pledged delegates and superdelegates –have “ equal moral weight in the process , ” he said , and the rules of the party “ anticipate there will be delegates ” who will make “ good faith decisions . ”
That is so .
But for Clinton to win , these superdelegates will have to say that they know better than the voters .
It is certainly permissible under Democratic Party rules .
But might such an action blow apart the party ?
There is no way for the Clinton campaign to orchestrate this strategy politely or calmly and wrap it up quickly after the primaries conclude on June 3 .
After all , no superdelegate commitment is solid until he or she actually votes at the convention .
Even if Clinton is able to sway enough superdelegates and win the necessary number of commitments , Obama will not fold his tent and accept this as a deal done .
He would fight for those superdelegates and , if need be , fight the process .
There would be a bloody battle from early June until the first ballot at the convention in late August .
Nullification cannot be accomplished neatly .
Clinton and her crew must realize that .
I asked Garin if he foresaw any problem if the candidate with the most pledged delegates and the most popular votes was not chosen at the convention .
“ When we get to June 3 , we ’ll have a very close result , ” he said .
“ This might raise the question of how close is close . ”
He did n’t answer the question .
Right now , the Clintonites are saying they ’re not bailing .
But in for a penny , in for a pound .
The only way she can triumph is by first persuading superdelegates to vote against the wishes of primary voters and caucus - goers and by then mounting an ugly fight that will last for months until the convention–a fight that would likely create consequences that would resonate far beyond the convention .
It may be full speed ahead for Clinton and her gang , but that ’s only because her finger is on the button and she is considering pushing it .

Free March Madness Picks
One thing we love about sports is championship games .
The one game that separates champ form chump .
We love the story lines going into the game , the pageantry and drama that are decided on the field .
And at the end of it there is only one champion .
What could be better than that ?
How about an entire month devoted to just championship games ?
That 's what we get each year during March Madness , aka The Big Dance , aka the NCAA Basketball Championship tournament .
It has gotten so big that over the course of the month , employers lose more hair than at any other time during the year .
Why ?
All of their employees are consumed with constantly updating their brackets that no real work actually gets done !
Making Your Own March Madness Picks
What makes this time of the year even more exciting is that we can put down a few dollars and make our own picks for March Madness .
With so many games , we can do pretty well if we make the right NCAA tournament predictions .
According to a USA / Today article that was published last year , betting on the Betting on the NCAA tournament has now surpassed the Super Bowl for the biggest betting event .
It makes sense , as there are 67 games in the tournament compared to just one Super Bowl .
The first four days of the Big Dance alone see over $ 90 million in bets processed and the betting just continues all the way through to the exciting Final Four and into the NCAA National Championship .
Now that 's a lot of scratch !
The tournament started way back in 1939 with just eight teams , and has since expanded to 68 of the nation 's best college basketball teams .
With all those teams and all of those games , how do us regular Joes stand a chance at winning a few bucks ?
Get Expert Picks

You see , there is method to the " Madness , " and I can help you make heads and tails out of it all to ensure you get the best March Madness spread picks and straight - up picks .
The tournament starts out with 68 teams , but 31 of those teams won their right by winning their respective conference tournaments .
These are the teams at the head of the class – the elite .
The other spots in the tournament are saved for teams that are awarded bids by the selection committee .
Right off the bat , we can exploit a big selection committee .
Right off the bat , we can exploit a big difference in talent coming into the tournament .
But , let 's not get bogged down , we can save my " Bracketology " for later .
The point is that I can help guide you through the field of teams to come out ahead of the game and get paid .

JAMES CITY – James City County police officers used a Taser gun on a 24 - year - old autistic Williamsburg man Thursday after police said he became unruly with employees at Wilson ’s Leather at the Prime Outlets - Williamsburg shopping mall .
Police responded to the store on Richmond Road around 2 p.m. after employees reported that the man had become argumentative during a dispute over a returned item , according to police spokesman Mike Spearman .
The man , whom Spearman called “ large in stature , ” became combative with police and refused to leave the store .
Officers incapacitated him with a single shot from the Taser , placed him under arrest and charged him with trespassing and resisting arrest , both Class 1 misdemeanors .
Police only learned the man suffered from Asperger ’s syndrome , a mild form of autism , after he had been placed under arrest , Spearman said .

Unwanted programs that , once installed , bombard users with unwanted adverts .
Often those pushing the aware programs get paid for every machine they manage to recruit .
Some adware poses as fake computer security software .
Can be very hard to remove .
BLACKHAT
A hacker that uses his or her skills for explicitly criminal or malicious ends .
Has been used to mean the writers of destructive viruses or those that use attacks to knock websites offline .
Now as likely to refer to those that steal credit card numbers and banking data with viruses or by phishing .

The name given to an individual computer in a larger botnet and which is more than likely a home PC running Windows .
The name is an abbreviation of " robot " to imply that it is under someone else 's control .
BOTNET
A large number of hijacked computers under the remote control of a single person via net - based command and control system .
The machines are often recruited via a virus that travels via e-mail but increasingly drive - by downloads and worms are also used to find and recruit victims .
The biggest botnets can have tens of thousands of hijacked computers in them .
Research suggests they can be hired from as little as 4 cents per machine .
BOTNET HERDER
One of the names for the controller or operator of a botnet .
BULLET -PROOF HOSTING
A company that guarantees that its servers will not be shut down even when the request to do so comes from law enforcement agencies .
These hosting companies are often located off - shore or in nations where computer crime laws are lax or non-existent and where extradition requests will not be honoured .
CARDER
Someone who steals or trades exclusively in stolen credit card numbers and their associated information .
CASH-OUT
A euphemism that means to steal money from a bank account or credit card to which someone has gained illegal access .
Hackers who grab credit card data often do not possess the skills or contacts to launder the money they can steal this way .
CHANNEL
A virtual " room " on the IRC text chat system .
Most channels are usually dedicated to a single topic .
CROSS - SITE SCRIPTING
A sophisticated phishing attack that exploits weaknesses in the legitimate sites of financial institutions to make attempts to trick people into handing over confidential details more plausible .
A successful use of Cross - site scripting will make it look like all the transactions are being done on the website of the real bank or financial institution .
DEAD -DROP
A hijacked PC or server used to store all the personal data stolen by keyloggers , spyware or viruses .
Criminal hackers prefer to keep their distance from this data as its possession is incriminating .
Dead drops are usually found and shut down within a few days of the associated phishing e-mails being sent out .
DDoS
Abbreviation for Distributed Denial of Service .
This is an attack in which thousands of separate computers , which are usually part of a botnet , bombard a target with bogus data to knock it off the net .
DDoS attacks have been used by extortionists who threaten to knock a site offline unless a hefty ransom is paid .
DRIVE-BY DOWNLOAD
Malicious programs that automatically install when a potential victim visits a booby - trapped website .
The vast majority exploit vulnerabilities in Microsoft 's Internet Explorer browser to install themselves .
Sometimes it is obvious that a drive - by download has occurred as they can lead to bookmarks and start pages of the browser being replaced .
Others install unwanted toolbars .
Increasingly criminals are using drive - bys to install keyloggers that steal login and password information .
EXPLOIT
A bug or vulnerability in software that malicious hackers use to compromise a computer or network .
Exploit code is the snippet of programming that actually does the work of penetrating via this loophole .
FIREWALL
Either a program or a feature built into hardware and which sits between a computer and the internet .
Its job is to filter incoming and outbound traffic .
Firewalls stop net - borne attacks such as worms reaching your PC .
HONEYPOT
An individual computer or a network of machines set up to look like a poorly protected system but which records every attempt , successful or otherwise , to compromise it .
Often the first hints of a new rash of malicious programs comes from the evidence collected by honeypots .
Now cyber criminals are tuning their malware to spot when it has compromised a honeypot and to leave without taking over .

IP stands for Internet Protocol and the technical specification defines how this numerical system works .
IRC
Abbreviation for Internet Relay Chat - one of the net 's hugely popular text chat systems .
The technology is also used by botnet herders to keep tabs on and control their flock of machines .
KEYLOGGER
Program installed on a victim 's machine that records every keystroke that a user makes .
These tools can obviously be very useful for stealing login and password details .
However , the data that is stolen often has to be heavily processed to make it intelligible and to extract names and numbers .
MALWARE
Portmanteau term for all malicious software covers any unwanted program that makes its way on to a computer .
Derived from Malicious software .
MAN-IN -THE-MIDDLE
A sophisticated attack in which a criminal hacker intercepts traffic sent between a victim 's computer and the website of the organisation , usually a financial institution , that they are using .
Used to lend credibility to attacks or simply steal information about online accounts .
Can be useful to defeat security measures that rely on more than just passwords to grant entry to an account .
PACKET SNIFFING
The practice of examining the individual packages of data received by a computer to find out more about what the machine is being used for .
Often login names and passwords are sent in plain text within data packets and can easily be extracted .
PHISHING
The practice of sending out e-mail messages that look as if they come from a financial institution and which seek to trick people into handing over confidential details .
Often they direct people to another website that looks like that of the bank or financial institution the e-mail purports to have come from .
Anyone handing over details could rapidly have their account plundered .
PORT
The virtual door that net - capable programs open to identify where the data they request from the net should be directed once it reaches a computer .
Web browsing traffic typically passes through port 80 , e-mail through port 25 .
ROOTS
A slang term for networks that have been hacked into by criminal hackers .
Derives from the deep , or root , access that system administrators typically enjoy on a network or computer .
The login details to get root access are often sold to spammers and phishing gangs who then use these networks to send out millions of e-mail messages .
SCRIPT KIDDIE
An unskilled hacker who originates nothing but simply steals code , techniques and attack methods from others .
Many viruses and worms on the web today are simply patched together from other bits of code that malicious hackers share .
SPYWARE
Malicious program that , once installed on a target machine , steals personal and confidential information .
Distinct from adware .
Spyware can be contracted many different ways .
Increasingly it arrives on a PC via a web download .
Often uses a keylogger to grab information .
Some are now starting to record mouse movements in a bid to foil the latest security measures .
Some fake security programs pose as spyware cleaners .
TCP
Abbreviation for Transmission Control Protocol - the series of specifications which define the format of data packets sent across the internet .
TROJAN
Like the wooden horse of legend this is a type of program or message that looks benign but conceals a malicious payload .
Many of the attachments on virus - bearing e-mail messages carry trojans .
VIRUS
A malicious program - usually one that requires action to successfully infect a victim .
For instance - the malicious programs inside e-mail attachments usually only strike if the recipient opens them .
Increasingly the word is used as a portmanteau term for all malicious programs - those that users must set off or those that find their own way around the net .
WHITEHAT
A hacker that uses his or her skills for positive ends and often to thwart malicious hackers .
Many whitehat security professionals spend their time looking for and closing the bugs in code that blackhats are keen to exploit .
WORM
Self - propelled malicious program that scours the web seeking new victims - in the past this has been used to distinguish it from a virus that requires user action to compromise a machine .
Worms can infect and take over computers without any help , bar lax security , from a victim .
ZERO DAY
A Zero day vulnerability is one on which code to exploit it appears on the first day that a loophole is announced .
As most of the damage done by exploiting bugs occurs in the first few days after they become public , software firms usually move quickly to patch zero day vulnerabilities .
ZOMBIE
Another name for a hijacked computer that is a member of a botnet .
The news of Microsoft ’s 40 billion offer to buy Yahoo astounded me .
( CNN ) Almost in a daze I listened to it again and again on one media outlet after another .
All reported the same story : Google is gobbling up the lucrative Internet advertising market and Microsoft wants a share .
I ’ve seen some bad business moves — Time Warner ’s purchase of AOL for example .
But this one tops the charts .
Not only will it fail .
It will fail spectacularly .
Microsoft has had a remarkably successful run selling software .
I use this term rather loosely since much of the software it sold is operating system code .
Selling “ code ” may be a better term .
Excluding a few minor ( and late ) exceptions — such as the Xbox–Microsoft made its fortune selling code .
In the early days selling code worked well .
In fact , it was the only model around and it still works well in niche markets .
In the 80’s anything computer related was by modern standards a niche market .
Microsoft focused on owning the largest of these niches and rode those markets to stardom .
Microsoft still thinks in terms of owning software market space .
Even worse , Microsoft seems to think that everyone else thinks that way too .
This is where Microsoft comes into direct ideological conflict with Yahoo and Google .
Yahoo and Google do not sell software .
They sell advertising .
Yahoo and Google do n’t act like software companies .
They do n’t think like software companies .
Because — they are n’t software companies !
They are advertising companies .
Microsoft does n’t understand the advertising business .
Most people do n’t .
Although it ’s a very simple business .
Definition : Advertising is the art of consistently drawing lots of attention .
That ’s it .
Find a way to consistently draw attention and you have created advertising space .
If you do n’t believe me — think about the Super Bowl .
It is the king of advertising .
Why ?
It gets LOTS of ATTENTION .
World class sports and world class entertainment rolled up into one massive show available for — you guess it — FREE .
Google has been winning the war on Internet advertising war because it ’s really good at getting lots of attention .
In addition to providing the best search engine on earth Google has found another way to get lots of attention :
Offer free software services .
People flock to Google services by the millions .
Google does n’t really care about the “ code markets ” it ’s poaching .
It does n’t even think in terms of “ code markets ” .
Google is just looking for “ cheap ” attention — and it ’s getting it .
The fact they have eaten up some of Microsoft ’s “ code markets ” is mostly an accidental byproduct of their business plan .
Yahoo is very similar to Google , just less successful .
In order for Yahoo to regain momentum it must capture advertising space ( i.e. get and hold attention ) quickly .
That will come in direct conflict with the existing Microsoft for - sale software model .
Microsoft will never let Yahoo poach any of their “ code markets ” until those products are no longer producing significant revenue .
By that time Google will have poached all the useful advertising space and moved on .
A merge with Microsoft is the death - knell to Yahoo ’s ability to compete with Google .
On the other side , Microsoft gains very littel from Yahoo .
An advertising company has very little in common with a niche software company .
It can do nothing to defend it from Google .
Microsoft may gain something in intelectual property and people , but certainly those things can be aquired much more cheaply from small startup firms .
Ultimately , the main problem with the Yahoo acquisition is it will distract Microsoft from what it really should be doing — abandoning declining niches ( like OS and Office Products ) and moving into new niche space .
The purchase of the ProClarity business intelligence suite was an excellent start down that road .
Microsoft needs to build on those kind of small purchases .
I predict that if Microsoft goes through with the Yahoo purchase it will find itself caught between being yesterday ’s niche software player and tomorrow ’s advertising company and will fail at both .
Disclosure : I do not own any positions in either Microsoft , Yahoo or Google .

Following up on my post from a little while back discussing Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnell ’s desire to police the Internet , the Washington Post ’s Ellen Nakashima confirmed last weekend that the Decider had signed a classified directive authorizing the NSA to more expansively monitor intrusions on federal networks for signs of cyberattacks :
Until now , the government ’s efforts to protect itself from cyber- attacks — which run the gamut from hackers to organized crime to foreign governments trying to steal sensitive data — have been piecemeal .
Under the new initiative , a task force headed by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence ( ODNI ) will coordinate efforts to identify the source of cyber - attacks against government computer systems .
As part of that effort , the Department of Homeland Security will work to protect the systems and the Pentagon will devise strategies for counterattacks against the intruders .
As Brian has said recently , the U.S. is absolutely not ready to handle cyberwar on almost any front .
I ’m all in favor of redirecting tax money towards protecting and strengthening our Internet infrastructure against any one of the millions of crippling threats it can face , rather than expensive , crappy weapons systems that have little measurable effect except fattening defense contractors ’ coffers .
But in an expansive profile of Mike McConnell , the New Yorker ’s Lawrence Wright touches on the myriad obstacles our intelligence community faces towards handling a real threat , and why they get it wrong so often :
To call the disparate intelligence bureaucracies a community suggests that they share a collegial spirit , but throughout their history these organizations have been brutally competitive , undermining one another and even hoarding vital information .
Since the establishment of the C.I.A. , in 1947 , the fractious intelligence community has botched many of the major tasks assigned to it .
Its failures include the Bay of Pigs invasion , the unforeseen collapse of the Soviet Union , the inability to prevent the September 11th attacks , and the catastrophic assessment that Iraq , under Saddam Hussein , possessed weapons of mass destruction .
The intelligence culture , like any other corporatized , hierarchical , top - down system , is hobbled by its own evolution .
Territorial turf wars , emphasis on CYA over doing the job , antiquated technology and lack of resources to pay for it , and a thick blanket of paranoia and mistrust that suffuses the field at every level not only prevents agencies from being able to do their jobs effectively , but often redirects them into much more malignant and sinister ends–like the NSA ’s illegal wiretapping program .
From Wright ’s article :
The changes to FISA that McConnell proposed were minor , in his view .
â€ œThree things we wanted , â€  he told me , in characteristic bulletin language .
â€ œFirst , we had to have a situation where it doesnâ€™t require us to get a warrant for a foreign person in a foreign country .
Second point , we need the coÃ¶peration of the private sector .
The private sector is being sued for allegedly coÃ¶perating with the government .â€ 
He was referring to reports that , even before 9/11 , many of Americaâ€™s major telecommunications companies had diverted virtually all records of telephone and e-mail traffic from their routers into N.S.A. data banks , where it could be stored and examined .
McConnell wanted liability protection not only for the companiesâ€™ future coÃ¶peration but for their past actions as well ; however , he agreed to take the issue of retroactive immunity off the table if Congress would reconsider the matter after its recess .
Of course , this did n’t happen , and we ’re now in a brutal Congressional stalemate between the White House , who wants permanent immunity for the telecoms and expansive new surveillance powers , and the Dems in Congress who refuse to let lawbreaking companies get away with it .
McConnell , as I ’ve said before , is a big fan of private - sector cooperation on surveillance matters .
He acknowledges in Wright ’s article that the massive , bureaucratic intelligence community can’t move or innovate fast enough to perform the kind of vast tracking he wants for the Internet .
So , how will he accomplish this ?
Here ’s a hint .
The battle over telecom immunity is n’t just important for what these companies and their pals in government have done , but for what they will do .
No matter how vital the need for a stronger policing of the Internet against cyberterrorism is–and it is vital –that can’t come at the hands of an Administration and its operatives who have repeatedly and willfully disregarded the law and civil rights to achieve their objectives , and rapacious private interests who want to use these technologies as stepping stones to their goal of a much more controlled Internet –with their hands on the dial .
That ’s why nothing like this can happen under Bush ’s reign without the most stringent accountability and strong oversight .
He simply cannot be trusted , and those who work for him and want to enact these goals have to be viewed with extreme skepticism .
Otherwise we may find that our innocuous e-mails and blog posts are getting swept up in a vast vacuum of data mining , while real terrorist threats go unnoticed until it ’s too late .

Years ago , Maryland geek Chris Clark bought the web domain pizza.com for around $ 20 .
Eschewing many lowball offers , he just sat on the domain , where it became one of those omnipresent ' parked ' sites that relay a message such as " find out everything about pizza " along with ' get a new mortgage , ' ' get a trip to vegas ' , etc .
He just closed the sale for the name for $ 2.6 million .
on top of March 's sale of fund.com for $ 10 million .

GAZA ( Reuters ) - Israeli forces killed 17 Palestinians , most of them civilians including a Reuters cameraman , in the Hamas - controlled Gaza Strip on Wednesday , medical officials and witnesses said .
The attacks came after three Israeli troops died in a Hamas ambush near a border fuel pipeline .
But despite the bloodiest day ’s toll in more than a month , Israel allowed European - funded fuel into Gaza to keep its only power plant operational .
“ The fuel has started to go through , ” said the European Union official , referring to the Nahal Oz terminal , close to the scene of clashes in which the three soldiers died .
Seventeen Palestinians , at least 11 of them civilians , were killed in Israeli assaults , Hamas and medical officials said .
The dead included Fadel Shana , 23 , a Reuters cameraman who was felled while trying to film in central Gaza .
Footage from Shana ’s camera showed an Israeli tank firing a shell in his direction from several hundred meters ( yards ) away .
An Israeli military source did not immediately address the cause of Shana ’s killing , telling Reuters only that the area saw “ ongoing fighting ” and was therefore dangerous for journalists .
At least three youths , a 67 - year - old man , and four Hamas gunmen were also among the Palestinian dead .
Signaling escalation , Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri said his group ’s armed wing were authorized to “ strike the Zionist enemy everywhere ” .
The Western - backed administration of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas , who lost Gaza to Hamas last June , censured the Israeli attacks but made clear peace talks would stay on track .
Abbas ’s prime minister , Salam Fayyad , told reporters that the negotiations were meant to stop Israel ’s “ incursions , siege and daily killing ” .
FUEL LIMITS
Nahal
Oz was shut down by Israel on April 9 after militants killed two Israeli civilians at the facility .
Israel ’s Defence Ministry had said it would reopen the pipeline on Wednesday , but the latest attack had raised doubts fuel would flow again soon .
Kanan Abaid , deputy chairman of the Palestinian Energy Authority in the Gaza Strip , said before pumping resumed that the power plant only had enough fuel to operate until Saturday .
The EU official said the goal was to provide “ as much ( fuel ) as can be possibly pumped today ” because the army had yet to tell the Europeans whether they would be allowed to make further deliveries to the plant on Thursday and Friday .

The plant supplies power mainly to residents of Gaza City and its surrounding areas , home to 800,000 people .
A strike by Gaza petrol station owners has been preventing distribution of limited Israeli supplies of gasoline and diesel to the general public .
Israeli officials accuse Hamas of preventing distribution of petrol and diesel in order to create a crisis to pressure Israel to ease a blockade it tightened after the Islamists took over .
Slideshow ( 5 images )
In a development likely to stoke further anger in Israel , Hamas said former U.S. President Jimmy Carter , who planned to travel later in the day to Egypt , would meet in Cairo with two of its Gaza - based leaders , Mahmoud al - Zahar and Saeed Seyam .
“ Mr. Carter asked for the meeting .
He wanted to hear the Hamas vision regarding the situation , and we are interested in clarifying our position and emphasizing the rights of our people , ” Hamas official Ayman Taha said .
Carter ’s delegation in Israel declined to comment .
Zahar , speaking in Gaza before leaving for Egypt , said Carter had been able “ to break all the restrictions preventing him from meeting Hamas leaders ” .
Israeli leaders have shunned Carter over his contacts with Hamas , which has rejected Western demands to recognize Israel , renounce violence and accept existing Israeli - Palestinian interim peace deals .
Carter , who began a Middle East visit on Sunday , said in Arab East Jerusalem it would be counterproductive to exclude Hamas completely from “ conversations or consultations ” .
More than 200 people died in a previous outbreak in Kikwit
Five people are confirmed to have died from the virus , but at least 166 people have died in total in the area and WHO says it is aware of 206 more cases .
International agencies are moving quickly to try to contain the outbreak .
Ebola is highly contagious .
People contracting the disease suffer severe stomach pain and internal bleeding .
' Ebola kits '
Medecins sans Frontieres has reinforced its medical personnel and has flown three tonnes of supplies to the provincial capital Kananga , to be distributed in the affected areas .
The supplies include tents and plastic sheeting to build isolation facilities .
Medicines , water and sanitation materials are also being sent .
" Ebola kits " have been provided for the medical teams - they include protective gloves , boots and uniforms which are designed to be destroyed after use .
Local health authorities are helping to disinfect contaminated areas .
The fatality rate for Ebola , which has no known cure , is as high as 90 % .
Specialist laboratories in Gabon and Atlanta in the US confirmed Ebola from blood samples , saying they also showed the presence of Shigella dysentery - which is hampering efforts to identify Ebola victims .
WHO has also requested additional support from the global outbreak alert and response network , and says specialised laboratories in Gabon , Canada and the US will share the analysis .
They say there could be a " possible concurrent outbreak of another etiology " .
Quarantine
It is three months since people started falling sick from a mystery virus in several villages around Kananga , the capital of West Kasai region .
Several villages are under quarantine , but WHO says so far there is no need for any further restrictions on travel or trade with DR Congo .
The incident is the worst for several years and is likely to have serious consequences for some time to come - even if the spread has been contained .
It is thought to be transmitted through the consumption of infected bush meat and can also be spread by contact with the blood secretions of infected people .
DR Congo's last major Ebola outbreak killed more than 200 people in 1995 in Kikwit , about 400 km ( 250 miles ) west of the current outbreak .
The last major incidence of the disease was in Uganda in 2001 when more than 400 cases were reported and more than half of the patients died .
Uganda has issued a red alert to border posts neighbouring the DR Congo and has instructed staff at Entebbe international airport to be on the lookout for passengers who show symptoms of fever .
“ with the proverbial sweat of his brow ( and my mother ’s ) , he pulled himself up … ”

When Catherine McGuigan began digging an extension in her cottage , she thought she had budgeted for every contingency .
But she could not have prepared for what would emerge after workmen found ten skeletons buried under her dining room .
And now Miss McGuigan , 42 , faces a £ 30,000 bill to give them another resting place .

Respect : Burial laws mean the skulls and skeletons have to be disposed of with respect
The gruesome episode began three weeks ago when she found her five builders white as sheets and hugging mugs of tea .
" It was like something out of a horror movie , " said Miss McGuigan , who has a son , Cameron , ten , and lived in the cottage for 11 years .
" The men said they had found what they thought was an old pipe but when they pulled it out of the ground they realised it was bone .
Shocked : Catherine McGuigan outside her home
" Then they looked down and there in the earth was a skull and the rest of the skeleton . "
Miss McGuigan , who had moved out of the cottage during the building work , called police and within minutes her cottage was cordoned off for a forensic search of the hole beneath her dining room .
To her relief , the remains turned out to be over 100 years old and the police did not need to get involved .
But within days of restarting work , another skeleton was found .
Since then eight more have been recovered .
" It 's been heart - breaking and now I can hardly bear to go to the house .
" Some skeletons are just a few bones but others have been dug up intact actually still in their coffins . "
And it is thought up to 40 more bodies could be buried at the cottage in Potters Bar , Hertfordshire – on the site of Quaker burial ground from the 1700s .
And as no one else will take responsibility for the bodies , their disposal has been left to Miss McGuigan .
" I am staggered that the local council wrote to me saying whilst I did not need a licence to exhume the bodies - because it is not a registered burial site - they still expected me to " show respect " for the dead , " she explained .
" And the Quakers have also advised I must cremate them .
" It appears I could simply throw the remains away but I 'm concerned there could be legal repercussions I do n't know about .
" Anyway , my conscience means I could n't live with myself in the cottage if I did that . "

Coffins :
The home is a burial site for a Quaker community in the 1700s
The Ministry of Justice , the Government body that has responsibility for burial law and practice , told her it was an offence to " offer indignities to the remains of the dead " and warned of health and safety rules .
Miss McGuigan has now ordered coffins from an undertaker and is looking into arrangements for a mass cremation or a burial in a nearby field .
" The undertaker has quoted me £ 800 per body , " she says .
" When it was just a couple of bodies this was fine .
But now I am very concerned that if , as expected , I find 40 bodies , I could be facing a bill of some £ 32,000 . "
However the IT specialist plans to carry on with her £ 150,000 extension , which includes a gym and cinema .
" It 's been a very happy home and I 've done too much work to stop now , " she says .
Research at a local library has revealed the cottage was built over an old Quaker meeting house .
Because the worshippers were non-conformists they were not allowed to bury their dead in church graveyards , so they used the garden instead .
And while the discovery of the burial ground might put the faint - hearted off her cottage , Miss McGuigan says her son has no such qualms .
" I feared Cameron would no longer want to live here , " she said .
" But thankfully he thinks finding skeletons in our dining room is " cool " and quite exciting ! "
CRAWFORD , Texas ( AP )  President Bush on Monday signed a bill aimed at giving the public and the media greater access to information about what the government is doing .
The new law toughens the Freedom of Information Act , the first such makeover to the signature public - access law in a decade .
It amounts to a congressional pushback against the Bush administration 's movement to greater secrecy since the terrorist attacks of 2001 .
Bush signed the bill without comment in one of his final decisions of the year .
The legislation creates a system for the media and public to track the status of their FOIA requests .
It establishes a hotline service for all federal agencies to deal with problems and an ombudsman to provide an alternative to litigation in disclosure disputes .
The law also restores a presumption of a standard that orders government agencies to release information on request unless there is a finding that disclosure could do harm .
Agencies would be required to meet a 20 - day deadline for responding to FOIA requests .
Non-proprietary information held by government contractors also would be subject to the law .
The legislation is aimed at reversing an order by former Attorney General John Ashcroft after the 9/11 attacks in which he instructed agencies to lean against releasing information when there was uncertainty about how doing so would affect national security .
Dozens of media outlets , including The Associated Press , supported the legislation .
Last year , the government received 21.4 million requests for information under the 40 - year - old law , according to statistics provided by the Justice Department .
The government processed nearly the same number of requests , which was almost 1.5 million more than processed during the previous fiscal year , according to the department .

You probably have a list of questions you 'd ask your boss if given the chance .
" You really paid someone for that haircut ? "
" Must your lunch always include garlic ? "
" How did someone as nice as you end up marrying someone so unpleasant ? "
If you have any desire to keep your job , you 'll keep those questions to yourself .
Unfortunately employees have a tendency to keep all questions to themselves , even when speaking up can help their careers .
" Workers choose silence over dialogue because they worry about damaging credibility , fear retaliation from key decision makers or doubt their voice will make a difference .
And when employees choose silence , progress suffers , " says Kerry Patterson , co-author of " Crucial Conversations . "
Whether you keep quiet because you 're afraid of embarrassing yourself or you do n't think your questions mean much , you should start speaking up .
" A colleague once said to me , ' I can tell more about a person by the questions they ask than by what they tell me , ' " says Edith Onderick - Harvey , president of Change Dynamics Consulting , an executive consulting firm .
" The same is true for managers .
Questions about the broader organization 's goals and priorities , your role in achieving those and asking for feedback tell your boss you are focused on a career with the organization , not just a job . "
Here are nine questions to ask your boss that can help your career .
( Just do n't ask them all at once -- your boss is probably a busy person . )
" How do you measure success ? "
Employees often forget that their performances are graded in some form or another .
In order to understand how your work is quantified , you should be speaking the same language as your boss .
Find out if your manager is only concerned with numbers and results or if with how you achieve them also matters , Onderick - Harvey advises .
Then , you base your future work on his or her priorities .
" What areas do I need to develop to advance my career ? "
This question shows your boss you are in control of your future and are not waiting for someone else to make things happen , Onderick - Harvey says .
If you can articulate what your career goals are , your boss can tell you what experience you need to gain before you can move up the ladder .
" What strengths do I have that will help my career ? "
Do n't be so focused on looking for your weaknesses that you forget to ask about your strong points .
You might think you know what your strengths and weaknesses are , but your boss could have a different opinion .
This question is n't an excuse to beg for a compliment ; it 's an opportunity to show the boss you want to steer your own career , Onderick - Harvey says .
" How often are performance evaluations conducted and who is in charge of them ? "
Basic questions such as this one are crucial to your performance , says Dr. Ivonne Chirino - Klevans , professor at Walden University .
Understanding the mechanics of your job should be a top priority at all times .
Make sure you know if you have quarterly or annual goals to aim for and how they impact your daily tasks .
" What are the options for growth within the organization ? "
Although you might expect this question only belongs in a job interview , it 's worth asking even after you 've been employed for a few years , Chirino says .
Company structures change all the time and you should know what opportunities are open to you if you want to advance .
Once you know what your options are , you can decide what your next move is , whether it 's aiming for a new position or looking for a job with a better future .
" Do I understand this correctly ? "
When you have a project that has many components or a new set of guidelines , be certain you have a grasp on what your task is .
Tackling an assignment without knowing you 're on the right path leaves the opportunity for a rude awakening on the due date .
Check in with your boss to ensure you understand everything the way he or she intends it .
If you do n't ask the right questions , you could derail your own career even though you 're fully capable of doing the work , Chirino warns .
Caution :
Use restraint when asking this question .
No boss wants to repeat himself or herself ad nauseam .
" What can I do to help you ? "
This simple question is important but often forgotten , according to executive coach Suzanne Bates .
Even if you can't help , your boss will take note of your offer .
" It 's lonely at the top , so if your boss sees you as someone who wants them to succeed , you stand out . "
" What is the most important priority we need to focus on ? "
This question often goes unasked because employees fear appearing incompetent .
Really , it shows concern about your responsibilities and your team 's goals .
When you have several ongoing projects and your boss adds more to your workload , knowing how to prioritize grows difficult .
Managers want to hear from employees who are concerned with improving business , says Gayle Lantz , an organizational development consultant and executive coach .
" Can I take on this task ? "
Too many employees take a laissez - faire attitude toward their careers and relinquish control to their bosses , says career expert Dr. Rachelle J. Canter .
Bosses have their own lives to worry about , however , and do n't have time to map your future .
Rather than let your career meander , look for opportunities to prove you have initiative and leadership skills .
Find ways to build experience and gain skills that you currently lack .

On the streets of London , the Chinese dictatorship has just learned with a painful jab that their Olympic Slogan – " One World , One Dream " – is true .
In every city the Olympic torch sashays through on its world tour , its greeting is the same .
Tibetans wave their banned flag and grieve for their freshly - slaughtered countrymen .
Falun
Gong refugees hold aloft pictures of their co-believers who have vanished into China 's vast " re-education camps " .
Darfuris cry for an end to the massacres against them backed from Beijing .
And ordinary people line the streets to support them .
Yes , they all have One Dream : an end to human rights abuses .
But are n't the Olympics meant to be apolitical , one of the few places where we can gather and leave our ideologies at the door ?
Yes .
But it is not the protesters who politicised the Olympics ; it is the Chinese Communist dictatorship .
As the leading Chinese human rights lawyer Gao Zhisheng – who taught himself law in a shack in Shaanxi Province – explained last year : " The Chinese Communist regime sees the hosting of the Olympics as political .
They are using it to prove to the Chinese people that the world is still acknowledging the party as a legal government , despite all the suppressive and bloody tyranny , and all the horrible crimes against humanity the Party has committed . "
( Shortly after he issued this warning , Gao " disappeared " , as so many Chinese human rights activists do .
With this move , the Chinese government proved his point . )
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The protesters are simply trying to stop the Chinese dictatorship from continuing to wave the Olympics as a bogus global seal of approval for their cruel rule .
Now they are asking : how do we keep disrupting the 100 - metres propaganda sprint that takes us up to August ?
Should there be a boycott of Beijing ?
So far , the discussion has focused on one very narrow sliver of the Games : whether our political leaders should attend the opening ceremony .
But this is looking in the wrong direction .
Our politicians are not the people to take a moral stand on our behalf .
Not only are many soaked in the blood of innocents themselves ; worse , last year , they actually used their power to lobby hard against a major extension of human rights in China .
Here 's how it happened .
The Chinese government was being battered by industrial unrest , across the country 's factories and mines .
There were more than 300,000 industrial protests in 2006 , because ordinary Chinese people were sick of being paid artificially low wages and seeing their colleagues lose limbs in shrieking machinery just to provide us with ultra-cheap goods .
So the Chinese dictatorship decided – through gritted teeth – to allow ordinary Chinese citizens to form trade unions .
It was an extraordinary gasp of freedom , allowing political organisations to be formed across the country .
Our governments panicked .
The mighty business lobbies told them – in more polite language – that if Chinese workers are not lashed into submission , they will start demanding more wages , and to make their workplaces safe .
That means lower profits for " our " businesses and higher prices at our tills .
So the US and European governments lobbied the Communist Party hard against upholding this basic right .
Our leaders stood up for unfreedom , and won .
The law was ditched .
We still get to shop until Chinese workers drop .
How can those same leaders pop up a year later and posture about greater rights in China ?
But one of the great things about the Olympics is that we are n't represented by our politicians .
We are represented by ordinary citizens , who happen to be extraordinarily brilliant athletes .
They are untainted by the fetid calculations of geopolitics and corporate corruption .
They can speak for basic human values – if they choose to .
So far , the discussion of a sporting boycott has also stalled , because people assume there are only two options .
Either we go along passively and smile into the Communist propaganda - camera , or we stay away until the distant day when China is a multiparty democracy with a First Amendment protecting free speech .
There is another way .
Our athletes can offer the Chinese government a deal .
We will happily take part – provided you meet three simple , practical conditions .
Follow this checklist , and your international coming - out party will go swimmingly .
First : release China 's 10 greatest human rights activists .
Top of the list is the Chinese hero Hu Jia .
He is a 34 - year - old father rotting in jail because he campaigned for the rights of Aids victims , and against the environmental destruction spreading across the country .
We 're going to need Chinese allies like him in the years to come , as the Great Leap Backwards of global warming intensifies .
Second : invite the Dalai Lama to Beijing , and talk to him .
Just talk .
When I met the Dalai Lama a few years ago , he said he would do it .
This is in China 's interests too : the younger generation of Tibetans coming up behind him are less prepared to offer up the other cheek for a kicking .
Israel has learned the hard way that if you react to largely peaceful protests against occupation – like the first Intifada of the 1980s – with beatings and bullets , you face rockets and suicide - bombers further down the line .
China still has a chance to stop that shift – just .
Third : allow a real UN peacekeeping force into Darfur .
Since 2003 , the Chinese government has been covering at the UN for the genocidal Sudanese government , in return for full access to the country 's oil .
They will only vote for a peacekeeping force if the Sudanese government – the murderers – retains the right to veto the arrival of any troops .
As the limping , bloodied people of Darfur told me last summer as they filed across the border , this Chinese clause makes peace impossible .
And finally , allow us to set up a website that breaks through the Great Firewall of China , explaining why we have laid down these conditions .
If the athletes of the free ( ish ) world unite behind these demands , there is a significant chance the Chinese government will meet them .
The embarrassment of their multi-billion - dollar phallus flopping before the world may well trump the embarrassment of conceding on these three issues .
If we are going to ask the Olympics athletes to risk something they have worked their whole lives for , we have to offer them something hefty .
A noble but ineffective moral gesture wo n't do it .
But with this proposal , we can say – imagine : you could play a part in getting the Dalai Lama to Beijing , a proper peace - force into Darfur , and 10 heroic men and women into freedom , or go down trying .
We have four months to persuade them this is worth making a stand for .
Before being sent to his dungeon , Hu Jia wrote , " When you come to the Olympic Games in Beijing , you will see skyscrapers , modern stadiums and enthusiastic people .
You may not know that the flowers , smiles and prosperity are built on a base of tears , imprisonment , torture and blood . "
Ha was prepared to risk his life to tourniquet this flow of his countrymen 's blood .
Are we really not even prepared to take a calculated , calibrated risk with the Olympics ?

Everyone knows it , and virtually everyone enjoys it : grated Parmesan cheese sprinkled across a steaming bowl of pasta .
But , it 's been a hotly contested good , with countries wrestling over its name .
This week , the European Court of Justice , located in Luxembourg , rejected the idea that " Parmesan " is a generic name undeserving of protection .
" Only cheeses bearing the protected designation of origin ( PDO ) ' Parmigiano Reggiano ' can be sold under the name ' Parmesan , ' " the court decided , likely giving a boost to cheesemakers in Parma and the surrounding area in northern Italy .
The PDO system gives the cheese the same protection benefiting other European products , such as French camembert , which must come from Normandy , or champagne , which must come from the French region of the same name .
Only products made in the place were the foods were first created can be sold under the traditional name .
Germany not responsible
Only the cheese produced in the area around Parma may be called " Parmesan "
But there 's a hitch .
The court also ruled that Germany did not have the responsibility to police or take action against non-Italian Parmesan suppliers whose products were on German supermarket shelves .
The European Commission in Brussels had taken Germany to the European Court of Justice for failing to protect Parmigiano Reggiano 's PDO rights by not prosecuting the sale of " Parmesan . "
" A member state is not obliged to take on its own initiative the measures required in order to penalize the infringement on its territory of PDOs from another member state , " the ruling stated .
The court said that it was up to Italian authorities to prosecute .
" Still a victory "
The European Commission and Italian cheesemakers were pleased with the verdict nonetheless .
" The court has upheld the basis of our PDO system , " Commission agriculture spokesman Michael Mann said , as cited by Reuters news service .
" Parmesan is not a generic product -- you can only call it that if you follow the specifications of Parmigiano Reggiano . "
" We lost the case because it was specifically about our thinking that Germany had a legal responsibility to prevent the sale of these products , " he added .
Germany has its own specialties
" The glass is half - full and half - empty , " Igino Morini , spokesman of the Parmigiano cheesemakers ' group , told DPA news agency .
" Germany has been acquitted , but the court has recognized that the term ' Parmesan ' can only be used for Parmigiano Reggiano . "
Cheesemakers in the Italy who traditionally make Parmesan have been struggling to protect their product from cheaper , lower - quality copies from other areas .
The name " Parmigiano Reggiano , " as well as the cheese 's specific geographical origin and manufacturing process , won legal protection as a PDO in the EU in 1996 .
Italy has the greatest number of PDOs -- 165 -- of any EU - member state .
France has the second highest number , with the two countries sharing 40 percent of the total 772 products , including 78 types of cheeses .
The EU 's list of protected names for farm products also applies to translations of the registered term or name across the 27 - nation bloc .

Unless something truly monumental produces lopsided victories for Hillary Clinton in the upcoming primaries , her chances for the Democratic nomination rely on superdelegates overturning the will of Democratic voters .
Knowing this , her campaign has regularly identified criteria upon which the superdelegates might choose Clinton over Obama , some of which directly reflect the voters ’ intent ( pledged delegate count , popular vote ) and some of which are essentially judgment calls ( electability , readiness ) .
The campaign ’s problem is that the former criteria currently favor Obama and the latter do n’t lend themselves to a slam dunk consensus .
In fact , they have so far been rejected by the majority of Democratic voters , who think electability and readiness are either better found in Obama or are trumped by Obama ’s ability to usher in change .
If superdelegates were to cite Clinton ’s electability and readiness in order to coronate a nominee , it could drive voters out of the party .
But the Clinton campaign has found a new angle : imaginary electoral college votes .
It is sending surrogates out to push the idea that superdelegates should vote for the candidate who would have come out ahead if the primaries were awarding electoral college votes instead of delegates .
This has a veneer of legitimacy because the campaign can say , “ In the fall , the president is chosen through the electoral college .
If you want to know who would make the best nominee , look at the electoral vote math . ”
In fact , Clinton communications guru Howard Wolfson said almost exactly this to the New York Times .
Now , is this spin ?
Of course it is .
The Clinton campaign will and has spit out any criteria it can think of that shifts the media narrative in its direction .
It is losing the pledged delegate count , it is losing the popular vote , and it has lost more states .
But it is in front when it comes to this notion of electoral college votes because it has won more big states .
“ It is our belief that at the end of the day , superdelegates will need to take into account a variety of factors , ” said spokesman Phil Singer on a conference call on Monday .
“ And that includes which candidate is going to be best able to accumulate the requisite 270 electoral votes . ”
The problem here is that these fictitious electoral college results have little , if any , connection to the electoral college results in the fall .
Clinton won California in the primary , giving her bucketloads of these imaginary electoral college votes .
( Because of how the Democratic Party awards delegates , the delegate results were relatively even in California .
Electoral college votes are winner - take - all . )
The same happened in New York .
But Obama will win California and New York in the fall if he is the nominee .
He ’s a Democrat .
Winning California and New York in presidential elections is what Democrats do .
And then there ’s the fact that the winner of a state ’s Democratic primary is not necessarily the best Democrat to win that state in the fall .
Clinton won the Democratic primary in New Mexico , where Kerry lost to Bush by one percent in 2004 .
The Democrats may need Obama ’s ability to appeal to independents and Republicans to turn New Mexico blue in the fall .
The question is , how will the media cover the Clinton campaign ’s latest ploy ?
In a Politico article recently , Jim VandeHei and Mike Allen made the point that a hard look at the delegate count shows that Clinton has “ virtually no chance of winning ” the nomination .
But the media has a couple reasons for pretending like it does :
One reason is fear of embarrassment .
In its zeal to avoid predictive reporting of the sort that embarrassed journalists in New Hampshire , the media — including Politico — have tended to avoid zeroing in on the tough math Clinton faces …
One important , if subliminal , reason is self - interest .
Reporters and editors love a close race — it ’s more fun and it ’s good for business .
The media are also enamored of the almost mystical ability of the Clintons to work their way out of tight jams , as they have done for 16 years at the national level .
That explains why some reporters are inclined to believe the Clinton campaign when it talks about how she ’s going to win on the third ballot at the Democratic National Convention in August .
I would add another reason : many in the media hold to a twisted form of objectivity .
Instead of taking a hard look at the facts and stating them plainly , it gives equal space to both sides ’ arguments and spin .
I ’m guilty of some of this myself .
So the media can either : ( 1 ) ignore the Clinton campaign ’s new math ; ( 2 ) report the campaign ’s new math , but explain the fallacy behind it ; or ( 3 ) report the campaign ’s new math and pretend like its just part of the back - and - forth of a dogfight campaign that either candidate can win .
The first two are clearly superior to the third , but it is the third that keeps Clinton viable .
The fact that her campaign has realized that content - hungry 24 - hour news outlets will report most of their spin as long as they keep producing it demonstrates that though they might not win this nomination fight , they ’ll never be beat on the media management front .
Mountain View , CA - The developers of Firefox , a web browser created by the Mozilla Foundation , have decided to once again rescue the masses from the horrors of the Internet .
Having produced top - notch phishing protection , malware identification and other security features unmatched by their competitors they are now introducing the " Rickroll Detection Filter . "
This new filtering protection will pre-screen links when the page renders and determine the campiness of the content .
The new technology is called " Quash Unreasonable Electronic Entertainment Recognition " or QUEER .
It will start being tested in the fifth beta of version three of their flagship product .
Avid gamer Ronald Parks was Rickrolled just hours before attending a LAN party to play Halo .
" I started humming the tune while fragging the other team .
They all stopped playing because they were laughing so hard .
It was embarrassing .
They all think I 'm gay now , " says Ronald .
" This new scheme will protect the many users who are now suffering , sometimes for days , with catchy yet awful songs and images in their head , " says Hans Freidenhaufer , a top developer at the Mozilla Foundation .
He continues , " The worst part is when you are caught humming these tunes in your cubicle when someone walks by .
The QUEER filter will keep you from having to wear that old Metallica t- shirt to work for the next three days to restore your respectability . "

The filtering mechanism will be extensible with plug-ins to catch threats that may get past the default engine .
The first of these extensions , the " LoLCat Image Malady Protection " or LIMP , has the ability to still render pages where LolCats have been found with the offending images removed .
When asked if the QUEER filter would protect against things like the Goatse website , Mr. Freidenhaufer responded , " While the imagery depicted there is rather horrific , the use of this particular attack is usually directed at an individual not to the public at large .
Also , it is not used lightly .

When you visit a web page , you might expect that the code and images from the page will make their journey through the tubes unmolested and unaltered , but according to security researchers , you would also be wrong 1.3 percent of the time .
Researchers from the University of Washington and the International Computer Science Institute wanted to see whether ISPs , enterprise firewalls , or proxy servers commonly made changes to requested HTML while it was " in-flight . "
Testing 50,171 unique IP addresses around the world , the researchers found that content requested by 657 IP addresses was modified during transit , but the modifications were n't always nefarious .
We 've reported before on companies that sell products to ISPs to do exactly this .
ISPs can use the devices to insert or replace their own advertisements into web pages ( MetroFi does this to offer its free WiFi service in the US ) , or they can simply add notification messages to websites ( Rogers in Canada began doing this late last year ) .
But such interventions , though worrisome , are rare .
Only 1.3 percent of pages tested were modified in any way , and 70 percent of those modifications were caused by client proxies installed to deal with pop-ups or to block advertising .
The researchers also note that not every alteration is problematic ; some cellular operators , for example , will strip extra whitespace from pages or will provide extra compression for images to keep bandwidth usage low and browsing quick .
One caveat , however : the research tells us little about the prevalence of ad blocking in general .
Browser extensions ( which do much of the ad blocking ) that may modify page layouts were not included in the tests , so only separate proxies that blocked ads generated positive results .
Because altering the pages in transit might not be in the publisher 's interest ( ad - blocking ) or the user 's interest ( some of the alterations caused security problems ) , the researchers devised a method of " web tripwires " to detect any changes .
The tripwire is some additional JavaScript code that is executed on the client and can check the received HTML for possible alterations .
For example , the tripwire could count the number of script tags on a page , a method that would have turned out 90 percent of the modifications found during testing .
If the number of tags differs from the number hardwired into the script , it can pop a message into the browser notifying the user that the page has been modified .
The tripwire at work
For publishers who care about the integrity of their pages , the tripwire method offers a simpler and lower - overhead solution when compared to more extreme measures , such as only allowing access over an encrypted HTTPS connection .
If you want to check whether your browser is receiving web pages as they were created , the researchers have left their validation tool online for public use .
A paper based on the research ( PDF ) will be presented at the NSDI '08 conference on network systems design this week .
Introduction
DTS HD Master Audio Explained
DTS HD Master Audio in Action
Final Thoughts
Yesterday , Sony Computer Entertainment finally gave home theatre fanatics what they had been clamouring for since late 2006 , when the PlayStation 3 console launched .
With the delivery of the latest console firmware , version 2.30 , owners whom have an amplifier capable of outputting PCM sound will benefit from improved sound with Blu-ray movies encoded in DTS HD Master Audio .
Before the update , the console could only access the ' core ' of the audio track , resulting in a lossy output from inside the lossless container .
We 'll talk more on this later .
For reviewing Blu-ray movies here on TweakTown , I use a combination of two Blu-ray players ; the Sony BDP - S500 , which is Sony 's flagship stand alone Blu-ray player ( which at the time of release in November 2007 , retailed for $ 1299 ) , and the PlayStation 3 .
The idea behind obtaining a stand alone player was so I could access the higher functions that Blu-ray could perform , which would be delivered via firmware upgrades , which was the expectation upon release .
I say expectation , because Sony never formally announced upcoming features , but Sony staff littered forums with hints and users calls to technical support indicated to ' expect them soon ' .
So it was n't merely a pie in the sky wish .
However , whilst the BDP - S500 has received numerous firmware upgrades , they have all been bug fixes .
The unit does not have an Ethernet connection , does not feature BD Profile 1.1 or 2.0 , does not have any persistent storage , and does not decode DTS HD MA - all features of the PlayStation 3 .
Clearly , the PlayStation 3 is still the preferred entry for anyone wanting to obtain Blu-ray .
And for the going rate of the console ( the best I have seen is $ 678 AU from Sony Central ) , it represents immense value for what you are getting , and I have no hesitation in calling it the best consumer electronics device the industry has ever seen .
This audio codec is one of two lossless audio codecs which is built into the Blu-ray specification .
The other is Dolby TrueHD .
Both work on the same principal ; they both use the master audio recording of the film , and using lossless compression ( similar to what FLAC is to WAV ) to generate a smaller file size , and is variable in data rate .
For example , if there is silence in any one audio channel , rather than encode that silence , it will discard that information and resume again when the silence ends .
But it 's important to note that there is no compression here , it 's bit - for - bit master recording .
This is in slight contrast to PCM sound , which is also built into the Blu-ray spec .
PCM is uncompressed sound , but there is no fancy losslessness , so files are bigger , taking up precious space on the disc .
The way that the PlayStation handles the aforementioned formats is to simply ' unzip ' both TrueHD , and now DTS HD Master Audio , and output them to an amplifier in uncompressed PCM form .
There is nothing lost in the transition .
Allegedly , the PlayStation 3 lacks the necessary hardware to bitstream the raw information to the amplifier , this just means that anyone who has an amplifier that can play PCM can also benefit from these audio codecs .
The DTS HD Master Audio codec is the best option of all three , because of a very smart design by the DTS engineers .
Embedded in each DTS HD MA audio track is a 1.5 MB/s ' core ' track .
This means by having just one audio track , those with standard DTS amplifiers , or standard TVs will still hear the core track , whilst owners with a DTS HD MA certified amplifier ( or in the PlayStation 3 case - just a PCM amplifier ) , will be able to extrapolate additional information with greater enhanced detail .
This is in contrast to the Dolby TrueHD codec , which if it features on a Blu-ray disc , needs to be joined by an additional standard Dolby Digital soundtrack , to meet disc standards .
By DTS only employing one audio track to suit all needs , it means more disc space can be allotted to the image , and extra features .
So , now we know what DTS HD MA is , and what it does , let 's see how it performs with TweakTowns ' first look .
Every Twentieth Century Fox and MGM Blu-ray features a DTS HD Master Audio track , as does all new Roadshow titles ( fromonwards ) .
So this means there are around 40 DTS HD MA equipped Blu-ray movies on the market right now .
Let 's take a look at a few of them .
I reviewed this title a few months ago at my previous site , DVDBits .
Being one of my favourite films ( do n't laugh - I kill you ! ) , I am quite versed in how it has traditionally sounded , but nothing quite prepared me for what unveiled .
For starters , and to be rather general , it felt like a veil has been lifted off the soundtrack .
This veil prevented me from hearing the full depth and scope that I now hear .
I heard sounds that I had never before .
There was a little more clarity to the vocals in the centre channel , and much less compression heard in the music , and more detail in the rear tracks .
The booming bass that the film is known for became a little less boomy , but more detailed .
It now sounds more like a crunchy and responsive bass which is less boomy , and definitely more powerful .
The down side is I think I have done permanent damage to my hearing , but to the credit of my amplifier , it wanted to truck on .
Onto the next one .
For those that have seen the movie , I think they would agree that the F - 35 fighter jet Vs the semi- trailer which punctuates the climax of the film , was the highlight .
It also sounded very , very good before , so let 's see how it sounds now .
The same benefits I heard with
Open Source Market : FOSS getting hot in Russia
Recent interest towards FOSS from the Russian government has boosted commercial activity in this field .
No longer than a year ago there was no single large company that would say it is capable of doing FOSS system integration projects .
Now there are three , and the number will probably grow .
Nobody is particularly sure about how to do business with FOSS , but it is already evident that it can be done somehow .
That is why the larger ones are jumping on the bandwagon simply not to be late .
First to come was Armada ( Russian ) , a holding which is better known for its sibling company named RBС ( Russian ) .
It succeeded to unite in Fall 2007 the majority of the local Linux vendors , namely ALT Linux , Linux - Online ( Russian ) , Linux Ink ( Russian ) and VNIINS ( the latter specializes on producing operating systems for the military needs ) in its bid on the project of the Ministry of Education that , if successful , could become the largest migration to FOSS in world ’s secondary education .
Another participant in the same tender was a company named Korus Consulting .
Although large , it has never done FOSS projects before , so its move looks to be grounded on a pure business decision .
Korus ’ bid was remarkable as the company was willing to do the project for 5 mln roubles only ( while the official budget limit of the project and the sum concluded with RBC was 60 mln ) .
This striking difference does not mean that Korus has found a way to cut the costs down tenfold — they announced that they viewed this project as an investment and were willing to do it with their own costs .
Nevertheless , they lost to RBC .
A week ago Korus announced ( Russian ) that it will be shipping a localized version of Asus EeePC .
However , there is little original software there : the OS is a modified version of Xandros .
Finally , a recent visit of RedHat ’s Jim Whitehurst last week was concluded with an OEM partnership agreement ( Russian ) between RedHat , IBM , Austrian VDEL and a large Russian IT company AiTi to supply Linux - based computers to Russian government .
As far as I understand the layout , RedHat is going to supply software , IBM will provide its Lotus Symphony , VDEL will make hardware , and AiTi will be concluding deals and doing the system integration part .
The first company is clearly trying to build its strategy on the locally available resources .
As the company has not done FOSS business before , it looks like it is going to submerge the smaller Linux developers .
The strategy of the second remains somewhat unclear : a modified Xandros may be a nice start , but if they are going to attract government ’s attention , they need to become or partner with a more solid and reliable software supplier .
Finally , AiTi is playing as a mediator of the Western companies with most of the hardware and software built outside of Russia .
It ’s getting interesting to follow the development of the events .
Which strategy will be the most effective ?
Will there be new players , and if so , how will they differentiate their offer ?
Will the Russian FOSS developers be able to produce commercially - driven world - class FOSS software or will it be imported from other countries instead ?
Even though it is now unclear what the Russian FOSS will be , I think that some two years will be sufficient for it to take a definite shape .
We ’ll see .
WASHINGTON 
It was a recipe for scandal .
Until early Tuesday morning , visitors to John McCain ’s campaign
Web site could find seven of “ Cindy ’s Recipes , ” among them three elegant and healthful offerings : passion fruit mousse , ahi tuna with Napa cabbage slaw and farfalle pasta with turkey sausage , peas and mushrooms .
Only problem was , all three , listed as favorite family recipes of Cindy McCain , Mr. McCain ’s wife , were taken verbatim from the Food Network .
A fourth , rosemary chicken breasts and warm spinach salad with bacon , bore a striking resemblance to a similar recipe by Rachael Ray .
By midmorning , the McCain campaign had taken all seven recipes off the Web site and was pointing a finger at an intern who , tasked several months ago with contacting Mrs. McCain ’s staff for favorite McCain recipes , had prowled the Internet instead .

AMD and Intel have been trading shots through the court docket since AMD first filed its antitrust lawsuit against Intel in 2005 , so it 's not particularly surprising to see a new 108 - page filing from Sunnyvale and a prompt and massive reply from Santa Clara .
AMD 's filing does , however , contain a few new bits of information amongst the heavily - redacted pages , and one brand - new , surprising assertion .
The first section of AMD 's filing tromps over familiar ground ; Sunnyvale gives its version of microprocessor history , the rise of AMD as an Intel competitor , the golden age of Opteron ( 2004 - 2006 ) , and the various illegal and abusive actions it accuses Intel of over these periods .
In brief , AMD claims that Intel has paid major OEMs ( directly or indirectly ) not to carry AMD products , has paid manufacturers to avoid building AMD solutions that target certain market sectors , has paid OEMs to abandon AMD platforms they initially agreed to launch , and has used all - or - nothing discounts as a means of locking OEMs into Intel products .
While the rest of these alleged misconducts are fairly self - explanatory , all - or - nothing discounts merit an explanation .
The ( alleged ) system works as follows .
In a given quarter , an OEM will purchase 100 CPUs .
Of those 100 chips , 80 of them are going to be Intel chips , while 20 would be AMD chips , assuming an 80/20 market split between AMD and Intel .
Given this scenario , our hypothetical OEM goes to Intel to negotiate a price for the 80 processors it wishes to purchase .
Intel is willing to sell 80 processors at $ 100 each , but it 's also interested in cutting a deal .
If the OEM will commit to buying 90 percent of its processors from Intel this quarter ( 90 chips , in this case ) , Intel , in turn , will sell the chips for $ 80 apiece .
If the OEM fails to sell a product mixture that works out to be 90 percent Intel , however , it receives no discount at all .
This leaves Intel 's chief competitor with two equally unappealing options .
Either AMD accepts
Intel 's maneuvering , and competes only for the last 10 percent of the market available to it , or AMD subsidizes the discount the OEM would 've received over just 20 processor sales .
This particular allegation is n't new — AMD included it in its original 2005 filing — but it forms a substantial part of the company 's claim against Intel .
Having listed the various ways in which Intel allegedly abuses its monopoly position , AMD launches into the heart of its argument .
In taking such actions , Intel has excluded AMD from fairly competing in the market and placed the company in a vice it cannot escape .
From the filing : " Up until the June 2005 filing of this lawsuit and contemporaneous international enforcement actions that caused Intel to moderate its misconduct ...
AMD 's technologic successes earned it a lower share of desktop and notebook revenues than it had achieved during most of 2001 and early 2002 .
Through the end of 2008 , it garnered roughly 13 percent of total x86 microprocessor revenues , less than half of what it requires to operate long - term as a sustainable business . "
This last , for the record , is something of a bombshell .
AMD has never named a specific revenue target under which it could not sustain itself as a going concern .
It should be noted , however , that this projection is obviously long - range and / or contingent upon future operations .
Over the past eight years , AMD 's highest share of the microprocessor market by revenue was the fourth quarter of 2006 , in which the company earned 16 percent revenue share .
It 's not clear how AMD accounted for the 26 percent revenue share figure , although more than doubling its current income would obviously drastically improve the company 's financial situation .
Discovery in this case is ongoing , but AMD makes a point of noting the degree of Intel 's " cooperation , " stating that " What it [ Intel ] contends amounts to the equivalent of 140 million pages has just been produced , much in the past 90 days .
Additional caches of documents are being received continuously from Intel 's customers , though many , including important OEMs such as HP , have yet to produce their first document . "
Intel 's response to AMD 's latest filing is straightforward and to the point , as expressed in its filing : " AMD 's complaint about Intel 's discounting boils down to a complaint that Intel is a more efficient competitor . "
The company hammers this home even further later in the document , when it states : " Its [ AMD ] brief period of a computing performance advantage with the Opteron microprocessor cannot mask AMD 's historical and current position as a laggard in computing performance , its consistent record of failing to offer suitable solutions to corporate customers , or competitive products for the notebook ( or mobile ) market segment , and finally its well deserved reputation for unreliability , among other deficiencies . "
If you 're interested in this case , I recommend reading AMD 's original 2005 filing .
The company goes into detail regarding the claims it makes against Intel and names specific companies , time periods , and actions it alleges are evidence of Intel 's illegal behavior .
Intel , for its part , continues to insist that while it most definitely plays hardball , none of its actions rise to the level of market abuse or are evidence of monopolistic behavior .
There 's a legal difference between playing all out against a much smaller competitor and cheating .
If AMD 's allegations and Intel 's counter - filings agree on one point , it 's that Intel is a fierce and unrelenting competitor .
Whether or not the company 's behavior has ever damaged consumers , however , is a very open question .
According to the current schedule , 11 months from now , AMD will have its day in court — and a chance to prove its been illegally blocked from competing fairly .
( CNN ) --
From that latte addiction to another pair of shoes you just have to have , everyone makes some missteps with their money .
But there are some mistakes you should never fall into .
Here 's what not to do with your money :
In today 's economy , there are certain financial mistakes you should avoid .
Do n't tap into your 401 ( k ) retirement fund too early .
But more and more people are doing just that .
There was a 20 percent increase in hardship withdrawals for people trying to save their home , according to Great - West Retirement Services , an organization that provides retirement products for employers .
Last year , 18 percent of employees took out a loan from their 401 ( k ) or 403 ( b ) , a retirement account for public education and nonprofit employees .
That 's up from 11 percent in 2006 , according to the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies , a nonprofit retirement research group .
Of the people borrowing money , almost half said they needed the money to pay off debts .
That 's a significant increase from 27 percent in 2006 .
" If you are borrowing money to pay off your mortgage , you 're sabotaging yourself , " said Frank Boucher , a retirement expert at Garrett Financial Planning .
Why ?
You 're getting taxed twice .
When you take a loan from your 401 ( k ) , you are required to pay it back -- with interest -- in five years .
Remember , you paid taxes on the money you used to pay the loan back and you pay taxes again when you withdraw your account .
Plus , tapping into your 401 ( k ) also means you 're missing out your money 's ability to compound until retirement .
If you are faced with high credit card bills or you 've been hit with unexpected bills , like an un-reimbursed medical expense or an expensive car repair , consider some alternatives before tapping your 401( k ) .
Remember you can always stop contributing temporarily to your retirement fund .
Of course , this will be limiting your ability to make money with compound interest , but it may fatten your paycheck by a hundred dollars or so .
You may also consider taking out a home equity line of credit , even though the credit crunch has made it harder to qualify .
It 's not only 401 ( k ) mistakes that can lead us astray .
' Buy now , pay later ' can really hurt your credit .
" It seems like a good idea , " Ulzheimer said .
" But people tend to buy more than they intended because they do n't have to pay it back right away . "
When you sign up for in - store financing all you 're really doing is getting an installment loan through a finance company , according to Ulzheimer .
It ends up on your credit report that you have a loan you 're not paying down for months , or even years .
Unlike a traditional loan that you pay down immediately , an installment loan will hurt your credit score for a longer period of time since the principal is n't decreasing .
Beware if you miss the first payment .
The amount may have to be paid off in full by the end of the free period , consumer advocate Edward Dworsky warns .
If you miss that payment , you 'll have retroactive interest that could be over 18 percent .
And do n't forget , these buy now , pay later ads are usually offered on higher ticket items .
" Having to pay 18 percent or more on a big screen TV is n't worth it , " says Dworsky .
In addition , finance companies are generally seen as lenders of last resort , Ulzheimer said .
You 'll look like a risky borrower if you have a finance company on your credit report .
If you 're required to take out a store credit card to take advantage of a 10 percent discount or a zero percent financing offer , your credit score will also be hurt because you 're basically giving the retailer the ability to pull your credit report .
That lower score count means you 'll get a higher interest rate when you apply for a mortgage , a car loan or any other kind of personal loan .
You do n't want a $ 30 savings today to cost you $ 10,000 in the future .
Help out a friend or family member by co-signing on a loan is a big risk .
If you sign your name , you are personally responsible for that loan in case the original borrower makes late payments or defaults .
If you co-sign a loan and your friend or relative misses a payment , the lender can immediately collect from you without going after the borrower first in many states .
And it does happen .
Three out of four co-signed loans wind up being paid by the co-signer , according to the Federal Trade Commission .
In addition , you may not realize that co-signing a loan can hurt your own ability to get credit .
Since a co-signer is legally obligated to pay the debt , the loan will show up on your credit report , too , and it will factor into your debt - to - income ratio .
In addition , the amount you owe may be increased -- by late charges or by attorney fees -- if the lender decides to sue to collect .
If the lender wins , your wages and property may be taken according to the Federal Trade Commission .
If you must co-sign a loan , there are steps you can take to protect yourself .
First , ask the lender to send you a written notice if the original borrower misses a payment .
That way you 'll get a heads - up about any future trouble .
You may also be able to negotiate the specific terms of your obligation .
For example , you may be able to limit your liability to just the principal on the loan , excluding late charges , court costs or attorney fees .
In this case , ask the lender to include a statement in the contract .
If you do co-sign , get copies of all the important papers , like the loan contract , the warranties and the Truth - in - Lending Disclosure Statement .
You may need these documents in case there is a future dispute .
Keep in mind that the lender is n't required to give these documents to you .
You may need to ask for copies from the borrower .
In the long run , if you really want to help out , consider just giving your friend or family member a cash loan .
It 's a smarter move that can save you a lot of headaches .

All About Retirement Planning
One of the defining features of the last 8 years or so has been the way ideas go from crazy stuff that only DFHs believe to stuff everyone knows , without ever going through a stage in which the holders of conventional wisdom acknowledge that they were wrong .
Oh , and the people who were right are still considered DFHs ; you see , they were right too soon .
It looks as if peak oil may be going that way :
If it 's possible to make Bush look any stupider --- the new NIE report on certainly Iran does .

Bush :
But this — we got a leader in Iran who has announced that he wants to destroy Israel .
So I ’ve told people that if you ’re interested in avoiding World War III , it seems like you ought to be interested in preventing them from have the knowledge necessary to make a nuclear weapon …
Is anyone else shocked that it was FOX ’s Bret Baier that elicited the “ World War III ” sound byte ?
Me neither .
Full transcript here if you can stomach it .
Kevin Drum has a good post up and notes :
This NIE was apparently finished a year ago , and its basic parameters were almost certainly common knowledge in the White House well before that .
This means that all the leaks , all the World War III stuff , all the blustering about the IAEA — all of it was approved for public consumption after Cheney / Bush / Rice / etc .
knew perfectly well it was mostly baseless .
Nothing smells better in the morning to the Neocons than war propaganda .
That 's why Cheney tried to hold up the report from coming out .
A National Intelligence Estimate ( NIE ) on Iran has been held up for more than a year in an effort to force the intelligence community to remove dissenting judgments on the Iranian nuclear programme , and thus make the document more supportive of U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney ’s militarily aggressive policy toward Iran , according to accounts of the process provided by participants to two former Central Intelligence Agency officers .
via Amanda : " As ThinkProgress has documented , the White House ’s manipulation of the Iran NIE bore a striking resemblance to the controversies that played out over pre-war Iraq intelligence . "

Iron for the guns was thought to have come from Argentina
Enlarge Image
Given pride of place in an unassuming museum on the East Coast of America is a pair of 200 - year - old duelling pistols shrouded in mystery .
The intricately decorated guns were said to have been forged from the iron of a meteorite .
They were a unique gift from the commander of a South American region , which would later become Argentina , to the fourth US president , James Madison .
" Permit me therefore to present to your Excellency ... a specimen of the first essays of the manufacture of arms established in the provinces of Buenos Ayres and Tucuman , " wrote General Ignacio Alvarez in an accompanying 14 - page letter .
Over time , they passed into the hands of Madison 's successor - James Monroe - and are now on display at a museum dedicated to him .
Since that time , the story of their origin has gone unquestioned .
Now , scientists armed with a battery of hi-tech machines have probed the pistols in unprecedented detail .
Their findings cast doubt on the accepted theory of their origins and have thrown up a whole new set of questions for historians about the guns and the motives of the original protagonists .
" It 's made the mystery even more mysterious , " Meghan Budinger , curator at the James Monroe Museum and Memorial Library , told BBC News .
Atomic probe
To uncover the secrets of the pistols , they were sent on a world tour of some of the most advanced microscopes and scanners .
HOW ISIS WORKS Neutrons blasted at sample Neutrons created by accelerating protons to near light - speed Pulses of protons smash into block of tungsten , dislodging neutrons from the nuclei of its atoms .
20,000 trillion neutrons dislodged each second Neutrons channelled into beams and directed at sample of interest Neutrons bounce off the molecular structure and collected by sensors which record position and energy Scattering tells scientists about how target atoms are organised
They underwent X - ray fluorescence to reveal their surface detail , and were passed through a CT scanner to reveal their inner workings .
But the key test - whether they were forged from a lump of metal from space - was performed at the ISIS neutron source in Oxfordshire , UK .
The colossal machine is able to probe matter at the atomic level , giving scientists unique insights into the structure and make - up of materials .
" We give a different picture of what the world looks like , " said Professor Andrew Taylor , director of ISIS .
The facility , owned and operated by the UK's Science and Technology Facilities Council ( STFC ) , is currently being expanded to add the so - called Second Target Station , which will give the super - scope even more capability .
It is more commonly used by scientists designing and testing new materials , such as those used in the Airbus A380 and the turbine blades found in Rolls Royce jet engines .
" We did n't set out to build a tool for archaeology , " said Professor Taylor .
However , its abilities are ideally suited to probing historical artefacts .
" What my neutron beams tell you are where atoms are and what atoms do , " said Professor Taylor .
" We try to understand at a microscopic level the structure , arrangement and forces that hold materials together . "
Crucially , this process is non-destructive .
" Without [ ISIS ] , we'd have to take a hacksaw and cut chunks out of the artefact to look at under the microscope , " explained Dr Evelyne Godfrey , who carried out the study .
' Funny stuff '
The machine was used to compare Monroe 's pistols to a fragment of a meteorite from the Campo del Cielo crater in Argentina ; the supposed origin of the metals from which they were forged .
ISIS has been used to test and develop materials for the Airbus A380 The results were conclusive .
" They were completely different , " Dr Godfrey told BBC News .
" There were differences in microstructures , there were differences in carbon content , there were differences in chemical composition .
" We can say for sure they were n't made from meteoritic iron . "
The results came as a blow to the museum .
" The results were n't quite what we were hoping , " said Ms Budinger , diplomatically .
But , whilst the tests closed one chapter for the pistols , it opened another , packed full of new questions .
Curators of the objects had always assumed that the handles of the pistols were made of silver , but ISIS showed that this too was not the case .
" They were brass - and it was a funny type of brass , too , " explained Dr Godfrey .
The closest match was a distinctive alloy exported from Southeast Asia at around the time .
" It looks just like silver but is cheaper - so they were making tableware and replacing silver in other objects , " said Dr Godfrey .
Other tests revealed that the guns were not just ceremonial - as previously thought - but were fully functioning arms .
Questions , questions " It brings up all kinds of questions , " said Ms Budinger .
" What exactly was General Alvarez 's motivation ?
He wrote this very flowery letter saying how much he admired the United States and how much he admired Madison but then he gives them a gift that was not where he said it was from and it was made from cheaper materials . "
There is a possibility that the General was duped - that he was told the pistols were made of meteoritic iron and gifted them in good faith .
" He may not have known what he was giving to Madison - at the time there would have been no way to prove it one way or the other , " said Ms Budinger .
The partially solved mystery could stop there ; but the research team have one further avenue to explore .
A third pistol is mentioned in General Alvarez 's letter that was also supposedly forged from Campo del Cielo iron .
" We 're trying to track that down , " explained Ms Budinger .
If it is located and can be put through the same battery of tests as the first pair it could finally give historians clues to the real origin of the pistols .
" If it looks exactly the same that tells us that all three pistols were manufactured by the same person and that either General Alverez was duped or that it means he was lying and that none of the pistols were made from the Campo del Cielo crater .
" If the third pistol is different entirely then I think we have fairly good evidence that our pistols may not be the Madison pistols at all , " said Ms Budinger " In which case it 's a whole new mystery . "

Health reporter , BBC News
As the government launches its latest campaign to help people monitor what they drink , two drinkers keep an alcohol diary for a week - and get a doctor 's verdict .
'I THOUGHT I CANCELLED OUT THE BADNESS ' Caroline Eardley , 27 , classes herself as a social drinker , who drinks no more than other people she knows , so she was shocked when she saw her total .
" When I wrote down the amount , I was like ' woah that is a lot ' .
ALCOHOL DIARY - MAY 7 -13
Wed - no alcohol Thur - Evening at a friend 's = 2 units Fri - lunch out , then to a pub and a house - warming = 20 units Sat - friend 's birthday - 10 units Sun - no alcohol Mon - wine with dinner = 3 units
Tue - wine with dinner = 2 units Week 's total = 37 units
Recommended limit = 14 units
" But I do n't know anyone my age who sticks to 14 units a week . "
Caroline , who works in PR in London , added : " I have a good job , I have no problems at work so I think so long as I am dealing with the day - to - day I will deal with the future .
" You think , I 'm not caning it every night so what damage can it be doing ? "
But Dr Dave Tomson , a Tyneside GP who works in alcohol services , said Caroline 's drinking was " hazardous " and bordering on the " harmful and risky " .
" The risks for Caroline , at the rates she is currently drinking , are what could happen to her after she has drunk 20 units .
" They might be very simple risks such as falling over and twisting her ankle , or doing her back in , or driving while drinking .
And if this drinking level is a pattern she could also face relationship difficulties .
" If she sustained this pattern of drinking she would gradually get early problems such as weight gain .
She is drinking at least two extra meals a week . "
But he warned there were also long - term risks , which young drinkers like Caroline often ignore .
" Over time Caroline faces rises in blood pressure both acute and chronic rises in cholesterol and a fatty liver .
She will eventually increase her risk of heart disease , liver disease and stroke , " he said .
" She will also have an increased risk of breast cancer .
Mouth throat and oesophageal cancers are rare , but she will increase her risk of them .
' I 'll stop when I 'm older ' Caroline said she might now alternate alcoholic and soft drinks when she is out .
" I always used to think if I had two or three days where I did not drink at all it cancelled out the badness . "
I think at the moment I am being a bit hedonistic
Caroline Eardley
One of Caroline 's grandmothers had breast cancer , and Caroline said the increased risk linked to drinking was " scary " .
But she said : " The thing that scared me the most was the extra calories , because I would never eat two extra meals .
" This has made me pay more attention to what I drink , but I do n't know whether it will make me change and that is a scary thing .
" When I have children and get older I know my drinking will stop .
" I think at the moment I am being a bit hedonistic . "
' I 'M NOT WORRIED ' Mark Foster is a keen runner and considers himself fit and healthy , so says he sees no problem with drinking over 100 units in a week .
The 29 - year - old London - based economist said : " I have the same pattern of drinking throughout the week . "
ALCOHOL DIARY - MAY 5 - 11 Bank holiday - out with friends = 17 units
Tue - curry with friends = 12 units Wed - park and pub with friends = 16 units
Thur - birthday meal = 7.7 units Fri - barbeque = 16 units Sat - a friend 's 30th = 25 units Sun - another barbeque = 18.5 units Week 's total = 112.2 units
Recommended limit = 21 units
Rather than use units to gauge safe drinking levels he said his aim was not to get drunk .
" I do n't binge for one or two days and I do n't like getting drunk - I rarely have a hangover .
" I was a bit tipsy on the Saturday night , but not drunk .
" I do n't drink at lunch times and do n't worry about my current drinking patterns . "
But Dr Tomson said Mark 's drinking pattern suggested he could be alcohol dependent .
" This is a worrying drinking diary .
He is drinking almost six times his recommended weekly limits , he never does n't have a binge .
" He has n't drunk under six units in one session and is probably over the drink - drive limit .
" Mark is obviously young and allegedly fit but he is probably already experiencing symptoms .
" The drinking plays a part in his tiredness and he does confess to a few feeling rotten in the mornings .
" And if he continues drinking at this level he will have significant health problems before he is 40 . "
Impotence Dr Tomson said Mark 's liver would already show acute inflammation because of the toxins in alcohol .
One hundred and whatever units means nothing to me
Mark Foster
And he faces problems with insomnia , impotence and poor concentration , plus long - term risks of liver and pancreas damage , heart disease , raised blood pressure , some cancers and stroke .
" Ultimately he has increased risk of brain damage . "
But Mark said he had been drinking regularly at these levels for about a decade and was unconcerned about future health risks .
" I am fit and healthy so do n't really consider my drinking to be a problem because there is no evidence .
" I do n't think the health risks mentioned will make me change .
" I suppose I will change in the future as the circumstances of my life change , but not today or tomorrow .
" When I saw the units totalled up they did n't really mean anything to me .
I can't really put them into context .
" One hundred and whatever units means nothing to me . "

This year , her liver began failing again and she was hospitalized at County - USC Medical Center , affiliated with the University of Southern California .
In her Medi-Cal application , a USC doctor wrote , “ Her current clinical course is irreversible , progressive and will lead to death without another liver transplant . ”
The application was denied .
The county gave her medication but does not have the resources to perform transplants .

Critics of abstinence programmes say they do not cut teen pregnancy rates US lawmakers are investigating whether to cut government funding for health education programmes that promote sexual abstinence until marriage .
The move follows a report earlier this year from America 's leading health agency , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , which revealed one in four teenage girls has a sexually transmitted disease .
Opponents of abstinence education say the approach ignores the fact that teenagers are sexually active and fails to give them accurate medical information or advice on safer sex .
" We get sex -ed classes in school and that should be where teens get the right information - but that is n't happening , " says 15 - year - old Mildred , from Arizona , who volunteers as a peer educator with the pro-choice organisation Planned Parenthood .
" They do n't touch on subjects like sexuality , STDs ( sexually transmitted diseases ) , birth control - it 's not allowed because of abstinence - only education .
It leaves you on a cliff - hanger - and a lot of teenagers become sexually active in their middle school years . "
" Teens are curious and they want to experiment and if they know what 's out there and they have the correct information , they 're going to know how to protect themselves and prevent an unwanted pregnancy and an STD , " adds Maryland high school student Melissa .
" Putting up a wall and saying ' do n't have sex ' makes them more curious and wanting to know what it is .
But if you tell them the straight facts they 're going to know how to protect themselves .
It 's about taking care of yourself . "
Teen pregnancy Planned Parenthood estimates that two thirds of teenagers will have experienced sexual intercourse by the time they leave school .
And with some 750,000 teenage pregnancies a year , America has one of the highest teen birth rates in the developed world .
" This national programme which has wasted $ 1.5 bn ( £ 750 m ) of tax money is a failure and our teens are paying the price , " says Cecile Richards , president of Planned Parenthood .
If we can learn to control the most basic of drives - the sex drive - for good , then we can control drugs , gangs , alcohol and abusive anger
Roger Norman
' Wonderful Days ' abstinence programme " We 've been wasting money on programmes that do n't work and we 're seeing the consequences every single day . "
State governments receive federal money they must match to fund abstinence programmes .
At least 17 states have opted out of the system and others have suspended funding while Congress investigates whether such programmes work .
Critics say there is no evidence that they delay sexual activity and teenagers who have taken a vow of virginity are less likely to use protection if they break their promise .
Religious right Roger Norman , a Texas lawyer , describes himself as being part of the religious right .
He runs an organization called Wonderful Days which does not receive government funding but teaches abstinence as part of the health curriculum in some local schools .
" I am convinced that abstinence is the only way for kids , " he says .
" You begin by teaching the consequences of bad behaviour and the benefits of proper behaviour and you do that in a way that a child can grasp .
" Self control leads to a happy , joyful life .
If we can learn to control the most basic of drives - the sex drive - for good , then we can control drugs , gangs , alcohol and abusive anger . "
His lessons promote marriage and virginity - for both partners - as an ideal .
A lot of the young people I know who go around have experiences with lots of different people are just preparing themselves for not knowing how to be committed to somebody
Ashley , 18 They emphasise disease as a consequence of sex before marriage .
Some of his former students say that sexual abstinence is sensible and beneficial .
Eighteen - year - old Ashley says she believes teenagers who experiment with sex are laying the foundations for troubled relationships later in life .
" At some point everybody ends up getting married .
Everybody wants commitment at some point and nobody likes to be cheated on .
" But a lot of the young people I know who go around have experiences with lots of different people are just preparing themselves for not knowing how to be committed to somebody .
" Once you get into the practice of doing whatever you want , it 's hard to change when you 're older . "
Sixteen - year - old Josh says he relies on friends to help him stay abstinent .
" I have a lot of close friends and we pretty much agree on the same thing so we keep each other in line most of the time .
Yes , it 's difficult , but my friends are there and I 'm there for them , and it gets easier if you have friends who agree with you . "
" I 'm pretty confident I can keep my abstinence vows , " says 15 - year - old Kirsten .
" It was pretty hard reaching that decision , because living in this world today , it 's almost expected of you to ' do it ' .
But with my religious upbringing and convictions and commonsense , it 's really not that hard . "
" Secondary virgins " Teenagers who do have sex before marriage are given another chance by becoming " secondary virgins " .
" Of course , if you view virginity as number one , and you 've slept with someone , of course it 's going to be different and you can never go back - but that does n't mean there 's no tomorrow , " explains Ashley .
" Every day is a new decision and abstinence is not one you make once .
You 're going to have to make this decision over and over again .
So if you fail once , you get back up and you try again . "
The row over abstinence education is part of a much wider debate in the US about " family values " .
Many conservatives are concerned that " American values " are being eroded .
But their opponents believe that the conservatives have an overly influential political voice , particularly within the current Bush administration .
For liberals , the campaign to roll back the abstinence programmes is part of a broader struggle against what they regard as reactionary elements in the US government .
Pro-abstinence campaigners say it is unfair to blame abstinence programmes for America 's teenage health crisis .
Valerie Huber , chief executive of the National Abstinence Education Association , says only one in four schools teaches abstinence - the vast majority use comprehensive sex education .
That , she says is the real reason for the rise in STDs and teenage pregnancies .
" We would argue that abstinence education is not an ideological approach .
We know that in the area of teen sexual activity , abstinence is the optimal approach .
" Compare this with healthful eating .
We know that obesity is rising in America .
That does n't mean though that we minimise the optimal health message . "
" We still stress good eating habits , we still stress exercise , knowing that , unfortunately , many Americans are not going to listen . "
If Congress does decide to cut government funding for abstinence programmes , they will still continue .
Many enjoy public support and will likely find money elsewhere .

What are these ?
But when the women face prison , questions are raised about where to set the age of consent .
And because many of those named as victims refused to testify against the women in what they said were consensual relationships , not everyone agrees that the cases involve child abuse .
" We need to untangle the moral issues from the psychological issues from the legal issues , " said Carol Tavris , the author of " The Mismeasure of Women " and a social psychologist .
" That 's the knot . "
She added : " You may not like something , but does that mean it should be illegal ?
If we have laws that are based on moral notions and developmental notions that are outdated , do we need to change the laws ? "
Though it might seem that way from the headlines , women having sex with teenage boys is not new .
A federal Department of Education study called " Educator Sexual Misconduct , " released last year , found that 40 percent of the educators who had been reported for sexual misconduct with students were women .
Charol Shakeshaft , the author of the study and a professor of education at Hofstra University , said that even when the woman is not a teacher , the relationships are not healthy .
" A 16 - year - old is just not fully developed , " she said .
" Male brains tend to develop the part that can make decisions about whether it is a wise thing to do later . "
Prosecutions of women have been rising slightly in the last several years , said David Finkelhor , director of the Crimes Against Children Research Center at the University of New Hampshire .
Mr. Finkelhor says he believes that the scandal involving sexual abuse by priests called more attention to cases with teachers and other authority figures .
But the cases also reflect a decline in the double standard applied to men and women , brought on , he said , by increasing numbers of female prosecutors and police officers who may not buy into the traditional notion that a boy who has sex with an older woman just got lucky .
BANGKOK , Thailand ( CNN ) --
Thailand 's parliament reopened Monday , marking the end of 16 months of military rule and the return of democracy .
Newly elected lawmakers in immaculate white ceremonial uniforms attended the opening in the sumptuous surroundings of the Thai parliament building in Bangkok .
The return of parliamentary rule follows elections in December in which the People Power Party ( PPP ) , the party of deposed Thai leader Thaksin Shinawatra , won nearly half the seats in the lower house .
Billionaire businessman Thaksin was ousted in a military coup after allegations of widespread corruption in his government .
He remains in exile in Britain .
In his absence current PPP leader Samak Sundaravej will probably be announced as the next prime minister at the head of a ruling coalition .
The selection of new prime minister is schedule to take place Friday .
A political veteran of more than 40 years , Samak refused to comment when asked by CNN about the likelihood of him taking over .
According to CNN's Dan Rivers , however , his selection appears a foregone conclusion -- the PPP has the most seats in parliament , and the support of all but one of the other parties .

It remains to be seen what role , if any , Thaksin will play in a future government .
He and his family are facing court cases accusing them of massive corruption .
When his wife returned to the country earlier this month , she was presented with an arrest warrant by police .
Pojamarn Shinawatra appeared before the Supreme Court and was released on 5 million baht ( about $ 168,000 ) bail and ordered not to leave the country .
Samak has already said that if he became prime minister he would amend the constitution to allow the deposed leader to return to Thai politics .
Analysts are uncertain , however , how much influence Thaksin -- who won three elections and is still immensely popular in his homeland -- could exert from abroad .
" He has a lot of influence right now because he 's behind the scenes .
He 's probably providing cash flow but once they have power in their hands they will be more independent of him , " Chris Baker , an author on Thai politics , told CNN .

He wanted to make sure Nicole McElveen did after she purchased some new phones from him .
So he sent her a few picture messages , even though she did n't pay for the service , before really showing off the resolution and clarity of their cameras with full - frontal nude pics of himself .
Just to make sure she saw how good the pictures were , he re-sent them three different times .

Now she 's suing Sprint and Daryl for $ 1 million — her husband , David , adds in the filing that the toll on his wife from the pictures has cost him the " services , companionship , love , affection and consortium of his wife . "
Daryl says that 's total BS , they had corresponded over text messages , and she had asked for photos of him and that she actually " expressed her appreciation for receiving such photographs . "
Usually the truth lies somewhere in the middle , but honestly , I do n't want to get anywhere near this thing , much less thrust my consciousness into the center of it .

Snow hampered rescue efforts
The aftermath
The crash , involving at least 60 vehicles , was near the town of Seewalchen , on the main motorway linking Vienna and Salzburg .
A police spokesman said that low visibility caused by a major snowstorm was to blame for the accident .
Some victims were trapped in their vehicles , and falling snow was hampering rescue efforts .
Helicopters attempted to land at the scene , but some had to abort the rescue mission because of the heavy snowfall .
Around 40 Red Cross rescue vehicles have been sent to the scene , where they are working alongside the emergency services .
The Red Cross said a bus was involved in the incident .
At least five of the injured were in a serious condition and local hospitals have been put on stand - by to deal with the casualties .
The motorway has been closed in both directions .
This is not the first incident along this section of the motorway .
The Seewalchen to St Georgen section has seen several fatal crashes , mostly because of fog , in which 10 people have died since 2002 .
In this case , a split was not a draw .
Despite narrowly winning Indiana , while losing North Carolina , Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton did not fundamentally improve her chances of securing the Democratic presidential nomination .
If anything , Mrs. Clinton ’s hopes for overtaking Senator Barack Obama dwindled further on Tuesday night .
For Mr. Obama , the outcome came after a brutal period in which he was on the defensive over the inflammatory comments of his former pastor .
That he was able to hold his own under those circumstances should allow him to make a case that he has proved his resilience in the face of questions about race , patriotism and political mettle — the very kinds of issues that the Clinton campaign has suggested would leave him vulnerable in the general election .
Beating Mr. Obama in Indiana , a state he had once been confident of winning , was an achievement for Mrs. Clinton .
But it was hardly the kind of strong victory she posted in Pennsylvania and Ohio .
And when paired with his comfortable victory in North Carolina — which Mr. Obama pointedly described in his victory speech as “ a big state , a swing state ” — it hardly seemed enough for Mrs. Clinton to convince so - called uncommitted superdelegates to rally around her candidacy .
Her showing in the two states did not permit Mrs. Clinton to cut into Mr. Obama ’s lead in pledged delegates or his overall lead in the popular vote .
A series of conflicts with insurgent groups along Iran ’s borders may be impelling Tehran to back its own allies in Iraq in what it regards as a proxy war with the U.S. , according to security experts and officials in the U.S. , Iran and Iraq .
Dozens of Iranian officials , members of the security forces and insurgents belonging to Kurdish , Arab Iranian and Baluch groups have died in the fighting in recent years .
It now appears to be heating up once again after an unusually cold and snowy winter .
In recent weeks , Iranians have begun the now - routine bombardment of suspected rebel Iranian Kurd positions in northern Iraq , and guerrillas have claimed incursions into northwestern Iran .
Some Iranians blamed Sunni Arab radicals for an explosion Saturday that killed 12 and injured 202 at a gathering where a preacher criticized the Wahhabi form of Islam that inspires Osama bin Laden .

None of the groups appear to pose a serious threat to Iran , but Tehran regards them as Washington ’s allies in an effort to pressure it to scale back its nuclear program and withhold support for militant groups fighting Israel .
American and Iraqi officials in turn accuse Iran of supporting Shiite Muslim militias and other militant groups in Iraq to keep the U.S. preoccupied and the Baghdad government weak .
Although a U.S. intelligence estimate in December undercut claims that Iran has a secret nuclear weapons program and appeared to lower the possibility of a direct military conflict over Iran ’s uranium enrichment operations , tensions over Iraq have increased .
U.S. officials accuse Iran of backing Shiite militias close to cleric Muqtada Sadr that fought Iraqi government forces to a standstill in Basra and Baghdad two weeks ago .

Tempting assets

Analysts say the anti-Iranian groups are tempting assets for the U.S.
They say it would be a surprise if the groups were not receiving U.S. funding , but that the strategy would probably not work .
“ It will give more encouragement to Iran ’s hard - liners to step up their own efforts to assist anti-American forces in Iraq and Afghanistan , ” said Bruce Riedel , a former CIA analyst now at the Brookings Institution , a Washington think tank .
Among the most active groups is the Party for Free Life in Kurdistan , known by its Kurdish acronym , PEJAK .
It has hundreds of well - trained fighters along with camps in northern Iraq .
Iranian soldiers guarding the border are sometimes ambushed by PEJAK fighters .
Iran responds with artillery attacks that send Iraqi villagers scurrying for cover .
Border skirmishes last summer and fall between Iranian security forces and PEJAK left dozens dead on both sides .
Advertisement
PEJAK emerged this decade as an Iranian offshoot of the Kurdistan Workers Party , or PKK , an armed group formed to fight a separatist war against the Turkish government .
Former members say PEJAK was meant to circumvent Western restrictions on contacts with the PKK , which has been labeled a terrorist organization by the U.S. State Department and the European Union .
“ The PKK wanted to have a relationship with America , so it formed and used PEJAK , ” said Mamand Rozhe , a former commander who defected from the group four years ago .
U.S. military officials visited PEJAK ’s camps in northern Iraq just after the U.S. - led invasion of Iraq in 2003 , said Osman Ocalan , a brother of the PKK ’s imprisoned leader and a founder of PEJAK .

“ Since the beginning , we thought we would get the American help , ” said Ocalan , who left the group two years ago .
“ And it ’s a good relationship now .
. . .
They are in talks with each other , and there is some military assistance . ”
Ocalan and others say U.S. help has included foodstuffs , economic assistance , medical supplies and Russian military equipment , some of it funneled through nonprofit groups .
Every two or three months , U.S. military vehicles can be seen entering PKK and PEJAK strongholds , Ocalan said .
“ There ’s no systematic relationship , no number to call , ” he said .
“ Americans do not intend to have an official relationship .
Whenever there ’s any kind of question by the Turks , they can say we do n’t have a relationship . ”
A PEJAK leader , Abdul Rahman Haji-Ahmadi , was publicly given a cold shoulder when he went to Washington last summer .

PEJAK ’s activities may have created obstacles for those working inside Iran for peaceful change .
Dozens of Kurdish activists in Iran have been thrown in jail on charges of supporting the rebel group .
“ I think that on balance PEJAK does more harm than good , ” said Aso Saleh , an Iranian journalist and ethnic Kurd who fled his country after being charged with state security crimes that carry a possible death sentence .
“ PEJAK ’s actions give the government the excuse to militarize the region , ” Saleh said .
“ It gives the Islamic Republic the excuse to crack down on civil opposition . ”
Elsewhere , Iranian authorities blamed U.S. - backed elements for a series of bomb attacks in the oil - rich southwestern province of Khuzestan that killed dozens of people from 2005 to 2007 .
Baluch militants have killed dozens of members of Iran ’s security forces , including 11 elite Revolutionary Guards in a car bomb attack last year in Zahedan , a town near the border with Pakistan and Afghanistan .

Last fall , a young Kurdish woman killed several officers and soldiers in a suicide attack along Iran ’s northwestern border .
Other groups can provide precious intelligence to the U.S.
The decades - old Kurdistan Democratic Party of Iran , or KDPI , whose members have been the victims of scores of assassinations in Iraq and Europe , allegedly at the hands of Iranian intelligence operatives , has relations with Washington that stretch back decades .
“ It ’s a very warm relationship , ” said Rostam Jahangiri , leader of the group ’s Irbil , Iraq , office .
“ We interact here and in Washington . . . .
Sometimes it ’s once a month .
Sometimes it ’s after three or four months . ”
The secretive Mujahedin Khalq , also regarded by the U.S. and EU as a terrorist organization , may have little support among Iranians , but its networks extend deep into Iranian territory , and it is credited with exposing Iran ’s nuclear program in 2002 .

Other groups include Jundollah , which operates out of the southwestern Pakistani province of Baluchistan , and Arab groups in Iran ’s southwest .
The leftist Komala Party of Iran has n’t staged any military operations inside Iran since 1992 , but several hundred or so fighters continue to train at their base camp in Zergwe in the autonomous Kurdish northern region of Iraq .
Abdullah Mohtadi , a leader of one of two Komala factions , said he met with White House and State Department officials in 2005 and 2006 to discuss Iran .
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice asked Congress in early 2006 for $ 75 million to promote democracy in Iran , of which $ 66 million was approved -- most of it for Persian - language broadcasting .
But about $ 20 million was set aside for unidentified groups the State Department described as “ nongovernmental organizations , businesses and universities , ” for Internet development and “ cultural affairs . ”
Congress set aside an additional $ 60 million for the effort in the current fiscal year .

U.S. officials did not respond to a request for comment on claims that PEJAK or other groups receive funding .
No group officially acknowledges receiving U.S. aid .
But many say they would welcome it .
“ If you ’re a political movement that is part of an opposition , you need help from abroad , ” Mohtadi said .
“ We ’re not ashamed to admit it . ”

A push for rebel aid
Many in Washington have advocated such aid .
The rebels fight the same Revolutionary Guard that oversees at least part of Iran ’s nuclear program and probably funnels support to militant groups in Lebanon and the Palestinian territories .
“ It would be a scandal if the U.S. was not funding these groups , ” said John Pike , director of globalsecurity.org , a website about intelligence and military issues .
“ The support would be covert and might be done in ways that the groups themselves remain unaware of the ultimate source of their funding . ”
Still , most of the groups suffer severe weaknesses .
KDPI and Komala have endured tumultuous splits in recent years , KDPI in part over whether to align itself with the U.S .
Advertisement
Both PEJAK and the Mujahedin Khalq operate like cults , barring members from having sexual relations and discouraging personal lives .
Each touts a strict Marxist ideology .
Iranian diplomats and politicians say they have intelligence to back up their claims that the U.S. aids these groups , but have never publicly provided proof .
“ We know the MKO and PEJAK both have relations with the U.S. , ” said Hamidreza Taraghi , an official of the Islamic Coalition Party , which is close to Iran ’s conservative religious leadership .
“ The Americans have given the MKO a lot of technology to monitor Iranian phone traffic , ” he said in an interview .
“ Where is the Baluchistan separatist money coming from ? ”

Iraqi Kurds say perceived U.S. support for PEJAK and other anti-Iranian groups prompted Iranians to reactivate Ansar al Islam , a Sunni Muslim group with ties to Al Qaeda that has been launching attacks against Kurdish officials .
The Ansar al Islam fighters have been used as a “ pressure card ” by the Iranians , said Jafar Barzinji , the minister of affairs for peshmerga , or Kurdish security forces , who oversees military issues in Iraq ’s autonomous Kurdish region .
Iraqi Kurds say they have asked Iranian authorities to rein in Ansar .
“ They never deny that they ’re supporting them , ” Barzinji said .
“ They always promise a solution in the near future . ”
Sometimes , he said , they bring up PEJAK .
Fareed Asasard , head of the Kurdish Strategic Studies Center , a think tank in the Iraqi Kurdish city of Sulaymaniya , recently visited Tehran to meet with analysts at a research institution close to supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .

“ The reason for their support of Ansar is PEJAK , ” he said .
“ They ’re 100 % worried about PEJAK ’s actions . ”

Times staff writer Paul Richter in Washington contributed to this report .
Ever since I started my professional career as a software developer back in 2002 , nearly all of my development was done using C sharp and .NET framework with a bit of Java here and there .
However while studying software engineering at University of Sydney 90 % of my work was done on unix machines , I was taught object oriented programming in my first year , and thankfully we did n’t get introduced to OO by learning C++ or Java but a language called Blue ( it was first developed by the Basser Computer Science department at the University of Sydney to teach students OO concepts ) .
Blue was not just a programming language but was a programming environment , which allowed interactive manipulation of classes and their relationship to each other graphically or textually .
This allowed me to visualize a group of instantiated objects whose state was encapsulated and only way the objects performed anything was by collaborating with each other sending messages to each other to perform a task .
As I learned mainstream languages like C++ and Java .
The idea of objects sending messages was blurred by multiple inheritance , classes and types .
Throughout the years as I read books , researched and experimented with different ideas , I noticed Smalltalk being reference numerous times in every book OO book and every time Objects , XP and TDD were discussed .
Xp and TDD were all conceived in the Smalltalk community and some of my favorite authors like Kent Beck , Rebecca Wriffs - Brock and the numerous speakers at OOPSLA every year all had a Smalltalk background .
So about a year ago I decided to check out and learn this Smalltalk thing .
It was a steep learning curve in the beginning ( especially getting used to the idea of not working with source files ) it was a big paradigm shift but it the best thing I did , there such a long history and wealth of experience in the Smalltalk community .
Just browsing through code base in the standard squeak Smalltalk image , studying the wonderfully crafted code which was refined and polished by master Smalltalk craftsman over the last 25 years has improved my understanding of good OO design and also increased my productivity in my day job using C sharp and .
NET .
After experiencing Smalltalk and programming with “ live objects ” , going back to C sharp or java seems a little dull at times they are not nearly as expressive as Smalltalk .
While learning squeak Smalltalk and as I immersed myself into the Smalltalk culture , I stumbled across Seaside a framework to create web based applications entirely in Smalltalk .
Seaside kind of blew my mind , I have dabbled with Rails a bit and it is very clean and can be very productive , but Seaside takes web based development to a whole new level I never seen highly complex web based applications developed this way .
Well it was n’t long before I discovered GemStone / S which is not just an OO database but a powerful object server based on Smalltalk ( more on this in another post ) .
Through Smalltalk I rediscovered just how powerful it is to think in terms of objects not classes and just be able to send any message to * any * object that can understand that message .
Now I realize that OO is more about message passing and actually very little to do with classes , inheritance or types .
I found this quote by Allan Kay where he states what OO is all about .
“ OOP to me means only messaging , local retention and protection and hiding of state - process , and extreme late - binding of all things .
It can be done in Smalltalk and in LISP .
There are possibly other systems in which this is possible , but I ’m not aware of them . ” – Alan Kay creator of Smalltalk
Obama fires back at Clinton : ' Shame on her ' David Edwards
Published : Monday April 14 , 2008
|
Print This Email This From NBC : " At a United Steel Workers union hall tonight , filled with steel workers , Obama launched on his own " shame on you " tirade against Clinton , for hitting him hard and repeatedly on his comments that small town Pennsylvanians " cling to guns , " and religion and anti-immigrant sentiment because government has n't served them . "
This video is from CNN.com , broadcast April 13 , 2008 .
NBC continues , " Clinton , who over the past two days has touted her family 's roots in Scranton , PA as working class and church - going , has also portrayed herself as a defender of the 2nd Amendment .
Tonight , Obama questioned her commitment , saying that her espousal of the issue was politics at work and said she was trying to appear like ' Annie Oakley . ' "
" Now , I have to admit that I expected some of this out of John McCain .
John McCain said I was out of touch , he said I was being condescending and elitist , ' people are n't bitter , ' " Obama remarked .
" And I 'm thinking to myself , ' Here 's a guy , it took him three tries before he actually came up with a plan to deal with the millions of people who are about to lose their homes because of foreclosure , who wants to perpetuate the Bush tax cuts . ' "
" And he 's saying I 'm out of touch .
Do you think I 'm out of touch or do you think he 's out of touch ?!
So I expected this out of John McCain .
But I 've gotta say , I 'm a little disappointed when I start hearing the exact same talking points coming out of my Democratic colleague Hillary Clinton .
She knows better .
She knows better !
Shame on her !
Shame on her !
She knows better ! "
Well , according to the Associated Press , a " top U.S. official "  speaking , as always , " on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter "  told reporters that " evidence " would be presented to Senate and House Intelligence Committees that the Syrian facility our Major Non-NATO
Ally , Israel , attacked without provocation and destroyed last September , was a plutonium - producing nuclear reactor " within weeks or months of being functional . "
" CIA Director Michael Hayden , Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnell and National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley briefed lawmakers , who were shown a video presentation of intelligence information that the administration contends establishes a strong link between North Korea ’s nuclear program and the bombed Syrian site .
It included still photographs that showed a strong resemblance between specific features of the plant and the one near Yongbyon . "
What s weird is that the top official also told reporters the North Koreans had no objection to that presentation being made .
The Israelis did , but the Koreans didnt !
You see , just a few weeks ago , knowing what would be in such a presentation , a spokesman for the North Korean ( DPRK ) Ministry of Foreign Affairs blamed us for the deadlocked U.S. - DPRK bilateral talks , which , in turn , have resulted in deadlocked Six -Party talks on ending the Korean War .
President Bush has personally made the " ending " of the Korean War conditional on DPRK admitting during U.S. - DPRK bilateral talks that the charge we first made back in 2002 that Kim Jong - il had a secret " uranium - enrichment " nuclear - weapons program and the charge we made last year that Kim Jong - il was helping the Syrians essentially duplicate the quasi- successful DPRK plutonium - based nuclear - weapons program were true .
According to the DPRK spokesman 
“ The U.S. side is playing a poor trick to brand the DPRK as a criminal at any cost in order to save its face . "
Bush has reportedly told his negotiators not to agree to anything " that makes me look weak . "
“ Explicitly speaking , the DPRK has never enriched uranium nor rendered nuclear cooperation to any other country .
It has never dreamed of such things . "
Our negotiators claimed the issue of “ suspected uranium enrichment ” could only be solved if the DPRK told us the whereabouts of “ the imported aluminum tubes . ”
So , the Koreans actually took our experts to see those tubes , which  like the Iraqi aluminum tubes  were central to some military application ; they even provided us with samples !
Okay , but what about the video presentation just made to Congress , which purports to show a reactor vessel  " similar " to that of the Soviet - designed Soviet - supplied 5
Mwe natural - uranium fueled , graphite - moderated reactor which became operational in 1986  in a facility under construction , allegedly in Syria , with " Korean faces among the workers " ?
The Israelis  allegedly the source of this " intelligence "  apparently believe ( and want gullible members of the Best Congress Money Can Buy to believe ) that ten - foot tall Korean nuclear scientists and engineers have gone into the nuclear - reactor export business .
( When it comes to Israeli " intelligence , " Congresspersons are especially gullible .
And it would never occur to them that if Syria really wanted nuclear - weapons  and Kim Jong - il wanted them to have them  it would be much cheaper and faster to just buy them from the quasi- successful DPRK nuclear - weapons producers . )
At the time the Soviet Union disintegrated , they had under construction at Nyongbyong two scaled - up natural - uranium fueled graphite - moderated plutonium - producing nuclear reactors .
After the disintegration , Russia stopped construction of those large reactors and made the DPRK subject the Soviet - designed Soviet - built reactors to an International Atomic Energy Agency Safeguards Agreement , as required by the Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons .
Every outsider who has visited Nyhongbyong since has reported no signs the Koreans have attempted to complete construction of the large reactors .
In fact , all DPRK reactors have been reported to be in a dismal deteriorating state .
But it is conceivable that DPRK metallurgists and engineers are capable of making " reactor vessels " for small reactors .
After all , most of the steel reactor vessels for Soviet nuclear power plants were outsourced to the Czech Republic .
The diameter of such reactor vessels was restricted by the requirement that when loaded on a Soviet railroad flat car , it could pass through Soviet railroad tunnels .
So , what will be the ( perhaps unpredictable ) result of this latest " disclosure " in Congress by the Cheney Cabal ?
Will Congress declare war on Russia ?
On the DPRK ?
On Syria ?
How about on Iran ?
Maybe this was just a dress rehearsal for an Israeli attack on Iran .
After all , according to Hillary ,
" Iran continues to pursue a nuclear [ weapon ] option .
Those weapons , if they got them , would probably pose the greatest threat to Israel .
During the Cold War , it was the United States policy to extend deterrence to our NATO allies .
An attack on Great Britain would be treated as if it were an attack on the United States .
Should it be U.S. policy now to treat an Iranian attack on Israel as if it were an attack on the United States ? "
Hillary to the contrary , under U.S. law , Major Non-NATO
Allies do not enjoy the same mutual defense and security guarantees afforded bona - fide members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization .
We are not obligated to regard an attack on Israel or Pakistan or Jordan or Kuwait as an attack on us .
However , MNNAs are eligible for participation in cooperative research and development programs ( such as the U.S. - Israeli Arrow anti-ballistic missile program ) as well as priority sales or grants of “ excess ” U.S. weapons and associated equipment ( such as the TOW missiles we provided Israel to replace the ones they sold to Iran , during the Iran - Contra Affair ) .
Furthermore , MNNAs can take advantage of the Defense Export Loan Guarantee program , which provides loan guarantees for foreign purchasers of U.S. defense products  such as the F - 16s that destroyed that Iraqi reactor back in 1981 and the suspect " reactor vessel " in Syria last year  in much the same way the Export - Import Bank provides guarantees for U.S. commercial products .
But , when one of our MNNAs uses any of our supplied weapons in acts of aggression  such as the Israelis did two years ago in Lebanon and did last year in Syria and are apparently contemplating doing this year in Iran  we are complicit .
Congress is complicit .
Hillary and Obama and McCain ought not to be demanding to know if Syria somehow acquired what the Israelis claim looks like a reactor vessel .
Rather , they should be demanding that no MNNA ever again be allowed to make us complicit in an act of aggression .
And while they re at it , they might prohibit this and any future President from committing another war of aggression .
A network intrusion at the Pentagon nine months ago resulted in the theft of an " amazing amount of data " that continues to pose a threat to national security , the CIO of the Defense Department said earlier this week .
" This was a very bad day , " Dennis Clem , who is also CIO of the Office of the Secretary of Defense , said during a panel discussion at the Information Processing Interagency Conference .
" We do n't know when they 'll use the information they stole , [ which was ] an amazing amount . "
The pilfered data included processes and procedures that will be valuable to US enemies , he said , according to an article by Government Executive .
Over the course of two months leading up to the attack , malicious code infiltrated several systems belonging to the Pentagon 's network and culminated in an exploit of a known Microsoft Windows vulnerability , Clem said .
That allowed attackers to send spoofed emails that appeared to come from Pentagon personnel in Clem 's division .
Somehow , the emails managed to steal login credentials for the network , according to this article from Federal Computer Week .
Network forensics show the hackers were able to access sensitive information , which they encrypted as they transmitted it back to their sites .
Clem 's statements are just a tad more telling than those of US Secretary of Defense Robert Gates when first disclosing the June 2007 breach to reporters .
" There will be some administrative disruptions and personal inconveniences , " he said at the time .
" It will come as no surprise that we aggressively monitor intrusions and have appropriate procedures to address events of this kind . "
Clem did n't identify the attackers , but according to some published reports , government investigators believe the the breach originated in China .
It took three weeks and $ 4 m to clean up the mess .
Clem said the Pentagon gets 70,000 malicious entry attempts per day , ranging from relatively innocuous probes to more nefarious attacks .
Outside hackers can pinpoint new servers or software within minutes of them being deployed and intrusions quickly follow . ®
Justin is completely right to criticize Bob Barr for failing to adhere to libertarian , non-interventionist foreign policy principles concerning Latin America .
But for the sake of clarification for our readers , I must take issue with something Justin said regarding the war on drugs .
Justin writes ,
“ I ’m even mildly enthusiastic about his opposition to legalizing ‘ hard ’ drugs , such as methamphetamine ( this will doubtless prove his undoing over at Reason magazine ) . ”
He often has a valid criticism of some libertarians who seemingly care much more about the drug issue than the war issue .
It is indeed true that foreign policy sometimes does n’t get the attention it deserves , compared to many domestic questions .
I think Justin ’s comments were made as an “ in your face ” challenge to them , not really as a declaration of support for the war on drugs .
I must make it clear that libertarianism as a philosophy is opposed to the war on drugs , including laws against methamphetamine and other “ hard drugs . ”
This is not a lifestyle question , but a question of government power , liberty , property rights and humanity .
Libertarians believe it is wrong to put people in prison for using or selling drugs .
People have a right to do what they wish to their own bodies , even if their decisions are sometimes immoral and self - destructive .
The war on drugs , including “ hard drugs , ” has caused a massive expansion of domestic police state power .
Just because it ’s not as bad as what happens during foreign war does n’t means it ’s not important .
Being less destructive than all - out war should be considered a rather low standard for libertarians .
Furthermore , Barr is n’t even as bad on this issue , at least on the federal level , as Justin somewhat implies .
Barr believes the federal government should butt out of domestic drug policy .
Barr ’s critics on the drug war are more concerned about his apparent willingness to use military force and foreign aid to protect America from drugs .
This is a drug policy deviation as well as a foreign policy deviation , and Justin should be especially sensitive to the latter .
This is also a lesson for libertarians that compromising too much on one issue can lead to problems on others , which is one reason war is the health of the state .
When someone goes to Chernobyl he often misses one thing that could be of big interest and is located just a few miles away from the exploded nuclear power plant .
This one is one of the three alike built by Russian army in Russia during the iron curtain times .
It was used for some of their military purposes but as you can see is abandoned now .

It ’s a measure of how far CPU technology has come when you can buy a CPU with four cores on a single die for about $ 235 .
That would be the AMD Phenom X4 9850 Black Edition .
It ’s also true that for under $ 300 , you can buy an Intel quad - core CPU manufactured on a 45 nanometer ( nm ) process .
If you consider that the original Pentium processor , which ran at 66MHz ( and that was the high - end model ) , was built using an 800nm process , with a measly 3.1 million transistors — well , you get the idea .
And people spent upwards of 1,000 1993 dollars to buy one .
It ’s worth putting all this in perspective before we dive into the performance numbers of these two quad - core CPUs in our showdown today .
The Phenom X4 9850 Black Edition and Core 2 Quad Q9300 are capable products and faster than the generations preceding them .
One , of course , is faster than the other .
As you might predict , it ’s the more expensive one who ’s manufactured by the company starting with the letter “ I ” .
On the other hand , the new B3 stepping of the Phenom , even if you do n’t consider the critical TLB bug fix , just seems a little more well mannered than the original Phenom we reviewed back in December .
Rated at a 2.5GHz clock speed , our Phenom X4 9850 Black Edition is currently looping 3 Dmark06 at 2.8GHz — and the CPU fan is spinning at normal speeds .
Still , it ’s worth comparing performance between these two mainstream quad core CPUs .
Just for grins , we ’ll also toss in performance numbers of an Intel Core 2 E8500 dual core CPU , which also costs around $ 300 .

Sometime after the launch of XP , somewhere in Redmond , someone on the Microsoft design team was in the progress of developing something for Media Center .
It was believed to be too powerful for public consumption and forever archived in the servers at 1 Microsoft Way .
Now , a young hobbit man by the name of W3 bbo saw light of this unheard of theme , and traveled far and wide to uncover its mysteries .
One theme to find .
One theme to upload .
One theme to rule them all .
Devoted Channel9 member W3 bbo spotted an interesting theme on one of the “ people_ready ” television commercials airing in the Kingdoms .
After some dedicated searching , he finally uncovered this mystery Windows XP theme by Microsoft .
W3 bbo writes ,
During Royale ‘s development ( the XP Media Center theme ) , the graphic artists also produced a black version of the skin , sans the overused “ glass ” effect .
The result is an aesthetic black skin named “ Royale Noir ” , it even works with Office 2003 .
Since the skin was never released ( or reached final adjustments ) there are a few issues with it : some of the colors do n’t meet the overall “ feel ” ( they ’re too purple - ish compared to the greys of the bitmaps ) and the inactive titlebars are a little too dark .
You ’ll find it ’s been signed by Microsoft and does n’t require a custom UxTheme.dll in case there are any doubts as to its authenticity .
If you already have Royale installed , you ’ll need to remove it as both of these skins share the same name .
This skin has not been released to anyone outside Microsoft , until now .
Without a doubt , XP Media Center ’s Royale theme was a huge improvement over Luna .
It updated the cliché beveled look - and - feel if XP to a contemporary glossy style , whilst keeping similar color schemes and layouts .
In my opinion , it was the most usable non-standard XP theme available .
Royale Noir is an almost exact copy of Royale except with a dark purplish tint .
If Royale was day , Royale Noir is night .
No doubt about it , this is a ‘ dark ’ theme .
If you ’re the sort of person who likes bright and vivid colors , stay away from this theme .
As W3bbo pointed out , there are quite definitely issues with this theme due to its incompleteness .
The most obvious being , the “ Start ” button ’s hover and active states are unchanged from Royale , inconsistent with the purple tint surrounding .
However , there is even a color scheme for Office 2003 so it will not default to the blue Luna colors .
Looking at it from the big picture , Royale Noir is a welcomed alternative to the extremely small collection of verified - by - Microsoft XP themes .
However being incomplete , it is not recommended for the general consumers .
Enthusiasts are welcomed to try it to stand out from the crowd , but even still , you ’ll feel right at home with the familiar Luna / Royale style .

In experiments with mice , researchers have found that the body 's immune system can use a surprisingly common molecule to recognize prostate tumors .
The molecule comes from a protein found in all cells of the body ; however , immune cells appear to respond to it only when it is present on the surface of cells within a tumor .
Understanding how this protein , known as histone H4 , signals the immune system to respond to malignant cells may help researchers refine immunotherapy strategies that harness the body 's own immune system to fight tumors .
Some types of immunotherapy are already being tested in patients , but many questions remain unanswered .
In particular , researchers want to know if tumor cells display molecular signposts that tell the immune system , " I 'm a cancer cell , destroy me . "
Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator James P. Allison and his team report finding one such signpost in prostate tumors in mice .
The finding points toward possible improvements in immunotherapy .
" We know very little about how the immune system responds to tumors , especially early tumors , " said Allison , director of the Ludwig Center for Cancer Immunotherapy at Memorial Sloan - Kettering Cancer Center in New York .
" Is the tumor at that stage invisible , or can immune cells detect it ?
And if they can detect it , can they mount a response ?
Those are the two big questions . "
Allison 's research , published in the January 11 , 2008 , issue of Science , found that immune cells can , in fact , detect prostate cancer , at least in lab mice .
However , the immune system mounts only a feeble attack against the tumor .
But the signpost Allison 's team identified might make revving up that feeble response much easier .

The strategy relies on a specific type of immune system cell called a killer T cell .
Each of these cells bristles with thousands of receptors that recognize molecules that do not belong in the body .
When a T cell recognizes a foreign molecule , it tries to destroy the cell carrying it .
The T cell then replicates , making copies that also latch onto the same foreign molecule .
In 1982 , while at the University of Texas at Austin , Allison discovered T cell antigen receptors , the fork - like proteins that recognize the molecular signals on invading cells .
Each T cell has a different receptor as determined by genetics and a random process .
There are trillions of different T cell receptors possible , a number greater than the number of cells in the human body .
In normal tissue , the distribution of receptors found on T cells is random .
That is , a batch of T cells will have a range of receptors , with none being more common than the others .
But in the new work , one of Allison 's colleagues , Peter Savage , discovered that the cancerous prostate glands of mice harbored many T cells carrying a specific receptor .
That meant that a single T cell had recognized the malignancy and had replicated .
Savage found the overrepresented receptor in 15 of 20 mice with prostate cancer .
" That told us something was going on , " said Allison .
" You do n't see this in normal mice . "
At this point , the team knew that the immune system of the mice was recognizing a particular signpost of malignancy .
But they had no idea what the signpost was .
advertisement
" The obvious question was , ' What are these T cells seeing ? ' " said Allison .
" And that 's when the hard work started . "
The team chopped up tumor cells in a dish and mixed them with antigen presenting cells and T cells carrying the receptor they had identified .
The T cells switched on , which " showed we had really gotten the right receptor , " said Allison .
However , during control experiments , the team also found that nearly any type of tissue , if it was chopped up , would activate the T cells .
" This started some head scratching , " said Allison .
Because if every tissue activated the T cells , it meant that the signpost was not specific to the cancer cells .
The mystery deepened when mice were engineered to produce T cells that carried only the receptor of interest .
Those cells did not attack every tissue .
They only attacked -- albeit feebly -- the prostate tumors .
It was a conundrum .
Returning to their experiments in the lab dish , the team decided to focus on specific parts of the tumor cells .
They soon discovered that only molecules from the nucleus activated their T cells .
" This was really a surprise , because normally , nuclear proteins do n't get fed onto the cell surface , " said Allison .
And in living animals , T cells only recognize molecules on the surface of other cells -- they can't peer deep into the nucleus .
The team then searched for particular nuclear proteins that activated the T cells .
They eventually struck on histone H4 .
As the wrapper that sheaths the DNA inside all cells , histones are abundant in the nucleus .
The finding explained why the normal cells , when chopped up , had activated the T cells -- their histones were being exposed .
The team had identified the molecular signpost that activated the T cells , but they had also landed on another big question -- how do the histones rise to the surface of the tumor cells .
" Every cell has a ton of histone , and we just do n't know why the tumor cells put it on their surface , " said Allison .
The team is now examining the blood of patients with prostate and other cancers to see if people , like mice , carry T cells sensitive to histone .
If so , " then we can take those cells out and try to activate them , " said Allison .
" Those cells already recognize the tumor .
If we can mobilize them , maybe it will have a therapeutic effect . "
Allison and his colleagues are also conducting studies to determine whether the presence of histone H4 - reactive T cells in the blood could be used as a diagnostic marker for the early detection of prostate cancer .
This tier gets you all above rewards , , and every game we 've made so far and their soundtracks if available :
This is a massive endeavor , easily the biggest project we 've ever taken on .
Big projects are very risky and very hard to make estimates for .
So instead of doing an all - or - nothing campaign , we 're taking it little by little , creating the game in small milestones , and delivering what we make to everyone that funds it ... experiments , prototypes , concept art , dino animations , music , YOU GET IT ALL .
And if the stars are aligned , we 'll make it to the very end , to the ultimate goal - a game we will be proud to call DINO RUN 2 .
Dino Run 2 is a hyper - evolved pixel - art single and multiplayer platformer with procedurally generated terrain , multiple dino types to play as with different strengths and skills , tons of character customization , and most importantly an unstoppable doom wall that 's constantly on your tail .
FAQ
Q : So are you raising money for the full game ?
A :
Not yet .
This current campaign is to fund and deliver the initial stages of game development - the exciting part where we discover how the game will work , look , sound and feel .
Whatever we produce , funders will get : concept art , music , animations , physics tests , playable prototypes and alphas .
Right now our current alpha is called STEGOBALL :
in - game funding system
Q : So the final game will be FREE ?
Free - to - play is gross .
A :
... and you can play this right now by becoming a funder .
Stegoball will continue to evolve until it becomes a single playable level of Dino Run 2 , and then we 'll just keep going from there .
We 're also raising money to create thethat will take us all the way to the end , which is explained below :
We know .
Our goal is nothing short of re-inventing the F2P model , by introducing the concept of In - Game - Crowdfunding .
Here are the basics :
1 ) On this site , people are currently contributing money towards the development of the game according to the current reward tiers .
They are getting mostly out - of - game perks & rewards , since we do n't have much of a game yet .
2 ) When Dino Run 2 is far enough along to warrant it , we will put all these existing funding tiers ( and more ) inside the game , and people will fund its development from within the game itself .
3 ) You will not be paying real money for extra content like playable dinos , new eras , temporary boosts , lootboxes or anything else that is typical F2P .
Rather , you will get special in - game perks like multiplayer prestige ( high rank + name treatments visible to all other players ) , and credit to spend on extensive customization unlocks like hats , skins , colors , species variations , special effects , etc .
4 ) Nothing is consumable , nothing is temporary .
As you contribute more ( in - game , or out - of - game on this site ) , the game will remember your total contribution and you will slowly gain more and more reward tiers and goodies within the game .
This funding model keeps the core features of the game free , which is important for a robust multiplayer experience and onboarding new players ( and eventual funders ) , but also supports the development long term .
As long as people are playing and supporting it , we will be improving and expanding it .
Q : Why are n't you using an established crowdfunding platform ?
A :
We are !
We are covering all the bases : you can support our Patreon campaign right now , and earlier in 2018 we wrapped up a round of funding on Kickstarter .
The funds from those 2 campaigns are rolled into this one .
We maintain and update all the various ways of funding and promoting , but this one is the headquarters for our main operation .
Q : What 's with the roadmap ?
A :
This is the heart of our campaign , and we encourage everyone to click on it to explore the full - screen version .
From here you 'll be able to see exactly what we are targeting with each funding goal .
If you click on Progress Report , you 'll get a more detailed task list that details how we intend to achieve that goal .
Q : Is this all - or - nothing ?
What happens when I contribute money ?
A :
This campaign is NOT all - or - nothing .
All contributions made through this site will be immediately charged / debited and you will instantly receive any rewards you qualify for , in addtion to access to the process of making Dino Run 2 and any deliverables it creates .
Q : I 'd like to contribute now , and then more later if things are going well .
What happens when I fund it more than once ?
A :
As long as you enter the same email address for both contributions , they will be totalled under a single " funder " and your rewards will aggregate as well .
For example if you contribute 10 now and 20 later , you will receive the 30 dollar tier if you use the same email address for both .
Q : I do n't have the means to contribute money , can I help ?
A :
Of course !
and you will receive email updates with action items to help us promote this project to the world .
Q : What happens if you raise more than 75 K ?
A :
We will add more milestones , all the way up to the full final game .
We will also carry over this campaign to inside the game , as described above .
[ The ' ambitious and unusual ' vector - based Vectrex console was one of the most intriguing game console failures of all time , and Loguidice and Barton continue their ' History Of Gaming Platforms ' series on Gamasutra , started with the Commodore 64 , by analyzing the rise , fall , and legacy of the cult ' 80s console . ]
One of the most ambitious and unusual videogame systems ever released , GCE 's vector - based Vectrex failed to win massive audiences , like the Atari 2600 Video Computer System ( VCS ) or the Nintendo Entertainment System ( NES ) did .
Nevertheless , the distinctive platform gained a cult following after being pulled from the market in 1984 , two years after its debut , and now enjoys one of the finest homebrew development scenes of any vintage system .
History
The annals of videogame and computer history are littered with promising and ambitious systems that inexplicably flopped on the market , only later garnering the attention and passion of dedicated collectors and enthusiasts .
However , the bulk of these obscure platforms are valued mostly for nostalgic reasons ; only a precious few attract the time and energy of serious homebrew enthusiasts who continue to develop and release software for their favorite system long after it has disappeared from store shelves .
GCE 's Vectrex is one such system .
Debuting just two years before The Great Videogame Crash of 1984 , it soon joined many lesser systems in the bargain bins of toy stores across the nation .
The media was saturated with reports and speculations about the demise of the videogame industry , and the Vectrex was sucked into the vortex of bad publicity and uninformed opinion .
Yet the Vectrex deserved and continues to deserve more attention than the hordes of cheap , me - too game systems and E.T.
The Extra-Terrestrial cartridges of the early 1980s .
It is , after all , unique among programmable videogame systems , falling somewhere between a television - based console and a handheld in terms of design .
The Vectrex is a self - contained AC - powered transportable videogame unit that displays unique vector graphics on a built - in monitor .
These vector graphics , which are essentially lines of light , have a timeless appeal that typical raster graphics , which consist of small pixels or blocks , can't duplicate .
The Vectrex took the road less traveled , and was the better for it .
The system got its start in late 1980 , when one of the hardware designers at Western Technologies ( Smith Engineering ) , John Ross , had a light bulb go off -- or , to be more precise , a surplus one - inch Cathode Ray Tube ( CRT ) .
He took his idea to company head , Jay Smith , who had designed the ill - fated Microvision for Milton Bradley in 1979 , the first cartridge - based handheld videogame system .
Smith was impressed with Ross 's idea , and his company shopped around a plan for a new type of handheld dubbed the Mini Arcade .
In early 1981 , the Mini Arcade concept was offered to toymaker Kenner , who wanted a five - inch screen and a less portable design in which the CRT would sit on a stand with the controls on the bottom .
However , Kenner soon canceled further development , so Western Technologies shopped the idea again .
Western Technologies redesigned the system as a tabletop , and later that year General Consumer Electronics ( GCE ) licensed it for production -- though now with a nine - inch screen .
The system went through several name changes due to copyright and marketing concerns before assuming the now familiar moniker .
After a very compressed and hectic hardware and software development period , the GCE Vectrex was officially unveiled at the Summer Consumer Electronics Show ( SCES ) in Chicago , June 1982 , to positive notice , and released to the public in November , just in time for the holidays .
" The president has made a disappointing speech that does not match up to the global challenge , " Gabriel said Thursday , April 17 , in reference to Bush 's announcement a day priop on US emissions policy .
In his speech , Bush called for the growth in US greenhouse gas emissions to be stopped by 2025 " and begin to reverse thereafter , so long as technology continues to advance . "
Bush said this were " realistic goals , " whereas " the wrong way is to raise taxes , duplicate mandates , or demand sudden and drastic emissions cuts that have no chance of being realized and every chance of hurting our economy . "
The US president 's words marked a backward step from the United Nations climate conference held in Bali in December , where the US delegation made a last - minute decision to support a final summit document after previously opposing it , Gabriel said .
A need for caps
Bush is n't leading as far as Gabriel is concerned
The German environment minister criticized Bush 's refusal to back legislation to cap greenhouse - gas emissions .
" Without binding upper limits and reductions targets for the industrialized countries , climate change will not be stopped , " Gabriel said .
" Europe and the US must take the lead if others are to follow .
" Instead , with his proposals , the president is limping hopelessly behind , " he added .
" We are glad that there are other voices in the US . "
Stepping backwards
The environment minister noted that the third meeting of the 16 so - called Major Economies ( MEM ) ( formerly Major Emitters Meeting ) was taking place in Paris on Thursday and Friday , and said Bush 's speech ran the risk of undermining a process initiated by the US itself .
MEM aims to draw together the Group of Eight ( G8 ) countries with major developing economies , such as China , India and Brazil , to combat climate change .
Together , the 16 countries account for some 80 percent of world greenhouse - gas emissions .
Bush proposed the initiative ahead of the G8 summit in Heiligendamm in June last year as a counterproposal to the Kyoto Protocol and MEM was launched in September .
By now you have heard the news : Photoshop CS4 will not be 64 - bit on the Mac , but will be 64 - bit on Windows .
I discussed the dawn of the 64 - bit age and the end of Carbon in my Leopard review , concluding the section with this warning .
In the end , Apple made the hard choice instead of the easy one .
I think it will pay off , though the short - term consequences could be pretty grim .
After all , just look at how long it 's tak[en ] to get an Intel - native version of Microsoft Office for the Mac .
Should we expect a 64 - bit Cocoa version in , say , 2012 ?
And I have no idea what Adobe 's going to do about 64 - bit versions of its products .
That 's many millions of lines of Carbon code between those two companies alone .
We may be in for a rough patch , so buckle up .
That lack of a 64 - bit Photoshop on the Mac is the first big bump .
I wrote that " I have no idea what Adobe 's going to do . "
It turns out that they chose the obvious answer : port to Cocoa .
The consequences are just as obvious : delay .
This is going to be a huge job for Adobe , and is likely the most complex and difficult Cocoa port ever attempted .
I can imagine it being surpassed only by a hypothetical Cocoa port of Microsoft Office .
But , of course , Office has no pressing need to be 64 - bit ; Photoshop does .
So now we wait .
The speed advantage of 64 - bit code on Intel 's x86_64 processors makes this wait particularly galling .
The lack of a 64 - bit Photoshop on the Mac does n't just affect those who work with huge files .
It represents a blanket 8 - 12 % speed hit for Mac users when compared with Windows users running Photoshop on the same hardware .
Given these unfortunate facts , some assignment of blame is inevitable .
Here are the two poles of this world of hurt :
Blame Apple : If Apple had not discontinued the 64 - bit port of Carbon , Adobe could have shipped Photoshop CS4 as a 64 - bit Mac OS X application as planned .
At WWDC 2006 , there were many sessions about developing 64 - bit Carbon applications .
At WWDC 2007 , 64 - bit Carbon was canceled .
Adobe found this out the same time everyone else did , at WWDC .
By canceling 64 - bit Carbon so suddenly , Apple screwed Adobe .
Blame Adobe : The death of Carbon was inevitable .
Adobe should have seen it coming and planned accordingly .
It 's been clear for years that Cocoa offers many advantages to Mac application developers .
Adobe should have started its Cocoa port of Photoshop years ago .
By willfully ignoring Cocoa for so long , Adobe screwed Apple .
As usual , there 's some truth to both points of view .
But the key to understanding this situation — and therefore to knowing how best to apportion blame — is to look to the past .
The end of the innocence
The defining event of the Jobs 2.0 era relationship between Apple and Adobe was the creation and subsequent scuttling of the Rhapsody project .
Rhapsody was Apple 's original plan for a new operating system based on the recently purchased NeXT technology .
Rhapsody 's proposition for Mac software developers was simple : write your applications using these NeXT - derived APIs .
These are the APIs that eventually became Cocoa , and there was much to recommend them even back then .
But for Mac developers with substantial existing code bases , the proposition was more aptly phrased , " rewrite your applications using these NeXT - derived APIs . "
It was a hard sell , to be sure .
The sweetener that Apple hoped would push the deal over the top was that applications written using this API could also be compiled to run on Windows .
And so the complete pitch to the Adobes and Microsofts of the world was this : rewrite your huge existing applications using these APIs and end up with a single code base for both Mac and Windows .
Alternately , just rewrite the Mac versions of your applications using these new APIs .
The answer from the Mac development community was , essentially , " Yeah , uh , no thanks . "
Remember , this is the Apple of the late 1990s , its power and influence at an all - time low .
It 's hard to imagine a company like Adobe or ( even more laughably )
Microsoft betting the future of its flagship software products on 1997 - Apple 's ability to ship and support a " new " API ( its NeXT origins and history counting for little among this crowd ) .
This is after years and years of Apple demonstrating a complete inability to ship a modern replacement for its aging operating system .
As for rewriting just their Mac applications using a new API , even that represented a tremendous investment of time and resources for a platform that could very well be on its way out .
So yeah , no thanks , Apple .
We 'll take a pass .
And so Rhapsody was shelved , and Apple 's operating system strategy was revised yet again — blessedly , for the last time .
There 'd be no Mac / Windows cross-platform API , but there would be a new compatibility API that would let existing Mac applications be recompiled to run on the new OS with only minor modifications ( for some definitions of " minor " ) .
Thus , Mac OS X was born , and with it , Carbon .
But by then , there was no going back for either party .
All their intentions had been laid bare .
On the one hand you had Apple , née NeXT , which had revealed its inner-most fantasies for the future of Mac development , an inflated idea of its own platform 's importance , and a startling disregard for the problems of third - party developers .
And on the other , you had the big third - party developers that were finally forced to put politeness , friendship , and ( in some cases ) emotional attachment aside and tell some hard truths to Apple .
This is the defining moment .
This is the schism .
This is when old friends were forced to realize how far they 'd drifted apart , and what they really thought of each other .
In the case of Adobe , it was particularly painful .
Apple was used to playing hardball with Microsoft , but Adobe was always a friend .
Apple and Adobe grew up together , and owe much of their success — indeed , perhaps their entire existences — to each other .
Carbon and the eventual success of Mac OS X helped move things forward .
Everyone tried to forgive and forget .
But it 's all still there , barely under the surface : the inner children of Adobe and Apple still sulking , arms crossed , in their respective corners .
This tension is evident in all dealings between Apple and Adobe .
It 's the thing left unsaid as minor disagreements take on an extra edge of animosity .
Imagine thought bubbles below all the actual spoken text in a corporate comic strip .
Apple : " You did n't want my new API .
I was in trouble .
I needed your help and you rejected me . "
Adobe : " You wanted me to risk everything for you .
Though I wanted to help , I just could n't afford to do it , and now you have the nerve to be mad about it .
I give and I give but you always want more . "
Hindsight
And so we come back to the cancellation of 64 - bit Carbon and its consequences for Adobe and Apple .
I said earlier that Apple made the hard choice , but also the correct one .
Long - term , maintenance of two full - featured GUI APIs for Mac OS X is an untenable situation .
Carbon is , was , and always has been a transitional API , though of course it could not be presented as such for political reasons in the wake of the Rhapsody misfire .
The choice was hard not just because it hurts Adobe and Microsoft , but also because it hurts Apple itself .
Apple has its own extremely large Carbon applications , at least one of which is aching to be 64 - bit : Final Cut Pro .
If I 'm being cynical , however , I can't help but notice the playing field is not exactly level .
When I suggested to some people at Adobe that Apple could perhaps continue its partially complete work on 64 - bit Carbon and bury the resulting code inside ( for example ) the private ProKit .
framework shared by Final Cut Pro and other Apple applications , I 'm pretty sure I could hear several sets of teeth grinding .
I think this scenario is highly unlikely , but the fact that it 's even technically possible highlights the inherent inequities of the relationship — and once again pokes a stick into some old wounds .
For my part , I 'm like the mutual friend that just wishes these two crazy kids could work things out .
As I 've said , I think Apple 's decision to sunset Carbon was the right one .
I 'm also sorely disappointed that Adobe did n't start its Cocoa porting efforts until forced to by external events .
But does this mean that I blame Adobe for this decision ?
Put another way , though it may not have done what I wanted , did Adobe do what 's best for Adobe ?
My initial instinct is to say no .
It certainly seems like Adobe would have been better served to start down the Cocoa path years ago , if only as a skunkworks project running in the background .
Again , the corporate psychoanalytical angle inevitably resurfaces .
Here 's what I would have said to Adobe circa 2003 : " Dammit , Adobe , I know you 're still sore about Apple 's attempt to push those NeXT APIs down your throat , and I know you 're annoyed by Apple 's constant passive - aggressive behavior since then , but you 're hurting your Mac customers by willfully ignoring the API that Apple so clearly still wants you to use .
If you 're sick of all the bullshit , then just get off the platform .
But if you intend to stay , it 's time to get on the Cocoa train .
Someday , you may have no choice .
Apple 's a lot more powerful now than it was in 1997 , especially with all this iPod stuff starting to take off .
Swallow your pride and at least start looking into this Cocoa thing . "
But there would have been risks to that approach as well .
To make any meaningful progress on a Cocoa port , significant resources would have to be shifted to the project .
Cocoa has also evolved a lot in the past few years , which means there would have been a baseline cost for Adobe just to stay above water .
Now let 's look at the risks of doing nothing until forced .
We 've pretty much had the worst case scenario play out for Adobe .
All signals were pointing to a smooth 64 - bit upgrade path for Carbon Photoshop until a sudden revelation at WWDC 2007 dashed all plans and a Cocoa port had to be started immediately .
That means no 64 - bit Photoshop CS4 for the Mac , and no guarantee that the 64 - bit Cocoa port will be ready in time for CS5 .
The cost to Mac users is clear , but what 's the cost to Adobe ?
Will Mac users refuse to buy CS4 because it 's not 64 - bit ?
If so , what will they buy instead ?
CS4 for Windows ?
Nothing at all ?
Try as I might , I cannot convince myself that the sales lost due to the decision to keep Photoshop on Carbon until forced to do otherwise even comes close to outweighing the benefits to Adobe of this approach .
During all the years it was n't porting to Cocoa , Adobe had more time , money , and resources for all its other projects .
And though it 's not currently able to deliver a 64 - bit Photoshop to Mac customers , I believe Adobe will sell a copy of either the Mac 32 - bit version or the Windows 64 - bit version to nearly all the people who would have actually purchased a 64 - bit version of CS4 for the Mac .
The lack of a serious Photoshop competitor is ultimately what saves Adobe , and what makes its decision financially and strategically sound , even as it annoys and disappoints many of its customers .
Speculative fiction / friends forever ( ? )
This leads nicely to the final piece of the puzzle .
Imagine if , around 2003 , Apple had embarked on a secret project to build a serious Photoshop competitor using Cocoa .
Further imagine that this competitor was released , in 64 - bit - capable form , just as Adobe was forced to announce to the world that its Carbon - only Photoshop strategy had finally reached its limit .
Even if Apple 's Photoshop - killer version 1.0 was a dog , it 'd soak up a significant number of disgruntled Mac Photoshop customers , perhaps enough to outweigh the historic benefits Adobe reaped by delaying its Cocoa efforts .
To the best of my knowledge , no such project exists at Apple .
Though Apple 's relations with Adobe told it that Photoshop on the Mac should not be taken for granted , and that Adobe was " not enthusiastic " ( ahem ) about adopting Apple 's favorite API , no plan was made to supplant Photoshop with an Apple - controlled alternative .
( Premiere , on the other hand ... )
In the end , both Apple and Adobe chose not to mitigate their risks with expensive long - term projects .
Adobe believed its investment in Carbon would be protected .
Just as Apple created Carbon in the first place to help Adobe , so too would it stand by its friend by bringing the framework into the 64 - bit era .
And Apple , for its part , continued to believe that its gentle persuasion would eventually bring Adobe around to the Cocoa side of the fence .
For all the bad blood and unfortunate consequences , it 's somewhat heartening to realize that the two companies ' faith in each other so thoroughly informed their decisions .
( Of course , if Apple does turn out to have a Photoshop killer in the works , it 'll be clear who really had more faith in whom . )
Sizing up the competition
The Cocoa port of Photoshop has disaster written all over it .
It 's tempting to count Adobe out at this point , but that 'd be a big mistake .
Recall when Apple released Aperture 1.0 to , er , less than universal praise .
My reaction was to boldly predict that " Aperture will go on to become an extremely successful product , perhaps even the dominant application for professional photographers in the coming years . "
My reasoning was straightforward : Apple had proven its ability to create successful professional applications even in markets with strong existing competitors , and Aperture 's market - defining design meant that it had almost no direct competition .
To come at it from another angle , I thought Apple had a big head start with Aperture , and I simply did n't believe that Adobe , or anyone else could catch it .
I was wrong .
Lightroom came seemingly from nowhere and capitalized on all of Apple 's Aperture 1.0 mistakes .
Lightroom 1.0 was a Cocoa application , and a damned good one .
Apple bounced back with Aperture 2.0 , but just as quickly Adobe has responded with Lightroom 2.0 .
And oh , by the way , unlike Aperture , Lightroom 2.0 is 64 - bit .
The new sound I hear is Apple gulping .
I see no signs of the Rhapsody schism being fully mended any time soon .
Apple and Adobe will continue to eye each other warily for many years to come , the battle lines being drawn ever more clearly .
If you need a reason to be optimistic about Adobe 's Cocoa port of Photoshop , look no further than Lightroom .
If you 'd like to wallow in depression , consider the ever - decreasing areas of shared interest between Apple and Adobe .
In particular , ponder Adobe 's newfound desire to define its own platforms , first with Flash and now with AIR which is starting to quietly make its way into Adobe 's flagship desktop applications .
For all the turmoil over Photoshop and Cocoa , the real storm may be yet to come .

The 58 - year - old said Sir Terry , who lives in a mansion in Hertfordshire , deserved a taste of his own medicine .
She plans to turn the site of the Tesco boss 's house into a community garden .
The grandmother lives on Spicer Grove where there are a mix of bungalows and houses , which would be bought under a compulsory purchase order and demolished under the plans .
She helped set up a housing co-operative which was given government money to build the homes , which were finished in 1992 .
I want Sir Terry to have a taste of what we have to put up with
Dot Reid
She said : " These are more than just houses , they are homes .
" I have been living under the threat of losing my home for 18 months now and it is very stressful .
" I want Sir Terry to have a taste of what we have to put up with .
" When we found out about the plans by Tesco and Everton , we thought it was disgusting . "
Mrs Reid has submitted an application to Welwyn Hatfield Borough Council in Hertfordshire for permission to demolish Sir Terry 's 1930s mansion in Cuffley .
' Publicity stunt '
Mrs Reid has plans for the site .
" It 's going be a nice community area .
Trees and ponds and a little play area for the children , somewhere for the old people to go and sit and relax . "
A council spokeswoman said : " Welwyn Hatfield Borough Council has received a planning application from a resident of Kirkby relating to the demolition of a property in Cuffley and use of the space as a community garden .
" This application will go through the normal planning process . "
A spokesman for Tesco said : " This is just a publicity stunt .
" Unlike this application , for our application we spoke to hundreds , if not thousands , of residents in Kirkby , the vast majority of whom recognise this is a once - in - a - lifetime opportunity which will create 2,000 jobs . "

What are these ?
By David T. Z. Mindich , AlterNet
On a cold January morning in 1933 , Adolf Hitler was sworn in as chancellor of one of the world ’s great democracies .
While the world has duly noted its 75th anniversary last month , it is not the cold January morning but a hot February night that should command our greatest attention .
It was 75 years ago this week that the parliament building , the Reichstag , was set ablaze .
As the Reichstag burned , Hitler was busy converting the chancellorship into a dictatorship .
As we engage in the democratic process of picking a new president , a look back at Hitler ’s dizzying rise is an instructive reminder of the fragility of democracy , then and now .
During the period of long simmering fears over an amorphous international threat — communism — German opposition forces were willing to give Hitler the chancellorship despite his capturing only a minority of votes during the recent election .
But it was the Feb .
27 Reichstag fire , a fire that the Nazis accused a Dutch Communist of setting , that sent the country on a quick road to fascism .
Within 60 days , Hitler had begun the process of arbitrary arrests , warrantless surveillance and searches , incarceration without charges , suspension of habeas corpus , the implementation of torture , the mustering of a private army , and was pushing through the passage of the “ Enabling Act , ” which gave Hitler and his henchmen the power to ignore the legislative branch and write laws themselves .
We are not a fascist country .
Nobody is contemplating the mass arrest or elimination of Communists , Jews , or any other groups .
To compare our secret prisons , our warrantless spying , our suspensions of habeas corpus , our torture , our mercenaries , and our “ signing statements ” that flout legislative laws to theirs is a dangerous oversimplification .
To compare Bush to Hitler — Hugo Chavez - like — insults the memory of Hitler ’s victims .
And yet , the parallels are worth noting .
As the fire raged in the Reichstag , and Hitler was fanning the flames of fear , Germans made a decision that can be summed up by words from Benjamin Franklin ’s 18th century aphorism : they chose to “ give up Essential Liberty to purchase a little Temporary Safety ” and they received neither .
What the Reichstag fire reminds us is how tenuous democracy can be .
Today , we still live in a democracy , and we still live freely , as the Germans did before the Reichstag fire .
But what will America look like after —
God forbid — another 9/11 or the equivalent of the Reichstag fire ?
Sandra Day O’Connor once said , “ It takes a lot of degeneration before a country falls into dictatorship .
But we should avoid these ends by avoiding these beginnings . ”
Marc vander
Heyden , the former president of my college , a man whose Belgian family hid another family from the Nazis , used to warn students and faculty that “ we are always one generation away from barbarism . ”
In Germany , it took less than a generation ; it took a maniac , a fire , and terrified country to tip a democracy into dictatorship .

This week ’s report covers changes from 10 Mar 2008 to 16 Mar 2008 ( the day the corresponding Rails Envy podcast was recorded ) .
Custom JavaScript and stylesheet symbols
Remember how you can do something like :
javascript_include_tag : defaults
and Rails would load all the Prototype JavaScript files and your application.js ?
You can now register your own custom expansion symbol too :
# In a Rails initializer .
ActionView : : Helpers :: AssetTagHelper.register_javascript_expansion : yui => [ ' yahoo ' , ' autocomplete ' , ' calendar ' ] #
In your view .
javascript_include_tag :yui
would result in :
< script type =" text / javascript " src= " /javascripts/yahoo.js " ></ script > < script type =" text/ javascript " src= " /javascripts/autocomplete.js " ></ script > < script type =" text/ javascript " src= " /javascripts/calendar.js " ></ script >
You can do the same with the stylesheet_link_tag by registering a custom expansion symbol via register_stylesheet_expansion .
This is useful for anyone but in particular plugin developers who have a multiple asset files would appreciate being able to tell users to include JavaScript or stylesheets using a single symbol .
Warning :
This patch currently breaks the default symbols like : all ( check out the ticket for more info ) .

Sexy default timestamps in migrations
Remember how you can say timestamps in a migration and Rails will create the ' created_at ' and ' updated_at ' columns for you ?
You can now also do add_timestamps : table_name and remove_timestamps : table_name in your migrations if you decide to add these columns later to a table :
def self .up add_timestamps : posts end def self .
down remove_timestamps : posts end
Related changeset : http://dev.rubyonrails.org/changeset/9014
ActiveRecord :: Base # find ( : last )
Just like Comment. find ( : first ) , you can now do something like Comment. find ( : last ) .
There 's some controversy over whether this is bloat , but DHH makes a good case for it with this example :
class Person has_many : comments , :order => ' created_at ' end @some_person.comments.find(:last ) # =>
Returns the most recent comment .

Database rake tasks fixes
rake db : create used to ignore the ' charset ' and ' collation ' options in your database .
yml configuration file .
This has been fixed so that your created databases now respect those options .
rake db : drop and rake db : migrate : reset also no longer crash with an unhelpful exception if the database has already been dropped , and instead shows a proper error message .

Rails ' logger now creates the log directory if it does n't exist
This is a blessing to those of us who use version control systems that do n't support empty directories ( like Git ) .
Rails ' default logger ( the BufferedLogger ) , now creates a log / directory if it does n't already exist .
This should save you the step of creating / symlinking a log / directory ( or symlinking ) on deploy .

As usual , let me know of any inaccuracies or any suggestions you may have in the comments !
For indispensable reporting on the coronavirus crisis , the election , and more , subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily newsletter .
A decade and a year after Enrico Fermi demonstrated the first atomic fission chain reaction , President Dwight D. Eisenhower went before the United Nations General Assembly to avert an apocalypse .
Other nations now had in their hands the weapon with which the United States had pulverized two Japanese cities ; altruistic scientists and eager investors both had pressured the president to share the technology for peaceful uses .
And so Eisenhower had little choice on that December day in 1953 but to announce a new purpose for the force inside the atom : Properly monitored and generously financed , he declared in his “ Atoms for Peace ” address , fission could be harnessed “ to provide abundant electrical energy in the power - starved areas of the world . ”
You could have been forgiven for thinking the president and his advisers had just hatched the notion that month , so full of poetic wonder and portent was that speech .
In fact , not only were the Soviets about to power up a five - megawatt reactor , but the Westinghouse Electric Corporation was well on its way to building the country ’s first commercial atomic power plant .
Within five years , the Shippingport Atomic Power Station would begin sending its 60 megawatts of electricity to the city of Pittsburgh .
That was probably about the best atomic power ever looked .
For it was n’t long before the electricity touted as “ too cheap to meter ” proved too pricey for profit :
The power that came out of Shippingport cost 10 times the going rate .
Though in the coming years many more reactors would be hitched to the nation ’s grid , Eisenhower ’s gallant dreams were undone by rising construction costs , high maintenance bills , and risk .
The last application for a new nuclear plant was withdrawn in 1978 .
By the time Three Mile Island nearly melted down in 1979 , the United States was through with nuclear - generated electricity .
Until now .
When President George W. Bush celebrated the Energy Policy Act of 2005 at the Calvert Cliffs nuclear plant in Maryland , he may as well have been delivering the 21st - century update of Eisenhower ’s 1953 manifesto , minus the poetry , and plus some dopey jokes .
( “ Pass the Mayo , ” he chirped to Constellation Energy CEO Mayo Shattuck . )
This time , however , the marketing slogan was not about peace , but the very future of the planet .
“ Without these nuclear plants , ” Bush said , “ America would release nearly 700 million metric tons more carbon dioxide into the air each year . ”
Half a century after Shippingport powered up , the U.S. government has once again entwined its long fingers under the heel of the big industry that could n’t .
In his day , Eisenhower shared his vision with a number of vocal pacifists : Redirecting atomic power to electricity , they believed , would at least keep the military occupied with something other than blowing up cities .
And Bush shares his vision with some prominent environmentalists : Stewart Brand , for instance , who founded the Whole Earth Catalog and Fred Krupp , the director of the Environmental Defense Fund , who believes that “ the challenge of global warming is so urgent we ca n’t afford to take anything off the table . ”
As far back as 1978 , Tom Alexander — an award - winning science writer with a deep knowledge of economics and ecology — urged utilities in the pages of Fortune to resuscitate the already - flagging nuclear industry lest a ramp - up in coal - fired electricity “ trigger irreversible changes in the world ’s climate . ”
The ramp - up happened on schedule ; the changes in climate too .
Which now makes it very hard to ignore the fact that whatever else nuclear power does to the environment , however many fish it kills or however much waste it leaves in our great - great - great - great - grandchildren ’s hands , it emits neither soot nor smoke nor mercury , and far less carbon dioxide than the coal that keeps most of our lights on .
Industry has been quick to take advantage of the shifting political climate : Last year , UniStar submitted an application for a new nuclear reactor to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission ( NRC ) , the first to cross the agency ’s desk since Jimmy Carter was president .
Four more followed , and 14 separate companies have notified the agency that they will file applications in the next year .
It ’s hard to imagine any of the current presidential candidates slashing nuclear subsidies once in office .
( Senator Barack Obama , for one , represents a state with 11 of the nation ’s 104 civilian reactors , and his donors include employees of nuclear giant Exelon . )
But can nuclear power really rescue our warming planet ?
And if you answered quickly , answer this too :
Are you for or against because you know the science , or because someone said you should be ?
When we talk about nuclear power these days , we talk about environmentalists for nukes , and about people posing as environmentalists for nukes .
We talk about Dick Cheney ’s energy bill defibrillating a faltering industry with $ 12 billion worth of incentives and tax breaks .
We talk about who is for and who is against , and whether we can trust them .
But no one talks about fission .
No one talks about the letter Albert Einstein wrote to FDR in 1939 , advising the president that “ it may become possible to set up a nuclear chain reaction in a large mass of uranium ” to produce enormous amounts of power .
No one mentions that breathtaking moment on December 2 , 1942 , when Fermi , on a squash court at the University of Chicago , had an assistant slowly pull a control rod from a pile of uranium and graphite , sustaining a controlled chain reaction for 28 minutes and thus securing atomic power ’s industrial future .
For the last four years , I have tried to shut out the chatter — the goofy Nuclear Energy Institute ad ( girl on a scooter says , “ Our generation is demanding lots of electricity … and clean air . ” ) , and the warnings of No Nukes godmother Helen Caldicott , who , rightly or wrongly , cannot think of splitting atoms without thinking of weapons .
I ’ve tried to focus instead on the awesome force that binds the nucleus and whether it can ever be an appropriate source of civilian energy .
The idea of nuclear power arose more than half a century ago out of the most noble impulses of humanity ’s brightest minds , scientists who hoped that the destructive force they ’d harnessed , the most concentrated source of energy on earth , could also be applied for good .
But atomic electricity strayed so far from its promise — corrupted by government ’s collusion with industry , mismanagement for the sake of profit , and ordinary bureaucratic incompetence — that we seem flummoxed at the thought of ever reclaiming it .
To consider a technology as terrifying as nuclear power requires more than slogans .
It requires looking beyond the marketing and activism , into the physics and its consequences .
It means thinking about rocks .
And waste .
And fission .
Hot Rocks , Warm Water
Like so many sources of energy , nuclear power begins with a rock — a brownish chunk of hard dirt , flecked with glittery particles .
You can hold uranium in your hand without much trouble :
As it decays into other elements — thorium , radium , and eventually lead — it throws off radioactive particles , but most of them ca n’t penetrate your skin .
Nor can they sustain a controlled chain reaction in most of the world ’s nuclear reactors .
For that , you need a certain neutron - rich uranium isotope , U - 235 , which makes up only a tiny portion of raw uranium ore .
Natural uranium comes out of the ground in Canada , Australia , Niger , and several other countries .
Uranium is finite , and it ’s not easy to find — as a consequence of the impending nuclear revival , mines that were once declared unprofitable may open once again , including some in the western United States .
This worries people who remember the last uranium boom in the Southwest : From the 1940s through the 1980s , more than 15,000 men , many of them Navajo , worked the mines , often without protection .
Many eventually came down with cancer or respiratory diseases .
Few were compensated .
When the mines closed , piles of uranium tailings were left mouldering along the Colorado River , leaching at least 15,000 gallons of toxic chemicals a day into water destined for taps in Arizona and California .
To be useful as nuclear fuel , uranium ore has to be refined into uranium oxide ( the yellowcake of Niger fame ) and then enriched — turned into pellets of 4 percent U - 235 .
The sole U.S. plant that enriches uranium for civilian power reactors , located in Paducah , Kentucky , accomplishes this via an energy - hogging process that consumes 15 billion kilowatt - hours of electricity a year .
Even so , carbon emissions for the entire nuclear fuel cycle come to no more than 55 grams of CO 2 per kilowatt - hour — roughly even with solar .
By 2010 , when the U.S. Enrichment Corporation is slated to switch to the more efficient method used in Europe , that number should come down closer to 12 grams per kilowatt - hour — on par with wind .
Nuclear power does have other environmental consequences , drawbacks that have nothing to do with carbon : Aside from radiation ( more on that later ) , a particularly delicate one involves cooling water .
“ Light water ” reactors , used at the majority of the world ’s nuclear plants ( so named because they employ ordinary H 2 O , as opposed to water made with a heavy hydrogen isotope ) , use water both to moderate the chain reaction and produce steam to spin turbines — 2 billion gallons per day on average .
Most of it returns to the adjoining river , lake , or ocean up to 25 degrees warmer , an ecological impact that could significantly interfere with nuclear power ’s chances as a climate - change solution .
Already , wherever a light - water reactor sits near a sensitive body of water , its intake pipes kill fish and its outflow distorts ecosystems to favor warm - water species .
The Cancer Conundrum
Will a nuclear reactor operating under normal conditions give you cancer ?
It ’s a question that , surprisingly , still has n’t been conclusively answered .
A 1995 Greenpeace study found an increase in breast - cancer mortality among women living near various U.S. and Canadian reactors in the Great Lakes region .
Yet peer - reviewed studies by the Ontario Cancer Treatment and Research Foundation as well as the National Cancer Institute show no significant increase in cancer among people living near reactors .
An initiative called the Tooth Fairy Project is currently trying to prove that concentrations of the radioactive isotope strontium - 90 are higher in baby teeth from children who grow up near nuclear plants .
But those tests are not complete , and no one else has turned up persuasive evidence of such a link .
“ Without a baseline study , we do n’t have any credibility ” on the cancer issue , longtime Southern California anti-nuclear activist Rochelle Becker once told me .
“ There are so many things wrong with the nuclear industry that are confirmable that we try to stay away from that . ”
We do know that nuclear plants routinely release small amounts of radioactive gases , and that those releases expose nearby residents to a small dose of radiation — one that the Health Physics Society , which governs radiation measurements , says will probably not increase their risk of getting cancer .
We know that elevated levels of radioactive tritium — which gets into water and is easily ingested — have been found downstream from nuclear facilities , and we know that the scientific consensus holds that no amount of radiation is good for you .
But we also know this : 24,000 Americans per year die of diseases related to emissions from coal - fired power plants , which release sulfur dioxide , smog - forming nitrogen , toxic soot , and mercury — not to mention 2.5 billion tons of carbon dioxide annually .
It ’s a devil of a dilemma :
One source of always - on “ base load ” power kills people every day .
Another kills people only if something goes terribly wrong .
And it could .
Accidents Happen
Early in the morning of March 28 , 1979 , a combination of malfunctioning equipment and inadequately trained workers led to a loss - of - coolant episode at Three Mile Island Unit 2 near Middletown , Pennsylvania .
Had workers not finally arrested the disaster 10 hours after it started , the fuel inside the reactor could have melted completely — the disaster scenario alluded to in the movie The China Syndrome , which had arrived in theaters just a few weeks before .
The partial meltdown and subsequent radiation leak was the worst nuclear accident ever on U.S. soil ; in its wake , public support for the technology dropped from 70 to 50 percent , where it remains today .
Industry proponents claim that no one died as a direct result of the accident , and in 1990 , a Columbia University study found no elevated radiation - related cancer risk in the population near the plant .
A later study , though , found a tenfold increase in cancer among the people who lived in the path of the radioactive plume .
Because of Three Mile Island , the night crew performing an ill - advised test at the Chernobyl plant on April 26 , 1986 , might have been prepared for a loss - of - coolant episode .
But they did n’t know enough about the plant they were tinkering with to have an idea what to do when things went grievously wrong .
The reactor exploded , and the fire spewed a massive cloud of radiation across Europe .
There are no reactors as fire - prone as Chernobyl in the United States , and reactor safeguards have been upgraded dramatically since Three Mile Island .
Emer­gency core-cooling systems kick in if other systems fail ; operators have been trained to respond promptly when something goes awry .
But just because what has already happened may not happen again does n’t mean we should relax : Human error has infinite permutations , and near misses in the last decade have shown just how vulnerable reactors remain .
In March 2002 , during a scheduled refueling outage at the Davis - Besse Nuclear Power Station in Ohio , workers discovered that boric acid deposits had gnawed a “ pineapple - sized ” hole into the six - inch - thick steel cap bolted to the top of the reactor .
Had the corrosion gone just a third of an inch deeper , radioactive steam would have flooded the containment dome , and Davis - Besse might have been the next Three Mile Island .
As frightening as the near - accident was the way Davis - Besse owners FirstEnergy and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission responded : by soft - pedaling procedural flaws and scapegoating plant workers , in particular Andrew Siemaszko , a systems engineer who they claimed had failed to report the corrosion .
The NRC has since barred Siemaszko from working in the nuclear industry , and in 2006 he was indicted on five counts of lying to the government and falsifying records .
But documents show that Siemaszko repeatedly told his employers the reactor head needed a thorough cleaning .
FirstEnergy did n’t complete that job because it was taking too long ( keeping the reactor idle was costing the company $ 1 million a day ) — and the NRC delayed a scheduled inspection of the reactor at FirstEnergy ’s request .
Watchdog or Lapdog ?
The Davis - Besse incident puts into sharp relief a history of regulatory neglect that goes back for decades .
The Union of Concerned Scientists ( UCS ) has counted 47 incidents since 1979 in which the NRC failed to adequately address issues at nuclear power plants — until the troubles got so bad the plants had to be shut down for repairs .
In some cases , “ the NRC allowed reactors with known safety problems to continue operating for months , sometimes years , without requiring owners to fix the problems . ”
There ’s evidence , too , that the commission has tolerated serious lapses in security , even after 9/11 .
In March 2007 , an anonymous whistleblower wrote a letter to the NRC claiming that guards at Exelon ’s Peach Bottom plant in Pennsylvania were “ coming into work exhausted after working excessive overtime ” and thus “ sleeping on duty at an alarming rate . ”
The NRC ignored the letter until a guard videotaped the naps in progress and WCBS in New York aired the tape .
The Project on Government Oversight claims a skilled infiltrator would need just 45 seconds to penetrate the area where Peach Bottom stores its spent fuel .
The corporation that provides those sleepy guards , Wackenhut , has also been accused of cheating on security exercises :
One DOE inspector general ’s report found that in 2003 guards had been tipped off in advance about security drills at a government nuclear facility in Oak Ridge , Tennessee .
The same year , Wackenhut was fired from Entergy ’s Indian Point plant in New York after guards there admitted they had been improperly armed and trained .
Critics often point out that the NRC is funded by industry fees ; despite his cautious support of nuclear power , Obama declared it “ a moribund agency … captive of the industries that it regulates . ”
( NRC spokesman Scott Burnell insists that because those fees come to the NRC through the U.S.
Treasury , there ’s no conflict of interest .
“ It ’s not a case where the industry is handing us a check , ” he says . )
Dave Lochbaum , UCS ’s nuclear - safety expert , believes the problem at the NRC is a lack of money — and congressional attention .
“ There have been more hearings on lunches in the White House , ” he notes , “ than on whether the NRC ’s doing a good job . ”
The French Connection
Just as there are arguments against public investment in nuclear power , there are arguments for it — and one huge living example .
France shifted from oil - burning electric plants to nuclear during the oil crisis of the early ’ 70s , and over the past 20 years it has invested $ 160 billion in nuclear programs , making the country the largest exporter of nuclear electricity in the European Union .
Sixteen percent of the world ’s nuclear power is generated in France .
And where once the French were buying nuclear technology from the United States , now it ’s the other way round : 6 of the 20 applications expected to be submitted to the NRC before 2010 are for the U.S. Evolutionary Power Reactor ( EPR ) designed by the French conglomerate Areva .
Instead of just two coolant loops like the traditional “ Generation II ” reactor , the EPR has four .
If one leaks , another kicks in : No more Three Mile Islands .
“ The EPR has more defensive depth than reactors created for the U.S. market , ” acknowledges Edwin Lyman , a senior scientist at the UCS .
His cautious approval of the EPR is significant :
Two years ago , Dan Hirsch of the anti-nuclear group Committee to Bridge the Gap warned me not to make too much of the alleged environmentalist enthusiasm for nuclear power .
“ All of the people supporting it now supported it before , ” he argued .
“ It ’s not news .
But when the Union of Concerned Scientists comes out in favor of nuclear , now that will be news . ”
That has n’t happened exactly :
The UCS remains ambivalent about nuclear power , and its position papers reflect deep worries about the technology .
But as far as the UCS is capable of liking a reactor , it likes the EPR .
Lyman stresses that the EPR ’s improved safety does n’t mean that Areva “ is a warm and fuzzy company . ”
It only means it designed the EPR to meet the safety standards of the European Union , which happen to be better than ours .
“ The NRC ’s whole presumption is that the current reactors are safe enough , ” Lyman explains .
“ The NRC is afraid that if it makes too much fuss about how the new ones are safer than old ones , it will mean that the old ones are n’t safe enough .
“ An opportunity is being squandered , ” he adds .
“ If this renaissance is going to happen , you ’re going to build a new fleet of reactors to last 60 , 80 , 100 years .
Why not lock in a safer reactor design ? ”
The $ 50 Billion Question
In 1960 , the price of a brand - new light - water reactor hovered around $ 68 million , just under what it cost to build a new coal plant at the time .
( Actual costs were often higher , but eager manufacturers offered “ turnkey ” plants at a fixed price , absorbing any overruns . )
Having recouped their start - up costs , these older reactors now produce electricity — a fifth of the country ’s power , all in all — at prices that easily compete with coal .
But a new plant will have a harder time breaking even :
An Areva reactor may start at $ 3 or $ 4 billion , already twice as much as a coal plant , but actual construction costs and interest will probably boost total plant cost to $ 9 billion .
Which is why not a single one will get built without help from the government , says Craig Nesbit of Chicago - based Exelon .
“ These are huge capital projects , ” he says .
“ The largest capital projects on a private scale you can build .
We would n’t be building them without loan guarantees . ”
Nuclear lobbyists have been asking for $ 50 billion in such guarantees , which , they point out , are given to other industries , including wind and solar : “ There ’s nothing exotic about it , ” Nesbit says .
Companies also want “ production tax credits ” for the actual power they generate , on the order of a penny or two per kilowatt , also akin to wind energy .
So far , Congress has pledged up to $ 6 billion worth of production tax credits for new nuclear plants .
But in 2007 , it capped loan guarantees for plant construction at $ 18.5 billion — scarcely enough to fund a couple of reactors .
“ We considered that a win for our side , ” says anti-nuclear activist Becker .
The industry does get another massive taxpayer - funded benefit , however : Since 1957 , plant operators have been protected by the Price - Anderson Act , which limits their liability in a catastrophic accident .
The 2005 energy bill updated the act , which required reactor operators to carry insurance policies worth $ 300 million and contribute $ 95 million to an accident compensation fund .
The rest is covered by taxpayers — not a bad deal , considering that it cost $ 1 billion to clean up after Three Mile Island .
The debate over whether nuclear power deserves this kind of public investment is second only to the debate over whether reactors can ever be safe .
Amory Lovins of the Rocky Mountain Institute , long a foe of nuclear power , argues that “ about three - quarters of all electricity we use in North America can be saved cheaper than just running a coal or nuclear plant , even if the capital costs of the plant were zero . ”
Lovins has argued for 30 years that redirecting nuclear investments toward energy efficiency , solar , wind , or tiny gas turbines that could be located in every neighborhood would yield carbon - free power much faster , without the federally mandated insurance policy .
Nuclear power , he ’s famously said , “ is like cutting butter with a chainsaw . ”
But wind and solar have still not fully conquered their intermittency issues :
Wind power works only when the wind blows ; solar panels are no good at night .
“ Distributed micropower ” could make progress fast ; efficiency would do even better ; and we should look forward to the day when they put the mammoth , centralized energy providers that feed our national grid out of business .
But given the current economic structure of our energy market , can any of those things quickly replace coal ?
And how fast ?
Barring a president who can infuse us with the political will to roll out a Jimmy Carter - style conservation plan , electricity demand will continue to rise .
We may be stuck with our devil of a dilemma .
Wasted Promise
The Atomic
Age has left behind many kinds of radioactive garbage , from the rags that mopped up hot spills to the concrete from decommissioned reactors to the liquid residue of plutonium warheads .
Some is low - level waste , already tucked away in various locations , from Hanford in southwestern Washington state to Barnwellin South Carolina .
The waste fuel from nuclear reactors is high - level stuff that will remain dangerously radioactive for millions of years .
In volume it ’s not that much :
All the detritus from a half - century of civilian nuclear power “ can fit on a football field piled six meters high , ” says Harold McFarlane , deputy associate laboratory director for nuclear programs at Idaho National Laboratory .
“ It grows at about three yards a year [ in length ] . ”
But we still have no place to put it .
Since Congress in 1987 picked Yucca Mountain as the repository for the country ’s high - level waste , the state of Nevada has sued several times to block it , mostly on the grounds that the Department of Energy relied on bad science to select the spot :
Among other things , an earthquake fault runs under it , and water percolates through the porous volcanic tuff .
( When I visited after a wet desert winter in 2005 , Yucca — which the feds have always characterized as arid — was positively green . )
The repository ’s most recent opening date was set for 2017 .
But that date “ is clearly out the window , ” says Ward Sproat , who directs the Yucca project for the DOE .
“ Based on what I ’m seeing right now it ’s a two - to three - year slip from that . ”
Others predict that the $ 11 billion facility wo n’t open at all .
Still , the DOE has announced that it will file its long - awaited license application in June .
For now , nearly all the nation ’s spent - fuel assemblies sit at individual reactor sites in water - filled basins about the size of swimming pools but 30 feet deeper , and reinforced with concrete .
Most of the pools are close to full and , according to a 2002 report by the National Academy of Sciences , vulnerable to terrorist attack .
If Yucca Mountain ever does open , another perplexing problem emerges : transporting waste from the 200 - plus reactors around the country .
Trains can come off their rails ; sabotage and hijackings happen .
According to a map the state of Nevada circulates , only the Dakotas , Montana , and Rhode Island lie outside planned nuclear waste transportation routes .
DOE spokesman Allen Benson , who gives tours of Yucca Mountain to journalists , contends that “ we ’ve been shipping nuclear waste around the country since the beginning of the atomic age . ”
Still , the DOE intends to build a dedicated rail line 300 miles into the Nevada desert and instruct residents along its route in how to respond to emergencies .
Everyone along the route will know where those trains are going .
And what they carry .

So why do n’t we do like they do in France , where they recycle the fuel from their own 59 reactors , along with some from other countries , into neat little piles of useful radionuclides ?
By dissolving nuclear waste in acids and separating the isotopes , they can reduce 20 years ’ waste from a family of four ’s electricity use to a glasslike nugget the size of a cigarette lighter .
France ’s eager embrace of nuclear technology has yielded some spectacular benefits .
The country , which relies on nuclear for nearly 80 percent of its electricity , emits only two tons of carbon dioxide per person per year , less than half the U.S. load .
But its reprocessing operations , as with Britain ’s notoriously leaky site at Sellafield , have racked up such a roster of problems that in the United States they ’d be shut down as gross violators of the Clean Water Act .
Every year Areva , the French conglomerate that handles reprocessing , dumps so much radioactive liquid into the Channel that , says Lochbaum of the Union of Concerned Scientists , “ there are certain beaches where the effluent pipe is where you can get a suntan at night .
“ I ’m not going to say the French are ‘ no blood , no foul , ' ” Lochbaum told me , “ but they ’re not quite as concerned about effluents as we are .
They tend to believe more in ‘ the solution to pollution is dilution . ' ”
They are , however , in violation of European Union pollution regulations — largely because the waste contains the dangerous isotope technetium , which so far no one has found a way to remove .
“ Ten European governments have come together to get them to stop , saying , ‘ You ’re polluting all the way to the Arctic , ' ” says Arjun Makhijani of the watchdog group Institute for Energy and Environmental Research .
“ But they have n’t stopped .
They have n’t stopped because there ’s no way for them to stop . ”
The dumping has grim consequences .
In 1997 , researchers surveying children and young people who lived near the Normandy Coast town of La Hague where reprocessing takes place found a correlation between beach visits and leukemia risk .
Yet Areva continues to argue that its operations have “ zero impact ” on the environment .
In addition to pollution problems , the reprocessing of nuclear waste isolates plutonium .
Currently , France has 80 tons of it socked away , enough to make 10,000 nuclear bombs .
“ They store it in what looks like 11,000 sugar cans , ” says Makhijani .
“ It ’s a huge security issue . ”
In 1974 , India made its first nuclear bomb with plutonium skimmed off reprocessed nuclear waste .
For that reason , President Gerald Ford placed a temporary hold on the technology in 1976 , a hold President Carter turned into a ban .
Nevertheless , the 2009 federal budget request includes $ 301.5 million for research into reprocessing technologies .
For a nuclear future to flower , industry executives want assurances that the waste problem wo n’t continue to haunt them .
“ Unless we see a clear path , ” says Exelon ’s Craig Nesbit , “ we do n’t believe that we or anyone else should be building new nuclear plants .
We do n’t think it ’s right to saddle a community with more high - level spent fuel than already exists . ”
Breeding Reactors
In his 1974 book The Curve of Binding Energy , John McPhee speculated that by the end of the 20th century , reactors using nuclear fusion — the kind of reaction that powers the sun — would be in operation , “ and the energy crisis will cease to be a crisis for many millions of years . ”
Okay , so that has n’t happened .
But what if a nuclear reactor could be invented that was safe , sustainable , and clean , even using plain old fission ?
What if it could reuse spent fuel until it was no longer dangerous , curtailing the pesky problems of waste , mining , and a finite uranium supply all at once ?
These are the questions du jour of research facilities around the world , places like Idaho National Laboratory , which sprawls over 890 square miles of desert land bounded by some of America ’s most prized national parks .
In the 1950s and ’60s , it was a bustling facility , drawing the best in young talent from the world ’s science academies .
Now , says nuclear programs director Harold McFarlane , the lab — which has expanded into other fields , such as biotechnology and alternative energy — is back full bore in the nuclear business , bolstered by federal programs to encourage the development of “ Generation IV ” reactors .
( The 2009 budget request includes $ 70 million for such programs . )
One reactor in the offing , the Next Generation Nuclear Plant , can be cooled with helium instead of water and might be capable of producing industrial hydrogen to power emission - free cars and other power plants .
Another , the Advanced Fast Reactor , can burn up the radioactive elements that remain behind in a light - water reactor .
Other countries — India , China , South Africa — are working on their own prototypes .
“ There ’s also a great deal of interest in designing smaller reactors for developing nations , ” McFarlane says , “ anywhere from 20 megawatts to 600 megawatts , to provide distributed power to outlying areas . ”
McFarlane has noticed that nuclear engineering has become a hot major in college again .
“ We ’re seeing a fantastic increase in undergraduate enrollment , ” he says .
“ A lot of universities are reinstating nuclear engineering programs they dropped back in the ’ 80s and ’ 90s . ”
The Ultimatum
When Tom Alexander recommended nuclear power as a hedge against climate catastrophe 30 years ago , he did so not because it was perfect , but because he thought that with better information its imperfections could be addressed .
He was no industry shill ; he also blasted the Reagan administration for blowing $ 10 billion on a badly conceived uranium - enrichment plant , and the government in general , whose “ inability to untangle its licensing , fuel , and waste - storage policies has all but destroyed the electrical companies ’ brief infatuation with nuclear power . ”
As with the early proponents of nuclear power ( who in the 1940s staged sit-ins and hunger strikes to call for the “ peaceful uses of atomic fission ” ) , Alexander believed that there was a way to apply atomic technology against poverty , environmental collapse , and certain doom .
Alexander died in 2005 at the age of 74 , never writing one last story to say he told us so :
We should n’t have built so many coal plants .
And just maybe , instead of destroying that “ brief infatuation with nuclear power , ” we should have fixed the nuclear industry instead .
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warns of global mayhem should we fail to cut our carbon emissions in half by midcentury .
For nuclear power to make a significant dent in the U.S. carbon footprint , the Colorado - based Keystone Center for Science and Public Policy reported last year , we would have to build five new 1,000 megawatt reactors every year for the next half - century .
“ The world we have made as a result of a level of thinking we have done thus far creates problems we cannot solve at the same level at which we created them , ” said Albert Einstein .
In other words , we have driven ourselves into a technological quagmire .
There is no easy route back , but there may be many paths forward .
Nuclear power is expensive , flawed , dangerous , and finicky ; it depends on humans to run properly , and when those humans err , the consequences are worse than the worst accident involving any other energy source .
If there is n’t a way to do it right , let ’s abandon it — but only because we ’re secure in the belief that we can replace coal - fired electricity with energy from the wind , the sun , and the earth .
When rising seas flood our coasts , the idea of producing electricity from the most terrifying force ever harnessed may not seem so frightening — or expensive — after all .
Tesla executives said they decided not to use Mr. Fisker ’s design and were starting over on the design for White Star when they discovered that Mr. Fisker was going into competition with them .
The design switch caused a three - to six - month delay in production of the car , which is now scheduled to go on sale in 2010 , the company said .
Tesla is building a factory in New Mexico to manufacture the sedan .

“ It caused a slight delay in White Star because we could not use the Fisker styling , ” said Elon Musk , chairman of Tesla .
“ The styling was substandard compared to what he unveiled for his product .
He gave us an inferior work product , and it ’s obvious why . ”
Tesla has scrambled to come up with a new design with some help from Lotus , the maker of the bodies for the initial Tesla Roadster .
Mr. Musk said that he was leading the effort .
“ ‘I ’m not really a car designer , ” said Mr. Musk , who was one of the founders of PayPal and started SpaceX , a developer of spacecraft .
“ We ’ll see what people think of cars designed by me versus Fisker ; it ’s the amateur versus the professional . ”
The Tesla lawsuit seeks to stop Mr. Fisker from using Tesla design documents , along with a return of the money from the contract and unspecified punitive damages .
Having previously designed cars for BMW and Aston Martin , more recently Mr. Fisker has modified BMW and Mercedes - Benz luxury cars to create even more expensive custom cars that cost as much as $ 234,000 .
Tesla ’s White Star is expected to cost between $ 65,000 and $ 70,000 .
The Fisker Karma , which is also planned for delivery in 2010 , is expected to cost about $ 80,000 .
" The Golden Path , Volume 1 " -- Part 3 of a Multi-Part Review
When Chooseco sent us the galley proofs of the first Golden Path book , I was overjoyed .
The Choose Your Own Adventure series is beginning to cross the great new frontier of hypertext !
A new and exciting " Golden Path , " one cornerstone for the construction of a new 21st century literature !
Unfortunately , the book was sort of dull , and I unsatisfyingly died right away after going to Carlsbad .
But upon my second read of the book ( I cheated ; I read it twice ) , I understood the magic of this gamble .
I 'm not sure if this is true for the final published version , but the proofs we received have a huge amount of space at the bottom of each page .
And after many years of reading these books , I finally figured out the point : LITERALLY choosing your own adventure .
After a prologue and 31 pages , you are faced with your first choice as reader and character .
You can either go to Carlsbad to meet " Uncle Harry " or go to New York City and meet Preston Billings .
Hmmmm .
With all that white space , I started writing my own story in the margins , like a cad or rogue or middle school desperado .
Here is my adventure .

Page 30 - 31
" Food ? " you say with a grimace .
" My stash is running low .
Who cares about eating ?
I 've got $ 50 ...
Let 's shoot it up and see how far up the sky really is . "
Hermione says , " It 's not good to rely on your addictions during stressful times .
You should be more careful . "
You turn to Hermione because you know what 'll get her .
" I 'll give you first shot . "
You see her considering it until she finally nods .
Ron complains about getting the third shot , especially since you only have one needle , but he eventually relents .
You walk up three flights and buy a bag .
The stairs are covered in roach carcasses .
This place needs the exterminator to come back .
You tie off , disinfect , and inject .
Everyone sits on their asses for six hours feeling good , real good .
Suddenly , you see a heroin vision , coming from either " a desire for more " or " a desire for less . "
A geometric shape appears in your mind and begins speaking out of one of its many mouths in a voice that fills each nerve ending in your body with recognition .
" You have searched far and wide , " the chiliagon says .
" Now your search has led you to another search : the attainment of the sacrament of yage . "
" HOLY SHIT , " you scream , " Is anyone else getting this ? '
Ron and Hermione awake from their fevered poppy dreams on the couch .
" Yo , I think I 'm busting out of here , " you say .
" I 've gotta go find some yage . "
" What 's yage ? " asks Ron .
You start to explain .
" William Burroughs said that yage ' may be the ultimate fix , ' and he knew his shit .
It 's actually a colloquial name for Banisteriopsis caapi , also known as ayahuasca , or ' the vine of souls and death . ' "
Hermione replies , " Cool , I guess . "
You continue the explanation .
" Unfortunately , the U.S. considers yage to be a scheduled drug , since Psychotria viridis contains DMT and various other scheduled chemicals .
So guess where you 're going if you want to use ?
Either to jail or to the Amazon . "
To do a bunch of boring stuff , turn to other pages .
To go to the Amazonian rainforest and continue the search for the perfect drug , turn to page 225 .

Fuck this shit .
Your parents never loved you anyway .
Burroughs , Ginsberg , and Terence McKenna have used before , and guess what , motherfucker ?
They are famous and you are next .
After forging passports and airline tickets for you , Ron , and Hermione , you take a flight to Puyo , capital of the province of Pastaza in Ecuador .
Well , not right to Puyo .
Your flight lands in Shell , the center of Amazonian colonialism , at the airport 10 kilometers northwest of Puyo .
You pay an Ecuadorian kid $ 5 to get you into the city .
Hermione tells you about some research that she did about this old man Cotter that lives there .
After you get into Puyo , you find his place and meet him , and the guy seems suspicious .
He keeps saying that he 's working on some experiment with this thing called curare , but that does n't sound like yage to you .
He says he 'll take you to Canela to talk to the brujo there -- the resident witch doctor -- but it might take two weeks before he can take you .
What do you do ?
To stay in Puyo and wait for Cotter , keep reading page 225 .
To explore the area and head to Canela by yourselves , turn to page 226 .
Further Down On Page 225
Cotter is old now , and he is still obsessing over curare , which you find out is actually poison that Amazonians put on darts and shoot through bamboo tubes .
This makes you a little wary , but Cotter says everything is fine .
" HAR HAR HAR , " says Cotter , " It 's not like you kids have anything to worry about .
I only reserve curare for my enemies .
So far , you have n't done anything to prove yourselves as enemies . "
You all get bored waiting for Cotter to stop working with his crazy synthetic isoquinoline derivatives .
Ron starts taking pictures with his new digital camera , the one his parents gave to him back in civilization .
One of the natives sees him take the picture and gets worried that you 're conducting some sort of western brujeria .
He reports you to Cotter .
Cotter packs some of his curare substitute into your bananameal that night to test it , and he finds out his synthetic poison works flawlessly .
Unfortunately for you , your nicotinic acetylcholine receptors no longer do , and you all die .
The End # 1

You hack and slash your way through the rainforest with Ron and Hermione , terrified of both animals and natives .
Finally , you make it to the village of Canela where the brujo is .
The brujo is gaunt with richly tanned skin , crinkling like a coffee filter .
He knows what you 're there for .
Americans only come to the brujo for one thing : yage .
Kids especially .
The brujo makes you a drink .
Ron and Hermione sip like nuns , but you QUAFF it like a magic potion .
The brujo looks knowingly into your eyes .
Suddenly , thousands of non-Newtonian elf - like machines transmogrify the soul of the world and whisper into your ear the secret about the nature of all matter .
You are pure .
You are strong .
You are Shaman , and you are on the Golden Path to Infinity .

WASHINGTON
Maybe it was the proximity of Mount Rushmore and Deadwood , but something caused Hillary ’s inner Eve Harrington to leap out in South Dakota .
Venturing into Daschle - Obama territory , she inadvertently and inelegantly illuminated her thinking on why she wants to keep running as long as she can : stuff happens .
In politics , there are many unpredictable and unsavory twists and turns .
That ’s why she ’s hanging around , and that ’s why she and Bill want to force Barack Obama to take her as his vice president , even if he does n’t want her , even if Michelle ca n’t stand her , even if she has to stir the sexist pot , and even if she tarnishes his silvery change message .
In an interview with The Argus Leader in Sioux Falls , Hillary disagreed that she ’s hurting party unity : “ My husband did not wrap up the nomination in 1992 until he won the California primary somewhere in the middle of June , right ?
We all remember Bobby Kennedy was assassinated in June in California . ”
LONDON 
They had rehearsed the piece only once , but already the musicians at the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra were suffering .
Their ears were ringing .
Heads throbbed .
Tests showed that the average noise level in the orchestra during the piece , “ State of Siege , ” by the composer Dror Feiler , was 97.4 decibels , just below the level of a pneumatic drill and a violation of new European noise - at - work limits .
Playing more softly or wearing noise - muffling headphones were rejected as unworkable .
So instead of having its world premiere on April 4 , the piece was dropped .
“ I had no choice , ” said Trygve Nordwall , the orchestra ’s manager .
“ The decision was not made artistically ; it was made for the protection of the players . ”
The cancellation is , so far , probably the most extreme consequence of the new law , which requires employers in Europe to limit workers ’ exposure to potentially damaging noise and which took effect for the entertainment industry this month .
Other nations can provide health care for everyone .
The United States cannot .
In an era in which a college degree is becoming a prerequisite for a middle - class quality of life , we are having big trouble getting our kids through high school .
And despite being the wealthiest of all nations , nearly 10 percent of Americans are resorting to food stamps to maintain an adequate diet , and 4 in every 10 American children are growing up in families that are poor or near - poor .
The U.S. seems almost paralyzed , mesmerized by Iraq and unable to generate the energy or the will to handle the myriad problems festering at home .
The war will eventually cost a staggering $ 3 trillion or more , according to the Nobel Prize - winning economist Joseph Stiglitz .
When he was asked on “ Democracy Now ! ” about who is profiting from the war , he said the two big gainers were the oil companies and the defense contractors .
This is the pathetic state of affairs in the U.S. as we approach the end of the first decade of the 21st century .
Whatever happened to the dynamic country that flexed its muscles after World War II and gave us the G.I. Bill , the Marshall Plan , the United Nations ( in a quest for peace , not war ) , the interstate highway system , the civil rights movement , the women ’s movement , the finest higher education system the world has known , and a standard of living that was the envy of all ?
America ’s commanding general in Iraq , David Petraeus , and our ambassador to Baghdad , Ryan Crocker , went up to Capitol Hill this week but were unable to give any real answers as to when the U.S. might be able to disengage , or when a corner might be turned , or when a faint , flickering hopeful light might be glimpsed at the end of the long , horrific Iraqi tunnel .
A country that used to act like Babe Ruth now swings like a minor - leaguer .
The all - American can - do philosophy has been smothered by the hapless can ’t - do performances of the people who have been in charge for the past several years .
It ’s both tragic and embarrassing .
The war in Iraq stands like a boulder in the road , blocking progress on so many other important issues that are crucial to our viability as a society .
We ’ve seen this before .
Lyndon Johnson ’s Great Society , which included the war on poverty , was crippled by the war in Vietnam .
On the evening of April 4 , 1967 , one year to the day before he was assassinated , the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. went into Riverside Church in Manhattan and said of the war in Vietnam : “ This madness must cease . ”
Forty - one years later , we can still hear the echo of Dr. King ’s call .
The only sane response is : “ Amen . ”
By Dave Lindorff
I admit to feeling a little like the weatherman who keeps saying it 's going to rain , and who eventually is proven correct .
I feel certain that the Bush / Cheney regime is going to launch a disastrous attack on Iran , but have made several calls , which have been proved wrong , beginning back in October 2006 , when I wrote that it looked like several aircraft carrier battle groups were being put in position for the assault , but then it was called off , thanks to a decision by former Secretary of State James Baker to release the conclusions of his " Iraq Study Group " early -- which called for negotiations with Iran .
Now it looks like the attack is coming soon .
The Washington Post 's Ann Scott Tyson is today reporting in an article headlined , Joint Chiefs Chairman Says US Preparing Military Options Against Iran , that Admiral Michael Mullen , the nation 's top military officer , thinks the US military is not stretched too thin to take on Iran , and that Iran is becoming an " increasingly lethal and malign influence " in Iraq .
This article comes only a day after a US civilian ship under contract to the US military to deliver supplies to Iraq fired on Iranian boats in the Persian Gulf -- just the kind of aggressive action that could lead to an Iranian reaction and trigger a full - blown US response .
The Persian Gulf is now crammed full of US attack ships , ranging from a missile - armed nuclear sub to aircraft carriers packed with tomahawk cruise missiles and fleets of attack aircraft larger than most nation 's entire air forces ( and also with nuclear weapons ) .
Other things also point to an attack , most significantly the pushing out of Adm.
William Fallon as Central Command chief , and now his replacement by Gen. David Petraeus , who is widely seen as a " political " general who is essentially a yes - man for Bush and Cheney .
I would say the die is cast , and that it awaits only the pretext .
There would be no melodramatic Congressional debate over the reasons for going to war against yet a third nation this time around .
Thanks to the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force ( AUMF ) passed by Congress in October 2001 ( and never subsequently rescinded ) to authorize the attack on the Taliban and Al Qaeda in Iraq , which Bush and Cheney have illegally and outrageously interpreted as a declaration of a global and unending " War on Terror , " the administration is claiming it has the right to attack any nation it defines as " terrorist " at any time , without authorization .
Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton helped promote war against Iran a few months ago by backing a Senate resolution authored by Sens.
Joe Lieberman and Jon Kyle that defined the Iranian Revolutionary Guard as a " global terrorist " organization .
That was all Bush and Cheney needed , as Clinton , Lieberman and Kyle clearly knew .
In what has to be one of the understatements of the century , Adm .
Mullen said he knew that conflict would be " extremely stressing " and " disastrous on a number of levels . "
Indeed it would .
Troops in Iraq are already on their fourth and even fifth rotation , and the " surge " troops in Iraq for the past year are being sent home , not because their job of " stabilizing " Baghdad is done ( hardly ! violence is increasing ! ) , but because there 's nobody left to replace them , and they 've been there for 15 brutal months .
Worse yet , oil prices have hit a record $ 122 / barrel and are causing a US and even a global recession -- but that figure will be doubled the minute any US attack on Iran begins .
This is because war with Iran would immediately bring all oil shipments through the Persian Gulf , which supplies 20 - 25 percent of the world 's oil , to a halt .
Even if not one tanker were sunk , no insurer would cover a tanker in that region .
Moreover , Iranian sappers , and their allies in Iran , Turkey and Saudi Arabia , could be expected to take out vulnerable pipelines , refineries and even well - heads in retaliation to any attack .
So an attack on Iran would mean global economic collapse .
Hold on to your hats .
I hope I 'm proved wrong yet again , but I 'm afraid we 're in for a bumpy ride .
Even if there is no attack , the level of threats against Iran now emanating from the White House and the Pentagon are sufficient to keep driving oil prices skyward .
Americans should look at those pump prices and see Bush 's and Cheney 's faces in the digital display .
They should also think of the gas they pump as blood , because it is going to be spilled in prodigious quantities if the US goes through with an attack .
Not only would countless innocent Iranians be killed by US bombs and rockets and by any radiation released by attacks on Iran 's nuclear facilities ( the more so if the US or its Israeli ally use nuclear bombs in that attack ) , but the toll of US military casualties could be expected to soar , as Iran 's Shia allies in Iraq predictably turn on American forces in support of Iran .

The Australian infantry wears small box respirators to ward off the harmful effects of poison gas .
Courtesy Australian War Memorial 1915 : Poison gas is used for the first time on the Western Front at the Second Battle of Ypres .
Although the attack opened up an 8,000 - yard gap in the Allied line , as French and Algerian troops broke and ran , the Germans failed to exploit the success because their own infantry balked at attacking in an area that had just been gassed .
The Germans were n't the first to use debilitating gas as a weapon during World War I : The French launched tear - gas attacks against German positions in the first month of fighting .
But chlorine gas represented an escalation in chemical warfare , still very new at the time .
Unlike tear gas , chlorine gas could kill .
Fortunately for its intended victims , a chlorine - gas attack resulted in a green cloud and a strong odor that was easily detected .
Countermeasures were also easy and effective .
Placing a wet cloth over the mouth and nose was one method used at the Second Battle of Ypres , and , while primitive , generally diluted the worst effects of the gas .
Although the Allies , especially the British , protested against this new type of warfare ( and used it in anti-German propaganda ) they embraced it and refined it themselves as the war dragged on .
The French produced phosgene , a deadlier gas than chlorine and , being colorless , one that was harder to detect .
The most effective chemical agent of World War I , mustard gas , was introduced by the Germans in 1917 .
It was not designed to kill ( although a high enough dose often resulted in a lingering , agonizing death ) but to incapacitate .
Exposure resulted in blistering skin , difficulty in breathing , vomiting and blindness .
Despite the terrible effects suffered by gassing victims , gas itself was not particularly effective as a tactical weapon , mainly because it was hard to direct and subject to the vagaries of the wind .
Wind shifts often resulted in gas being blown back on the attacker .
Countermeasures were also improving ; both sides produced reliable gas masks that essentially eliminated the danger .
But the idea of being gassed was terrifying , so it did have value as a psychological weapon .
Perhaps the most famous victim of gassing was a German corporal named Adolf Hitler , who was temporarily blinded during a British gas attack in 1918 .

The CIA says it used waterboarding on Khalid Sheikh Mohammed
CIA head Michael Hayden told Congress it had only been used on three people , and not for the past five years .
He said the technique had been used on high - profile al - Qaeda detainees including Khalid Sheikh Mohammed .
Waterboarding , condemned as torture by rights groups and many governments , is an interrogation method that puts the the detainee in fear of drowning .
Mr Hayden was speaking as National Intelligence Director Mike McConnell presented his annual threat assessment .
We used it against these three detainees because of the circumstances at the time
Michael Hayden
CIA director
Congress has been debating banning the use of waterboarding by the CIA .
President Bush has threatened to veto such a bill .
Kuwaiti - born Khalid Sheikh Mohammed is accused of masterminding the 11 September attacks on the United States .
The two other men Mr Hayden said the CIA had also used waterboarding against are also top al - Qaeda suspects , Abu Zubaydah and Abd al - Rahim al - Nashiri , both from Saudi Arabia .
Catastrophe fears
He told Congress : " We used it against these three detainees because of the circumstances at the time .
Michael Hayden ( R ) spoke as Mike McConnell reported to Congress
" There was the belief that additional catastrophic attacks against the homeland were inevitable .
And we had limited knowledge about al - Qaeda and its workings .
" Those two realities have changed . "
In his report , National Intelligence Director Mike McConnell focussed attention on al - Qaeda and its leadership based in the border area between Pakistan and Afghanistan .
" Al - Qaeda remains the pre-eminent threat against the United States , both here at home and abroad , " he said .
His report said al - Qaeda enjoyed many of the same benefits from its bases in the border areas as it had when it was in Afghanistan proper , and was able to :
use the region as a staging area for attacks outside
maintain a group of skilled operators able to direct operations around the world
pass on morale - boosting messages from Saudi - born al - Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden and his Egyptian deputy Ayman al - Zawahiri
improve its ability to attack the US itself .
Despite this , Mr McConnell praised the Pakistani authorities , saying they had done more to " neutralise " terrorists than any of the US 's other partners - despite more than 860 members of their security forces being killed by bombs in 2007 .
And although al - Qaeda had suffered some reverses , he said , it remained active and dangerous in Iraq , in North Africa , in the Arabian peninsula , Lebanon , East Africa , Pakistan and South - East Asia .
Other worries outlined by Mr McConnell included :
Russia , China and oil producers using their wealth to advance political goals
nuclear proliferation , especially Iran and North Korea
computer system vulnerabilities .
" The threats we face are global , complex and dangerous , " he wrote .
" We must have the tools to enable the detection and disruption of terrorist plots and other threats . "
It 's easy to view the computer interface as nearly static .
Since the advent of mouse - driven , windowed interfaces over 20 years ago , much of human - computer interface ( HCI ) has gone the same route .
But a proliferation of mobile devices is beginning to change that and , even if that were n't the case , important differences are developing in what information is available to computers , and how we access it .
In March 2007 , Microsoft Research invited 45 leading researchers to discuss where HCI would be in 2020 ; a report summarizing their conclusions has now been made available .
The report covers more ground that can possibly be covered in a cogent summary .
Fortunately , it hits some obvious points that are easily summarized .
For example , it concludes that speech and gestures would play a larger role in HCI , and suggests that nerve impulses themselves would start to be used for controlling computers , especially for the disabled .
It also predicts that the pervasive connectivity that enables computers to act as surrogates for human memory would , when combined with enhanced processing power , begin to allow them to supplement human reasoning .
But a number of its conclusions are less obvious .
Computers are just now starting to identify us by RFID and facial recognition , and track us through GPS and closed - circuit monitoring .
In essence , we 're now involuntarily " interfacing " with computer systems every time we go through an airport .
The experts predict that these trends will accelerate and expand , raising serious privacy issues .
In some cases , such as implanted medical devices , the boundary between human and computer is nearly erased — is there really a " human interface " between a device that can monitor and manipulate heartbeats and the heart itself ?
A second trend will interact and combine with this one .
The report suggests that we 're just entering the age of mobile computing , but , by 2020 , we 'll be in an era of ubiquitous computing .
Instead of a few computers and devices , each user , by leveraging pervasive networking , will have access to thousands of computers , with various information and capabilities available through each .
With everything about a person being recorded , imaged , or twittered , and all of that information constantly available , the report claims that we 're about to reach the end of the ephemeral .
By having medical information , personal photos , and even minute - by - minute thoughts permanently stored online , people will voluntarily provide access to more information than government spies or advertising agencies could ever succeed in gathering .
To cope with these changes , the researchers suggest that careful thought will have to go into allowing people to be notified and opt out of pervasive recording .
Referring to GPS navigation systems , the authors note , " if people are prepared to stupidly obey instructions given out by simple computers , this should make us even more concerned about the relationship between people and ever more complex computers as we move toward 2020 . "
To get there , the report urges adding a fifth step to the traditional study / design / build / evaluate design process : understand .
It 's not enough , the authors argue , to simply design an object to perform a task .
Instead , in an era when information from that task may be shared and permanently stored , designers will have to take into account human values , such as privacy , personal security , the distinction between work and personal life , etc .
We 're entering a brave new world , and HCI will have to adapt to let its occupants navigate it .

Please pay attention , people .
Another race , the second in a week , has now been overturned in Arkansas due to failures of the ES&S voting machines ( here was the other we reported earlier in the week ) .
Says the candidate who ended up losing in the very - low - turnout race after the ES&S machine failure was discovered : " What 's going to happen in November when there 's a presidential race and there 's all sorts of people here .
This was a 1,500 person turnout .
What 's going to happen when there 's a 20,000 turnout ? "
What 's going to happen indeed .
Arkansas is quickly becoming Florida / Ohio , it seems .
Worse , these very same , oft - failed ES&S machines are used all over the country .
Here 's coverage from the Arkansas paper [ emphasis ours ] ...
The Faulkner County Election Commission has determined that Linda Tyler is the winner of the House District 45 election .
The new outcome , according to Election Commission Chair Bruce Haggard , is Tyler , 792 votes ; Dr. Terry Fiddler , 764 votes .
" I want to apologize personally and on behalf of the election commissioners and the county clerk for these recording errors that were made on election night , " Haggard said , adding that the commission will conduct an audit " to find out what went wrong " and ensure the mistakes made Tuesday night never happen again .
...
The election commission also discovered an error in the East Cadron B precinct machine that caused votes cast in the Cadron Township Constable race for John Edwards and Paul Niehaus to be " dropped into " the District 45 race , Haggard said .
He said he did not know whether this mistake was caused by an error within the machine or an error by the person who programmed the machine .
...
" As a result of that one precinct , where the constable race results were placed in the District 45 results , Tyler lost 6 and Fiddler lost 51 , " Haggard said .
The result was " a net change of 16 plus for Tyler , minus 35 for Fiddler , " he said .
...
Fiddler said he does not dispute the result of the process , but is disappointed that given the significant expense of electronic voting machines , " this is what we get . "
...
" She won the race .
I 'm not questioning that .
What 's going to happen in November when there 's a presidential race and there 's all sorts of people here .
This was a 1,500 person turnout .
What 's going to happen when there 's a 20,000 turnout ?... "
...
[ Haggard ] said an audit would involve going back through everything in the election process , which is stored in an election audit file .
The audit will be supervised by a representative of Election Systems and Software , the company that sells the voting machines , he said .

WASHINGTON  Senator Edward M. Kennedy implored Americans on Monday “ to turn the page on the old politics of misrepresentation and distortion , ” as he placed the aura of the most prominent Democratic family around Senator Barack Obama ’s candidacy .
At a rally here at American University , as two generations of Kennedys surrounded Mr. Obama on stage , and Caroline Kennedy and Representative Patrick J. Kennedy , Democrat of Rhode Island , offered their own endorsements , Mr. Kennedy offered a fierce rebuttal to questions that Mr. Obama ’s rivals had raised about his experience and readiness for the job .

“ He will be a president who refuses to be trapped in the patterns of the past , ” Mr. Kennedy said , interrupting his speech more than once to embrace Mr. Obama .
“ He is a leader who sees the world clearly without being cynical .
He is a fighter who cares passionately about the causes he believes in without demonizing those who hold a different view . ”
Mass graves are regularly found in Iraq .
Some are recent , some date to Saddam Hussein 's era Security forces in Iraq have found a mass grave containing about 100 decomposed bodies .
The grave , discovered in Khalis , north of the capital , Baghdad , is one of the largest such finds in several months .
Iraqi and American officials said it was not clear who was responsible , but the grave may date back to sometime before the 2003 US - led invasion .
A US military spokesman said the bodies were mainly skeletal , indicating they may have been there a long time .
Iraqi army officer Major General Abdel Karim al - Rubaie added that the victims were beyond recognition .
" We ca n't identify them , " he told AFP news agency .
" There are just bones in there .
At the moment we have left the remains in the grave itself . "
Sectarian killings
Human rights groups believe there are many such mass graves in Iraq where thousands of people killed during the regime of deposed president Saddam Hussein were buried .
Hundreds of Iraqis have also died in sectarian fighting since the invasion and more recent mass graves are regularly discovered .
The US and Iraqi authorities often blame al - Qaeda for the killings .
In February , a grave with about 50 bodies was found near Samarra , 100 km north of Baghdad , during a hunt for al - Qaeda militants , Reuters reported .

Chatting with Chris Wanstrath ( Err the Blog / Github ) 2008 April 21 , 19:12 h
He answered everything in color detail and we speak a lot about his open source projects , performance , scalability and , of course , lots of Git and Github stuff .
Hopefully it will make people even more excited with how the Ruby / Rails community is moving things forward all the time .
Chris is a very accessible and easy - going guy , and I just got him out of AIM and started the interview right away .
For those of you who never heard of ‘ Chris Wanstrath ’ , he is also known for Err the Blog and recently as one of the guys behind the Github phenomenon .
AkitaOnRails :
Ok , so , where are you from ?
Chris Wanstrath : Right now I live in San Francisco but I grew up in Cincinnati , Ohio .
I moved to San Francisco in 2005 to work for C|NET where I did PHP for a while on sites like gamespot.com , mp3.com , and tv.com
In 2006 I moved over to the chowhound.com site within C|NET to work on Rails , which is something I had been doing on the side for a while .
While I was there P.J. Hyett and myself worked on chowhound.com then built chow.com , which we launched later that year .
Then in April of 2007 we both left C|NET to form our consulting company , Err Free .
In December of 2007 we launched FamSpam , which is a site for keeping in touch with your family .
It ’s basically a simplified version of Google Groups with emphasis on participating in a thread at least once a week and easily finding photos or other file uploads .
While P.J. and I were working on FamSpam , Tom Preston - Werner and I were working on GitHub on the side .
We started in October working nights and weekends on it .
We basically wanted an easy , pretty , and feature - rich way to throw our Git repos up and share them with people .
Then as we got more into it , we realized how things like the dashboard could change the way we deal with open source contributions .
After that , all the social features began to fall into place .
Github private beta launched in january , and in april we saw the public launch
AkitaOnRails : Wow , Cool , you are a very busy guy indeed , I want to go on in details within each topic you mentioned but first I knew you worked for C|Net because of your memcached keynotes .
I have 2 questions : you were a PHP programmer , what made you switch to Ruby on Rails ?
And then , working for a high profile network like C|Net exposed you to very demanding public websites .
How did you figured out about leveraging memcached with Rails and then your cache_fu plugin ?
Chris Wanstrath : I started doing Rails at the start of 2005 and got my first PHP job in February of 2005 .
( before that I was doing asp and Perl , which I do n’t like to talk about ) .
So really , I never considered myself a “ PHP programmer ” over a Rails programmer .
I really liked websites and I knew I could get paid doing PHP , so that ’s what I did .
In the meantime , I was constantly doing Ruby on the side .
When C|Net started doing Rails , I knew it would be a perfect fit for me .
I really liked PHP and loved Gamespot , but it was just silly for me to spend all night playing with Ruby while doing PHP professionally .
In fact , one of the things that got me hired at Gamespot was my pure PHP yaml parser called SPYC ( simple PHP yaml class ) .
It was inspired ( obviously ) by _why ’s syck yaml parser .
I wanted an easy , extension - free way to deal with YAML in PHP because I was so spoiled by Ruby .
I think today the CakePHP and Symfony frameworks use it , and do their config stuff in yaml .
But even when writing PHP I wanted to be writing Ruby .
The main reason I picked up ruby in the first place is because I knew PHP , and I knew Perl , but I wanted something I could use to write both websites and command line scripts .
Perl was great for scripts , and PHP was great for sites , but I was just tired of using them both
So while I was learning Python , Rails popped up .
As far as cache_fu goes , I was very interested in some of the “ scaling ” aspects of running a website while working at Gamespot .
While good OOP design and stuff like that can be learned by anyone writing enough code , you ca n’t really learn about scaling unless you ’re working on a big website .
There are just too many tricks and moving parts , and it ’s too hard to simulate the load in a controlled environment .
So while at Gamespot , like I said , I tried to learn as much as possible about things like MySQL replication , clustering databases , sharding databases , and memcached based on how the smart guys at C|Net had set it all up over the years .
They had a lot of machines serving a lot of traffic so it was perfect
At Chowhound , we were re-writing an old static html site in Rails and were worried about the transition from flat files to dynamic database calls and page generation .
It had a fair amount of traffic from a group of rabid fans , and we knew the new “ web 2.0 ” look of the site would not sit well with the old school users , so we at least wanted the site to be performant in order to give them one less thing to complain about .
So we basically took a lot of what I had learned at Gamespot , and what information was freely available on the internet in mailing lists and discussions , and tried to do a more Rails friendly way of object caching with memcached .
Ruby is just so good at cleaning up repetition and creating friendly apis .
So cache_fu does fragment caching and object caching , because in bigger sites you end up using both for different purposes which is how it was at Gamespot too , basically .
AkitaOnRails : Nice .
And it is not very common for me to find people that have dealt with really big websites .
Can you give us a glimpse of what kind of load your Rails apps did have to handle ?
Some pundits I know complain about the vanilla Rails distribution and recommend lots of tweaks like dumping ActiveRecord altogether and several other hacks .
Do you have to hack Rails a lot in order to achieve the scalability you need or do you think most of it is good enough so you can avoid too much tweaking ?
Chris Wanstrath : I would n’t really consider Chowhound to be a big Rails site anymore .
Now that you ’ve got scribd and twitter and friends for sale and Yellowpages , Chowhound does n’t really make the list .
We ended up doing a lot of premature optimization on that site , and not enough real world optimization .
I learned a lot of lessons there that I ’ve applied to other sites along the way .
However , I recently had the chance to work with the friends for sale guys on their Facebook app which gets millions of page views a day and handles an insane amount of db records .
To my knowledge , the only AR hack we did was apply Pratik Naik ’s partial updates patch .
This was because , with so many rows and such large indexes , you want to avoid modifying indexes when you do n’t need to , so saving only the changed columns / attributes can have a real big performance gain .
Luckily , partial updates are now in Rails Core .
In my experience , you spend a lot more time trying to scale SQL before you even need to address AR .
And once you get to the AR part , it ’s usually your application code .
Fetching and saving too many records in before / after_save callbacks , full row writes like I was just describing , and generally not being a good SQL citizen .
I would only ditch AR completely if I felt like I had no control over the SQL it generated .
Which , as anyone knows , is not the case – you have a lot of control over it .
There are times , however , when AR is overkill and you really do need speed .
On Github , we need to authenticate you every time you try and pull or push a repository over ssh .
Loading an entire Rails environment , or even activerecord , was noticeably slow , so we switched to using sequel in a simple ruby script .
Because we do n’t need AR ’s massive featureset and nice OOP capabilities for such a simple single row find , this made a lot of sense for us .
AkitaOnRails : I agree with that , that ’s what I experienced too with regards to AR .
So , and you ’re also the author of several other famous Rails plugins like will_paginate , Ambition , the original Sexy Migrations .
Can you comment briefly about each .
Am I forgetting any other plugins ?
Some of what you did became the ‘ de facto ’ standards for Rails development , some people here use these plugins without really knowing you made them all .
P.J Hyett at SXSW’06 P.J Hyett at SXSW’06
Chris Wanstrath : Err the blog is actually two people , P.J. Hyett and myself .
I did not write will_paginate – P.J. wrote the original version then Mislav Marohnić re-wrote it .
Mislav is now the maintainer .
But I still get all the credit , which is fine by me .
As far as the other plugins go , there ’s mofo , ambition , sexy migrations , cache_fu , acts_as_textiled , fixture_scenarios_builder , and gibberish .
Mofo is a microformat parser based on Hpricot .
It ’s up on Github and unfortunately does n’t get enough love from me these days , but as far as I know it ’s still the gold standard for microformat parsing in Ruby .
It was the first gem that I released which doubled as a Rails plugin , which is how I think most plugins should be distributed in the future .
Gems already have a solid distribution system and versioning scheme , and if Github becomes a gem source then there ’s almost no reason not to release plugins as gems
Sexy migrations were inspired by Hobo .
Unfortunately their version was hobo - specific , so I wrote a plugin - friendly version .
DHH later wrote his own version and rolled it into core , making a grand total of 3 distinct sexy migration implementations .
Gibberish is a pretty fun localization plugin I wrote pro bono for a client , just because I felt like the APIs of all the existing localization plugins were so difficult to work with .
Hopefully , with the help of anyone interested , we can begin localizing Github in the near future .
Ambition was inspired by dabbling in Erlang .
I read a blog post explaining that mnesia ’s query syntax , which is all list comprehension ( basically Ruby ’s version of the Enumerable module ) , was made possible by the ability to walk the parse tree and build an mnesia query that way .
So I started playing with the parse_tree gem to see if I could do the same for Ruby .
It ’s now , of course , a full fledged framework for generating arbitrary queries for any RubyGem based on Enumerable .
For simple queries , I really like treating tables as arrays , it feels very natural .
Acts_as_textiled was the first Rails plugin I released .
It ’s a testament to Rails that the plugin still works on edge today .
The only other notable thing that Err started is the “ vendor everything ” term , which is now a part of Rails through config.gems .
That , and the Cheat gem ( and site ) .
Tom Preston - Werner Tom Preston - Werner
AkitaOnRails : ( Of course , pardon me P.J. ! )
And this raises another curiosity of mine : where did the name “ Err ” come from ?
It is both for Err the Blog and Err Free which is your company .
And you mentioned P.J. and Tom .
And you ’re all full time Railers , right ?
How did you teamed up with them and decided starting your own company ?
Many times people ask me about entrepreneurship and you ’re another good example .
Chris Wanstrath : “ err ” is kind of a play on “ Typo , ” which was the popular Rails blogging engine when we started our blog , so it may be kind of confusing , but I actually am cofounder of two distinct companies .
There is Err Free and Logical Awesome .
Err Free is Ruby & Rails consulting and training .
P.J. and I own the company , and we use it to do client work , speaking gigs , corporate training , that sort of thing .
It also owns and operates FamSpam , which we use with our own families .
Logical Awesome , however , was founded by me and Tom .
This is because I was developing FamSpam with P.J. and GitHub with Tom at the same time , separately .
Today , however , P.J. is a part of Logical Awesome and is one of the GitHub developers .
Tom works at Powerset and does n’t actually do much Rails for GitHub , he mainly does flash , haxe , C , css , design , and ruby .
And because he ’s the author of God , I make him write all the config files , too .
As far as deciding to start a company , I am someone that needs to be involved in whatever I ’m involved with on every level .
At C|Net , there is only so much input you can have on a website that employs 30 people especially when there are dedicated product and “ vision ” people , whereas with Github , it ’s just me Tom and P.J .
If the site is slow , confusing , sucks , or does n’t improve your workflow , I can take responsibility for that .
But if it ’s fast , simple , awesome , and life changing , I get to take responsibility for that , too .
Which is very rewarding .
It also means , when you ’re cofounder of a mostly technical company , the discussions are a lot more logical .
I saw decisions made at C|Net that directly contradicted a/b statistics we had gathered .
At Logical Awesome , that would never happen .
It is neither logical nor awesome .
Basically : I wanted to find the ideal company so I found good people and started it .
AkitaOnRails :
Ok , so we come to the main dish of the day : Github !
I ca n’t think of a better example of an innovative product that leverages so well the power of Git .
I am very curious to understand how did you come with this idea ?
At the same time , lots of people still ca n’t understand why Railers as a whole started using Git so massively all of a sudden .
Mercurial , Bazaar guys are very uncomfortable .
What do you think Git has that attracted Railers in flocks like that ?
Or at least what do you think Git has that no other have ?
I started evangelizing Git here in Brazil last year after listening Randall Schwartz , and recently someone asked be about what would me my pick for a Rails killer - app and Github popped out of my mind , right away .
So you do have good mind share as well .
Chris Wanstrath : Github is super exciting to me because it ’s really a website just for me .
Tom and I are pretty similar in that we both have a fair amount of open source projects , all of which get used and patched by people we ’ve never met .
Handling this the old fashion way was fine until me and P.J. started working on FamSpam … as my free time decreased , so did my ability to maintain my open source projects .
And really , that ’s a definite workflow problem .
Sometimes when you can’t find enough time to do something , you just need to make the something take less time .
Github was literally written for chronic , god , ambition , will_paginate , and the rest of our projects .
We wanted to make it dead simple for people to contribute , and really , it ’s just not possible without Git .
I had started using Git right after viewing the Linus tech talk in May 2007 , which is really good at explaining Git from a very high conceptual level .
So when this time problem came up , I had already been using Git for a few months and Tom had serendipitously been trying to solve the same problem .
We talked after a local San Francisco Ruby meetup , at a bar of course ( where all great ideas and partnerships begin ) , and decided to work on the problem together .
I ’d been playing with an err-specific Gitweb , but Github is obviously much more ambitious in its scope .
As far as the adoption of Git , I have no idea what single thing tipped it .
When we began working on the app in October , we were worried about ./ script / plugin and tarballs and windows and svn mirroring .
we were n’t even sure we could build a business around Git , because subversion was still so utterly dominant .
As we all know , however , Git tipped at the start of 2008 and everyone somehow found the time to try it out .
It maybe takes , like , two seconds to realize how much faster it is , and then a few more seconds after that to realize how much more awesome it is .
So it ’s not much of a surprise that it is grabbing converts .
As for the Rails community , it ’s definitely because of the projects .
When Merb , Rubinius , and Ruby on Rails all switch to Git , you have no choice .
This is where the community is headed .
As for other languages , we have a large number of non-ruby projects on Github .
PHP , Java , Javascript , Lisp , Python — there are a handful of Django forks , for instance , the io and nu programming languages are also hosted on Github .
So really what it comes down to is early adopters , I think .
Nu is a lisp written on Objective - C , very new and very cutting edge .
The people using it right now are people who realize how powerful and awesome it is to run such a dynamic language on such a mature and stable platform .
And naturally , the forward thinkers behind nu know that Git ( and distributed source control ) is an equally powerful , equally cutting edge concept .
With Prototype and Scripatculous moved over , and rumors of other Javascript frameworks switching , it ’s only a matter of time before Git becomes even more widespread .
I think the Railers just like to blog a lot .
As far as other solutions go , it ’s Rails vs Django all over again .
If you use Mercurial , that ’s fine .
The two are so similar ( yes , Git does work great on Windows ) that as long as people move to distributed source control , it ’s still a win .
Oh , but wait , Mercurial does n’t have Github :-)
AkitaOnRails :
There you go :-)
And I wonder what were the challenges of putting something as Github together .
It is not a simple Rails web app , with very fast , pure Ruby code .
You ’re probably dealing with thousands of system calls to Git command liners , several background jobs , maintenance , security .
What do you think were the biggest challenges while assembling Github before recently releasing it to the public ?
Chris Wanstrath :
Well you pretty much nailed it right there … scaling Rails is the easy part .
scaling sshd , Git , Git - daemon , and our background jobs is the hard part .
We call Git directly many times per page , we need to process jobs that get entered from many different places ( create a repo on the website , push a repo through ssh ) , we need to be secure ( ssl and ssh for all private repos at all times ) , we need to make sure it all runs fast ( memcached for both Git calls and the db ) , we need to make sure you ’re “ in the loop ” with a news feed aggregating information from all different sources within our system ( almost 1 m rows in the feed table when we launched ) .
So it definitely has not been easy .
Not to mention that ssl is essentially the “ slow flag ” for http , so we need to make sure we ’re going fast because things like your dashboard already have a speed handicap .
As an example , sshd stores its keys in an authorized_keys file .
Well , we were n’t even done with our beta yet and the keys file was over 4 megs of just plain text .
So we had one of the C gurus at Engine Yard patch sshd for us to do mySQL based lookups , giving us faster searches and no pricey appending / writing of a massive file
Matthew Palmer is the said guru , and we plan to make that code open source in the near future .
We ’ve also got post - receive ( when you “ Git push ” ) hooks running that we host and deliver – so if you push , we ’ll POST to an arbitrary url for you with json of the commits .
But you can also give us some info and we ’ll post to campfire , irc , twitter , or lighthouse for you with custom payloads .
Since we have flash , flash with haxe , Python , c , ruby , bash scripts , lots of Javascript , and some forthcoming erlang under the hood , it ’s definitely an interesting mix .
We are fortunate to be hosted on Engine Yard , though .
If we did n’t have them we ’d be screwed .
Their awesome cluster setup with GFS means we can host our potentially 100s of gigs of repositories on a shared , raid ’d drive with redundancy and backups .
If we were running Github on a barebones VPS , I dont even know how we ’d share access to those repos .
It would n’t be fun .
They also have a lot of experts available 24/7 , which is great because I have a tendency to forget to sleep and work until 7 am .
A lot of the pain of running a heavily unix - dependent site is taken away by those guys .
AkitaOnRails : Interesting , Erlang ?
I ’d like to know what are you up to with it Going back , I think I saw a Rails trunk Git clone at Github way before DHH announced it a few days ago .
I think it was Michael Koziarski who first did it , without much fuzz .
Were you planning this together with the 37signals guys , or the switch of the Rails Core to Github was something that happened naturally ?
And do you have any kind of partnership with the Lighthouse guys as well , because you already have some hooks to manage Lighthouse tickets through Github commit messages , right ?
Chris Wanstrath : The Erlang stuff will be very cool , I promise .
We ’ll make a big fuss about it when it ’s ready .
As far as the Rails thing goes , koz did indeed have a mirror of his Git - svn repo at Github during the beta .
It was unofficial .
Then in february he wrote a post explaining that the core was thinking about moving to Git .
When I saw the post I emailed him and we talked a bit about what it would take to move Rails to Github , which was obviously something I love on a huge number of levels .
He said he would get back to me , and then a few weeks later the Core team contacted us and wanted to discuss the move .
The rest is history .
I really respect the work the Lighthouse team does .
The bug tracker is great , and the new redesign is even better , but we do n’t have any official partnership with them .
We wrote the post - receive lighthouse hook because we wanted it , Rails wanted it , and a huge number of our users wanted it .
AkitaOnRails : Many others started moving to Github during the Beta .
I think Merb was more obvious because of Ezra ’s being involved in Engine Yard .
Dr. Nic started using it for the Textmate bundles .
Can you point any other high profile Rails related projects hosted at Github right now ?
Chris Wanstrath : Merb was actually the reason Github went into beta .
We launched the beta so they could start using the site for their 0.9 rewrite of merb - core .
As far as popular projects , the best thing to do is check https://Github.com/popular/watched and https://Github.com/popular/forked.
Datamapper , Rspec , and Mephisto are some of the popular ones .
AkitaOnRails :
Are you using vanilla
Git code , or did you customize it in anyway to better fit your environment ?
Have you ever talked to Junio Hamano or any other Git core maintainer ?
With Github probably eating up a lot of your time , how is Chow and FamSpam going right now ?
How are you managing all those products all at once ?
Chris Wanstrath : We ’ve patched Git - daemon to record statistics , which we ’ll soon be surfacing on the website soon in the form of better , more granular activity .
You ’ll be able to see how many times your project was cloned , popular projects in the last 24 hours , all time most cloned projects , that sort of thing .
We ’ve emailed the core Git guys about the site , just to say thanks for writing Git and to let them know about Github , but have n’t really had an occasion to chat with them about anything in particular .
If I ever run into any of them , I ’ll definitely be buying them a few drinks , though .
I do n’t actually work at Chow anymore .
My last day at C|NET was almost exactly one year ago , so my Ruby time is spent on FamSpam , Github , open source , and doing occasional client work .
FamSpam is going well .
Now that Github is launched , there are a handful of features we want to get in and all .
Luckily , however , the site is very polished and has been running smoothly without the need for much intervention .
What we ’d really love to do , because it ’s really just a great Rails - based mailing list , is try out some different concepts .
Maybe one for open source , or a version for little league teams – anyone who needs to keep in touch and have their email workflow and document sharing streamlined .
For right now , however , I try to spend as much time as possible on Github .
There are so many places we want to take it .
AkitaOnRails : I probably more than exceeded my interview time ( sorry about that ) , but this conversation is super - interesting .
One project I just remembered is Sake .
To me Sake is very neat because many people complain about “ how difficult and complex ” the Git command line is , and Sake - like solutions make the workflow a lot easier .
For instance , my entire Git workflow for Rails projects are only 4 small sake tasks like Git:update and Git:push .
If I am not mistaken someone at Err did Sake , right ?
Are you still evolving it ?
Chris Wanstrath : Yeah , I wrote Sake .
It ’s not a Rails plugin but it was written to help in Rails development .
The “ Git tasks ” for Sake are becoming quite popular , as Git really just facilitates a better workflow .
If you want to implement it , or different branches of that workflow , you can pretty easily just wrap up a few commands into a rake task or bash script .
And while bash scripts are great , sake tasks are portable .
A lot of sake was inspired , very loosely , on Git – you can pull in sake tasks from any text file , whether it ’s on the web or local , and sake comes with its own daemon for serving your tasks .
So you could share tasks over wifi , or something , the same way you could share Git repositories over an adhoc network .
Sake is up on Github , so feel free to add features you feel should exist .
AkitaOnRails : Another thing I would like to hear your opinion about .
I recently made a presentation on Rails Deployment strategies for beginners .
The most common simple architecture revolves around Apache / Nginx / Litespeed + Mongrel / Evented Mongrel / Thin / Ebb .
It is usually a matter of load balancing between a Web server using some kind of IPC to distribute the load back to Ruby VMs running your Rails app .
Now we have mod_Rails .
What ’s your opinion on having all those choices , do you have any particular recipe you like or it depends on each application ’s needs ?
Did you have time to test mod_Rails ?
I think Hongli Lai is doing great stuff in regards to things like mongrel_light_cluster and his efforts on making Ruby ’s GC more copy - on - write friendly , did you take a look at that ?
Chris Wanstrath :
The nice thing about Engine Yard is they get to take care of all that stuff for me .
So while I used to spend a lot of time benchmarking and playing with different solutions , like Mongrel vs Emongrel , I just let the experts take care of it so I can focus on Github ..
So no , I have n’t played with mod_Rails yet because I ’m not in the situation where I could deploy it even if I wanted to use it .
Which is in my opinion the best situation to be in , and pretty much the reason mod_Rails was written .
AkitaOnRails :
And by the way , are you going to make any presentation at RailsConf this year ?
Chris Wanstrath : I am .
I ’ll be talking about “ Beyond cap deploy ” , which will pretty much be an in - depth look at the Github architecture , and then I ’ll be on a panel with Ben Curtis , Geoff Grosenbach , P.J. , and Tom about being a “ profitable programmer ” w/ side projects .
AkitaOnRails : I am very pleased to have the opportunity to talk to you .
Chris Wanstrath : Yes , you too .
Thanks !

Hillary Clinton , Elton John May be Investigated for Campaign Fraud
Another possible campaign finance violation by a Clinton ?
Say it ai n’t so .
You know the old saying , if you ai n’t cheating , you ai n’t trying ?
It is more than a motto to the Clinton ’s , it is a way of life to them .
A group now wants the recent benefit concert in which Elton John performed to be investigated for campaign finance violations .
You remember the concert , it was the one where Elton John called Americans misogynistic and told Americans to go to hell .
The same Elton John who crooned this about Margaret Thatcher :
So merry Christmas Maggie Thatcher
May God ’s love be with you
We all sing together in one breath
Merry Christmas Maggie Thatcher
We all celebrate today
‘ Cause it ’s one day closer to your death
Talk about misogynistic .
Anyway , time to get back on topic .
I just got a little carried away .
It is illegal for a presidential candidate to take money from foreign nationals , this concert could violate campaign laws .
“ Recent news reports suggest that Hillary Clinton and Hillary Clinton for President have accepted an in - kind contribution from a foreign national , Sir Elton John , in contravention of federal election laws , ” “ On behalf of Judicial Watch and its supporters , I hereby request that the FEC investigate this matter . ”
Just another misunderstanding by the Clinton campaign , at least that is what they will tell us .
Or another vast right wing conspiracy .

Presumably you come to read the news , primarily , not the comments ?
Also , the idea of the comments section , I would have thought , is so that you can post your own views for people to see - not specifically to change everybody else 's views - and you are not forced to agree with anyone else 's views .
With the comments section comes the inherent idea that some comments you disagree with , some comments you wo n't like , and some people you wo n't like .
But that 's life - and it would be ( more ) boring otherwise .
Well , I love reading what other people say .
It 's when you have to decipher what they are saying first that gets me down .
It makes me lose all faith in humanity .
On a more basic level , it makes it hard to understand the point that someone is trying to get across .
It might be the most valid , life - changing point in the world , but if it 's ill - written and needs translating , then the point may be lost and the world may never be the better place it could have been .
I have to say I admire SuperSaiyan4 for trying to make it clearer .
See , I believe if you live and let live , then nobody will learn from their mistakes .
But if heavy criticism is taken the right way - e.g .
" I am going to show these bastards they are WRONG about me ! " - then it may mean that one matures and grows in a positive direction in the face of arrogant negativity .
I for one know that I can be a picky bastard , but I do n't mean no harm really guv'nor .
I just like to dish out a bit of tough love from time to time .
SS4 is definitely maturing in attitude and commentary ; all we need to do now is teach him / her how to do grammar right and the world will be an idyllic utopia .
I believe that it 's possible that SS4 may even rise to be President of such a utopia .
Stranger things have happened ...
( CNN ) -- Tony Snow , former White House press secretary under President Bush , has joined CNN as a political contributor .
Snow discussed the 2008 presidential race Monday on " Larry King Live " following an appearance by Sen. Hillary Clinton .
Tony Snows says the Democratic race pits Barack Obama 's charisma against Hillary Clinton 's experience .
LARRY KING : What did you think of Sen. Clinton ?
TONY SNOW :
On substance , there 's not a huge difference between her and Barack Obama on key issues .
It comes down to personality .
For many Obama voters , it is " we like him . "
Hillary Clinton 's trying to make the argument that he is really not quite ready for prime time .
...
There are things in his background that he has to rectify .
I think she fairly artfully laid out some of the themes that are going to go on .
But she 's also right , this is not a campaign that ends tomorrow , although a lot of people want it done tomorrow .
This is going to go through June .
KING : What about the suggestion of Republicans in [ Clinton 's ] Cabinet ?
SNOW : Barack Obama 's figured out a couple of things .
No. 1 , people want optimism .
No. 2 , they want a sense of national unity .
So she 's laid out that she might have Republicans in .
But there 's nothing in the record the last few years to indicate that Sen.
Clinton ... is going to reach out to Republicans or agree with them on much of anything .
KING : Who 's going to win [ the Pennsylvania primary ] ?
SNOW : I guess Hillary 's going to win .
But it 's interesting , her biggest opponent right now is not Barack Obama .
It 's conventional wisdom , because everybody 's trying to set a margin .
The fact is , you win , you win .
And the argument that she 's been making -- I think it 's pretty compelling -- you win the big traditionally Democratic states .
If Barack Obama 's getting ahead in Republican states , do you have a candidate who 's going to be able to propel you to victory ?
KING : How do you see November ?
SNOW : I think [ Sen. John ]
McCain 's going to win , actually , because I think security and the economy both break his way .
But on the Democratic side ... you have got this charisma and emotion on the part of Obama .
Can people stay in love with him from now until November ?
If so , it makes him a stronger candidate .
If , on the other hand , the more you learn about him , the more you fall out of love , that 's a campaign that could collapse .
Meanwhile , with Hillary Clinton , you have somebody who is battle tested .
You have a political machine .
You have a lot of experience .
And you 're going to have the ability to do whatever it takes to try to pull the party together .
If you need that kind of machine operation , I think she does better .

All About Barack Obama • Hillary Clinton
The Clinton campaign claims that since it won the " big states " , it makes her a more effective general election candidate .
Let 's take a look at that logic .
The 10 biggest states by population .
I 've added numbers form SUSA 's 50 - state poll matching up Obama and Clinton to McCain .
1. ) California : O +9 , C +10
2. ) Texas : O -1 , O - 7
3. ) New York : O +14 , C +18
4. ) Florida : O -2 , C +9
5. ) Illinois : O +29 , C +11
6. ) Pennsylvania : O -5 , C +1
7. ) Ohio : O +10 , C +10
8. ) Michigan : O +1 , C-even
9. ) Georgia : O - 13 , C - 21
10 . ) North Carolina : O -2 , C -8
Of those , California , New York , and Ohio ( all of which Clinton won ) are solidly Democratic .
California and New York will certainly stay ( D ) in November .
Illinois , which Obama won , is solidly ( D ) no matter who the nominee is .
The two are essentially even in Michigan , while neither is currently competitive in Georgia .
Of the states that will be competitive , Obama has clear advantages in Texas and North Carolina , while Clinton has clear advantages in Pennsylvania and Florida .
In the electoral math , that is 49 EVs for Obama , 48 for Clinton .
Yup , Obama has a one electoral vote advantage from the top 10 " big states " that Clinton can't stop yammering about .
But more important than the biggest states should be the closest states in 2004 .
I 've coded states that Obama won this primary season in Blue , Clinton in Red .
Those still pending in black :
New Mexico : - 1
Iowa : -1
New Hampshire : +1
Wisconsin : +1
Ohio : - 2
Pennsylvania : +2
Michigan : +3
Minnesota : +3
Nevada : -3
Oregon : +4 [ update : changed to " pending " from Blue ]
Colorado : -5
Florida : -5
Delaware : +7
Washington : +7
Missouri : -7
New Jersey : +7
Virginia : -8
If you were to make the moronic assumption that only the winner of the primary could win those states , that would add up to 81 74 electoral votes for Obama , 49 for Clinton .
But better yet , let 's look at SUSA 's 50 state poll and see how the candidates fared in these states against McCain .
I 've color coded them Blue for states that Obama does better in , and Red for those Clinton does better :
New Mexico : O +7 , C-even
Iowa : O +9 , C -5
New Hampshire : O +2 , C -8
Wisconsin : O +11 , C +4
Ohio : O +10 , C +10
Pennsylvania : O -5 , C +1
Michigan : O +1 , C-even
Minnesota : O +7 , C +4
Nevada : O +5 , C -8
Oregon : O +8 , C -5
Colorado : O +9 , C -6
Florida : O -2 , C +9
Delaware : O +9 , C +5
Washington : O +14 , C -2
Missouri : O -6 , C -4
New Jersey : O-even , C +5
Virginia : O-even , C - 10
Pretty stark , huh ?
In terms of electoral votes , that 's an advantage of 101 for Obama , 74 for Clinton .
No matter how you parse it , the data is clear that Obama is the more competitive November candidate for the Democratic Party .
A trial of the new cervical cancer vaccine programme for schoolgirls across the country has encountered opposition from parents , with 20 % refusing to give permission for their daughters to have the jab .
A third of those who gave a reason for refusal said they were worried about the long - term safety , on which there is no data .
But some may have concerns that allowing vaccination may promote promiscuity , because the cancer - causing virus which the vaccination targets is passed on in sexual intercourse .
Two schools declined to take part for religious reasons .
The findings from the pilot study , involving 2,817 girls aged 12 and 13 in year 8 at 36 secondary schools in Greater Manchester , are published by the British Medical Journal today .
In an accompanying editorial , Professor Jo Waller and Dr Jane Wardle from the department of epidemiology and public health at University College London say 12 - and 13 - year - old girls whose parents refuse consent may be competent to decide for themselves .
The £ 100 m vaccination programme , which targets strains of the human papilloma virus ( HPV ) responsible for most cases of cervical cancer , is due to begin in schools across the UK in September for 12 - and 13 - year - olds , followed by a catch - up programme for girls up to 18 .
The pilot began in February last year , with two out of 10 primary care trusts agreeing to take part .
Parents were sent information , consent forms and reminders .
Uptake was significantly lower in schools with a high proportion of girls from ethnic minority groups and those entitled to free school meals .
Wardle and Waller said that in the wake of the MMR controversy , " work needs to be done to restore public confidence in immunisation " .

Also known as : Fallacy of Extension , straw dog fallacy , scarecrow argument , wooden dummy argument , single - villain ideology
A Straw Man is a classic logical fallacy where a person manufactures a caricature ( usually a misinterpretation or oversimplification ) of his opponent 's argument , and then sets out to attack or dismiss the exaggeration .
i.e. Building a straw man and then knocking it down .
This is a very dishonest line of argument , since a person puts words into his opponent 's mouth then ridicules them .
Its name is derived from the practice of using straw men in combat training .
In such training , a scarecrow is made in the image of the enemy with the single intent of attacking it .
The most prevalent use of strawmen argumentation today involves sweeping generalizations and labeling people as being part of pre-demonized ethnic , cultural or social groups : liberals , illegal immigrants , " Socialists " , blacks , Jews , etc .
Straw Man examples
" I believe it requires more " faith " to accept a theory that says our amazingly precise , intricately complex universe just exploded into being out of nothingness " [ 1 ]
The strawman here is that creation and all life " just exploded " , or " happened by chance " ( perhaps the most common Straw Man example employed by theists ) .
This is of course , a complete mischaracterization of evolution , quantum theory , astrophysics , biology and everything in between .
The writer suggests that one possible explanation for life , is that it " just happened " .
This is the weakest and most shallow answer possible , and is not any idea that a learned scientist in an appropriate field would endorse , yet the person uses this horrible example as a standard by which his opponent 's claims should be judged .
If he can find a fault in this " straw man " he 's created , or if he can get his opponent to suggest , " Yes , it 's unlikely things ' just exploded out of nothingness ' " then he will declare that he 's won the argument .
If you do n't support our president invading Iraq then you must love Muslim terrorists .
Strawman arguments often paint the world in black and white , also known as a False Dichotomy , as if there is only right and wrong and nothing in between .
Pick a position that is politically - correct and if you do n't align with it , then by default you must somehow be the exact opposite .
Liberals want America to fail in the Middle East .
An otherwise ridiculously ignorant claim can be almost suggested as legitimate if you incorporate a strawman group like " liberals " into the equation .
It 's not - specific but has been previously defined as some sort of " evil " or " unpleasant " ambiguous group of enemies on which various things can be blamed .
Since there is no particular " leader " of the " liberals " , there 's nobody motivated to defend such ignorant statements and pundits in the media declare by lieu of no argument , their statements are truthful .
Strawmen in the media BY DESIGN
Strawman Pundits
An interesting technique that is appearing in mainstream media and specifically news shows like CNN and Fox are " Strawmen commentators " where a very powerful speaker represents one side of an issue , while a weaker ideologue represents the other , ( i.e. Hannity & Colmes -- the aggressive overbearing Sean Hannity makes the so - called liberal Alan Colmes appear to be ineffective ) .
Roundtable discussions on networks like CNN routinely feature very skilled debaters on one side , and amateurs or extremists on the other .
How often do you see the voice of reason illustrated on roundtable discussions such as Crossfire ?
You usually see the network 's point of view , along with some extremist nutjob , or demonized attention whore as the representative icon of the other side .
Strawman Topics
Certain issues seem to lend themselves to strawmen arguments .
For example , when advocating tort reform , frivolous lawsuits such as a woman who sued McDonalds and got $ 3 M for being served hot coffee [ 2 ] - this suit is held as an example of wasteful lawsuits , as if most lawsuits are of this nature .
Furthermore , of course , the characterization of the actual lawsuit in the media is often grossly inaccurate .
These types of cases make for perfect straw man arguments ( assuming people do not do their own investigating to realize the networks are lying ) .
Pay attention to my strawman , people !
This two - bit Arabian dictator is the biggest threat evah to America !
BOOGA BOOGA !
Colon Powell scares congress into condoning the Iraq invasion by holding up a fake vial of antrax .
Strawman Demons
A very effective way of employing a strawman argument is through Ad Hominem sweeping generalization , which is the setup for the Guilt by association fallacy .
If the news media runs a story on the thousand plus people who protested the World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle , and shows a videotape of a stoned college student banging a drum and dancing , they create a strawman implying that anyone protesting the WTO is a wasted hippy .
Furthermore the strawman notion of a " tree hugger " has become synonymous with environmentalists , even though a typical person who cares about global warming is n't likely to chain themselves to a tree in protest .
Strawman Advertising
Invoking strawmen is a staple in the advertising business , from implying that drinking the right beer will give you wonderful friends and good times , to driving the right car making you more manly , patriotic , or a babe magnet .
Fearmongering
Scaring people is a basic component of strawman arguing .
A political candidate who suggests that the country would be less safe if his opponent were elected is creating a strawman using fear to motivate people to vote a certain way .
The entire Iraq invasion was perpetrated through an elaborate strawman concocted via the Bush administration 's attempt to paint Saddam Hussein as a threat to America .
Variations on Strawman
A strawman argument is a type of Red Herring , a distraction , often designed to divert attention away from qualifying the real issue .
It 's often used as an Ad Hominem to dismiss a person 's arguments prior to consideration :
What do you expect from someone who used to be friends with Louis Farrakhan ?
I would n't trust a word he says .
Guilt by association is a classic variation on the strawman argument .
Famous Real Strawmen
Virtually any historical figure of importance has a slightly distorted reputation , but some more than others have become much larger than their real life 's work warrants and have become symbolic strawmen often invoked to shut down an argument :
Adolf Hitler -
The quitessential strawman .
To invoke his name in an argument is to immediately kill off any intelligent discourse .
Whatever extent to which Hitler was universally immoral or " evil " , pales in comparison to his value as a metaphor for anything and everything anyone who is decent should stand against .
Michael Moore -
His work has been so heavily demonized , he is largely considered to be a propagandist on par with other historical figures who really did go out of their way to distort facts and figures .
Nonetheless , a careful analysis of Moore 's work and his statements will show a consistent attempt to show the truth and back up claims with facts and sources that are non-biased .
Hillary Clinton -
This woman was a GOP demon all through the 1990s for reasons nobody can seem to understand .
Her husband may have committed adultery , but her reputation seems to have suffered the most .
Now Hillary is synonymous with lesbians and socialism .
Ronald Reagan -
This is a great example of a false - positive strawman .
Ronald Reagan is greatly revered in conservative circles for being a " great president " and having a sound economic and social policy , but in reality , his record is anything of the sort .
Invoking Reagan 's name has become a sort of sacred pilgrimage for republicans , and likely because he is now deceased , it is considered taboo to speak critically of him or his policy .
A perfect strawman .
United Nations -
In many circles , most notably the American media , the U.N. has become a metaphor for the potential loss of American autonomy and power .
Characterized on CNN and Fox News as an ineffective , bumbling , racist , corrupt organization run by evil foreign leaders intent on destroying America , very little mention is made of the fact that the United States has more control and influence in the U.N. than any other nation , picks - and - chooses whether to pay attention to them , and the media largely ignores the plethora of valuable , life - saving programs the U.N. is involved in .
Instead , the reference is often invoked to scare and provoke people into backing the contention that the United States should not pay attention to any other world leaders with whom they disagree .
Video examples
Pat Robertson creates a huge straw man , by characterizing liberal college professors as " communists " , " killers " , " people who beat up on students " and " termites " attacking the very fabric of academia :
Watch Keith Olbermann call out Bill O'Reilly for creating an elaborate straw man argument centering around some supposed " Secular Progressive Conspiracy " to destroy Christmas :
The way O'Reilly paints things , you 'd think anyone who wants the holiday season to be more in tune with its true Pagan roots is part of some highly - organized cabal of mysterious secular soldiers .
Yea right .
Fox New 's Neil Cavuto strawmans an atheist who argues it 's inappropriate for a presidential candidate to use religious propaganda in a campaign ad :

The Great Horned Owls at Thompson Rivers University
This trio of Great Horned ( Bubo virginianus ) owls was first noticed March 11 , 2008 .
The nest is located on the Thompson Rivers University Campus in Kamloops , BC .
The Great Horned Owl is not an endangered species ( in Canada ) , but nesting in an urban environment is quite unusual .
Also a bit unusual , but not unheard of , is the early nesting time for this trio .
Owl update - April 7 , 2008
We are delighted to announce that the two owlets have successfully fledged .
They 've been observed moving from tree to tree around campus , and may stay around the area for a week or more before going out into the wider world .
Thanks for enjoying them with us !

As a young woman in the workforce , I am bombarded with media stories about the “ Mommy Wars ” between working mothers and stay - at - home moms and the “ off - ramping / on - ramping ” a woman ’s career takes if she decides take an off - ramp from the freeway of corporate life to raise children .
How to best approach working motherhood seems to be a loaded question , soliciting the harshest critics on either side with no sign of agreement in sight .
Is it possible for women to have it all — a career , a husband and a family ?
In the Go - Go 80s , women were told and encouraged to have it all .
Films like Baby Boom , Working Girl and even Mr. Mom all showed that women could have successful , high - powered careers as well as fulfilling personal lives — even if it took some creative arrangements to get there .
A generation later , the tides seem to be turning , with a flood of personal stories saying exactly the opposite — having a full - time career cannot be combined with full - time motherhood .
Brazen Careerist , Penelope Trunk , recently shared her story about hiring house manager to help run her household in addition to a nanny and a personal assistant .
She argues that a stay - at - home spouse ( or hired equivalent ) is a necessity in an age where a high - powered career requires 24/7 focus .
“ So I want you to know what it ’s really like to be a woman competing with the men who have stay - at - home wives : Expensive .
There are jokes about the hyperbole of the annual study that says that housewives are worth six - figures .
I think it is not hyperbole .
Those men are getting not just a house manager , but someone who adores his kids , is there all the time , and someone who is willing to have some sort of regular sex life .
For all that , the estimate of $ 100,000 a year seems very low . ”
“ So here ’s my advice to women who want a big career and a stable family :
You need to earn a lot of money to make that happen .
I do n’t know a stay - at - home dad who is seriously taking care of kids full - time , over the course of five - to - seven years , without a lot of money in the bank .
And I do n’t know a woman who has a huge career without money to support a bunch of people to take care of things at home . ”
The Wall Street Journal supports Penelope ’s advice by showcasing words of wisdom from top executives who do n’t apologize for putting their careers first :
“ For years , many ambitious women were ducking criticism that a high - powered job meant they cared only about their careers and would never have a family — or have one that was neglected .
Now , women who have climbed high up the corporate ladder are asserting that they have a lot to celebrate and nothing to apologize for . ”
“ After all , plenty of women toil at much lower - level jobs and work just as hard , but do n’t get the big rewards of their high - placed counterparts — from substantial compensation to the chance to make decisions instead of just following them . ”
It seems as if women are almost forced to choose between family and a career .
Should you work long hours or spend more time with your kids ?
Will your kids be better off having memories of playing catch or with a fully - paid college fund ?
What kind of lifestyle will make you happiest ?
Summers at the beach ?
Or networking with international titans ?
These are the types of decisions that everyone with a family has had to make at some point in their lives , regardless of their gender .
Only the individual can truly asses what values they have and what type of lifestyle they want and can afford .
I worry that I wo n’t make enough money to quit my job should I want to stay - at - home with my future children and that I would be robbed of a choice at all .
Ultimately , I think women should feel lucky to even have choices and stop struggling with what others think of their decisions .
Who Needs Air Conditioning When You ’ve Got Ice - Cold Water Running Through Your Shirt ?
It was about two years ago when I first saw ice vests in a running catalog and thought something along the lines of “ would n’t that be a sweet thing to wear in the car on the way to school instead of blasting my ( non-working ) A/C ! ”
Well , it seems the idea has n’t quite died .
Some users on the EcoModder forums have recently been discussing this idea , so I thought I ’d put together some of the ways I know to beat the heat without turning on the A/C , which reduces your fuel economy .
Get an ice / cold vest :
If you do n’t want to look through a sports catalog for an ice vest , you can use something like this ( shown in the picture above ) , that circulates cold water through a shirt next to your skin .
These things are usually used by racers who need to be in their cars for long periods of time in extreme conditions , and can cost several hundred dollars .
But if you really want to squeeze that extra 5 MPG by not turning on the air conditioning , this ( or a cheaper version , like an athlete ’s ice vest ) might be for you .
Throw on a beaded seat cover : I have yet to try this , but Darin Cosgrove , of MetroMPG ecomodding and hypermiling fame swears that it works .
He even goes so far as to call it his “ air conditioning . ”
I used to think they were just for hippies with back problems , but do n’t let those biases deter you !
I ’ll be trying them out this summer , for sure .
Check out the “ EV Seat ” :
There sure is n’t much information , but the idea of a heating and air conditioning seat cover you can just plug in is definitely interesting .
Check it out , and if you can find another version that ’s a little more available looking , drop a comment and let me know !
DIY a portable air conditioner : Instructables has some great stuff , but this DIY air conditioner is definitely one of the cheapest I have ever seen .
If you feel like getting a little dirty , or just getting inspiration from this great device , you ’ll be able to go without A/C all summer long .
Window tint is your friend : I have n’t done this yet , but this summer I will be finding some heat - reflective window tint and doing up my windows in order to keep the heat down just a few degrees .
It works and is worth checking out , especially if you leave your car parked out in the sun .
I ’ll be trying out all these things this summer , looking to get the best mix for me , my fuel economy , and my wallet , so look forward to some updates .

This is a stinker of an issue for the Republicans , but Bush promised big media that they would get a loosening of the rules back in the 2000 campaign and his FCC wants to fulfill it 's promise .
Last time the FCC was flooded with letters and emails to the point that the politicians had to slap it back .
They 'd clearly touched a nerve .
This time they 're being a bit more savvy and having public comment ( though extremely short ) so they can say they 've done it .
They 're putting this issue through a short time frame to try to get it out of the primary season and have a done deal .
I was at an interesting meeting last night of media activists and an undisclosed source from the FCC .
The agenda was thrown out the window after the news broke about this plan to rush consolidation through .
We spent the time talking strategy about how to defeat this proposal .
The time is short , so we need to make a stink now .
If you go to a presidential candidate 's event , ask them about media consolidation .
If your congress critters are on the Commerce Committees , express your displeasure .
If you live in a state where the commissioners are from , tell them that if they approve this , you 'll never let them hear the end of it in their political careers .
If you 're in Seattle , show up early to the hearing on November 2 .

World number one Roger Federer beat Pete Sampras in three sets in an exhibition match at Madison Square Garden .
Federer , who revealed last week that he has been suffering from glandular fever , beat the 14 - time Grand Slam winner 6 - 3 6 - 7 7 - 6 in an absorbing contest .
Sampras rolled out his classic serve - and - volley game , improving with each set and prompting a rusty Federer to step up in order to claim the victory in two hours and 15 minutes .
Federer has lost his last two competitive outings , falling to Novak Djokovic in the Australian Open semi-final and then making a first - round exit to Andy Murray in Dubai as he continues his recovery from the illness .
But he broke Sampras ' serve in the first game of the match as the 12 - time Grand Slam winner eased through the opening set .
Positive response
Sampras , who retired in 2003 after having played his last competitive match in the 2002 US Open final , responded in the second and held his serve to force a tiebreak and then served superbly to build a 5 - 2 cushion before capturing the set .
The 36 - year - old rallied from a 2 - 0 deficit in the final set to take a 5 - 2 lead , but 26 - year - old Federer stepped up his game and broke back to 5 - 4 , and after serving a perfect game at 6 - 5 down , claimed the tie - break and the match .
Federer and Sampras only met once competitively when the then unseeded 20 - year - old Swiss staged an upset at Wimbledon in 2001 after beating the defending champion in five sets to reach the quarter - finals .
Last November Federer beat Sampras 2 - 1 in a three - match Asian Tour after the American recorded a straight sets victory in the final match in Macau .
Sampras , meanwhile , has backed Federer to overcome his current troubles and resume his dominance of the world game .
Unbeatable
" Roger 's sort of created this monster , of being unbeatable , and just losing a match people have the assumption that he 's lost his ability , lost his dominance , " Sampras said .
" I do n't think that at all .
I think he 'll do just fine .
" Every great player in all sports will pick up losses here and there , I certainly did that , and people will start to think he 's lost his edge .
" Let 's just be fair , and try to keep it real .
This guy is incredible and he 'll bounce back just fine , I 've no question about that . "
TEHRAN ( Reuters ) - Iran said on Saturday it would press ahead with plans to expand its nuclear program , after diplomats in Vienna said Tehran was installing advanced centrifuges in its key uranium enrichment plant .
The government spokesman also rejected any idea of halting work the United States suspects is aimed at building nuclear bombs in return for trade , technology and other benefits .
Speaking a few days before the Islamic Republic ’s annual National Nuclear Technology Day on April 8 , Gholamhossein Elham said he hoped for “ good news ” on that day but did not elaborate .
The world ’s fourth - largest oil producer says it needs to produce nuclear fuel for a planned network of power plants to satisfy soaring electricity demand .
“ The trend of advancing nuclear capacity until reaching the production of nuclear fuel and building nuclear power plants to produce 20,000 megawatts of electricity will continue , ” Elham said .
On Thursday , diplomats told Reuters Iran has begun installing advanced uranium enrichment centrifuges in its Natanz enrichment complex , accelerating activity that could give it the means to make atom bombs in future if it chose to .
Iran has been hit with three sets of United Nations sanctions for hiding the program until 2003 , failing to prove to inspectors since then that it is wholly peaceful and refusing to suspend the disputed program .
Enriched uranium can be used as fuel in nuclear power plants or , if refined much further , provide material for weapons .
After a pause of several months , Iran has now assembled more than 300 centrifuges divided into two cascades ( interlinked networks ) to expand beyond 3,000 , the diplomats said .
The Washington Times reported last month the five permanent U.N. Security Council members were preparing a package of incentives for Tehran if it stops its program .
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has rejected the reported package of incentives , Japan ’s Kyodo news agency quoted him as saying in an interview published on Friday .
Elham said : “ This ( nuclear technology ) is our obvious right and we do not exchange our rights for things like incentives . ”
Ahmadinejad has also said Iran would only discuss its nuclear program with the U.N. International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , rejecting a call by world powers to hold more talks with European Union foreign policy chief Javier Solana .
“ We do not accept replacing the IAEA ... in the framework of negotiations , ” Elham said .

Almost all of us have , at some time , been chided by a parent or grandparent who has been mislead by an old wives ’ tale .
Their intentions are always good , but unfortunately they are misguided .
There are thousands of old wives ’ tales – ranging from the seemingly logical to the outright bizarre .
This is a list of ten of the most common old wives ’ tales which are , in fact , bunkum !
Feel free to use the comments to tell us about some of the more unusual tales you have come across in your life .
10 Feed a Fever Starve a Cold
In fact , both colds and fevers cause dehydration – so liquids are essential when suffering from either .
In addition , missing out on food when you are sick is never a good idea as food provides the body with the sustenance it needs to get healthy .
So , you should feed a fever and feed a cold .
This , of course , does not mean to overeat – it means to eat healthy balanced meals .
9 Eating Before Swimming
There is an old wives ’ tale that says that if you eat within an hour of swimming you will get cramp .
The Red Cross says that eating directly prior to swimming does not increase risk of cramp at all .
They do , however , recommend at least waiting for digestion to begin if you have eaten a particularly fatty meal .
They also recommend that you not eat gum or food while you are swimming .
8 Chocolate Causes Acne
There is actually not an iota of evidence to support this tale – no food type ( not just chocolate ) can cause acne or bad skin .
Needless to say , eating too much chocolate or sugary food is unhealthy for the body , but it will not cause skin problems .
Acne is actually caused by changes in the lower layers of the skin surrounding hair follicles .
7 Carrots Improve your Vision
It is possible that this tale came about due to allied propaganda during the second world war when rumors were spread that the British airmen had excellent night vision due to eating carrots .
The myth was spread to stop the Germans from discovering that the British were using Radar .
While carrots contain vitamin A which is good for healthy eyes , eating lots of them will do nothing to improve your vision .
6 Catching a Cold
There are a huge number of myths about how to catch a cold , but in fact there is only one way to catch a cold virus – by direct contact with the virus itself .
You can stand outside on a cold night with wet hair and your chances of getting a cold do not increase at all .
The reason that colds seem to spread more in Winter is not from the cold itself , but the fact that people tend to live more often indoors and this increases your chances of coming in to contact with a sufferer .
It is also worth mentioning that if you get a cold in your nose , you can not stop it from spreading to your chest if the virus is programmed to attack you there .
Most cold medicines are completely pointless and do nothing to help except alleviate the pain through the inclusion of painkillers .
5 TV and Eyesight
My parents constantly told me off for sitting too close to the television when I was a kid – I was told that my eyesight would deteriorate from doing so .
The same was also said of reading in dim light .
In fact , neither of these things do any damage to the eyes .
It should be noted , however , that spending too much time in front of the TV is not good for children ( regardless of how close they sit ) as research has shown that children who spend 10 hours or more in front of the television each week are more likely to become overweight , aggressive , and slower in school .
4 Masturbation Causes Blindness
The tale states that masturbation will cause blindness ( in France it is said it will cause deafness ) .
This is not true ( at least not completely ) and the idea has probably been spread in order to prevent children from masturbating for religious reasons .
Curiously , sperm contains quite a lot of zinc , and a serious zinc deficiency can cause a decline in vision .
However , it is nearly impossible to cause a zinc deficiency through masturbating .
3 Knuckles and Arthritis
While it is true that constant knuckle cracking can reduce the strength of your grip and cause swelling , it does not lead to arthritis .
There are many causes of arthritis ( such as trauma or infection of a joint , or old age ) , but knuckle cracking is not one of them .
2 Spicy Food and Ulcers
If a person suffers from an ulcer , spicy food can often aggravate it ; however , ulcers are not caused by spicy food at all – if they were , ulcers would be pandemic in many eastern nations .
An ulcer is usually caused by overuse of medications like aspirin and anti-inflammatories .
1 Toads and Warts
It is almost certain that this strange old wives ’ tale has come about because of the appearance of wart - like growths on many toads .
In fact , these growths are not human compatible at all .
Warts are caused by viruses and they are almost always exclusive to a particular genus of creature .
Human ’s cannot catch warts from other animals , and animals can not catch human warts .
The most common human wart virus is called the human papillomavirus .
The Casual Games Manifesto
By Daniel Cook
[ Casual games are vital to the future of the biz - but how does a developer navigate the middlemen - strewn digital distribution future ?
In this in - depth piece , Lost Garden blogger Daniel Cook presents a manifesto to help casual game devs get loyal customers with great social games . ]
A few years ago , casual game development has heralded as a safe haven for the independent , creative forces in the game development community .
All the past worries of shelf space limitations , ornery publishers and expensive development budgets no longer applied .
In the new world of high profit margins , limited middlemen and free green lighting for all , innovation would inevitably flourish .
And for the most part , once you account for Sturgeon 's inevitable law that 90 % of everything is crap , this is exactly what happened .
More game developers poured into the market and some truly wonderful games were born .
Middlemen , however , were not eliminated .
They merely evolved .
In the place of brick and mortar stores , portals emerged .
Instead of limited shelf space , there was limited access to top ten lists .
Instead having your company name sidelined in the spirit of publisher branding , your game is whitewashed with the portal 's brand , advertisements and customer retention systems .
In return , the portals offered quick sales on your latest game .
Game developers trade their future for a fast sale now and the portals attempt to pick up the long term customer loyalty .
Much of this is uncomfortably familiar to the early publisher / developer relationships of years past .
How can casual game developers adapt ?
In order to maintain the biggest piece of the pie possible , casual game developers need to evolve their business strategy .
This essay covers the following :
Strengths and weaknesses of the typical successful casual game developer
How the addition of developer - run online services can help mitigate the weaknesses of the current downloadable business model
How a developer 's strengths as makers of great games can be turned into a competitive advantage when surviving in an ecosystem filled with larger service - oriented portals
The current dominant strategy
There are two pillars to the typical casual game developer 's strategy :
Best - in - class casual games
The golden geese at the center of most casual game developers ' success are their high - quality casual games .
The best groups create a powerful creative team that consistently builds polished , innovative titles that have strong appeal with a wide demographic of players .
Historically , such teams have focused on creating complete , packaged games that can be easily ported to a wide variety of platforms .
Multi-platform / Multi-distributor
Once a game is built , it is distributed across hundreds of portals and multiple platforms .
Due to their relatively simple interfaces and system requirements , casual games port well to a wide variety of platforms ranging from phones to consoles .
Due to their electronic nature , they can be republished to a vast number of portals at little cost .
The revenue potential of a single game is multiplied by the number of distribution channels that can be addressed .
Threats
Every developer faces some common strategic threats :
The rising quality of competing games .
The entry barriers for creating casual games are low and dropping every day .
Tools such as Flash or XNA ensure that the masses of developers interested in making games have all the resources they need .
A substantial number of casual titles , both original and clones , are reaching best - in - class .
The secret ingredients of a great internal development environment ( small teams , a passion for detail and freedom to experiment ) are being replicated in a small but growing portion of the hundreds of developer petri dishes around the globe .
As this process inevitably advances , even the most established casual game developers run the risk of losing their position at the top of the heap .

Brand erosion due to portal business tactics .
Portals desperately want to commoditize casual games .
It is in their best interest to treat them as disposable , one - size - fits - all content like a movie or an MP3 .
This allows them to take a mass market strategy where they build efficient machinery that feeds their customers a stream of gaming snacks .
Never satiated , the players keep coming back to the portal for more .
In order to make themselves the center of gaming goodness in the eyes of their players , portals are incentivized to minimize development team branding and maximize the placement of their own branding and services .

In order to make themselves the center of gaming goodness in the eyes of their players , portals are incentivized to minimize development team branding and maximize the placement of their own branding and services .
Portal integration cost .
As part of their customer retention tactics , portals are building in more community features such as achievements , gamer scores , persistent IDs and chat .
They are using disposable casual games to build a loyal community that they can continue to rely upon for years to come .
This places an expensive integration burden on the casual game developers .
It also increases the chance that customers will look to the portal for future purchases , not the developer of their favorite game .
All these issues reduce the developer 's bargaining power and their profit margin .
The slew of high - quality games means that portals can more easily walk away from any one company with extraordinary demands .
Brand erosion means that developers are forced to scramble each time a new title comes out to sign deals that help them acquire a good stream of trial downloads .
The good news is that casual games are still a growing market and the inevitable consolidation is only just beginning to appear .
Distribution channels are still quite fragmented .
The bad news is that every game that a casual game developer releases ends up building up the publishing behemoths that will eventually put the squeeze on profitability .
Many smaller developers are already feeling the pinch .
The portals have some very sound business dynamics on their side .
Where casual game developers are scrapping over each and every sale , the services strategy adopted by most portals takes a longer term approach and looks to capture the lifetime revenue of each customer .
Identifying what needs to be done
Let 's begin by stating the obvious .
The reason the developers are going to portals in the first place is that they need customers for their games .
The reason they keep going back to portals is that they can't keep the customers they initially acquired .
This is a root cause that developers can address with careful application of both game design and business strategy .
Build a service that keeps the customers you have .
In the current model , developers lose their customers the moment they finish with the developer 's latest game .
One proven solution is to build an ongoing service that keeps those customers around , so there is no need to acquire them again for the next title .
Think of what Battle . net did for Diablo , or what the ranking and comment services do for Kongregate .
This is the game that portals are playing .
Game developers can play it better by building their own services .

Treat portals as a customer acquisition tool .
If you are using portals as a pure revenue source , you are thinking overly short term .
Your game demo is ideally built to sell itself .
It is a self - contained sales machine that hooks users and encourages them to make a purchase .
The only real value of a portal , marketing fluff aside , is to increase the number of people that get to experience your demo .
When you start thinking of portals as a customer acquisition tool instead of your primary revenue generation channel , other opportunities emerge .
Running services need not be the exclusive domain of portals .
There are limits to the community building that can be accomplished by portals .
Most ultimately do n't own the games and are not game developers .
A far more potent online community can be built if the core game mechanics integrate tightly with the community features .
The next generation of highly sticky community sites will be built by game developers , not clearing houses which treat games like commodities .
Benefits of developer - run game services
Online communities are an attractive addition to a casual game company 's core competencies because they mitigate most of the dominant business strategy 's obvious weaknesses :
Predictable long term revenue stream .
Users tend to stick around and they tend to keep spending money within their community .
There is less worry about being only as good as your last game .
By keeping your community healthy , you can keep the revenue stream steady .

Pricing power .
The ability to control virtual currency and sell items and levels within the game gives the developers far more pricing flexibility than is present in the current " $ 19.95 " download market .
This means that you can price in ways that deliver more value to more customers .
Overall , this results in higher lifetime revenue from each customer .

Extend sales of existing titles .
Core casual games that serve a larger multiplayer metagame end up being played long past the time that the initial content has been worked through .

Increased insulation from external market forces .
Since the customers using the service have a deep , invested relationship with the developers , they are less likely to be influenced by the activities of other portals or the existence of other games .
Webkinz and Club Penguin are two recent examples that both demonstrate how a multiuser environment combined with competent casual games can build a highly profitable and lasting user base .
Such games rival World of Warcraft in the size of their user base , are run by relatively small support teams , and exhibit impressive profitability .
The sale of Club Penguin for $ 350 million demonstrates the financial viability of running a game developer as a service .
Implementing a services strategy
How would a casual game publisher to begin tapping into the services business model ?
There are two main steps :
Build a gaming service around existing brands and products
Co-opt existing distribution channels to promote the game developer 's service
Step 1 : Build a gaming service around existing brands and products
To make a service sticky , you need a persistent multiplayer meta - game .
Existing casual games provide the core activity of the community , but the meta - game gives users reasons to socialize , reasons to replay old games and reasons to play new games .
There are obvious parallels to MMOs , but such designs should not be copied verbatim .
It is also worth looking at more casual social spaces such as Habbo Hotel , Club Penguin or Facebook .
There are four main steps that are important in the process of building a sticky community :
Persistent material goods .
The first step is to move beyond ephemeral gameplay and give the player an immediate reason to stick around .
The cheapest method is persistent meta - game goods .
These can be through a decorated user page , achievements on display , placement on the scoreboards , or outfits that they flaunt .
In order for players to stick with a game , they need to have a sunk investment in time or energy that is readily recognizable as material goods in the game .
Persistent material goods provide a common focal point that ties together the time they spend across all the various divergent games .
Why are you playing that 5000th game of Match - 3 online ?
Because you want to earn those popular Ruby Earrings .
Persistent Identity .
Once users are hooked on their material investment , the service should allow the user to make an investment in their reputation .
Persistent avatars and screen names that can be viewed by others lets users become known in the community .
Communication systems .
You need tools for individual users to find and converse with likeminded people .
Lone wolves tend to leave community sites no matter how great the games .
However , if you can bind them to a social group , they 'll stick around for the conversation .
Private messages , chat rooms , forums and blogs are all valid options .
Social structures .
Now that small groups of users are talking , you want to bake the fledgling social network into the structure of service .
By adding official groups , teams or " gaming circles " to your service , you ensure that the most efficient manner for users to talk with one another is through your site .
This is n't an exhaustive list , but the core concepts are simple enough that even a moderately - staffed developer can put such a service together quickly with some off - the - shelf components .
Step 2 : Use existing distribution channels to promote the game developer 's service
Other people 's portals ( OPP ) are a great resource that should be leveraged for the good of the game developer 's service .
They are n't competitors .
They are resources to be tapped .
Once your service is in place , you can use your traditional packaged casual games , marketed through pure portals , as a customer acquisition tool .
Currently , you can visualize the casual games economy as consisting of game developers , platform owners and customers .
Imagine that the two main currencies we are trading in are cash and customer loyalty .
Game developers make packaged games .
Portals in various platforms market and sell the packaged games .
Customers give the portals money and their loyalty .
A moderate portion of the money is passed on to the developer .
Only the biggest brands get any portion of the customer 's loyalty .
We want to switch this up a bit .
The first few steps are the same .
Game developers make games and portals market them .
Users give portals money to purchase the games .
However , the games are constructed to hook up to a larger developer - run online service upon purchase .
This siphons much of the user loyalty away from the portals and back towards the developers .
The developer gets a small cut of the initial sales .
They receive the vast majority of the customer 's loyalty and future sales due to the user 's participation in the service .
Each game sold through a channel acts as a gateway into the developer - run service .
Channels become marketing and new customer acquisition partners , not merely sales partners .
Channels still win , because they make money off selling games -- just like they do now .
The developer wins by building up a stable population of lifetime customers .
This is n't a new strategy .
We 've been seeing mainstream developers selling core games such as World of Warcraft with solid success through retail channels .
Eve Online recently started using Steam to replicate the same distribution tactic online .
Each sale makes the channel owners happy , but ultimately puts the majority of the revenue in the hands of the service owner .
The same strategy can be successfully applied to casual games as well .
Philosophically , portals are best - suited to selling packaged games to new customers for a profit .
It is a good business , but their piece of the pie should end here .
They should not own the lifetime revenue of the customer .
This is the developer 's to keep , if they so choose .
Issues
It is a big switch to go from putting out packaged titles to building a service .
Casual game companies may not yet have the cultural DNA to build a robust online gaming world .
Integration of web and game development .
In some larger groups , web and game development often exist in two separate silos .
The development platforms are different , the skills are different , and the goals have historically been different .
Yet the development of the games and the development of the base web service are intimately intertwined activities .
In order for the service to succeed , web and game development needs to be integrated in cross-functional teams .
The game development teams need team members that intimately understand web metrics , web usability , flash development and customer support .
Support for virtual currencies , achievements , and ties into service wide meta - games are typical features , and you need teams that can handle the cross - discipline requirements .

Packaged goods mindset .
Currently , most casual game developers ship complete , packaged games .
Teams are steeped in the premise that they create a complete set of levels and gameplay that is sold to the customer for a one - time fee .
When you get into services , this assumption is challenged by the need for incremental updates , virtual goods , seasonal events , and hot fixes .

Inexperience dealing with community support .
There is a rule of thumb that the real development on an MMO does n't begin until it has gone live .
The social anarchy that results from thousands of players interacting with your code requires a completely different form of support than a packaged game .
An experienced live support team would need to be grown to handle these situations .

Not enough people on the team .
Many casual titles are put out by one - or two - person shops .
They outsource the artwork , the sound and often even much of the marketing and business .
Some smaller groups barely have enough human capital to pop out a game or two a year , never mind manage a service .
As a result , most successful casual services will be built by medium - sized groups who can devote a developer ( or five ) to building and maintaining the service .

Lack of business experience running a profitable service .
Running a successful service means mastering the business side of micropayments , price setting , seasonal promotions , and virtual currency issues .
Making that switch from monetizing each game to monetizing the service can be painful .
A common mistake is to treat the service as a free add - on in the hope of selling more packaged goods .
The result is a developer who finds that their service investments just do n't pay off .
The next stage in the evolution of casual games
The future powerhouses of the casual games industry are companies that have the best attributes of both existing developers and portals , tied together by a rich meta - game experience .
A community of passionate gamers , heavily invested in the service , helps the company weather the inevitable surge of talented upstart game developers and predatory middlemen .
Other companies are sprouting up that embrace the hybrid portal / casual game developer / MMO from the very start .
Start from scratch : BuildCafé.com and Flowplay.com both have the stated mission of building a social community around casual games , complete with avatars , virtual currency and virtual item sales .

Partner : Service operators such as Outspark are building up considerable expertise managing MMOs brought over from Asia .
These are the new middlemen of the industry , though they have a much tighter relationship with the developer than current portals .

Add a service to your existing titles .
Middleware companies like MetaPlace or Aria are making the cost of starting your own service smaller than ever .
I suspect we 'll see a half dozen more announcements over the coming year .
If your company is not interested in created a major online community built around casual games , others will happily reap the benefits of doing so .
Still plenty of room
Yet , this is not a winner - take - all market .
A mere 100,000 active users can result in a vibrant , profitable community that lasts for a decade or longer .
Some survive on far less .
People will come for the games , and stay for the community .
The business dynamics are far more palatable than the vast numbers needed to make a pure advertising or packaged games business work .
There is room for hundreds , perhaps thousands of such services , occupying a spectrum of interesting niches .
Most will fly under the radar , completely unnoticed by mainstream media and generally unaffected by the ups and downs of the marketplace .
The market , for at least a decade or so , will become a fragmented place spotted with islands of humanity .
Some islands will be bigger and more noticeable than others , but they will not remove the opportunity for the willing entrepreneur to carve out a spot of their own .
Conclusion
There is no reason for casual game developers to play second fiddle to their distribution channels in the same way that many mainstream game developers bow to their retail - oriented publisher masters .
There are some larger themes at work here .
Direct relationships with customers .
Business models are emerging that let game developers have profitable , direct , long term relationship with their customers .
Business models are emerging that let game developers have profitable , direct , long term relationship with their customers .
Disintermediation .
The traditional middlemen are no longer critical to the developer 's survival .

Maintaining brands and customer relationships can be handled directly by the developers .
Managing an expensive portfolio of disposable content is mitigated by the use of community specific game systems .
Delivery of long term value .
The value driving these models is primarily based on socially rich communities , meaningful brands and highly reusable content .
Disposable content , in the form of game mechanics that you play for a short period of time and then toss aside , make less sense from a financial perspective .
It will take a long time before all game developers wean themselves off the current crop of middlemen .
Just as traditional publishers have not disappeared in the face of online portals , neither will portals disappear in the face of developer - run services .
Instead we are left with a mixed ecosystem populated by developer - run services living alongside powerful , well - established middlemen from the previous era .
It is highly likely that existing middlemen will be slow to adapt to the increased negotiation power of a small , but growing portion of the developers .
Many will be outright hostile to what they perceive as a threat to their core business .
That 's okay .
There is absolutely nothing they can do to stop developers creating exciting services .
The smarter portals will figure out how to provide additional value to these bright new customers in the form of efficient marketing and distribution offerings , international operating deals , and other activities that add value .
In the long term , this sea change is a good thing .
Business models that liberate developers from the yoke of publisher and portal funding releases powerful market forces that drive product innovation .
Bigger profit margins for self sufficient developers mean that they are more likely to single - handedly take on the " crazy " risks that result in new genres and increased markets .
All in all , the introduction of service - based casual games companies once again makes the casual games market an incredibly exciting and dynamic place to build games .
The opportunities for brilliant new businesses are boundless .

It makes good strategic sense to make a major investment in services offerings that go beyond dabbling with user accounts and simple achievement systems .
Purchase or hire a small MMO team as the core of a cross functional team of web , game devs and MMO experts .
A partnership is possible ; though the greatest benefits will come from bring the knowledge in - house .

Use existing flagship games as the core mechanics .
Be sure to include persistent material goods , persistent player identities , robust communication systems , and game supported social structures .

This means hiring more community support personnel and game masters .
Create portal versions of popular games that lead players back to your online game .
Turn portals into a marketing channel for your community .
Start tracking customer lifetime value and building game systems to increase this metric , either by increasing retention or creating offerings that let passionate players spend more .
Appendix B : Why lifetime customer value matters
I 've briefly mentioned above that lifetime customer value is a useful metric for a business .
Here 's a little exercise .
Note that the numbers are hideously simplified for the sake of illustration .
Strategy A : Cash now , please
You release one game .
You give up 50 % of its sales to the portal and sell 1000 copies at $ 20 a pop .
You make $ 10,000 .
You pay $ 10,000 to the portal .
You get no customer information .
10 games , each selling 1000 copies , will net you $ 100,000 in revenue .
Strategy B : Customer information , please
You release one game .
You give up 70 % of its sales to the portal and sell 1000 copies at $ 20 a pop .
You make $ 6,000 and the portal gets $ 14,000 .
However , now you also direct the customers back to your online service .
You know their names , their email addresses , how long they 've played your game and which activities in the games they seem to have enjoyed .
The next time you release a game , you contact the customer directly through your service .
Of those , 10 % purchase directly , giving you 100 sales and making you $ 2000 up front .
That 10 % might seem high , but you are n't selling to strangers .
These are people that know and like your products .
You 've made them happy before ; they play your games every day .
It is the difference between asking for money from a random stranger on the street and asking for money from your good friend .
You also use the portal again , and gain another 1000 customers and another $ 6000 .
Now you 've made a total of $ 8000 on your second game where you only made $ 6000 on your first title .
Following this logic , by the 10th game , you 'll have revenues of $ 150,000 , with $ 60,000 coming from the portal sales and $ 90,000 coming from direct sales .
By focusing on a close relationship with your customers instead of the easy money , you 've made 50 % more .
Lifetime customer value
Early on , you paid the portal $ 14,000 to acquire 1000 customers .
However , for each subsequent game that you released , those customers paid you $ 2000 .
Over the course of 10 games , they paid you $ 20,000 .
That 's a profit of $ 6000 over your initial acquisition costs .
Focusing on lifetime customer value helps you make difficult decisions early on in order to reap superior profitability later .

THE RACE FOR DELEGATES THE RACE FOR DELEGATES USA TODAY 's interactive delegate tracker shows where the presidential candidates stand as they seek their party 's nomination .
PORTLAND , Ore. ( AP )  Oregon Rep. David
Wu , one of Oregon 's 12 Democratic superdelegates , announced Thursday that he'd back Illinois Sen.
Barack Obama , citing Obama 's stand against the Iraq war " from the very beginning . "
Wu joins Oregon Rep. Earl Blumenauer in backing Obama .
Gov. Ted Kulongoski and Rep. Darlene Hooley are supporting New York Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton .
The rest of Oregon 's superdelegates have not yet announced their choice .
" We need new policies both at home and abroad , " Wu said in a statement .
" Like Americans , the international community wants to see real change in America and I believe that Senator Obama embodies that change . "
The endorsement is an important win for Obama in one of the few states still to vote .
Oregon 's primary ballots are counted on May 20 .
POLITICS BLOG : Resources for Oregon voters
Polls suggest the state is tilting toward Obama , but political analysts have suggested that Clinton could be competitive , particularly if she can make inroads in the populous Portland suburbs .
But
Wu represents much of that territory and is a popular incumbent there , and so could be a powerful force in the region for Obama .
The endorsement is Obama 's third from a superdelegate since he lost the Pennsylvania primary to Clinton on Tuesday .
Clinton picked up one superdelegate on Wednesday .
" This endorsement is a sign of the growing support for Senator Obama here in Oregon , " said Nick Shapiro , the communications director for the Obama campaign in Oregon .
Superdelegates are the party and elected officials who automatically attend the party convention in Denver in August and can support whomever they choose , regardless of primary and caucus results .

Bob Knight , the winningest coach in men ’s college basketball history , abruptly quit the other night , handing the reins of the Texas Tech program to his son and heir , Pat .
Knight has long been one of the most polarizing figures in all of American sport , and if your Internets get ESPN.com or you have access to a sports talk radio station in your town you probably already know that his sudden retirement has only served to revive the big argument .
To wit : what is Bob Knight ’s legacy ?
A ) Bob Knight is one of the greatest coaches in college hoops history .
He won over 900 games , something nobody else has ever done .
He won three national titles .
Let ’s see , what else ?
Knight is also the only coach to win the NCAA , the NIT , the Olympic Gold , and the Pan American Games Gold .
The Red Raiders ’ participation in the 2007 NCAA Men ’s Division I Basketball Tournament marked another record .
With their inclusion as the # 10 seed in the East Regional , Knight became the coach to lead his team to more NCAA Tournaments than any other …
In 1987 , Knight was the first person to be honored with the Naismith Men ’s College Coach of the Year Award .
Five years later , he received the Clair Bee Coach of the Year Award .
And , in 2007 , he was the recipient of the Naismith Award for Men ’s Outstanding Contribution to Basketball .
Knight also made a priority of doing things the right way .
He insisted on respect from his players , he emphasized the importance of academics and had a demonstrated track record for producing not only solid players , but solid citizens .
B ) Bob Knight was a hypocrite and an abusive thug with serious anger management issues .
His public demeanor was an embarrassment to his schools and , when called on to run the US national team , his nation .
His bullying and anti-social behavior forced Indiana University to fire him and he apparently came close to the same fate at Texas Tech .
The litany of his misdeeds is mind - boggling :
In 1979 , Knight was arrested for assaulting a police officer during the Pan American Games in Puerto Rico .
Knight was angry that a practice gymnasium was not opened to his team , which went on to a 9 - 0 record in the tournament .
Knight was later convicted in absentia in a Puerto Rican court .
However , the charges were later dropped when Indiana Governor Otis R. Bowen refused to cooperate in extraditing Knight to the island commonwealth .
In 1985 , Knight threw a chair across the court to protest a referee ’s call during a game against the rival Purdue Boilermakers .
Knight was suspended for one game and received two years ’ probation from the Big Ten Conference .
Women ’s groups nationwide were outraged by Knight ’s comments during an April , 1988 interview with Connie Chung in which he said , “ I think that if rape is inevitable , relax and enjoy it . ”
Knight ’s comment was in reference to an Indiana basketball game in which he felt the referees were making poor calls against the Hoosiers .
Knight allegedly kicked his own son , Patrick Knight , during a 1993 game ( Knight claims he actually kicked a chair ) .
Knight was shown berating an NCAA volunteer at a 1995 post - game press conference following a 65 - 60 loss to Missouri in the first round of the NCAA tournament held in Boise , Idaho .
The volunteer , Rance Pugmire , informed the press that Knight would not be attending the press conference , when in reality , Knight was running a few minutes late and had planned on attending per NCAA rules .
Knight was shown saying : “ You ’ve only got two people that are going to tell you I ’m not going to be here .
One is our SID ( sports information director ) , and the other is me .
Who the hell told you I was n’t going to be here ?
I ’d like to know .
Do you have any idea who it was ?
… Who ?
… They were from Indiana , right ?
… No , they were n’t from Indiana , and you did n’t get it from anybody from Indiana , did you ?
… No , Iâ € ” I ’ll handle this the way I want to handle it now that I ’m here .
You ( EXPLETIVE ) it up to begin with .
Now just sit there or leave .
I do n’t give ( EXPLETIVE ) what you do .
Now back to the game . ”
In February 2004 , Knight made national headlines when he had an argument with then Texas Tech University Chancellor David Smith at a Lubbock supermarket .
In March 2006 , a student ’s heckling at Baylor University resulted in Knight having to be restrained by a police officer .
The incident was not severe enough to warrant any action from the Big 12 Conference .
On November 13 , 2006 , Knight was shown allegedly hitting player Michael Prince under the chin to get him to make eye contact .
Although Knight did n’t comment on the incident afterwards and as of yet has n’t done so , Prince , his parents , and Texas Tech Athletic Director Gerald Myers insisted that Knight did nothing wrong and that he merely lifted Prince ’s chin and told him “ Hold your head up and do n’t worry about mistakes .
Just play the game . ”
Prince commented , “ He was trying to teach me and I had my head down so he raised my chin up .
He was telling me to go out there and do n’t be afraid to make mistakes .
He said I was being too hard on myself . ”
On October 21 , 2007 , James Simpson of Lubbock , Texas , accused Knight of firing a shotgun in his direction after he yelled at Knight and another man for hunting too close to his home .
Knight denied the allegations .
An argument between the two men was recorded via camera phone and aired later on television .
Then , of course , there was the whole Neil Reed fiasco .
So which was it ?
I mean , both sides of the argument are pretty well documented .
We Americans have this strange , almost pathological need to outfit people with either a white hat or a black one .
Good vs. Evil .
Saint or sinner .
And so .
We ’re generally pretty bad about dividing everything into either / or’s , and the case of Bob Knight is no different .
The answer to the question is neither A nor B , but C : all of the above .
Like most people , Knight was complex , an often infuriating blend of the noble and the repellent .
He insisted that his players show respect , but he accorded no one the respect he demanded of others .
His philosophy stressed sportsmanship , but his career was dominated by crass bullying and intimidation of everybody around him – including departmental secretaries .
He sought to produce mature young men , but was himself a paragon of immaturity and petulance .
He insisted on accountability , but nothing was ever his fault .
Not either / or , but both / and .
We all hate it when mercurial ability comes wrapped in such a fetid package , but such is life and such is the lot of anybody who has to spend a lot of time around human beings .
For my part , I can recognize the innate humanity of the flawed genius but I can’t forgive it , especially when Knight has steadfastly refused to acknowledge that he ’s ever done anything wrong .
So in parting , let me just say this : Coach Knight , you were brilliant , and good riddance to you .
May we all learn from your bad examples as much as we did from the good …
Some Inspiration For The Average Victim Of Walmart Receipt Checking .
This Man Has The Right Idea !
I found this article at http://www.bwcitypaper.com/bw.digg.page.final.html and found it truly inspirational .
This is a must read to prepare yourself for the actions needed to be taken to stand up to Walmart , Costco , Sams Club , etc .
Customer Confidential
A new Black &
White consumer column helps you fight bad service , bad products , and bad ideas .
By David Pelfrey
November 16 , 2006
Here ’s a scenario that is familiar to anyone who has ever set foot in Wal - Mart , CVS , Rite - Aid , or any of a dozen other major retailers .
After you have made a purchase , collected your bags , or packed everything into a shopping cart , you head for the exit .
Just as you approach freedom an alarm sounds ( usually a sequence of ugly , electronic grunts ) and a robotic voice ( always female ) announces : “ Please return to the checkout . ”
Other customers immediately look in your direction , and an employee begins to approach you .
What ’s your next move ?
If you possess an ounce of personal pride or perhaps two ounces of fortitude , then the 100 percent correct move is to proceed immediately out the door .
Why ?
There are many reasons , chief among them being that rational adults should not instantly obey mechanical voices ( unless that voice instructs us to exit a burning aircraft ) .
Also , if you have n’t stolen anything and therefore do not require interrogation , there is absolutely nothing that should compel you to linger post - transaction .
It ’s depressing enough simply being there in the first place .
Another good reason to make a quick exit is that you are n’t being paid to assist some giant retailer with its security measures .
You are n’t part of the team , and you did n’t clock in .
The clearest reason for leaving the store , however , is that there exists absolutely no legal obligation to remain there , and the store has no right to detain you .
Because all of the above constitute my position on the matter , I have established a mildly adversarial relationship with many retail establishments with whom I continue to do business .
I do n’t mind too much , because so far I have won all the battles in this long and silly war .
What does trouble me is that retailers who , as a matter of policy , routinely treat customers like criminals have not changed their attitude about the issue .
In fact , some vehemently defend their policies .
I began closely paying attention to this phenomenon several years ago .
My story begins at Wal - Mart during the Christmas shopping season of 2000 .
It ’s an unpleasant fact of life that sometimes we must shop at Wal - Mart , but the selection and savings in the pharmacy and auto department are worth braving the depressing atmosphere if you can get in and out fast enough .
A speedy departure is exactly what I was thinking about that December evening as I sped my cart , after paying for all nine items , toward one of the exits .
I was stopped by a 60 - something gentleman who said he needed to see my receipt and check what was in my cart .
I smiled and said , “ I ’m in a hurry to get out of this madness .
Ca n’t help you . ”
The truth is that I had no idea where that receipt was , and I was n’t keen to search for it .
The gentleman moved in front of the cart and firmly gripped the sides , saying “ Sir , I must see your receipt before you leave . ”
“ Oh , I see what you mean , ” I replied .
“ I guess we better get one of your security people over here . ”
That puzzled him for a second .
“ Will you wait here while I get somebody ?
he asked .
“ No . ” I said .
“ I ’m out the door as soon as you get out of the way . ”
This was a spontaneous answer on my part , but in all honesty I was delighted to have stumbled onto a perfect dilemma for this zealous worker .
If he stood his ground , he could n’t see my receipt .
But if he went for assistance , he might lose an opportunity to nail the Tylenol / Windex / Aussie Moist Conditioner thief .
He then began to work his way up the side of the cart toward me , his strategy apparently being to keep one hand on the side of the cart and one foot on the floor at all times .
Finally , he took hold of my forearm , which surprised me , but not in a good way .
“ Never mind security , ” I said .
“ Now you better go find a real police officer . ”
My captor gave that notion a moment ’s thought and then began sprinting toward the rear of the building , making a dash for help in an incident that , for him , must have been escalating toward Def - Con 1 .
He was n’t scared ; he was determined .
I stood there for some time , partly because the whole ridiculous scenario had stunned me , but also because I was even more impressed by how fast the old guy could move .
Two other employees and a few customers who were observing the scene were impressed in a different way , I concluded , because they were all laughing at the poor fellow .
I proceeded to my car , and that was the end of that .
I kept the incident in mind for future reference .
In the spring , a man ’s fancy lightly turns to lawn care , and I am therefore a frequent shopper in the gardening department at Wal - Mart , an area that in character and ambience stands in pleasant contrast to the rest of the store .
I also have a habit of using the garden entrance and exit .
But of course , that ’s where the “ greeter ” invariably interrupts my reverie .
“ May I please see your receipt ? ” is the common request .
The correct answer , which I also happened upon by accident , is “ No , you may not . ”
What usually occurs next is that the greeter contacts security , because she or he never comprehends that they merely asked for permission that was subsequently not granted .
There is nothing in that friendly exchange that hints of criminal activity , so what ’s the point of hanging around ?
If it sounds at this point as though I ’m being an ornery crank about the whole matter , simply consider all those retail establishments at which customers spend vastly greater sums but are not interrogated before their departure .
I ’ve never been harassed at Pottery Barn or Restoration Hardware , for example .
I resent certain measures taken by retailers who do n’t check bags or receipts , but who do , by implication , still manage to punish all shoppers for the deeds of a few criminals .
A favorite means of combating that takes place at Banana Republic and Macy’s .
Just for fun , I ’ll browse through the leather jackets or expensive sport coats that are fastened together by a cable that holds an alarm sensor .
When a clerk approaches and offers to unstrap the merchandise , I simply inform him that I do n’t try on clothes in orange - alert , high - security areas .
Yes , I ’m being a jerk in a very technical sense , but I ’m sending a message to management , I hope .
Throughout my struggle , I have assumed that enough of these encounters will eventually work their way up through corporate levels to a decision maker who might implement change .
That may be a flawed assumption .
The idea that small battles won might not lead to final victory first entered my mind at Costco .
Costco is one of my favorite stores in the world , from a purely fiscal perspective .
You do indeed save money there .
Moreover , the employees at this well - organized , disturbingly efficient warehouse are consistently cheerful and helpful .
The butcher shop is cleaner than those I see at the major grocers in town .
You can get a case of Coke in glass bottles for just over $ 10 .
No way is anyone going to foul up that shopping experience .
But Costco is apparently willing to make the effort .
When you check out at Costco , an employee takes your cart , places items on a conveyor , and then another employee rings up the items .
There are no bags here ( one of the many cost - saving measures ) but you may gather empty boxes from a designated area and organize things yourself , once you have paid .
It ’s a warehouse , after all .
In any event , at this point a customer is at least 20 feet from any merchandise , with no access to the store unless they return through the checkout line .
There ’s nothing between you and the exit , except another employee who must check your receipt and mark it with a highlighting marker .
Never mind that all of the items in your cart , which have obviously been paid for , were also placed there by a Costco employee .
One problem with this receipt - checking system is that on busy days it forces customers to form long lines at the exit .
On some of my visits , I decided to roll past this line with my items , now that I owned them , and head straight to my car .
The first time I tried this , a woman shouted at me to return to the store .
I believe she was still yelling “ Sir! Sir ! ” as I departed Patton Creek and approached the interstate ramp .
I would n’t know ; I was listening to a CD I had just purchased at Costco .
It was my CD , you understand .
Why not enjoy it ?
On another visit , I decided to get the lay of the land before attempting any more non-compliant exits .
Perhaps there was a rule or policy about the Costco system that made sense .
There on the wall at the exit , I discovered , is a huge sign that reads :
Why is my register receipt reviewed when I leave the warehouse ?
To assure that you paid for and are not overcharged or undercharged for any item .
Also , marking the receipt disallows its reuse .
The completely misleading nature of that message became obvious during my next encounter with Costco security enforcement .
As I suspected , there were about a dozen customers in line for “ receipt review ” at the exit .
That represented about six extra minutes that I was n’t being paid for , and so I rolled toward freedom .
The employee “ reviewing ” receipts left the line and cheerfully said , “ I ’m going to have to see your receipt first . ”
Adopting her happy demeanor , I replied , “ And you are going to have to chase me in order to do so . ”
Sometimes it ’s worth being an ass just to see the response on people ’s faces .
Not only was the receipt lady registering total bewilderment , but several customers in line for the same hassle appeared equally baffled .
One woman glanced at me with what looked like total contempt .
Her response was invigorating , although I ’m not sure why .
I continued toward my vehicle , where I was greeted by a man who looked and sounded like “ security . ”
“ Was there a problem at the checkout , sir ? ” he asked .
“ No , actually , checkout was great , ” I said .
“ Very efficient .
But leaving the store was a little shaky .
In fact , there ’s definitely a problem there . ”
“ What ’s wrong ? ”
“ Well , for openers , I do n’t like being treated like a shoplifter . ”
“ Sir , ” he solemnly stated , “ No one is treating you like a shoplifter . ”
“ Really ?
Then why , exactly , am I having a conversation with store security , who just happened to reach my vehicle at the same time I did ? ”
Minutes seemed to pass .
I thought I noticed a funnel cloud moving toward Vestavia .
A faint aroma of cotton candy was in the air .
The forty - ish woman loading her purchase into a car two spaces down was wearing tight - fitting , corduroy jeans .
She looked amazing .
Finally the security guy responded .
“ Sir , our people checking receipts are doing their jobs .
It ’s a store policy that we inspect receipts .
We ’re trying to make sure you paid the right price . ”
We get served a lob like that only so many times , and I was n’t letting this one go .
My research was finally paying off .
I chose to be polite , because the security guy was actually quite calm and friendly about the whole incident .
“ This is a warehouse , ” I replied .
“ There are no prices on those items in my cart , so how would they know if I were overcharged ?
Never mind , here ’s another thing you should know .
In my last five visits here , I allowed your staff to see my receipts , and they instantly marked them without so much as glancing at the totals .
They were simply making certain that I had paid for something , and that I could not come back and use that receipt at a later date .
In other words , to stop my attempts , present and future , at theft — you know , as though I were a potential shoplifter .
Your sign with the message about ensuring that I was n’t overcharged is what shoppers like me sometimes call bullshit .
That ’s Home Depot behind us .
I spent a few hundred dollars there last year .
Just to our right is Sears .
I spent almost that much there last Christmas .
No one reviewed my receipts at either store .
Please tell me what I ’m doing wrong . ”
The security guy walked away , perhaps wondering if Costco had not fully explained to him all the details of “ receipt review . ”
It ’s also possible that he knew , without a doubt , that I was just one more jackass who “ did n’t get it . ”
These are store policies , damn it .
I contacted management at Wal - Mart , Costco , and other retailers to get some comments for this article about their respective policies .
Long story short , no one is budging , and some retailers are downright proud of those policies .
Wal - Mart has the most detached view of the issue , it seems .
Their explanation of the process has to do with “ security detection determining that sensors have not been deactivated ; retraining transaction staff , etc. , ” but nothing to do with human volition .
For Wal - Mart , theft and theft prevention are natural phenomena , much like the weather .
No one is being treated like a criminal , you see , it ’s strictly a case of “ devices detecting active sensors . ”
There ’s really nothing Wal - Mart can do .
Except have a greeter rummage through bags of items that legally belong to you .
While you wait .
There are some things that shoppers can do , however .
First , the deer - in - the - headlights response to security alarms must end .
Smile and walk with confidence through the exit .
Bear in mind that being suspected of theft is actually a reason to leave the store , not a reason to stay , in much the same way that no one remains at a party after they have been insulted by the host .
If a particular retailer wants to play games by insisting that they are merely ensuring that you were not overcharged , then by all means let ’s check all 74 items in the cart , poring over the receipt line by line while other customers wait .
Another fun approach , if you are detained , is to inform the store that they may indeed inspect your bags or your receipt , if and only if all items are immediately returned for a full refund .
That gets their attention .
Or just tell them to call a cop .
If you ’re the theatrical type , adopt a German accent and repeat loudly that your papers are in order ( with the same accent you can do the old Berlin Wall bit and say that you have friends at the central committee ) .
The odds of a customer in the store getting the joke are very slim , but anyone who does get the reference will remember you forever .
It will feel good to be someone ’s hero .
Last fall , while I was waiting for a prescription to be filled , I stood near the exit of my local pharmacy reading a product description on a bottle of shampoo .
Two elderly customers set off the sensor alarm as they walked out , but I told them to go ahead , because “ that crazy thing had been going off all day , and we had not figured out how to stop it yet . ”
I also thanked them for shopping with us .
When an employee arrived a few seconds later , I waved the bottle and apologized for getting too close to the sensors .
All was well .
I ’m seldom that fast on my feet , but I was having a good week , apart from the sinus infection .
With that in mind , as Thanksgiving approaches and the shopping season gains momentum , I hope that my story will be the catalyst for a quantum shift in consumer habits .
17 . Quentin Tarantino
The jury may still be undecided on the virtues of Kill Bill , but no one can deny the massive impact the former video - store clerk has had on cinema across the world .
The chewy , minutiae - obsessed dialogue and abundant bloodletting of Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction catapulted him to era-defining stature and influence beyond the wildest dreams of any director ; had this poll been taken in 1995 , he would have been top three , no question .
But Tarantino has since been the victim of his own success : he took three years to make his third film , Jackie Brown , and another six to make his fourth .
Perhaps inevitably , neither of them made the splash of his first two , but whatever else , Tarantino can still make the simple act of watching a film seem oh - so - exciting .

AGAINST SCHOOL
How public education cripples our kids , and why By John Taylor Gatto John Taylor Gatto is a former New York State and New York City Teacher of the Year and the author , most recently , of The Underground History of American Education .
He was a participant in the Harper 's Magazine forum " School on a Hill , " which appeared in the September 2003 issue .
I taught for thirty years in some of the worst schools in Manhattan , and in some of the best , and during that time I became an expert in boredom .
Boredom was everywhere in my world , and if you asked the kids , as I often did , why they felt so bored , they always gave the same answers :
They said the work was stupid , that it made no sense , that they already knew it .
They said they wanted to be doing something real , not just sitting around .
They said teachers did n't seem to know much about their subjects and clearly were n't interested in learning more .
And the kids were right : their teachers were every bit as bored as they were .
Boredom is the common condition of schoolteachers , and anyone who has spent time in a teachers ' lounge can vouch for the low energy , the whining , the dispirited attitudes , to be found there .
When asked why they feel bored , the teachers tend to blame the kids , as you might expect .
Who would n't get bored teaching students who are rude and interested only in grades ?
If even that .
Of course , teachers are themselves products of the same twelve - year compulsory school programs that so thoroughly bore their students , and as school personnel they are trapped inside structures even more rigid than those imposed upon the children .
Who , then , is to blame ?
We all are .
My grandfather taught me that .
One afternoon when I was seven I complained to him of boredom , and he batted me hard on the head .
He told me that I was never to use that term in his presence again , that if I was bored it was my fault and no one else 's .
The obligation to amuse and instruct myself was entirely my own , and people who did n't know that were childish people , to be avoided if possible .
Certainty not to be trusted .
That episode cured me of boredom forever , and here and there over the years I was able to pass on the lesson to some remarkable student .
For the most part , however , I found it futile to challenge the official notion that boredom and childishness were the natural state of affairs in the classroom .
Often I had to defy custom , and even bend the law , to help kids break out of this trap .
The empire struck back , of course ; childish adults regularly conflate opposition with disloyalty .
I once returned from a medical leave to discover t~at all evidence of my having been granted the leave had been purposely destroyed , that my job had been terminated , and that I no longer possessed even a teaching license .
After nine months of tormented effort I was able to retrieve the license when a school secretary testified to witnessing the plot unfold .
In the meantime my family suffered more than I care to remember .
By the time I finally retired in 1991 , 1 had more than enough reason to think of our schools - with their long - term , cell - block - style , forced confinement of both students and teachers - as virtual factories of childishness .
Yet I honestly could not see why they had to be that way .
My own experience had revealed to me what many other teachers must learn along the way , too , yet keep to themselves for fear of reprisal : if we wanted to we could easily and inexpensively jettison the old , stupid structures and help kids take an education rather than merely receive a schooling .
We could encourage the best qualities of youthfulness - curiosity , adventure , resilience , the capacity for surprising insightsimply by being more flexible about time , texts , and tests , by introducing kids to truly competent adults , and by giving each student what autonomy he or she needs in order to take a risk every now and then .
But we do n't do that .
And the more I asked why not , and persisted in thinking about the " problem " of schooling as an engineer might , the more I missed the point :
What if there is no " problem " with our schools ?
What if they are the way they are , so expensively flying in the face of common sense and long experience in how children learn things , not because they are doing something wrong but because they are doing something right ?
Is it possible that George W. Bush accidentally spoke the truth when he said we would " leave no child behind " ?
Could it be that our schools are designed to make sure not one of them ever really grows up ?
Do we really need school ?
I do n't mean education , just forced schooling : six classes a day , five days a week , nine months a year , for twelve years .
Is this deadly routine really necessary ?
And if so , for what ?
Do n't hide behind reading , writing , and arithmetic as a rationale , because 2 million happy homeschoolers have surely put that banal justification to rest .
Even if they had n't , a considerable number of well - known Americans never went through the twelve - year wringer our kids currently go through , and they turned out all right .
George Washington , Benjamin Franklin , Thomas Jefferson , Abraham Lincoln ?
Someone taught them , to be sure , but they were not products of a school system , and not one of them was ever " graduated " from a secondary school .
Throughout most of American history , kids generally did n't go to high school , yet the unschooled rose to be admirals , like Farragut ; inventors , like Edison ; captains of industry like Carnegie and Rockefeller ; writers , like Melville and Twain and Conrad ; and even scholars , like Margaret Mead .
In fact , until pretty recently people who reached the age of thirteen were n't looked upon as children at all .
Ariel Durant , who co-wrote an enormous , and very good , multivolume history of the world with her husband , Will , was happily married at fifteen , and who could reasonably claim that Ariel Durant was an uneducated person ?
Unschooled , perhaps , but not uneducated .
We have been taught ( that is , schooled ) in this country to think of " success " as synonymous with , or at least dependent upon , " schooling , " but historically that is n't true in either an intellectual or a financial sense .
And plenty of people throughout the world today find a way to educate themselves without resorting to a system of compulsory secondary schools that all too often resemble prisons .
Why , then , do Americans confuse education with just such a system ?
What exactly is the purpose of our public schools ?
Mass schooling of a compulsory nature really got its teeth into the United States between 1905 and 1915 , though it was conceived of much earlier and pushed for throughout most of the nineteenth century .
The reason given for this enormous upheaval of family life and cultural traditions was , roughly speaking , threefold : 1 ) To make good people .
2 ) To make good citizens .
3 ) To make each person his or her personal best .
These goals are still trotted out today on a regular basis , and most of us accept them in one form or another as a decent definition of public education 's mission , however short schools actually fall in achieving them .
But we are dead wrong .
Compounding our error is the fact that the national literature holds numerous and surprisingly consistent statements of compulsory schooling 's true purpose .
We have , for example , the great H. L. Mencken , who wrote in The American Mercury for April 1924 that the aim of public education is not to fill the young of the species with knowledge and awaken their intelligence .
...
Nothing could be further from the truth .
The aim ... is simply to reduce as many individuals as possible to the same safe level , to breed and train a standardized citizenry , to put down dissent and originality .
That is its aim in the United States ... and that is its aim everywhere else .
Because of Mencken 's reputation as a satirist , we might be tempted to dismiss this passage as a bit of hyperbolic sarcasm .
His article , however , goes on to trace the template for our own educational system back to the now vanished , though never to be forgotten , military state of Prussia .
And although he was certainly aware of the irony that we had recently been at war with Germany , the heir to Prussian thought and culture , Mencken was being perfectly serious here .
Our educational system really is Prussian in origin , and that really is cause for concern .
The odd fact of a Prussian provenance for our schools pops up again and again once you know to look for it .
William James alluded to it many times at the turn of the century .
Orestes Brownson , the hero of Christopher Lasch 's 1991 book , The True and Only Heaven , was publicly denouncing the Prussianization of American schools back in the 1840s .
Horace Mann 's " Seventh Annual Report " to the Massachusetts State Board of Education in 1843 is essentially a paean to the land of Frederick the Great and a call for its schooling to be brought here .
That Prussian culture loomed large in America is hardly surprising , given our early association with that utopian state .
A Prussian served as Washington 's aide during the Revolutionary War , and so many German - speaking people had settled here by 1795 that Congress considered publishing a German - language edition of the federal laws .
But what shocks is that we should so eagerly have adopted one of the very worst aspects of Prussian culture : an educational system deliberately designed to produce mediocre intellects , to hamstring the inner life , to deny students appreciable leadership skills , and to ensure docile and incomplete citizens 11 in order to render the populace " manageable . "
It was from James Bryant Conant - president of Harvard for twenty years , WWI poison - gas specialist , WWII executive on the atomic - bomb project , high commissioner of the American zone in Germany after WWII , and truly one of the most influential figures of the twentieth century - that I first got wind of the real purposes of American schooling .
Without Conant , we would probably not have the same style and degree of standardized testing that we enjoy today , nor would we be blessed with gargantuan high schools that warehouse 2,000 to 4,000 students at a time , like the famous Columbine High in Littleton , Colorado .
Shortly after I retired from teaching I picked up Conant 's 1959 book - length essay , The Child the Parent and the State , and was more than a little intrigued to see him mention in passing that the modem schools we attend were the result of a " revolution " engineered between 1905 and 1930 .
A revolution ?
He declines to elaborate , but he does direct the curious and the uninformed to Alexander Inglis 's 1918 book , Principles of Secondary Education , in which " one saw this revolution through the eyes of a revolutionary . "
Inglis , for whom a lecture in education at Harvard is named , makes it perfectly clear that compulsory schooling on this continent was intended to be just what it had been for Prussia in the 1820s : a fifth column into the burgeoning democratic movement that threatened to give the peasants and the proletarians a voice at the bargaining table .
Modern , industrialized , compulsory schooling was to make a sort of surgical incision into the prospective unity of these underclasses .
Divide children by subject , by age - grading , by constant rankings on tests , and by many other more subtle means , and it was unlikely that the ignorant mass of mankind , separated in childhood , would ever re-integrate into a dangerous whole .
Inglis breaks down the purpose - the actual purpose - of modem schooling into six basic functions , any one of which is enough to curl the hair of those innocent enough to believe the three traditional goals listed earlier :
1 ) The adjustive or adaptive function .
Schools are to establish fixed habits of reaction to authority .
This , of course , precludes critical judgment completely .
It also pretty much destroys the idea that useful or interesting material should be taught , because you can't test for reflexive obedience until you know whether you can make kids learn , and do , foolish and boring things .
2 ) The integrating function .
This might well be called " the conformity function , " because its intention is to make children as alike as possible .
People who conform are predictable , and this is of great use to those who wish to harness and manipulate a large labor force .
3 ) The diagnostic and directive function .
School is meant to determine each student 's proper social role .
This is done by logging evidence mathematically and anecdotally on cumulative records .
As in " your permanent record . "
Yes , you do have one .
4 ) The differentiating function .
Once their social role has been " diagnosed , " children are to be sorted by role and trained only so far as their destination in the social machine merits - and not one step further .
So much for making kids their personal best .
5 ) The selective function .
This refers not to human choice at all but to Darwin 's theory of natural selection as applied to what he called " the favored races . "
In short , the idea is to help things along by consciously attempting to improve the breeding stock .
Schools are meant to tag the unfit - with poor grades , remedial placement , and other punishments - clearly enough that their peers will accept them as inferior and effectively bar them from the reproductive sweepstakes .
That 's what all those little humiliations from first grade onward were intended to do : wash the dirt down the drain .
6 ) The propaedeutic function .
The societal system implied by these rules will require an elite group of caretakers .
To that end , a small fraction of the kids will quietly be taught how to manage this continuing project , how to watch over and control a population deliberately dumbed down and declawed in order that government might proceed unchallenged and corporations might never want for obedient labor .
That , unfortunately , is the purpose of mandatory public education in this country .
And lest you take Inglis for an isolated crank with a rather too cynical take on the educational enterprise , you should know that he was hardly alone in championing these ideas .
Conant himself , building on the ideas of Horace Mann and others , campaigned tirelessly for an American school system designed along the same lines .
Men like George Peabody , who funded the cause of mandatory schooling throughout the South , surely understood that the Prussian system was useful in creating not only a harmless electorate and a servile labor force but also a virtual herd of mindless consumers .
In time a great number of industrial titans came to recognize the enormous profits to be had by cultivating and tending just such a herd via public education , among them Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller .
There you have it .
Now you know .
We do n't need Karl Marx 's conception of a grand warfare between the classes to see that it is in the interest of complex management , economic or political , to dumb people down , to demoralize them , to divide them from one another , and to discard them if they do n't conform .
Class may frame the proposition , as when Woodrow Wilson , then president of Princeton University , said the following to the New York City School Teachers Association in 1909 : " We want one class of persons to have a liberal education , and we want another class of persons , a very much larger class , of necessity , in every society , to forgo the privileges of a liberal education and fit themselves to perform specific difficult manual tasks . "
But the motives behind the disgusting decisions that bring about these ends need not be class - based at all .
They can stem purely from fear , or from the by now familiar belief that " efficiency " is the paramount virtue , rather than love , lib , erty , laughter , or hope .
Above all , they can stem from simple greed .
There were vast fortunes to be made , after all , in an economy based on mass production and organized to favor the large corporation rather than the small business or the family farm .
But mass production required mass consumption , and at the turn of the twentieth century most Americans considered it both unnatural and unwise to buy things they did n't actually need .
Mandatory schooling was a godsend on that count .
School did n't have to train kids in any direct sense to think they should consume nonstop , because it did something even better : it encouraged them not to think at all .
And that left them sitting ducks for another great invention of the modem era - marketing .
Now , you need n't have studied marketing to know that there are two groups of people who can always be convinced to consume more than they need to : addicts and children .
School has done a pretty good job of turning our children into addicts , but it has done a spectacular job of turning our children into children .
Again , this is no accident .
Theorists from Plato to Rousseau to our own Dr. Inglis knew that if children could be cloistered with other children , stripped of responsibility and independence , encouraged to develop only the trivializing emotions of greed , envy , jealousy , and fear , they would grow older but never truly grow up .
In the 1934 edition of his once well - known book Public Education in the United States , Ellwood P. Cubberley detailed and praised the way the strategy of successive school enlargements had extended childhood by two to six years , and forced schooling was at that point still quite new .
This same Cubberley - who was dean of Stanford 's School of Education , a textbook editor at Houghton Mifflin , and Conant 's friend and correspondent at Harvard - had written the following in the 1922 edition of his book Public School Administration : " Our schools are ... factories in which the raw products ( children ) are to be shaped and fashioned ....
And it is the business of the school to build its pupils according to the specifications laid down . "
It 's perfectly obvious from our society today what those specifications were .
Maturity has by now been banished from nearly every aspect of our lives .
Easy divorce laws have removed the need to work at relationships ; easy credit has removed the need for fiscal self - control ; easy entertainment has removed the need to learn to entertain oneself ; easy answers have removed the need to ask questions .
We have become a nation of children , happy to surrender our judgments and our wills to political exhortations and commercial blandishments that would insult actual adults .
We buy televisions , and then we buy the things we see on the television .
We buy computers , and then we buy the things we see on the computer .
We buy $ 150 sneakers whether we need them or not , and when they fall apart too soon we buy another pair .
We drive SUVs and believe the lie that they constitute a kind of life insurance , even when we 're upside - down in them .
And , worst of all , we do n't bat an eye when Ari Fleischer tells us to " be careful what you say , " even if we remember having been told somewhere back in school that America is the land of the free .
We simply buy that one too .
Our schooling , as intended , has seen to it .
Now for the good news .
Once you understand the logic behind modern schooling , its tricks and traps are fairly easy to avoid .
School trains children to be employees and consumers ; teach your own to be leaders and adventurers .
School trains children to obey reflexively ; teach your own to think critically and independently .
Well - schooled kids have a low threshold for boredom ; help your own to develop an inner life so that they 'll never be bored .
Urge them to take on the serious material , the grown - up material , in history , literature , philosophy , music , art , economics , theology - all the stuff schoolteachers know well enough to avoid .
Challenge your kids with plenty of solitude so that they can learn to enjoy their own company , to conduct inner dialogues .
Well - schooled people are conditioned to dread being alone , and they seek constant companionship through the TV , the computer , the cell phone , and through shallow friendships quickly acquired and quickly abandoned .
Your children should have a more meaningful life , and they can .
First , though , we must wake up to what our schools really are : laboratories of experimentation on young minds , drill centers for the habits and attitudes that corporate society demands .
Mandatory education serves children only incidentally ; its real purpose is to turn them into servants .
Do n't let your own have their childhoods extended , not even for a day .
If David Farragut could take command of a captured British warship as a pre-teen , if Thomas Edison could publish a broadsheet at the age of twelve , if Ben Franklin could apprentice himself to a printer at the same age ( then put himself through a course of study that would choke a Yale senior today ) , there 's no telling what your own kids could do .
After a long life , and thirty years in the public school trenches , I 've concluded that genius is as common as dirt .
We suppress our genius only because we have n't yet figured out how to manage a population of educated men and women .
The solution , I think , is simple and glorious .
Let them manage themselves .

BEIJING ( Reuters ) - China on Tuesday denounced protesters who upstaged Olympic Games torch relays in London and Paris and asked the United States to ensure the next leg in San Francisco avoids similar mayhem .
International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) officials also criticized the protests and a spokeswoman said the torch relay was expected to continue as scheduled .
Officials in Paris were forced to hustle the Olympic torch onto a bus on Monday when protesters against Chinese policy on Tibet tried to seize it .
In London the day before , activists waving Tibetan flags and shouting “ Shame on China ” also turned the event into a torrid obstacle course .
China quickly condemned the disruptions as “ vile ” and , in a departure from past reticence , state - run television and newspapers showed the protests and upset spectators .
“ We express our strong condemnation of the deliberate disruption of the Olympic torch relay by ‘ Tibetan independence ’ separatist forces , ” Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Jiang
Yu said in a statement posted at www.fmprc.gov.cn.
At a later briefing , she said Chinese and U.S. officials had been working together to ensure the visit of the torch to San Francisco on Wednesday would go “ safely and smoothly ” .
“ We also warn groups and elements attempting to disrupt and sabotage the torch relay that their goal -- of using the Olympics for their unspeakable ends and to blacken and put pressure on China -- is absolutely unattainable . ”
IOC president Jacques Rogge told reporters in Beijing : “ I was very saddened by what happened because this was a beautiful symbol and this symbol was attacked . ”
“ We are going , of course , to discuss the torch relay ( at the IOC executive board meeting ) in the Chinese capital on Thursday and Friday , ” he said .
“ We will make an analysis of what has happened and we will decide what actions need to be taken . ”
The IOC was also concerned about security in San Francisco .
“ I hope they can protect the flame better than those who hosted it yesterday , ” said IOC member Alex Gilady .
In San Francisco , where the flame is to make its only U.S. stop , three protesters scaled the city ’s famed Golden Gate bridge on Monday to hang banners reading “ One World , One Dream : Free Tibet ” and “ Free Tibet 08 ” ahead of the torch ’s arrival .
The torch relay disruptions follow unrest in Tibet that China has said was the work of the Dalai Lama , the exiled Tibetan Buddhist leader .
He has repeatedly denied China ’s claims .
Beijing ’s subsequent security drive in Tibet and nearby areas has galvanized international groups denouncing the crackdown and calling for the mountain region ’s autonomy or independence .
CALL FOR PEACEFUL PROTESTS
Rogge acknowledged the right of people to protest but hoped the Olympic flame would be respected as a symbol of unity .

“ However , if you want to protest , it has to be peaceful .
We do n’t accept violence , ” he said in an interview with Chinese media .
“ We accept protest , we do n’t accept violence . ”
An IOC spokeswoman said there had been no discussion on curtailing the international leg of the relay and that “ the expectation as we speak today is that the relay will continue as planned ” .
Kevan Gosper , the IOC press chief , said international legs should not be considered for future Games .
“ The torch should go from Olympia , Greece to the host country and I would expect that the executive committee will review that , ” he said .
Slideshow ( 37 images )
Beijing , which had hoped the Olympic torch relay would be a symbol of cheerful unity in the run-up to the August 8 - 24 Games , is seeking to rally public opinion to back government policy and reject criticism of the Beijing Olympics .
Newspapers played on the public rancor .
“ France did n’t protect the sacred flame , ” said the Global Times , a popular tabloid .
“ The world has seen the irrational extremism of some in the West , and also seen the incompetence of the Paris police . ”
Feelings were also running high on the streets of the Chinese capital .
“ If the torch relay does not progress smoothly it would be a compromise from the Chinese government towards the protesters , ” said Mao Xianmin , who works for a Beijing insurance company .
“ We not only have to continue with the torch relay but also to tell the world loudly that we can do it . ”
U.S. Democratic presidential aspirant Hillary Clinton urged President George W. Bush on Monday to boycott the Beijing Olympics opening ceremony unless China improves human rights .
Jiang
Yu said U.S. politicians should have a “ clear and sober understanding ” of the recent events .
“ We hope that figures in the political world can have the vision as politicians and will be able to treat and handle China - U.S. relations from a strategic , long - term vantage point , ” she said .
Bush plans to attend the ceremony and so far has resisted pressure to change his plans .

WHY GUITAR PLAYERS SPEND HALF THEIR TIME TUNING AND THE OTHER HALF PLAYING OUT OF TUNE :
The following is a rough overview of the physics of guitar tuning
by Steve Mason
C# AND Db ARE NOT THE SAME NOTE :
In fact C# is slightly higher than Db , but they are played by the same key on the piano , and there is only one fret for them on each string on a guitar .
What gives ?
There is a mathematical relationship between every note in a scale .
I wo n’t bore you with all the math but the simplest relationships are : the octave is twice as many vibrations per second as the prime and the fifth is the prime plus one third of the difference between the prime and the octave .
If you start on C and do all the math to calculate the vibrations per second for all the notes in a C scale and then calculate the vibrations per second for a D scale you will see that an E in a C scale is a slightly different note than an E in a D scale .
This means that if your guitar is perfectly in tune to play a C chord and you want to play a perfect D chord you must raise your E and B strings a little .
People apply “ logic ” to this situation and conclude that the E and B pegs are loose and need to be tightened or replaced or even soldered .
J.S. Bach , with his “ well tempered ” system , had started down the road toward solving the problem .
A system called “ equal temperament ” evolved .
This is a system in which all the notes are slightly out of tune so that nothing is shockingly out of tune and you can play in any key with equal success .
Pianos are tuned in equal temperament , and guitar fingerboards are fretted in equal temperament .
Fiddlers ( the good ones anyway ) play in perfect pitches because they can micro adjust their finger positioning to play exactly the vibration per second required .
The fixed frets of a guitar preclude this option .
A piano is a big clunky thing more closely related to a Chevy than to a violin .
The tuning is expensive and takes a long time , so you tend to tune it and then play it as it sits .
The guitar is more complicated : even though the frets are placed in equal temperament , guitar tuning pegs are easily accessible , and the strings can be “ bent ” with your fingers as you play .
Hence , the guitar player with a good ear is at constant war adjusting the string tension to approximate “ just intonation ” against the intentional misplacement of the frets .
Very roughly , the first fret is 1/18 the distance from the nut to the saddle , the second fret is 1/18 the distance from the first fret to the saddle etc .
In other words there is an equal distance between the notes ( expressed logarithmically as the twelfth root of two ) .
There is such a thing as a “ just intonation fingerboard ” , the frets do n’t go straight across and are not evenly spaced .
They play perfectly in tune , but they are only good for one key and are way out of tune in other keys .
( please read on .
This page break looks like the end ; it ’s not )
STRINGS ARE HUMAN TOO : THEY ARE IMPERFECT AND THEY DIE
The picture is further complicated by the physical makeup of your strings .
As a string gets old it develops metal fatigue at some spots and not others , it gets a little dent everywhere it goes over a fret , the windings fill up with crud , the steel part of the string can rust and you can even wear it thin in spots .
This uneven stress makes the string vibrate unevenly , so that the center point of the string is no longer the octave harmonic .
You may have noticed that the first symptom that you need to change strings , just before they get “ thumpy ” , is that you just ca n’t get in tune .
And even fresh strings are imperfect .
A string must be stretched to 80 % of breaking tension so that the pull on it ’s molecular bonds will make it act more like a fluid than like a rod .
People using lots of different tunings will have noticed that a string tuned too low for it ’s gauge wo n’t “ sing ” .
A nice new string does great at producing primary vibrations but as the harmonics get higher and higher they are produced by smaller and smaller fractions of the string , and at some point the string section is so short that it acts more like a rod than like a fluid , and that pushes these high harmonics sharp .
PHYSICAL ATTRIBUTES OF YOUR GUITAR
The “ action ” of a guitar is the playability as governed by the straightness of the neck , the evenness of the fret tops , the roundness of the fret tops , the height of the nut and the height of the saddle , and the angle from the bridge to the pin holes and the nut to the peg barrels .
This is all adjustable by adding material or taking material away .
Guitars do not come adjusted from the factory .
All new guitars must be adjusted ( Martin makes no pretense of adjustment , they do n’t even fit their bridge and butt pins ) .
It takes this amalgamation of fine woods a while to get used to being a guitar , so you will probably have to readjust your action at six months and then yearly for the first five years .
Every time the weather changes your guitar wood changes shape .
If it bows backward it can come forward again , but if it bows forward it has 180 pounds of string tension holding it there .
The normal motion is for the neck to bow up over time .
It is then either a simple or difficult process to straighten it , depending on the brand of your guitar .
After five years or so your guitar should stabilize to the point where you may go for two or three years between adjustments .
As you play , the high carbon steel strings wear down the nickel silver frets .
This makes low spots on your favorite frets and turns the frets you rarely use into high frets .
When you push a string down to a low fret it will buzz against the high fret in front of it .
You can always miss that high fret by jacking your action up higher and higher .
Every music store in the world knows how to shim your saddle to stop a buzz .
This solves the problem , but makes your strings hard to push down .
The proper solution is to let an experienced luthier “ dress ” your frets : file the fret tops so that all the fret tops are at the level of your lowest wear .
This puts little flat spots on the tops of the frets that were too high .
They are then rounded and polished .
A good guitar in normal use can probably be adjusted 7 to 10 times before the frets are too low ( worn about half way through ) and must be replaced .
However some very hard players wear through their frets in a few years .
So …. , here ’s how this relates to the topic at hand : if your strings are too high you must “ bend ” them down to the frets .
The extra stretch that it takes to get the string down to the fret tightens it in the same way as turning the tuning peg does .
The string length from nut to saddle is designed ( with more or less accuracy , depending on the guitar maker ) to play in tune ( equal temperament ) at a certain string height .
If you exceed that height the pitch will be sharp by the time the string contacts the fret .
Fret misplacement ( actual misplacement , not to be confused with intentional misplacement ) is very rare on modern guitars but saddle misplacement is common .
In fact , saddle placement on vintage guitars seems quite random .
If new strings do not yield a good match between your octave harmonic and your 12th fret go see your luthier .
If you are using vastly different strings than the guitar manufacturer intended , their bridge placement , though perfectly within their specs , will have to be changed for you .
Many people notice the tuning dilemma for the first time after they have shelled out the big bucks for a high quality guitar .
A fine guitar has the ability to project , clearly and resonantly , the nuances of the string vibrations .
Hence , you are more likely to hear the difference between C# and Db on your new Taylor / Collings / Santa Cruz / Martin / Larrivee / Thompson / etc. than you were on your old junker .
Also , on a fine guitar you do n’t notice that your strings are dead as quickly and you tend to not change them as often .
PSYCHO ACOUSTICS
This is the study of how the human hearing system works .
One major discovery of this field is that our hearing is often effected by things that we can’t hear and we hear things that are n’t really there .
Another good reason to take up the violin is to hear a great demonstration of psycho acoustics : Play “ Boil em Cabbage Down ” .
As you play C# and E you will clearly hear an “ undertone ” of A , 2 octaves below .
As you play the tune it sounds as if someone is playing bass with you .
If you give the human ear the 1 and 3 it will interpolate the 5 of the chord when it is not being played .
And , perfect intonation does not necessarily please us .
According to psycho acoustic research , we tend to like the high notes a little sharp and if any note is out of tune our first inclination is to “ tune up ” .
When players do the move from a D chord to a C chord , instead of lowering the E and B they tend to raise the bottom four strings .
When they go back to D they raise the E and B and then when they switch to C they raise the bottom four again .
Some of you old timers may remember jam sessions before the days of electronic tuners when the fixed pitch instruments would have to drop out by 9:00 and by 11:00 the guitars were tuned up to F and were popping strings left and right .
Our ears are much more accurate in the high range than in the low .
For example , a violin player must put his fingers in exactly the right place or we all notice , but if the bass player ’s fingers are within a half inch of where they ’re supposed to be it ’s close enough .
Bear this in mind , and always tune your highest string first .
Besides the few specifics already given , human hearing is too vastly complex for us to deal with in any completeness here .
Suffice it to say : hearing varies from person to person , with temperature and humidity , and as we get older we tend to loose it ( especially in the upper registers ) .
SO WHAT DO I DO OBI WAN ?
First , make sure that your guitar is adjusted properly and has good strings .
Then there are two true paths :
1 ) Equal temperament .
Buy an electronic tuner , use it and trust it .
The guitar wo n’t sound perfect to a very good ear but it will sound fine to most of us , and you can switch keys with impunity .
If you do n’t have an electronic tuner , tune your high E to whatever is available and then find an E on every string and match it to the high E .
Do n’t mess with harmonics .
Harmonics are perfect pitches above an equal temperament fingerboard .
2 ) Approximating Perfect .
Start with the electronic tuner and then adjust your tuning using your tuning pegs or by bending individual notes in a chord as you play until the sound pleases your ear .
Try tuning to perfect pitches where you are going to spend most of your time in a song .
For example : in the key of C tune the C chord in first position to a perfect C chord .
The F and G chords will be fine and when you go up the neck to play lead , bend into tune .
If a perfectly in tune note at the bottom of the neck yields a sharp note up the neck tune it low and bend it .
Or , play fast and no one will notice .
Mohamed Sifaoui was born on July 4 , 1967 , and spent most of his childhood in Algeria .
He holds a master 's degree in political science and studied theology for two years at the University of Algiers and for two additional years at Zeitouna University 's Institute of Theology in Tunis .
In 1994 , he began work for the Algerian daily Le Soir and survived a February 11 , 1996 bomb attack at Le Soir 's headquarters at the Maison de la Presse .
In 1999 , the French government granted him political asylum after he received death threats both from Algerian Islamists and the military .
In Paris , Sifaoui works at the French weekly Marianne .
Between October 2002 and January 2003 , he infiltrated an Al - Qaeda cell in France in order to research his book , Mes frères assassins : Comment j'ai infiltré une cellule d'Al - Qaïda .
( My assassin brothers : How I infiltrated an Al - Qaeda cell ) . [ 1 ]
Sophie Fernandez Debellemanière , a former intern at Le Figaro and The Weekly Standard , interviewed Sifaoui in Paris on September 12 , 2007 , after meeting him at a 9 - 11 ceremony on the Champ de Mars .
In Islamism 's Cross Hairs
Middle East Quarterly : Did you flee Algeria because of the terrorist attack on Le Soir ?
Mohamed Sifaoui : No . Throughout the 1990s , I was determined to stay .
I only left in 1999 when I was sentenced to one year in jail for insulting the head of state .
I had criticized President Abdelaziz Bouteflika 's reconciliation policy because I considered it unfair to grant amnesty to a terrorist without even judging him .
The Algerian government talked about peace without ever recognizing there was a war .
The terrorists suddenly got themselves released with the same rights as the victims ' families .
Bouteflika 's behavior towards his people was criminal .
They wanted to send me to jail at the same time they were releasing criminals .
MEQ : You stayed longer than most .
Were people right to leave Algeria ?
Sifaoui :
The intellectuals and journalists who left Algeria when the murders started in 1992 were right to do so because the risk was real .
Survival instinct is natural and legitimate .
It would be indecent to judge them because fear is a legitimate human feeling .
In this sense , I was the one being unreasonable by risking my life to stay .
MEQ : Why did you stay in Algeria ?
Sifaoui : I did n't want to leave the country under pressure , because of the possibility of another terrorist attack .
Nor do I believe that I was especially brave to stay .
It is not a question of being brave or weak .
The only thing that matters is the message and the values that you want to transmit .
As a journalist , I felt that I had to stay .
We never obtained press freedom in Algeria , but I wanted to struggle to get a small part of it .
We made some progress , but then , Islamism took us backward .
By staying , I wanted to show that I would not accept submission to Islamist censorship and its diktat .
MEQ : Are you still worried ?
After all , two bodyguards are supervising this interview .
Sifaoui : No , I am not worried .
I have built sort of a shell around me .
I keep calm , and I do not panic .
Honestly , I prefer not to think about it ; otherwise , I would worry too much .
MEQ : Are you proud today to have risked your life for your ideas ?
Sifaoui : Yes , because I am lucky enough to be alive .
It is a shame that those who died did not leave for safety .
I stayed because I felt that I was able to accomplish this act of resistance .
Each person resists in his or her own way ; each does what he or she feels able to .
Among the members of the World War II resistance , some hid other resisters ; some hid Jewish families or helped them escape to Switzerland , and some failed only to denounce them .
For me , at this time , my resistance to fundamentalism is based on a determination not to concede any ground to the Islamists but to keep on writing and to defy danger everyday .
MEQ : What was your reaction to Al - Qaeda deputy leader Ayman al - Zawahiri 's appeal on September 20 , 2007 , " to wipe sons of France and Spain " out of the Maghreb ? [ 2 ]
Sifaoui : I 've been expressing the same warnings about Islamist terrorism for years .
Zawahiri 's statement does n't surprise me .
Since the GSPC [ Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat ] pledged its allegiance to Al - Qaeda in September 2006 , Algerian terrorists and Al - Qaeda leaders expressed their objective very clearly : Intensify terrorist attacks against the Algerian regime and its institutions , as well as against lay and democratic people , targeting Western and especially French citizens .
MEQ : Do you believe that Zawahiri was referring to the descendants of former colonists in Algeria by using the expression " sons of ? "
Or was this the result of too literal a translation of the Arabic ?
Sifaoui : No !
This has nothing to do with any literal translation !
Zawahiri is referring to all French and Spanish citizens by saying " sons of . "
Al - Qaeda 's targets are all the French and Spanish citizens in the Maghreb .
MEQ : Less than twenty - four hours after the release of Zawahiri 's message , a terrorist attack in Lakhdaria in northern Algeria , fifty miles southeast of Algiers , wounded two French citizens , one Italian , and six Algerians .
[ 3 ]
Is this attack a sign that the European presence in the Maghreb is in jeopardy ?
Sifaoui : I would not be so pessimistic , but such a quick reaction indicates how organized and coordinated Al - Qaeda and the GSPC are .
It also shows the Algerian regime 's incapacity to deal with terrorism .
An Islamist and Fascist Nexus ?
MEQ : Would you use the term Islamo - fascism to describe this threat ?
Sifaoui : I certainly am one of the first Muslims to consider Islamism to be fascism .
This is not a subjective decision but rather a serious , academic argument .
Fascism and Islamism are comparable in many aspects : Fascism , without evoking all its particularities , bears similarities to trends also present in Islamism .
I am , of course , making a reference to their will to exterminate the Jews .
On this point , the Islamists may go even further in their doctrine than the Nazis did , considering that the end of the world could only occur when there are no Jews left on earth .
In the three monotheist religions , apocalypse , end of the world , and doomsday exist and are liturgical events invested with a high degree of spirituality .
Hence , the Islamists interpret the end of the world in a very special way .
Whereas it is written nowhere in the Qur'an , exegetes describe the end of the world as the day when even the trees and rocks will be able to talk and tell the Muslims : " Come here , there is a Jew hiding behind me .
Come and kill him . "
And this would go on , until there would not be any Jew left on earth .
This ideology is pure fascism .
MEQ : Are there other similarities ?
Sifaoui :
The will to exterminate or do harm to homosexuals is another similarity between Nazism and Islamism .
The Islamists , also , say that they are the best community in the world , a superior race thanks to their beliefs .
They use political means to arrive at this erroneous exegesis .
I do not fear to call it fascism .
And there are many more similarities between fascism and Islamism .
Islamism vs. Moderate Islam
MEQ : Do you believe it is possible to criticize Islamism without being called a racist ?
Sifaoui : Absolutely , I would say that one must criticize Islamism .
When I am criticizing Nazism , I am not being anti-German .
MEQ : When did you feel for the first time that you had to criticize Islamism ?
Sifaoui : I have always felt that it was a moral duty .
MEQ : Do you believe that moderate Islam exists ?
Sifaoui :
Of course , it does .
If the majority of Muslims were not moderate , Islamists would have destroyed the Western world a long time ago .
Despite its technological lead , its nuclear power , and all its armies , the Western world would never be able to face an Islamist world entirely convinced by the terrorist cause .
One billion people supporting Al - Qaeda would reduce the rest of the world to ashes .
Islam contains violent texts that need not be applicable today .
Islam is a religion of moderation .
I know because I studied theology for four years .
Perhaps 20 percent of Muslims on the planet must be totally reeducated .
We have to fight them politically , ideologically , and also militarily .
Western societies do not fight them well ; whenever they try to do so , they end up strengthening them .
One proof that moderate Islam exists is the huge number of sympathy messages that I received from Muslim people when my investigative story on Al - Qaeda Salafist networks , J'ai infiltré une cellule islamiste , was broadcast on French television M6 .
Iran
MEQ : Given the Islamists ' vision of apocalypse , do you believe that Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad would fear reprisal should Iran attack Israel ?
Should Western analysts rely on Iran 's rationality ?
Sifaoui : Too many Western analysts look at any adversary through a Western lens .
Western analysts believe that Al - Qaeda is as rational as the Basque separatist group ETA [ Euskadi Ta Askatasuna ] or the Irish Republican Army .
My personal history , culture , and investigative journalism work allow me to understand what Westerners cannot see : Iran will attack Israel as soon as it can .
MEQ : Does n't Iran take into account the eventuality of its own destruction ?
Sifaoui : No , it does not .
Martyrdom is exalted in Iran .
Iranians view annihilation positively .
The Islamists ' main purpose is to create the conditions for the West to believe that chaos is possible .
The argument that says that Iran will not attack Israel because of immediate and massive retaliation from Israel and the United States is absolutely wrong .
The Islamists would welcome such retaliation in order to cement coalitions among Muslim peoples and to encourage riots in the Arab street .
U.S. military action , or even its prospect , coincides with Islamists ' interests .
That is the reason why I was against the war in Iraq .
MEQ : Can you explain ?
Sifaoui : Between October 2002 and January 2003 , I spent four months infiltrating an Al - Qaeda terrorist cell in France .
Two months before the launching of the Iraq war , when I was in the midst of the group , one of the Islamists said , " Now we are going to pray for George Bush to attack Iraq . "
I was surprised and acted as if I were stupid : " Really ?
Why do you want America to kill our brothers ? "
The most clever and elevated in Al - Qaeda 's hierarchy , Amara Saïfi [ the GSPC 's emir in London ] whispered to me , " All over the world , our brothers are now praying for George Bush to attack Iraq .
War between the Muslim world and the Western world is bound to happen .
Unfortunately , Muslims are too divided .
Far too many of them do not pray regularly and neglect religion and jihad .
In order to unify and mobilize all these people , we have to continue what we initiated on 9 - 11 .
We attacked America to make her retort everywhere in the Muslim world , in order to create a real war between Muslims and the West , and especially Israel . "
MEQ : That 's incredible .
Sifaoui : Another of the group added , " Once Iraq is at war , many of our brothers will go there to fight jihad .
George Bush will have answered our prayers by suppressing our enemy Saddam Hussein and unifying the Muslims in jihad .
Then as Westerners do not know how to fight attrition wars , we know that they will inevitably get stuck .
We will wait until they leave in order to establish an Islamist state in Iraq .
This war will be a pretext to launch terrorist attacks in Europe as well . "
Unfortunately , you can see their theory is valid .
They predicted exactly what is happening .

The new patent application was initially filed in April 2006 , updated last April and published by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office last Thursday .
It covers what IBM calls " a system and methods for extracting value from a portfolio of assets , for example a patent portfolio . "
Specifically , IBM - which collects more than $ US1 billion in patent royalties every year - describes a new process for licensing patents .
Instead of smaller companies licensing technologies from patent holders like IBM in a plodding , one - by - one manner , IBM envisions a more dynamic system with " floating privileges , " in which patents could be licensed quickly , as needed .
The application says this floating privilege , once purchased , could be activated by a patent - infringement lawsuit .
In other words , companies would buy the right to use a patent portfolio like IBM's as a legal shield for themselves - " just like purchasing a fire insurance policy , " IBM 's application contends .
Alex Chartove , a partner with the Morrison & Foerster law firm , said IBM 's proposal appears to be aimed at hindering " patent trolls " - a term often applied to small firms that buy up patents and aggressively wield them in lawsuits against other companies .
The problem for IBM , though , could be the greater scrutiny it and others have brought to business - method patents in recent years .
In a 2005 " friend of the court " brief to the U.S. Supreme Court , IBM argued that patent law 's scope should be " fairly narrow , and limited to technology , " Fiacco said .
In fact , IBM 's brief acknowledged that some of its own patents " might not satisfy this standard . "
One influential decision came last month , when the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled against lawyer Stephen Comiskey 's bid to patent a system for conducting arbitration .
The implication appears to be that it is unacceptable to patent a basic idea that does n't by itself transform something , without a technology that harnesses it .
Chartove said IBM 's proposed patent for patent portfolios might fall into that category .
" It 's not clear to me that there 's a significant technological tie - in to the IBM application , at least in its present form , " he said .
Because of IBM 's vocal stance on patents , the company took some ribbing on tech blogs recently when an application surfaced in which IBM sought to patent a method for outsourcing labour .
Robert Sutor , an IBM executive for intellectual - property standards , responded on his blog that the application would be withdrawn because it was not in line with the patent - reform drive .
This time , however , IBM wants to see the patent - portfolio application through .
IBM spokesman Steven Malkiewicz said that while the application does describe a business method , " this is all only possible with technology . "

Cool Gifts For The Real Estate Lover , Investor , Homeowner : A Photo Gallery
Welcome to The Digerati Life Real Estate Gift Boutique !
Okay this is just for fun so I hope you can play along .
Inspired by an article from SFGate about real estate gifts , I garnered some illustrations that reflected some highly interesting real estate oriented gifts for the home buyer , seller , owner , renter or investor .
I hope you enjoy your window - shopping experience ! 🙂
Unique Gifts for Real Estate Aficionados
Know someone who ’s selling their house ?
You can help them appeal to St. Joseph , the Patron Saint of all things real estate by getting them St. Joseph home kits to be used for devotional purposes .
St. Joseph was a carpenter by trade who taught his own step - son Jesus his wood - working skills — hence the belief by some that by burying this saint ’s statue in your backyard , you can expedite the sale of your home .
I ’m not sure how serious people are about some of this stuff but I actually have a friend who took it to heart ( he belongs to the same faith as I do ) and really went ahead and buried a statue .
For the record , it worked for him .
Not only that , there ’s also a Saint Benedict Home Protection Kit.
Saint Benedict is known as the Protector of Hearth and Home , so if you would like to banish the negative vibes from your house , this is the way to go :
-ooOoo -
For the aspiring land baron or geography student : OwnAPieceOfAmerica.us will give them a piece of America .
A lot of pieces , in fact .
If you ’re looking for a unique gift , well this would be it ( along the lines of StarRegistry.com , where you “ name a star after your love ” ) .
Marketed towards the person who has everything , you can purchase a deed for a square inch of land from each of the 50 states .
You can also purchase deeds for one square inch pieces of land in any state you wish .
They all seem to be for the same price ( between $ 19.95 and $ 49.95 ) and that ’s because you ’re really paying mainly for the processing of your deed and the deed itself rather than any old land , as far as I understand it .
This is purely for novelty purposes only !
-ooOoo -
Gift someone the opportunity to acquire a brand new house , instantly !
You can give someone the chance to own a luxury home in California by getting them a raffle ticket to own such a home .
It costs around $ 150 to get entered into a Dream House Raffle for a $ 2 million house , 4,400 square foot house in San Rafael .
Here ’s a shot of the house from the front :
Same raffle entry price to win a Palos Verdes home ; while I just caught another one in Brentwood Estates in Simi Valley .
Seems like a lot of these raffles are for homes in California .
-ooOoo -
To tickle your sweet tooth , you can settle for the classic candy house .
Chocolate or gingerbread are my favorites and I ’ve received a few of these in my time !
If I do get one , I usually just use it as decor because the sugar buzz is just way too much .
🙂
But watch out , since these things are also heaven for ants and other hungry pests !
-ooOoo -
You can always go the tried and true route by giving away the gift of information and education via books or DVDs .
There are tons of real estate books or other form of multi-media such as DVDs , and even entertaining feature films such as Closing Escrow ( a real estate satire ) and Open House ( a musical comedy about securing the American Dream ) , that you can check out .
Or how about imparting some lessons in real estate property management and general money management to your young ones in a fun and educational way ?
Then let ’s not forget one of the hottest items for the 2007 Christmas Season : the new Monopoly , Electronic Banking Edition board game ( and definitely one of my favorite games ever ) which has these cool new features :
Updated money transactions using electronic banking card features ( such as debit cards ) .
New tokens to reflect today ’s culture : the thimble , wheelbarrow and vintage racing car are replaced by modern tokens such as a tin of Altoids , a flat screen TV , a space shuttle and a dog in a handbag .
Railroads have been redeveloped into airports .
Utilities are now internet service providers and cell phone companies .
Properties have been modernized ( e.g. Texas Stadium , Times Square ) .
Fun new cards telling you to go to jail for identity theft or lose a million dollars because your network gets hacked .
Exchange money using much higher amounts : players start with $ 15 million in their bank card account .
You can also go for the classic Monopoly or one of its myriad other variants .
-ooOoo -
Now if you want to make a statement with a heftier gift , why not give away real property ?
Sounds cool , ‘ no ?
However , I was actually surprised to find out that it would be better to receive property through an inheritance instead of as a gift — mainly because of tax purposes .
Here ’s why , according to the SF Gate article :
When you pass along a primary residence , you can pass on the appreciation without it being taxed ( up to $ 250,000 for an individual and $ 500,000 for a couple ) .
But if you gift that same house , the receiver has to pay capital gains on your appreciation when he or she sells .
For a property that was bought many decades ago , the difference between the value of the home as a gift or an inheritance is significant .
Well , maybe you ’d rather nix the idea of giving or receiving property for now , and instead go for that Deed to America instead !
-ooOoo -
On a more serious note , if you ’re looking to give to charity , your gift can go a long way at places like the Coalition on Homelessness , which is local to San Francisco .
But you can check your own area for similar reputable charitable organizations that exist to help our homeless brethren .

2 Other defense funds are separate from military assistance and include funding for other missile defense programs ( Arrow , David ’s Sling and Iron Dome ) as well as anti-tunnel cooperation .
See below :
3 Economic aid is combination of grants and loans .
Israel stopped receiving almost all economic aid in 2007 .
4 Refugee resettlement aid is earmarked for the Jewish Agency / United Israel Appeal to help transport and resettle immigrants in Israel .
It was primarily used to help Soviet immigrants in the 1980s and 1990s , and later for Ethiopian immigrants .
5 This is funding allocated to American Schools and Hospitals Abroad ( ASHA )
6 Includes Food for Peace ( loans & grants ) ; Export - Import Bank aid ; Housing Loans ; Cooperative Development aid ; missile defense ; and , others .
* Includes $ 1.92 billion in regular military assistance and $ 1.2 billion for implementation of the Wye Agreement .
Loan guarantees are not considered foreign aid so the $ 7.9 billion in guarantees have been excluded from this table ( see Loan Guarantees for Israel [ table ] ) .
This table also excludes funding for certain other projects the CRS does not consider foreign aid , such as the $ 180 million for the research and development of the Arrow missile .

While speaking to Philipp Encz and Chad Thomas from Bloomberg News and other members of the Euro auto press today about the 25 % uptick in sales at VW 's Lamborghini brand for the first eight months of the year , Lambo president Stephan Winkelmann confirmed that yes , the rumors we 've been hearing about are in fact true .
There will be a limited - edition sports car unveiling from the bull - brand at the Frankfurt Auto Show in two weeks .
The rumored price of $ 1 million ?
That has n't yet been confirmed — but it also was n't denied .
Our sources tell us his response to the question was :
" I can confirm those rumors , but at this stage I will have to make you wait until the Franfurt Auto Show , where we will release more details ... I can't confirm the price at this stage , but it will be very expensive indeed . "

We 're still going to be operating under the assumption it'll follow our initial tip that the car 's going to cost upwards of $ 1.5 million and be like some kind of love child between a LP640 and a jet fighter .
We 've also learned that In addition to the news about the super - rare Lambo unveiling , we 're also told Winkelmann told the press folks enthusiasts should n't expect an LM002 follow - up or four - door anytime soon .
We guess we 'll be showing you some hot and expensive Lambo action for you in Frankfurt in a mere two weeks time .
Nobel Peace Prize Winner Rajendra K. Pachauri , the chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC in Geneva attends a session at the World Economic Forum WEF in the Swiss Alpine resort town of Davos January 23 , 2008 .

COPENHAGEN ( Reuters ) -
One billion people can get electricity for the first time for little more than the reported cost of one month ’s war in Iraq said Rajendra Pachauri , the head of a Nobel peace prize - winning U.N. panel of climate scientists .
Pachauri is supporting a campaign “ lighting a billion lives , ” led by India ’s Energy and Resources Institute , to furnish people without access to the grid with electric lanterns powered by solar photovoltaic panels .
“ Millions and millions of people do not see light after the sun goes down , ” he told a carbon market conference in Copenhagen on Tuesday .
Some 1.6 billion people worldwide do not have access to electricity .
Pachauri compared the $ 15 billion cost of providing solar - powered lights to a billion people with a reported cost of the U.S. - led military campaign in Iraq of $ 12 billion a month .
He described that perceived mis-match in resources as “ one of the biggest tragedies that the world can be guilty of . ”
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) shared the Nobel peace prize last year with former U.S. Vice President Al Gore for raising awareness of the threat of climate change .
Ontario's Liberal government will introduce legislation tomorrow to implement a provincewide ban on the cosmetic use of pesticides , keeping one of their key election promises from last year .
Premier Dalton McGuinty promised the pesticide ban during last fall 's election campaign after intensive lobbying from environmental activists and health professionals .
McGuinty and Environment Minister John Gerretsen will visit a private home in Toronto tomorrow – Earth Day – to announce the ban on the cosmetic use of pesticides on lawns .
Gerretsen was reluctant to reveal any details today , but said members of the public who visited the ministry 's website overwhelmingly supported the ban .
" We always said it was a priority when we came out with our platform last year , and it's had tremendous support around the province from what we 've received as far as the environmental registry is concerned , " Gerretsen said .
" Ninety per cent of the people that responded to it responded in a favourable way . "
The provincewide ban is aimed at replacing a patchwork of local pesticide bylaws , but Ontario farmers will be exempt .
There 's no word yet if the province also plans to exempt golf courses from the ban .
The Conservatives and New Democrats said today they would likely support the legislation , but they first want to make sure the ban will actually help the environment and is n't just a public relations move by the Liberal government .
" I think our inclination is to probably support it , but at the same time we want to hear from the folks who are experts in this area , and whether they think it 's all politics or whether there is going to be some meaningful benefit to the environment , " said Opposition Leader Bob Runciman .
" We 've seen a lot of initiatives from this government that do n't have a lot of substance but look good and tend to make headlines , and this is maybe another one . "
NDP environmental critic Peter Tabuns said he wants a ban that includes real penalties for people who continue to use pesticides for cosmetic purposes .
" If they bring forward legislation that has teeth in it , that 's useful , then obviously we 're going to be inclined to support it , " Tabuns said .
" But we do n't know what they 're bringing forward .
We do n't know if it 's going to be useful or just simply fluff . "
The Ontario College of Family Physicians has said the long - term effects of exposure to pesticides can be devastating , especially to pregnant women and children , leading to learning disabilities , birth defects and miscarriages .
The Canadian Cancer Society , the David Suzuki Foundation , Environmental Defence and the Ontario Medical Association have all urged Ontario to follow Quebec 's lead and pass the ban on pesticides .

There is no better way to fall into an IRS black hole than to try to become a scientist .
I'm a postdoctoral fellow - which means that I have my PhD , but no permanent job ; I 'm spending a few years doing research in a lab run by a more senior scientist .
This is a typical part of the career path for most people in the natural sciences who want to direct their own labs at a research university or with a company .
While a postdoc position offers valuable training , its also an excuse for institutions to get work from trained scientists without paying them very much .
After getting your PhD ( generally 9 + years of training , if you count college ) , you can land a postdoc position with the lucrative starting salary of $ 36,996 , which really , really makes you feel like that PhD was worthwhile !
But besides the salary , you get screwed by the IRS because according to the IRS:1 .
You 're not an employee - not of the university you 're at , nor of the government organization funding your research and salary .
Thus you technically have no employer - sponsored health insurance ; all of your health insurance premiums are taxable income .
2 .
You 're not self - employed either , by the standards of the IRS - which also makes you lose out on certain tax benefits .
3 .
You do n't actually " earn " any income - by the standards of the IRS , what you are paid is a living stipend , not wages paid for a service - so in my case , with 3 kids , I get screwed on certain child tax benefits - such as the ability to deduct any daycare expenses .
4 . You are not a student - postdocs already have all the degrees they want ; they 're generally not looking for more .
But not being a student also screws you in some instances with the IRS .
In the US , we 're supposedly worried about the fact that we 're not training enough scientists to fill our society 's future needs , but unless you really , really like science , there is absolutely no incentive to choose it as a career .
So how do we get college kids to sign up ?
Easy : do n't tell your freshman biology students that after 4 years of college they 'll need another 5 - 6 years of grad school , and 3 - 4 more years as a postdoc before they land their first permanent job and get to do the things their friends in other professions are already doing , like saving for a house , retirement , kids ' college , not to mention vacations .
Oh , and we also should n't mention that because of flat NIH budgets for the last few years , its harder than ever to get money to do your research .
It is a brave man who , in seeking to be elected US President , starts a speech with the idea that the nation was founded on the ' original sin ' of slavery .
But that is what Barack Obama did last week .
It would have looked braver had Senator Obama not been forced into addressing the issue by a controversy over statements made by Jeremiah Wright , his church pastor and friend .
Rev Wright lambasted the US for ideological hypocrisy in terms deeply offensive to most Americans .
The fact that Obama 's speech was a reaction to controversy meant that US media focused more on its effectiveness as damage - limitation than on the ideas it contained .
But those ideas , although rooted in the American experience , deserve close attention beyond US shores .
Senator Obama noted that , while polite society has declared racial epithets taboo , in private , black and white communities ( mostly socially segregated ) harbour deep resentments .
On one side is the feeling that society is endemically racist .
The white establishment cannot be relied upon to do anything to help the black underclass if it means compromising its own hold on power .
On the other side is the feeling that a narrative of victimhood is used by the black community to extract special privileges .
The white working class , goes this view , faces the same barriers to advancement as non-whites , but is expected to surmount them by self - reliance alone .
That , Obama said , is ' racial stalemate ' .
At best , politicians view racial tension as an embarrassing side issue , at worst as a resource to be mobilised for votes .
The analysis rings horribly true of Britain too .
Although public discourse conforms to liberal anti-racist orthodoxy , skin colour , sadly , still matters .
It still affects people 's life chances .
Issues of race lie hidden in discussion of many policy areas : immigration , housing , education , crime .
If they are not tackled overtly , it is because politicians dare n't touch the subject for fear of stoking just the same resentments that Obama described and because none of our political leaders can draw upon the experience that Obama brings to the subject .
Westminster , as much as Washington , is largely a club for white men .
It would be a tragedy if Barack Obama 's speech , ' A More Perfect Union ' , were remembered only as a tactical bid to smother a controversy in an election campaign .
It was the most incisive account of race politics in America - and beyond - for a generation .
Delivered with dignity , authority and humility , it deserves a place in history as one of the most impressive pleas for a new beginning on race relations since the famous orations of Martin Luther King .
An appeal to Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman :
Arrest George W. Bush when he steps off the plane for the Republican Convention in September .
George W. Bush has committed horrible crimes against humanity .
His war against a weak and defenseless country ; his use of torture and kidnapping , his illegal incarcerations of foreign nationals and the shelling of Fallujah are crimes in violation of international law .
As long as he is President he cannot be tried for these crimes in another country , but once he is a private citizen , then , like Kissinger , Pinochet and Donald Rumsfeld , he will be a hunted criminal with little refuge in any foreign country that believes in the rule of law .
But those are matters for foreign countries and the international court .
He has violated and undermined the Constitution by illegally spying on citizens , by refusing to enforce laws passed by Congress , by invading a country without a Declaration of a State of War by Congress and by entering into agreements with foreign countries and not submitting those agreements to the United States Senate for their advice and consent .
But these are matters for the U. S. Congress to enforce .
Unfortunately , Congress is unwilling to hold the President accountable to the Constitution and has refused to begin impeachment proceedings against him .
But what concerns us as Minnesotans is whether George W. Bush 's actions have caused serious and grievous harm to the citizens of our state and whether that harm was incidental to the legitimate performance of his official duties as President or whether his actions were motivated by private and personal gain .
As the highest elected law enforcement official in Hennepin County , it is Mike Freeman 's duty to enforce the laws of this state .
If it can be shown that there is probable cause that George W. Bush caused harm to the people of Minnesota and that this harm was caused by his willful pursuit of personal gain , then it is the duty of Mike Freeman to arrest George W. Bush and hold him accountable to Minnesota law .
There are three areas in which the criminal acts of George W. Bush have violated Minnesota law .
First , his pursuit of a war against the government of Iraq was not done in legitimate defense of national interest but rather in pursuit of personal wealth .
His administration lied about the threat of weapons of mass destruction , and they lied about a connection between Iraq and international terrorists .
They knew Iraq did not pose a threat to the United States .
The only reasonable explanation for George W. Bush 's invasion of Iraq was that he stood to personally benefit from the war .
To fully understand the Bush family financial interests in war profiteering it is necessary to understand their history .
Great - grandfather Samuel Prescott Bush was president of Buckeye Steel Castings .
He manufactured railroad couplings for railroads owned by the Morgans , Rockefellers and Harrimans .
During World War I he was on the War Industries Board and chaired the section on forgings , guns , small arms and ammunition , and he got to work with people from Dupont , Remington , Winchester and Colt .
Sam Bush founded and became the first president of the National Association of Manufacturers , an organization whose principal cause was defending industrial capitalism from the threat of unions .
He became an indispensable part of the military - industrial complex , and he sent his son Prescott off to Yale where he could associate with the sons of his friends in the Skull and Bones fraternity .
Along with many of his college chums , Prescott joined Brown Brothers Harriman after college and started making serious money .
The biggest buck to be made in the 1920's was in re-arming Germany .
Harriman & Co. set up Union Banking Corp with Prescott as Manager to trade with Nazi financier Fritz Thyssen .
They bought a steamship line to ship Remington arms to Germany through a dummy corporation in Holland .
Harriman & Co. bought Dresser Industries ( manufacturers of oil pipeline equipment ) in 1929 and Prescott became a Director , and he continued to run Dresser from the Board for the rest of his life .
They , along with John Foster Dulles and others , bankrolled Hitler as a shrewd business strategy .
Prescott became Managing Director of Union Bank in 1934 at the height of trade with Germany .
In 1939 he took direct management of some of the slave labor camps in Poland to aid Nazi armament , according to Dutch intelligence sources .
In October of 1942 , the U. S. government seized the assets of Union Bank and three other of Prescott 's industries : the steamship line , the Seamless Steel Equipment Corporation ( suppliers of steel , wire and explosives to the Nazis ) and the Silesian - American Company ( the coal mining company he managed along with John Foster Dulles on behalf of the Nazi Economic Minister ) .
This did n't really close them down .
Once the war started they simply changed sides and started supplying war material to the Allies .
During the War Bonesmen were active in forming the OSS and its later incarnation , the CIA .
Prescott 's relationship with Dulles would become very useful during the Eisenhower years , with John Foster as Secretary of State and his brother Allen Dulles as Director of the CIA .
Prescott and Dresser Industries were kept well inside the loop .
Hans Gisevius , the German intelligence agent who acted as the go - between with Allen Dulles in Switzerland and Admiral Canaris in the German High Command after the war , acted as go - between with Dulles , Dresser Industries and Prescott Bush .
George Herbert Walker Bush , Prescott 's son , improved on the CIA connection to the point of becoming its Director in 1976 .
After graduating from Yale , George H. W. Bush went to work at his father 's firm , Dresser Industries .
Eventually , with money from Brown Brothers and Harriman ( his dad 's parent company ) he set up his own company , Zapata .
It was really a CIA front .
The Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba in 1961 was probably George 's operation as much as it was Allen Dulles's .
The CIA code name for it was Zapata .
The boats left for the Bay of Pigs from an island that was leased to George H. W. Bush , and the boats were named Houston and Barbara .
He ran for Congress in Houston in 1964 by campaigning against the Civil Rights Act .
He did n't get elected that year , but he did get elected the next time he tried .
When he was Chair of the Republican Party in 1972 he set up ethnic heritage groups within the Party .
These groups were havens for ex-Nazis .
While Vice President under Reagan , Bush was Chair of the Special Situations Group responsible for defeating the Sandanistas in Nicaragua .
He and Ollie North set up , financed and armed the Contras through an elaborate and highly secretive scheme that saw private planes flying cash to Iran , buying Soviet - made guns , flying guns to the Contras at a private CIA airstrip in Costa Rica , trading guns for marijuana and cocaine , then flying the drugs to a private U. S. airbase in Homestead , Florida , where the drugs were traded for cash .

Well , here ’s the story .
Let ’s start this off by saying that we think this might be a little bit too early , but you never know with Apple .
Anyways , we told y’all last year before the first iPhone launched that AT&T employees were not allowed to take vacations from June 15th to July 15th .
AT&T reps just got an internal email stating that they would be unable to take vacation time from 4/15 - 5/15 “ due to projected increased traffic and an exciting new promotion / product launch . ”
We ’re only 10 days away from the end of that time frame and with no Apple event in the next week or so , it seems highly unlikely that a new iPhone will launch .
Then again , the only other time AT&T has done this was last year before the first iPhone launched .
What do y’all think ?
Think some Apple event invites will start getting sent out in the next couple days ?
Or is this way too soon ?
UPDATE : Sorry , guys .
We ’re lacking some serious sleep over here .
The dates are in fact June 15th to July 12th .
Our apologies .
The full internal email , after the jump !

Carter : ' Foolish ' Bush World War III comment ' must have been misquoted ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Friday November 2 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This Former President Jimmy Carter has responded to George W. Bush 's comment that if Iran even acquires the knowledge of how to make a nuclear bomb it could mean World War III , calling it " a foolish statement for anybody to make . "
Carter told CNN , " Every year at the Carter Center , we bring in about 35 nations from around the world , all of whom know how to make atomic weapons .
... Argentina and Brazil and Egypt and Saudi Arabia ... it 's no longer a secret .
And so just to say that if someone has the knowledge of doing it , that we 're going to go to war with them -- I really believe that the president must have been misquoted . "
Carter suggested there were two things we ought to be doing to prevent Iran actually building a bomb .
" One of them is to talk directly to them , to have diplomatic relations with Iran , to let them know about the seriousness of it .
...
And the second is to quit making threatening statements from the highest levels in government that we might launch an attack on Iran .
That would make any country want to build up their military capability . "
" Cool it off and talk to them , " was how Carter 's summarized the situation , and though he acknowledged that Vice President Cheney has been pressing for war , he said that since speaking recently with Secretary of State Rice he did not think confrontation was inevitable and believed that " cooler heads will prevail . "
Carter declined to make any comment on the likely Democratic presidential nominee , saying , " I 'm not a very good predictor .
... I just hope that we 'll have a Democrat in the White House , because I notice the Republicans are debating about who 's going to attack Iran quicker and who 's going to keep Guantanamo open longer and who 's going to torture prisoners the hardest . "
Carter also recalled that , like Dennis Kucinich , he had once seen a UFO , back when he was a peanut farmer .
" I and about 25 others saw something in the air that changed colors and was round and came and left .
We could n't figure out what it was .
It was unidentified as far as we were concerned . "
But he added that he believed it was " impossible " for it to have been space people .

One of the U.K.'s top nuclear officials said today that she was told the U.S. will okay plans to build the first nuclear power plants since the accident at Three Mile Island nearly three decades ago .
Lady Barbara Thomas Judge , chair of the U.K. Atomic Energy Authority , said that the chair of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission informed her that the NRC will approve three applications for new nuclear reactors that it 's currently considering .
" Dale Klein told me that those three nuclear applications will be approved , " she told the State of the Planet conference at Columbia University today , the 29th anniversary of the accident at Three Mile Island in Middletown , Pa . ( Subsequently , a reactor at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in the then Ukrainian Soviet Republic melted down in April 1986 in what would become the worst nuclear power accident in history , spreading radiation as far away as North America and leading to the evacuation and resettlement of more than 336,000 people ) .
" The politics is changing , " she added , noting growing enthusiasm for nuclear power as the clean alternative to coal - burning plants .
Even some environmentalists have begun to embrace nuclear power , because of its potential to reduce the greenhouse emissions that are blamed for global warming .
But critics question the safety of nuclear power , citing such concerns as the potential for catastrophic meltdowns , their potential vulnerability to terrorists , the lack of workable evacuation plans in the event of accidents as well as the problem of dealing with radioactive waste .
Among the pending applications : a plan to build two additional boiling - water reactors at the South Texas Project power plant near Houston .
As many as 29 other reactors could be built , according to Bill Borchardt , director of the NRC's Office of New Reactors .
But neither the South Texas facility nor the applications for new reactors at Calvert Cliffs in Maryland and the Shearon Harris nuclear plant outside Raleigh , N.C. , have completed the NRC 's long design safety and feasibility evaluation , which could take years to complete .
The commission does not expect to complete its review of the new reactors at the South Texas plant before 2011 , according to NRC spokesman Scott Burnell .
" Once you build the power plants , it just keeps producing energy , " Judge said , noting the potential benefits of electricity generation from nuclear fission .
" It is part of what we have to do to deal with energy security and climate change . "

Children demonstrating against the Israeli military 's attempt to close schools and orphanages in Hebron , Palestine ( photo by Ahmad Jaradat , AIC , 2008 ) .
April 7 , 2008
Fourteen Hebron - area schools and orphanages , which serve approximately 7000 Palestinian children and orphans , today face the threat of closure by the Israeli army , Eight of these schools and orphanages belong to the Islamic Charitable Society , while the remaining six belong to the Muslim Youth Society .
On 25 February 2008 , the Israeli military commander of the West Bank , General Gadi Shamni , issued a military order confiscating all properties located in Hebron that belong to these Islamic societies , including schools , stores , centres and residential houses .
According to Palestinian security sources , in the past month the Israeli army conducted an intensive military operation in the city of Hebron , ransacking several offices , schools and properties of these societies .
On 26 February the army invaded several buildings while damaging gates and furniture and stealing food , notebooks , books , clothes and computers .
On 6 May the Israeli army attacked a store on Hebron�s El - Hawooz Street , where the Islamic Charitable Society collected clothes and personal items for the orphans .
According to Abdul - Kareem Farrah , the information advisor to the Islamic Charitable Society , these Israeli thefts and damages cost approximately NIS 1 million .
The original military order indicated that the schools and orphanages would be closed as of 1 April 2008 .
However , after the governor of Hebron , Hussain al - A�raj , expressing his astonishment at the order and requested the Israeli authorities to revoke it , and after the lawyer Osama Hallabi petitioned the Israeli High Court in this matter , the order was postponed for one week .
On the morning of 2 April , school officials received word that the Israeli High Court had given the Israeli army four days to provide full justification for the closure and evacuation of the schools and orphanages .
On 3 April the attorney for the Islamic Charitable Society was informed that the Israeli High Court will rule in this matter on Monday 7 April .
Today .
According to Attorney Hallabi , the military order does not specify a real and concrete reason for the closures , and falls under the category of a " security reason order " .
Hallabi reports that most of the charitable societies � buildings are located in Area A , which falls under jurisdiction of the Palestinian Authority , while others are located in Area B , which falls under PA administrative jurisdiction and Israeli security jurisdiction .
This means the charitable associations should be allowed to petition the Palestinian governor of the Hebron District or at least to the Civil Affairs Ministry of the PA .
Israeli authorities have no right to confiscate public or private properties not belonging to their jurisdiction .
Moreover , the closure order violates the Fourth Geneva Convention , as the Convention explicitly states that an occupation authority cannot confiscate properties within occupied territories .
The Islamic Charitable Society and the Muslim Youth Society provided numerous proofs of their legality .
All of their financial dealings and accounting are completely transparent .
They have contacts and relations with official organizations and banks .
The Islamic Charitable Society was founded in 1957 and the Muslim Youth Society in 1961 , both well before the establishment of the Islamic Resistance Movement ( Hamas ) .
Both societies always had legal permission for their buildings and their work , first during the Jordanian control and after under the Israeli occupation .
Several protest marches took place in recent days in Hebron and the surrounding area against the confiscation order , augmented by support from various international organisations .
At this very moment ( 3 pm local time on 7 April ) , a press conference for foreign consulate representatives , human rights organizations and journalists is being conducted in one of the schools under threat .
There is a tremendous grassroots effort to save these properties with support of the local and international media and non-government organisations .
If the military confiscation and closure will be implemented , 7000 Palestinian students , aged 5 to 16 , will have no school .
4500 orphans will become homeless for the second time .
5000 weakened families will go without assistance .
600 workers will lose their livelihood .
This situation is alarming .
Who can provide this assistance and shelter ?
The occupying forces of the Israeli military or government ?
The Palestinian Authority , which lacks money to build a state with all the necessary infrastructures ?
Why leave these children without homes , education and hope for their future ?
What is their crime ?
It appears that Israel is planning to target all Palestinian infrastructures which can be related in some way to Islamic organizations and movements .
Negatively affecting the life of thousands of people and children , this policy is once again a collective punishment against the entire Palestinian people and international law as a whole .
By targeting Islamic group and associations , Israel is attempting to steer the Israeli - Palestinian conflict towards a religious dimension .
In doing so , Israel is both exploiting and bolstering the American - led international equation of Islam with terrorism , and Muslim with terrorist , in order to further dispossess the Palestinian people and to destroy possibilities for peace in the area .
To date this international understanding has had horrific implications for the Palestinians , particularly in making it possible to dehumanize the 1.5 million Palestinian women , men and children of the Gaza Strip and declare them and the area as a " hostile entity . "
To kill and cut off the basic necessities of life , and to do so with complete impunity .
Israel is now acting to dehumanise Palestinian children and orphans in the Hebron area , whose sole ' crime� is to attend schools and reside in orphanages run by Islamic charity groups .
Israel had the possibility to negotiate with Islamic parties and organizations , but they failed to do so .
Numerous Palestinians do not possess any possibility other than the social efforts of some Islamic groups which truly care for the social needs of the people .
Often time people do not have any hope other than their religion .
Why steal from them even their individual hopes and dreams ?
A growing number of oil - market watchers say voters riled by soaring fuel costs may face far worse this summer , as factors ranging from unrest in Nigeria to slumping production in Russia could shove benchmark oil prices over $ 150 a barrel .
U.S. benchmark crude notched another record Tuesday , settling at $ 121.84 on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
Nymex crude oil so far this year is up 27 % and is now 17 % above its previous inflation - adjusted record in April 1980 .
It is up 96 % from a year ago .

With 3G and 4G wireless broadband becoming part of the daily mobile lexicon , who has time for pokey old EDGE networks ?
Nokia Siemens
Networks , a wireless equipment maker , does and has come up with a new software solution that doubles the EDGE data speeds .
The new technology , called Nokia Siemens Networks ’ Dual Carrier EDGE solution , will double the data speed to up to 592 kbps on existing EDGE - capable GSM networks .
It will be available in the third quarter of 2008 , and will soon be followed by what NSN calls EGPRS 2 , which will result in downlink speeds of up to 1.2 Mbps and will double uplink speed to up to 473 kbps , thus quadrupling the capabilities of EDGE today .
Now that means millions of iPhone users can now look forward to a new , faster day , when their devices will get a true taste of speed !
It 's not pretty , but it sure looks cool .
It 's not really an improvement over the regular PSP though .
If anything , I 'd say this gets a negative just because it adds yet another unnecessary moving part , and all the while does not protect the display any more than the regular PSP does .
" I came back from a trip to Israel in November convinced that Israel would attack Iran , " Bruce Riedel , a former career CIA official and senior adviser to three US presidents - including George W. Bush - on Middle East and South Asian issues , told Newsweek Thursday , citing conversations he had with Mossad and Israeli defense officials .
" And that was before the National Intelligence Estimate ( NIE ) .
This makes it even more likely .
Israel is not going to allow its nuclear monopoly to be threatened , " the American magazine quoted Riedel as saying in an article titled , " What will Israel do ? " .
Mission to Washington Israeli delegation dispatched to US to argue that Iran still pursuing bomb Associated Press Intelligence experts at end of week - long mission to Washington to counter findings of NIE report claiming Iran no longer developing nuclear weapons Israeli delegation dispatched to US to argue that Iran still pursuing bomb
Published in early December , the American NIE determined that Iran had shelved its nuclear weapons program in 2003 .
According to Newsweek , " a rising tide of opinion in Israel 's intelligence and national - security circles believes that the NIE does signal American retreat - and , more profoundly , renewed Israeli isolation over what is deemed an existential threat out of Tehran . "
' Israel has gotten away with it '
The magazine quoted Knesset Member Ephraim Sneh , a former deputy defense minister who has " warned for years that Israel would eventually have to confront Iran alone , " as saying that " today we are closer to this situation than we were three weeks ago ... we have to be prepared to forestall this threat on our own . "
David Albright of the Institute for Science and International Security in Washington told Newsweek that Israel was likely encouraged by the non-reaction to their September air strike on a reported Syrian nuclear facility , " which may have been a test run for Iran , or at least a warning directed at Tehran " .
" Israel has gotten away with it in a sense , " Albright was quoted as saying .
He suggested that any Israeli pre-emptive action might not be a " traditional strike " but could involve more " sabotage of equipment " .
Newsweek said Israel also knows that the Arab states are " terrified of an Iranian nuclear power , possibly to the point of looking the other way at another such strike " .
The magazine said one reason for Bush 's abruptly announced nine - day visit to the Middle East in mid-January was " to deal with the fallout from the NIE , which includes not only the possibility that Israel will act unilaterally but also that Bush 's prized Annapolis peace process will stall .
" The Bush trip is , in part , an implicit concession to US hawks that the NIE went too far in absolving Iran .
It is also a conscious effort to reassure both Israel and the Arab states that Washington will stand up to Iran 's increasing intrusiveness and hegemonic tendencies , " Newsweek said in its report .
I just finished re-reading ( for the nth time ) Bruce Sterling 's 1998 novel Distraction .
I did n't mean to — I picked it up in a used bookstore in Milwaukee on my way to a quick dinner in my hotel room , thinking I 'd just read a few pages of this old friend and then leave it behind for the next guest to discover and enjoy .
Now it 's 18 hours later and I 've read all 500 - some pages of it , and , as ever , my mind is a - whirl with the incredible ideas , people and speculation in this remarkable , remarkable book .
Distraction is the story of an America on the skids : economy in tatters , dollar collapsed , unemployment spiked , population on the move in great , restless herds bound together with networks and bootleg phones .
The action revolves around Oscar Valparaiso , a one - of - a- kind political operator who has just put his man — a billionaire sustainable architecture freak — into the Senate and is looking for some downtime .
But a funny thing happens on the way to the R&R : Oscar and his " krewe " ( the feudal entourage who trail after him , looking after his clothes , research , security , systems and so on ) end up embroiled in a complex piece of political theater , a media war between the rogue governor of the drowned state of Louisiana , the Air Force , the newly elected president , and a weird , pork - barrel science park in its own glassed - in dome .
Every single chapter — every one ! — has at least enough material for five great speculative short stories .
From the net - gang hobos ( and their remarkable , cellular - automata driven fleamarkets ) to the weird economic boom in cognition research , to the idea of leisure unions and anti-work activist techno - triumphalists , this book fizzes with awesome ideas .
But that 's only one of its three signal virtues .
The other two are : the insight Sterling brings to the nature of politics and the political process in the age of networked economies and systems ; and the vivid , larger - than - life characters who populate this book .
They are , to a one , likable , frustrating , believable , admirable and enraging .
It 's a powerful concoction , this book , and now , ten years after its initial publication , it 's possible to asses just how prescient , how visionary , Sterling is .
I love all of Bruce 's books , but this one may just be my favorite .
It 's the kind of friend you end up staying up all night chatting with , even when all you plan on doing is saying a quick hello .

Indonesia has banned broadcasts of the film by Geert Wilders , leader of the Dutch anti-immigration Freedom Party , and radical Muslims called for the lawmaker ’s death during protests outside the Dutch embassy in Jakarta this week .
On Wednesday , a Dutch flag flying outside a consulate in the Sumatran city of Medan was set ablaze .
Indonesia ’s information minister , Muhammad Nuh , has written to the video - sharing Web site YouTube asking it to remove the film , said Cahyana Ahmadjayadi , the ministry ’s director general for information technology .
“ Our efforts include asking Internet service providers to block access to YouTube .
They have started doing it now , ” Ahmadjayadi told Reuters .
Users subscribing to an Internet service provided by the country ’s largest telecoms company , PT Telekomunikasi Indonesia , said they could still access YouTube .
Dozens of students burned tyres and pushed against the gate of the Dutch consulate in Medan , prompting police to hold protesters back from around the consulate , Metro TV showed .
The protesters also pulled down a wooden signboard at the consulate .
An embassy official said a Dutch flag was taken down and burnt .
“ It ’s just an honorary consulate , so there ’s no sort of security there , ” said the official , who declined to be named .
The state Antara news agency reported that police had fired two warning shots and detained 20 people suspected of damaging property .
In mainly Muslim Malaysia , a supermarket chain , Mydin Mohamed Holdings , labelled hundreds of Dutch - origin items on its shelves with red stickers to help buyers identify and avoid them , urging customers to vote with their wallets in protest .
“ We feel that as Muslims we must do something , ” Managing Director Ameer Ali Mydin told Reuters , adding that products ranging from electrical appliances to baby food now carry the telltale sticker in his network of 40 stores across Malaysia .
Mydin , which buys up to 60 million ringgit ( 9.6 million pounds ) worth of products each year from companies with ties to the Netherlands , has also put up posters near store checkout points to urge customers to boycott the items .
Milk producer Dutch Lady , which says it has been operating in Malaysia for more than 50 years , took out full - page advertisements in newspapers on Wednesday to denounce the film , and condemned the comments and statements in it .
“ We respect all cultures , beliefs and values and strongly condemn this expression against Islam , ” it added .
Wilders launched his short video “ Fitna ” -- an Arabic term sometimes translated as “ strife ” -- on the Internet last week , drawing international condemnation .
The film intersperses images of the September 11 , 2001 attacks on the United States with other Islamist bombings and quotations from the Koran , Islam ’s holy book .
In February , Pakistan ordered its Internet service providers to block YouTube over material considered offensive to Islam .
The move came after the popular site carried controversial sketches of the Prophet Mohammad which were republished by Danish newspapers in January .
The cartoon , first published in Danish newspapers , ignited violent protests around the world and a boycott of Danish products in 2006 .
Many Muslims regard any depiction of the Prophet as offensive .
A similar step was taken by Thailand last year after YouTube aired a 44 - second film showing graffiti over the face of revered King Bhumibol Adulyadej .
Wilders ’ film urges Muslims to tear out “ hate - filled ” verses from the Koran and starts and ends with a cartoon of the Prophet Mohammad with a bomb under his turban , accompanied by a ticking sound .
Protests against the Dutch film have been small scale in Indonesia , the world ’s most populous Muslim nation and a former Dutch colony .
ATLANTA , Georgia ( CNN ) --
I 'm the mother of two daughters , a teen and a tween .
So every day , I tiptoe through hormonally laced minefields hoping to avoid emotional carnage in response to any of my random comments or actions .
The cervical cancer vaccine , approved in 2006 , is recommended for girls around 11 or 12 .
As I tiptoe , I sometimes stumble , as any mother of girls that age knows .
No adult woman in her right mind would knowingly , willingly utter comments that result in young people hissing , hurling verbal grenades such as , " Thanks , Mom , for calling me fat , AGAIN . "
Or " Are you EVEN listening to me ? "
Or any version of the very popular , " I hate YOU , " " I hate you SO much , " " I hate this family , " or just plain " AAAARRRRGGGHHHHH ! " followed by stomping feet and slamming doors .
So given this background , you might understand why , when I chose to broach the subject of the latest vaccine for young girls , I was braced for a fight .
Oddly enough , for once , the battle did n't come .
I told my teenage daughter I wanted her to get the HPV ( human papillomavirus ) vaccine the next time she went to see her doctor .
" I do n't want to . "
" Well , sorry .
You have to . "
" I heard it hurts . "
" Well , that 's too bad .
But it might prevent you from getting cancer later in life . "
" Oh. ( pause ) OK . "
If you were keeping score , you might chalk that one up as a Mom win .
The only problem with that is after winning over my daughter , I now had to convince myself .
This drug has its own emotional battlefields .
The HPV vaccine has been available to the public for almost two years .
When Merck launched it in 2006 under the name Gardasil , many people enthusiastically embraced it as a wonder drug .
Dr. Kevin Ault , associate professor of gynecology and obstetrics at Emory University 's School of Medicine , says the vaccine helps women avoid an assortment of ailments , some not too serious , but others that are potentially deadly .
" There are about 100 different types of human papillomavirus , " he said .
" Some of them are pretty common and not dangerous , like plantar warts or warts on your hand .
About 30 of them infect the genital tract , and about a dozen of them are associated with cancer . "
Health for Her : Watch more the HPV vaccine and girls »
In this case , the cancer Ault is talking about is cervical cancer .
The National Cancer Institute estimates that in 2008 , there will be over 11,000 new cases of cervical cancer diagnosed and almost 4,000 women will die from it in the United States .
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration says that at least 50 percent of people who have had sex will have one type of HPV at some time in their lives .

More Health for Her Health and Human Services : VAERS
Given those stats , this vaccine would seem like a pretty good thing , right ?
The hitch is that the vaccine is suggested for adolescent girls , but the viruses in question are sexually transmitted .
And that is one of the big reasons the HPV vaccine has divided parents in the question of " to give or not to give . "
Let 's face it .
Parents do n't like thinking about their daughters having sex at all .
Ever .
Now a new drug comes along , and not only are parents told they should embrace this new vaccine for their young daughters , but it 's also part of the set of routine vaccines that doctors are strongly encouraged to give their patients .
Merck says the drug has been safely tested for girls and women between the ages of 9 and 26 .
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that girls get the vaccine at age 11 or 12 .
Ault explains why youth is key .
Human papillomavirus is sexually transmitted , " so one of the advantages of giving it to adolescents is that they are unlikely to have been sexually active , so they will not have been exposed to the virus before getting the vaccine . "
Another reason to do this early , Ault points out , is that " our immune system is a lot better when we are 11 than when we are , say , at 22 . "
Ault also suggests that parents could use this experience to teach their children about sex and , even more important , about the realities of life , such as sexually transmitted diseases and unwanted pregnancies .
These arguments are n't convincing to some parents , the ones that are choosing not to have their daughters vaccinated .
There are several reasons for doing this , including religious beliefs .
Some faith - based groups feel the vaccine is inviting their young daughters to become sexually active .
Others believe the drug is just too risky .
CDC spokesman Curtis Allen says the vaccine is constantly being monitored by a joint CDC / FDA hotline .
Parents , patients and physicians can call the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System , or VAERS , to report any adverse reaction to the vaccine .
Through a Freedom of Information Act petition , the conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch got records from VAERS that showed three deaths in girls who'd had the vaccine in March - April 2007 and over 1,600 adverse reactions reported from June 2006 to April 2007 .
All said the response came after getting the HPV vaccine .
Allen cautions restraint in considering the reports .
" Most of these reactions were minor , " he said , and the deaths " were linked to circumstances not related to the vaccine . "
The CDC and the FDA are constantly monitoring the VAERS hotline and wo n't hesitate to act should they see any dangerous trends due to the HPV vaccine , he said .
The vaccine does have some known side effects .
Ault has seen his share .
" I certainly hear from women who get the vaccine that it 's painful , and I think some dizziness has been reported . "

In fact , fainting has been added to the list of potential side effects to watch for .
Allen says doctors are now recommending that girls stay in their doctor 's office for a short period after they get the injection for just that reason .
Three injections are necessary to get the full benefit of the vaccine .
The shots need to be administered over a six - month period and at this stage are guaranteed to work for at least five years .
All of this information leaves me confused .
Frankly , I 'm not really sure I have won myself over when it comes to the " shot or no shot " decision for my daughters .
However , in the back of my mind , I hear the words a father spoke when he thought about not giving the vaccine to his still - young daughter .
He said , " How am I going to be able to turn to my daughter when she 's older and tell her , ' When you were younger , I had the chance of making sure you never got a certain type of cancer , and I decided not to do it ' ? "
That 's an emotional minefield I truly do n't think I 'm emotionally equipped to walk through .

Peter Yarrow , 69 , the founder of Peter , Paul and Mary who composed and performed the group ’s famous song , “ Puff the Magic Dragon ” insists that it is not an ode to marijuana smoking .
The long assumed folklore that the lyrics to “ Puff the Magic Dragon ” refers to smoking marijuana has been debunked by the co-author himself .
The song makes reference to “ paper dragon ” ( draggin ) and speaks of “ travelling along t cherry lane ” which “ cherry ” is often used as a term for the burning end of a joint .
Quotes Yarrow :
“ No , ” Yarrow told Reuters recently .
“ Even if I had had the intention of writing a song about drugs … I was 20 years old at Cornell in 1959 when it was written and I was so square at that time .
…
Drugs had not emerged then . ”
But , Pete , what about those lyrics ?
Little Jackie Paper loved that rascal Puff / and brought him strings and sealing wax and other fancy stuff .
Oh .
Was n’t that less about Puff and more about , you know , puffing ?
Nope , says Yarrow .
So , what is it about ?
“ The innocence of a lost childhood . ”
Conspiracy theory :
My thoughts is that the author wants to continue the controversy , thus keeping interest in the song , which translates into more residual income .
Additionally , if he can maintain the ‘ innocence ’ of the song , theres potential for future marketing for additional projects aimed towards children ( like a major motion picture adaptation ) which would be more plausible with mainstream media giants if the song was n’t associated with drugs .
Lyrics :
I have come home from a long stay in Mexico to find - because of the presidential campaign , and especially because of the Obama - Clinton race for the Democratic nomination - a new country existing alongside the old .
On any given day we , collectively , become the goddess of the three directions and can look back into the past , look at ourselves just where we are , and take a glance , as well , into the future .
It is a space with which I am familiar .
When I joined the freedom movement in Mississippi in my early 20s , it was to come to the aid of sharecroppers , like my parents , who had been thrown off the land they 'd always known - the plantations - because they attempted to exercise their " democratic " right to vote .
I wish I could say white women treated me and other black people a lot better than the men did , but I cannot .
It seemed to me then , and it seems to me now , that white women have copied all too often the behaviour of their fathers and their brothers .
In the south , especially in Mississippi , and before that , when I worked to register voters in Georgia , the broken bottles thrown at my head were gender - free .
I made my first white women friends in college ; they loved me and were loyal to our friendship , but I understood , as they did , that they were white women and that whiteness mattered .
I am a supporter of Barack Obama because I believe he is the right person to lead the United States at this time .
He offers a rare opportunity for the country and the world to do better .
It is a deep sadness to me that many of my feminist white women friends cannot see him , cannot hear the fresh choices toward movement he offers .
That they can believe that millions of Americans choose Obama over Clinton only because he is a man , and black , feels tragic to me .
When I have supported white people , it was because I thought them the best to do the job .
If Obama were in any sense mediocre , he would be forgotten by now .
He is , in fact , a remarkable human being , not perfect but humanly stunning , like King was and like Mandela is .
He is the change America has been trying desperately and for centuries to hide , ignore , kill .
The change it must have if we are to convince the rest of the world that we care about people other than our ( white ) selves .
True to my inner goddess of the three directions , however , this does not mean I agree with everything Obama stands for .
We differ on important points , probably because I am older ; I am a woman and person of three colours ( African , Native American , European ) ; I was raised in the south ; and , when I look at the world after 64 years of life , there is not one person I wish to see suffer .
I want a grown - up attitude to Cuba , for instance , a country and people I love .
I want an end to the war immediately , and I want the soldiers to be encouraged to destroy their weapons and drive themselves out of Iraq .
I want the Israeli government to be made accountable for its behaviour to the Palestinians , and I want the people of the US to cease acting as if they do n't understand what is going on .
But most of all I want someone with the confidence to talk to anyone , " enemy " or " friend " , and this Obama has shown he can do .
It is hard to relate what it feels like to see Mrs Clinton ( I wish she felt self - assured enough to use her own name ) referred to as " a woman " while Barack Obama is always referred to as " a black man " .
One would think she is just any woman , but she is not .
She carries all the history of white womanhood in the US in her person ; it would be a miracle if we , and the world , did not react to this fact .
How dishonest it is , to try to make her innocent of her racial inheritance .
I can easily imagine Obama sitting down and talking to any leader - or any person - in the world , with no baggage of past servitude or race supremacy to mar their talks .
I cannot see the same scenario with Clinton , who would drag into 21st - century US leadership the same image of white privilege and distance from others ' lives that has so marred the country 's contacts with the rest of the world .
But because Clinton is a woman and may be very good at what she does , many people ( some in my own family ) originally favoured her .
I understand this , almost .
It is because there is little memory , apparently , of the foundational inequities that still plague people of colour and poor whites .
When I offered the word " womanism " many years ago , it was to give us a tool to use , as feminist women of colour , in times like these .
These are the moments we can see clearly , and must honour devotedly , our singular path as women of colour in the US .
We are not white women , and this truth has been ground into us for centuries .
But neither are we inclined to follow a black person , man or woman , unless they demonstrate considerable courage , intelligence , compassion and substance .
We have come a long way , sisters , and we are up to the challenges of our time , one of which is to build alliances based not on race , ethnicity , colour , nationality , sexual preference or gender , but on truth .
Even if Obama becomes president , our country is in such ruin it may be beyond his power to lead us to rehabilitation .
If he is elected , however , we must , as citizens of the planet , insist on helping him do the best job that can be done ; more , we must insist that he demand this of us .
And remember , as poet June Jordan and Sweet Honey in the Rock never tired of telling us :
We are the ones we have been waiting for .

At this very moment there breathing in the world nearly ten thousand million .
That is a respectable figure
How many know ?
Now take into account also the previous generations since the beginning of human history .
How many of them could mention ?
Or if you want , how many of them have even been recorded in the books ?
But the most interesting of this is finding a clarification for such omission .
It was not because they lacked the talent to be relevant .
In fact , right now there are perhaps hundreds of thousands if not millions of people with great potential .
They will die without passing into history .
Solo will be remembered by people close that when I die they will take their memories to eternal silence .
And you , of course , never know them .
Life is clear , no matter how smart someone is , how capable , how talented , how brave .
Does not represent anything mankind until the very moment you do something relevant .
The greatest superman , if any , would be ignored .
And it would be forever unless they act and do something recognizable .
Because there are no heroes without their exploits .
Today prevailing confusion and many ignore that reality .
Strongly want to stand out .
And they try to do it , but best enjoyed preparing for the triumph to triumph .
Some spend most of his life loving themselves , perfecting .
Remain strong programs of study , training , hypnosis , therapies , diets ...
They do not want to know about them or anything outside of history or geography , or arts , or science .
Maybe themselves remarkable achievement , which in itself is completely irrelevant , but nothing more .
They are people trying to be a strong resemblance to the heroes and their exploits .
And for the record that there are heroes of all kinds .
Some are at work , at home , in the study , friendship love .
But these people believe strongly that matter how you dress or what the character eats appreciate .
And do not realize that it really is distinctive is what someone can do .
I 'm talking about one of the causes that truncates the bright future of many people .
In many , perhaps like you , have great potential .
Talent only yours do not help anyone and that is why it is irrelevant that you have .
I 'm talking about self - absorption , the kind that wastes the precious resource of time .
It makes people want to stand out through narcissism .
But there is no better than another narcissistic narcissistic .
They spend all their effort in themselves as they read are written for personal growth .
All that talk about how to achieve success .
Unfortunately most of these texts only told they have to prepare .
And intends to tell how .
But these texts do not say that success is the son of the action .
And not just any action but one that has a significant effect for others , not merely for them .
nicamente this is how someone becomes genuinely important .
It is when their activity , their behavior , their projects are relevant to several or many people .
And it is not only for himself .
Can be important to condition your ideas reach implemented .
And with that , others may receive some benefit .
In other words , transcendence does not come with spiritual perfection , physically or otherwise .
The only true transcendence is achieved to be useful .

Genetically engineered rice plants that resist the uptake of toxic metals could boost production and ease the shortage of this staple crop in Asia , India and Bangladesh , where irrigation with contaminated groundwater has created soils with toxic levels of arsenic .
More than 80 percent of the world ’s population depends on rice as a staple food , but production is dropping in the rice paddies of Bangladesh , parts of India and South and East Asia due to toxic levels of arsenic in the topsoil .
Om Parkash of the University of Massachusetts Amherst leads a research team that uses genetic engineering to produce rice plants that block the uptake of arsenic , which could increase production of this valuable crop and provide safer food supplies for millions .
“ By increasing the activity of certain genes , we can create strains of rice that are highly resistant to arsenic and other toxic metals , ” says Parkash , a professor of plant , soil and insect sciences .
“ Rice plants modified in this way accumulate several - fold less arsenic in their above - ground tissues , and produce six to seven times more biomass , making the rice safer to eat and more productive . ”
This could help alleviate the current world - wide rice shortage .
Deep tube wells installed to provide drinking water in Bangladesh and other countries are producing water with naturally occurring levels of arsenic that greatly exceed safe limits in drinking water .
Groundwater is then being used to irrigate rice paddies , and this irrigation is causing a buildup of arsenic in topsoils that is toxic to the rice plants , reducing the amount of rice that can be produced in a given area .
According to Parkash , arsenic builds up in all parts of the plant , including the rice grains used for food , creating health problems in hundreds of thousands of people , including several forms of cancer .
Arsenic is also present in the rice straw used as animal fodder , causing arsenic to enter the food chain in dairy products and meat , and affecting the health of animals .
“ Already on the Indian subcontinent , particularly in Bangladesh and West Bengal , there are more than 300,000 people who have developed cancer from arsenic poisoning by drinking contaminated water and eating contaminated food , ” says Parkash .
“ The World Health Organization has dubbed this one of the major environmental disasters in human history . ”
Parkash is currently working with the UMass Amherst Office of Commercial Ventures and Intellectual Property and several interested companies to bring this technology to the marketplace .
“ Basically , the companies will use our gene constructs in new or existing rice lines , producing hybrid rice that will go through the cultivation and seed production stage , ” says Parkash .
“ Then the new strains of rice will be commercialized and brought to market . ”
Parkash ’s research is funded through the Massachusetts Technology Transfer Center from the Office of the President of the University of Massachusetts .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- A top Michigan Democrat expressed frustration Wednesday with Sen. Barack Obama for not embracing a plan to conduct a revote of the state 's Democratic primary .
" The road to a Democratic White House goes through Michigan and Florida , " Sen. Hillary Clinton says .
The source 's comments come the same day Sen .
Hillary Clinton accused her rival for the Democratic presidential nomination of being " un-American " for not backing plans to hold a revote in the Michigan and Florida primaries -- a charge Obama rejects .
Lawmakers in Michigan faced mounting pressure Wednesday to come up with an agreement before the legislature adjourns Thursday for a two - week recess .
" The Obama people are blocking it in the Legislature , " the Democratic source tells CNN .
The source also says the group has repeatedly and unsuccessfully reached out to the campaign for input and cooperation .
The source says that Obama 's campaign has been asked to craft an alternative or to meet with the Clinton campaign to work out an acceptable compromise , but that those requests have been met with silence .
But in an exclusive interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper on Wednesday , the Illinois senator hit back at Clinton 's claims that he is standing in the way of revotes in Florida and Michigan .
" Sen . Clinton , I have to say on this , has been completely disingenuous .
She said , when she was still trying to compete with the votes in Iowa and New Hampshire , that Michigan and Florida would n't count , " he said .
" Then , as soon as she got into trouble politically and it looked like she would have no prospects of winning the nomination without having them count , suddenly she 's extraordinarily concerned with the voters there . "
" I understand the politics of it , but let 's be clear that it 's politics , " he added .
" I want the Michigan delegation and the Florida delegation to be seated .
And however the Democratic National Committee determines we can get that done , I 'm happy to abide by those rules . "
The Clinton campaign has been increasing its criticism of Obama , even challenging the Illinois senator to back the seating of a full Michigan delegation .
" Sen . Obama speaks passionately on the trail about empowering American people .
Today , I am urging him to match those words with actions to make sure people of Michigan and Florida have a voice and a vote in this election , " Clinton said at a campaign rally in Detroit , Michigan , on Wednesday .
" This is a crucial test [ for Obama ] -- does he mean what he says or not ? "
Michigan and Florida held primaries in January , but the national party stripped them of their delegates for scheduling their contests too early .
Michigan has 157 Democratic delegates at stake , and Florida has 211 .
Florida has nixed the idea of a revote , but a proposal for a June 3 election in Michigan is under consideration .
Looking ahead to the general election , Clinton said ignoring the votes in Michigan and Florida would be a " grave mistake . "
" The road to a Democratic White House goes through Michigan and Florida , and if Democrats send the message that we do n't care about your votes , I 'm sure John McCain and the Republicans would be happy to have them , " she said .
Clinton , who was the only main contender on the ballot in Michigan , won with 55 percent of the vote .
Some 40 percent of Democrats in the state filed ballots declaring themselves " uncommitted . "
After the Democratic National Committee 's decision , Obama was among the Democratic presidential contenders who had their names taken off Michigan 's ballot .
" When others made the decision to remove their names from the ballot , I did n't because I believed your voices and your votes should count , " Clinton said .
Michigan Democratic leaders want their delegates seated , but the party has been unable to reach a consensus on how to handle them .
Michigan Sen. Carl Levin , who has been a major proponent of a new primary vote , told CNN on Wednesday that his group of four unaligned Michigan politicians was hopeful that legislators would vote on the plan Wednesday evening or Thursday , which would allow the delegation to be seated " without a floor fight and without a credentials fight . "
But Michigan state Sen. Tupac Hunter , a major Obama supporter , says an " overwhelming majority " of members who support both candidates " find something or the other wrong with it and cannot support it in its current form .
A new vote , he added , " does not look likely . "
" From where I sit , there are no floating pieces to this , " said Hunter -- nothing that can be changed that would n't require a major alteration or abandonment of the current proposal .
" I 'm not sure how feasible it is at this point .
...
There 's nothing I 've seen or heard that would lead me to believe that there 's going to be an agreement . "
He called on DNC Chairman Howard Dean to step in immediately and broker a compromise , to help avoid a " chaotic convention . "
" There 's a lot of hot rhetoric out there .
Sen. Obama and Sen. Clinton , they 're in the throes of a campaign , we understand that , " he said .
" But the DNC needs to come in and calm the storm . "
On Tuesday , Obama campaign spokesman Tommy Vietor said , " The Clinton campaign favors whatever they think will benefit them . "
Shortly before Clinton 's speech , the Obama camp released a letter outlining concerns it had with a potential revote in Michigan .
" There are such questions , and they are serious both in nature and in their potential , if not likely , impact on the June election proposal , " Obama counsel Robert F. Bauer said in the letter .
One of the concerns listed was voter disqualification .
Michigan voters wanting to cast ballots in the new primary would have to identify themselves as Democrats and certify that they did n't vote in the state 's Republican primary in January .
Michigan usually does not require party identification in primary elections .
Some say this requirement is unfair to Democrats who voted in the Republican contest , knowing their party 's primary was invalid .
A memo from the Clinton camp countered this argument , saying Obama can't argue that supporters participated in the GOP primary instead of the Democratic one because " the Obama campaign 's allies in Michigan organized an effort to get people in Michigan to vote for ' uncommitted ' in the Democratic primary . "
The Clinton camp also pointed out that Obama agreed to comply with DNC rules , which prohibit crossover voting .
The Obama memo also questioned whether the revote proposal could be cleared in a timely manner , without putting too much strain on election preparations and possibly leading to time - consuming litigation .
The draft proposal under consideration in Michigan calls for a new Democratic primary on June 3 , to be paid for with private money .
The state Legislature would have to approve that plan .
The DNC issued a statement Wednesday saying the proposal meets the basic requirements of the national party 's delegate selection rules .
State Senate Majority Leader Mike Bishop , a Republican , has said he will not give his support to any plan that does not have the consent of all the parties involved , including both presidential campaigns .
Neither Clinton nor Obama may get enough delegates -- 2,024 -- to clinch the nomination before the national convention in August .
Clinton is trailing Obama in delegates -- 1,479 to 1,621 .

This is part two of an ongoing series about Rubinius :
Rubinius for the Layman , Part 1 : Rubies All the Way Down
Rubinius for the Layman , Part 2 : How Rubinius is Friendly
In this shorter second installment , I ’ll present the ways in which Rubinius will be friendly to your multiple personalities :
you , the programmer ;
you , the ( potential ) contributor .
Rubinius is programmer - friendly
Backtraces
The first reason why I consider Rubinius more programmer - friendly is the better backtraces .
I ’ll show some examples run from each interpreter ’s interactive console .
Take the following piece of buggy code .
Notice the nil at the end of the array .
ary =[ ' bob ' , ' mom ' , nil ] .inject ( [ ] )
{ |result , element| result << element.to_sym}
With MRI you get the following :
NoMethodError : undefined method `to_sym ' for nil : NilClass from ( irb ) : 5 from ( irb ) : 5 : in `inject ' from ( irb ) : 5 : in `each ' from ( irb ) : 5 : in `inject ' from ( irb ) :
5
Ok , we have basic information on all the method calls that led to the NoMethodError .
Rubinius goes a step further , however :
NoMethodError : No method ' to_sym ' on an instance of NilClass .
from Kernel( NilClass ) #to_sym ( method_missing_cv ) at kernel / core / kernel.rb:606 from Object #irb_binding {} at ( irb ) : 4 from Enumerable ( Array ) # inject {} at kernel / core / enumerable .rb:375 from Array #each at kernel / core / array.rb:573 from Enumerable ( Array ) # inject at kernel / core / enumerable .rb:371 from Object #irb_binding {} at ( irb ) : 4
The backtrace tells me in which module each method on the stack was defined !
Q : How awesome is that ?
A : Very !
I ’m almost looking forward to debugging buggy mixins or method chains .
Are n’t you ?
These backtraces will definitely come in handy when debugging in situations where a lot of magic is happening behind the scenes .
Bring back the horse !
There ’s another interesting detail about the backtraces .
Remember what language Rubinius is written in ?
Heh .
The backtraces Rubinius generates go deeper .
Say we have another piece of buggy code :
s = ' ahh ' s [ 1 ] = nil
MRI :
TypeError : can't convert nil into String from ( irb ) : 5 : in ` [ ] = ' from ( irb ) :
5
Rubinius :
TypeError : Coercion error : nil.to_str =>

Not only is the message more descriptive , but as you can see , we can see deeper into the interpreter ’s inner workings .
The argument could be made that this could lead to noisier backtraces .
On one hand it ’s true that adding 5 lines to a 30 + lines backtrace generated in a Rails unit test will rarely help .
On the other hand , all this additional information may sometimes help finding subtle bugs ( in user code or in Rubinius ) or figure out that our use of a feature is not quite correct .
I say the additional information is very welcome .
And to help keep the information overload in check , let ’s get off our asses and use the quiet_backtrace gem by James Golick and Dan Croak .
The real Rubinius backtraces
It gets even better .
The previous examples were only run in irb .
So the additionnal information was getting squeezed in IRB ’s exception formatting .
Say I save both pieces of buggy code to 1.rb and 2.rb .
You ’ll notice too that I split program 2 in 2.rb and / lib / 2.rb ( I plan on making it a gem ) .
Here ’s in full colored glory the insults Rubinius will throw back at me :

Holy f**** sh Batman !
How centering the lines makes a difference !
To the left is the logical location : the class / module and the method name .
To the right is just the necessary information about the physical location .
Notice the paths .
They only contain what you need i.e. the relative path to execution – relative to the VM for Rubinius code , and relative to the execution root of my glorious code .
Do n’t tell anyone , but I think I ’ll intentionally put in bugs at work .
Just to see these in the logs !
Too bad our logs do n’t support coloring .
Rubinius is contributor - friendly
Commit access
The Rubinius project is friendly for the programmer who uses it .
But the project itself is also friendly to potential contributors .
They currently have a policy called the free - flowing commit bit .
This policy says the following :
Anyone who submits a patch which is accepted is granted commit access .
In case you missed it , here it is again :
Anyone who submits a patch which is accepted is granted commit access .
This is not crazy talk .
The patch can be as simple as you want .
A correction to documentation or a spec for the behavior of a Ruby class not behaving properly under Rubinius .
Any form of submission is admissible : a pastie , a ticket prepended with [ PATCH ] on lighthouse , or any other traditional way ( emails , ransom notes etc . )
Of course these methods are only temporary , since you ’re going to get commit access afterwards .
The idea in being so liberal with commit access is to put the barrier to contribution as low as possible .
This way , when your commit bit is set , you ’re going to be tempted to help more .
And your next contribution is going to be so much easier to submit .
A masterful adaptation of the timeless ‘ gateway drug ’ style of recruiting , really .
Get them hooked with as little friction as possible .
Then let them , uhhh , flourish in the wonderful world they just discovered .
How ’s that for being contributor - friendly ?
This may not last forever , I guess .
So hurry up and submit a patch ! ;-)
The naysayers might once again intervene to remind us that this is n’t going to scale .
Well it ’s every open source project ’s dream to have too many contributors .
The community and the team will adapt in time .
The fact that Rubinius is hosted with Git also gives the team much more flexibility to try different committing strategies , or simply gives more power to recover from mistakes from newcomers .
To really have a better understanding of Evan ’s vision of the Rubinius community , I highly recommend watching the video of his presentation at MountainWest RubyConf .
The presentation ’s content is really not the same as the other presentation mentioned in my first article .
Both are really worth it .
Conclusion
That ’s it for now , folks .
This is how much Rubinius will be friendly to you .
Delicious stacktraces and a very welcoming project .
A project ready to give you commit access if you submit anything good : a spec , some doc , or just a plain ol ’ bug fix .
Stay tuned for the next installment , in which I ’ll start covering a few mildly technical bits of Rubinius .
Unless I change my mind and decide to tackle another aspect of Rubinius .
A few references :
This is a hypothetical question to see if our notions of patriotism have changed since I was a kid .
Suppose the draft is reinstituted because there are n’t enough volunteers to fight a hypothetical unpopular war that does n’t seem to directly threaten the homeland .
Now suppose an individual gets drafted , and his profile is such that the odds of being in combat on the ground are very high .
And imagine that this kid is a sensitive type of person who knows that an experience like that will likely give him mental problems for the rest of his life even if he is not wounded .
Some people think , correctly , that they are mentally strong and could come through a war okay if they do n’t get physically injured .
But others know with a high degree of certainty that experiencing the horrors of war would mentally cripple them for life .
So here ’s the question .
If a person is relatively certain that going to war will end his ability to enjoy the rest of his life , one way or another , and the war does not present a plausible threat to the homeland , is such a person unpatriotic for dodging the draft to save himself ?
The obvious answer is yes , he is unpatriotic .
If your country calls on you , you need to go .
End of story .
On the other hand , what is the point of a being patriotic to a country that intends to kill you for its own marginal benefit ?
Such a country would be your natural enemy , not your friend , so any question of patriotism would be nonsense in this particular situation .
Is the draft dodger in this hypothetical situation unpatriotic or simply sensible ?
Just last year , we showed you the concept i- Snake medical robot , and now a different team actually has a similar device for real : the CardioArm .
This little robo-tentacle is being developed partly at Carnegie Mellon University , and is apparently the most flexible endoscope ever that follows its own camera - head in a snake - like way through your innards .
Since it enters the body through a single incision , it 's much less traumatic for the patient : minimally invasive surgery is clearly the way ahead .
Advertisement
Its snake / tentacle body is designed to perform cardiac surgery without damaging other tissue on the way in to its destination .
Currently their smallest prototype is 12 inches long and just 0.47 across , with 102 degrees of freedom and is joystick - steered by a surgeon .
Successful cardiovascular operations have been carried out using CardioArm on cadavers and pigs , and more extensive human trials are upcoming .
Advertisement
It 's a technology suited to many different surgeries , but not until it 's a tad smaller : ultimately the team plan to miniaturize it to the point that it can get in via a vein .
That 's sending the biggest shivers down my spine , I can tell you .

How Not to Save Housing
WASHINGTON --
In politics , it is imperative to be seen as " doing good . "
The present housing crisis is a case in point , as Congress now seems increasingly intent on aiding millions of homeowners who can't easily pay their mortgages and may face foreclosure .
This sort of rescue looks good , even though it is a bad idea and might perversely delay the housing recovery .
No reasonable person takes pleasure from seeing people lose their homes , and Congress is understandably upset .
Estimates of defaults in 2008 run up to 2 million .
If realized , that would be roughly twice the 2006 level and about 2.7 percent of the nation 's 75 million owner - occupied homes .
It would be the highest rate since World War II but well below much higher rates during the Great Depression , says economist Kenneth Snowden of the University of North Carolina at Greensboro .
The best - known congressional proposal comes from Rep. Barney Frank , D - Mass. , chairman of the House Financial Services Committee .
( The Bush administration is reportedly considering a similar plan . )
It would authorize the Federal Housing Administration ( FHA ) to guarantee $ 300 billion of new home loans to strapped homeowners , allowing them to refinance their existing mortgages at lower rates and lower outstanding amounts .
Under it , homeowners who borrowed from Jan. 1 , 2005 , to July 1 , 2007 , would be eligible for new loans if their monthly payments of interest and principal exceeded 40 percent of their income , well above a more prudent level of 30 percent .
Existing lenders would have to take a sizable write - down to qualify for having their loans repaid by the government .
The FHA would pay the existing lender no more than 85 percent of the property 's present appraised value ; the FHA would then charge the homeowner for a loan at 90 percent of the appraised value .
The extra 5 percent is a cushion against losses .
( Example : A $ 200,000 home with a 100 percent mortgage has already declined 10 percent to $ 180,000 .
The FHA loan repays the existing lender 85 percent of that , about $ 153,000 .
The existing homeowner 's new loan is at 90 percent of that , or $ 162,000 . )
Everyone wins from this arrangement , say its supporters .
Homeowners -- some victims of deceptive lending practices -- stay in their houses .
Neighborhoods do n't suffer the potential blight of numerous foreclosures .
Housing prices do n't go into a free fall , depressed by an avalanche of foreclosures .
Although lenders take a loss , the losses are lower than they would be if homes went into foreclosure .
That 's a costly and lengthy process that could involve losses of 50 percent or more .
The Frank proposal and others like it put politicians on the barricades , trying to protect needy homeowners .
The imagery is flattering .
But there are two glaring problems : one moral , the other economic .
About 50 million homeowners have mortgages .
Who would n't like the government to cut their monthly payments by 20 percent or 30 percent ?
But Frank 's plan reserves that privilege for an estimated 1 million to 2 million homeowners who are the weakest and most careless borrowers .
With the FHA now authorized to lend up to $ 729,750 in high - cost areas , some beneficiaries could be fairly wealthy .
By contrast , people who made larger down payments or kept their monthly payments at manageable levels would be made relatively worse off .
Government punishes prudence and rewards irresponsibility .
Inevitably , there would be resentment and pressures to extend relief to other " needy " homeowners .
The justification is to prevent an uncontrolled collapse of home prices that would inflict more losses on lenders -- aggravating the " credit crunch " -- and postpone a revival in home buying and building .
This gets the economics backwards .
From 2000 to 2006 , home prices rose by 50 percent or more by various measures .
Housing affordability deteriorated , with home buying sustained only by a parallel deterioration of lending standards .
With credit standards now tightened , home prices should fall to bring buyers back into the market and to reassure lenders that they 're not lending on inflated properties .
If rescuing distressed homeowners delays this process , the aid and comfort that government gives some individuals will be offset by the adverse effects on would - be homebuyers and overall housing construction .
Of course , there are other ways for the economy to come to terms with today 's high housing prices : a general inflation , which would lift nominal ( but not " real " ) incomes ; or mass subsidies for home buying .
Neither is desirable .
None of this means that lenders and borrowers should n't voluntarily agree to loan modifications that serve the interests of both .
Foreclosure is a bad place for most creditors or debtors .
Although the process is messy , promising to lubricate it with massive federal assistance may retard it as both wait to see if they can get a better deal from Washington , which would then assume the risk for future losses .
Even as she continues her longshot presidential bid , Hillary Rodham Clinton faces a political rift in New York , where black leaders say her standing has dropped due to racially charged comments by her and her husband during the campaign .
African American elected officials and clerics based in New York City say Clinton will need to defuse resentment over the campaign ’s racial overtones if she returns to New York as U.S. senator .
State Sen. Bill Perkins , who represents Harlem , said constituents recently phoned him because they wanted to demonstrate outside Bill Clinton ’s Harlem office against comments by the former president .
Michael Benjamin , a state assemblyman who represents parts of the Bronx , said his wife removed a photograph of Bill Clinton from her office wall -- an expression of the misgivings that some black New Yorkers feel .

Assemblyman Karim Camara of Brooklyn contributed $ 500 to Hillary Clinton ’s Senate reelection campaign in 2006 and described Bill Clinton as a political hero .
He said : “ Once the campaign is over there has to be a lot of work to heal the wounds .
She needs to go back to the black churches she visited in the course of her campaign and have a frank conversation about who she is and how much the support of the black community means .
There would not have been a first Clinton presidency in 1992 if not for the African American community . ”
Many of the officials back the presidential bid of Illinois Sen.
Barack Obama , Clinton ’s rival for the Democratic nomination , though they say they have long supported the Clintons , defending him in the past and supporting her Senate run .
Their sentiments reflect the peculiar arc of the 2008 campaign .
Black voters were once central to the Clinton family ’s political identity and base of support .
But that relationship has been strained by the emergence of a charismatic African American candidate who has been propelled by black voters .
“ The Clintons have their die - hard fans who would never abandon them , ” said Eric Adams , a state senator who represents Brooklyn .
“ But there are those New Yorkers who feel there was a lot of insult , slight and disrespect toward an African American candidate , and it translated as a slight to the African American community . ”

Clinton ’s campaign declined to comment .
In New York , she still enjoys the support of some high - profile black leaders .
U.S. Rep. Charles Rangel has endorsed Clinton , as has the state ’s first black governor , David Paterson .
But both men have been critical of her recently .
Rangel told reporters this month that her claim she has the support of white voters was “ the dumbest thing she could ever have said . ”
Clinton later agreed with that .
Paterson recently told a radio show he saw “ desperation ” in Clinton ’s effort to count in her favor disputed delegates from Michigan and Florida .
Clinton ’s dwindling chance of winning the nomination includes snagging as many Florida and Michigan delegates as possible .
As the campaign unfolded , both Clintons made comments that some black leaders deemed dismissive of Obama .
There was Bill Clinton ’s suggestion that Obama ’s victory in South Carolina carried no more weight than Jesse Jackson ’s success there in the 1980s .
Other sore points were Hillary Clinton ’s claim that she enjoys the support of “ hard - working Americans , white Americans ” and the credit she gave to President Lyndon Johnson -- rather than the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. -- on civil rights legislation .
Advertisement
“ There has been a consistent pattern of comments made by both Sen. Clinton and President Clinton from January until this moment that are deeply troubling to the African American community , ” said Assemblyman Hakeem Jeffries , whose district is in Brooklyn .
“ That will require meaningful reconciliation and discussion when Sen. Clinton returns to New York . ”
The Rev. Clinton Miller of Brown Memorial Baptist Church in Brooklyn said that any hurt feelings left by the campaign could be easily overcome .
“ There are wounds , but I do n’t think they necessarily have to be that deep , ” Miller said .
“ They ’re deep wounds for people who never liked Hillary in the first place . ”
He encouraged her to be more of a presence in the city ’s neighborhoods .
Advertisement
“ For her to heal those wounds , she would be well served either in public office or just in her private life by being herself and working toward those ideals that she ’s always espoused as a person . ”
African American leaders said she could repair frayed ties by visiting black churches , backing legislation that shows she is sensitive to conditions in black neighborhoods , and apologizing for comments she and her husband made that seemed to polarize voters and marginalize Obama .
“ She has a problem , ” said the Rev. Al Sharpton , a New York - based civil rights activist .
“ If she does n’t aggressively deal with the problem -- rather than sit in denial -- it will haunt her at home in her Senate race . ”
Clinton ’s Senate term ends in January 2013 .
Advertisement
Some Democrats have mentioned that she could run for governor of New York if she is n’t nominated for president .
That prospect unnerves some black leaders .
They said they did n’t want to see her challenge Paterson , who plans to run in 2010 .
With Paterson in the job , some black leaders want a definitive statement from Clinton that she would not subject him to a primary challenge -- and say they have n’t gotten it yet .
Benjamin said : “ I was pretty much appalled when supporters said one of her options was to run for governor .
We have a governor .
He ’s a black Democrat .
It ’s not wise for them to challenge a black Democrat for governor .
“ She should have come out and said a flat no , that folks were wrong , but I did not see that or hear that coming from her . ”

GUANTANAMO BAY U.S. NAVAL BASE , Cuba ( Reuters ) -
The self - described mastermind of the September 11 attacks on New York City and the Pentagon has been assigned a U.S. military lawyer to defend him in the Guantanamo war court , where he could face execution if convicted , The Miami Herald reported .

Navy Capt .
Prescott Prince was given orders on Tuesday to defend Pakistani prisoner Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , the newspaper said on its Web site .
Military officials at Guantanamo and at the Pentagon could not immediately confirm the report .
However , they previously had said Prince had joined the team of military lawyers who defend foreign captives facing war crimes charges in the U.S. military tribunals at the Guantanamo Bay naval base in Cuba .
Prince , 53 , is an attorney and naval reservist from Richmond , Virginia .
He recently served in Iraq , where he was a lawyer in the unit that oversaw detainee operations .
Mohammed , better known by his initials KSM , has said he planned every aspect of the September 11 attacks using hijacked airliners in 2001 .
In February , U.S. military prosecutors charged him and five other Guantanamo captives with counts that include murder , conspiring with al Qaeda and terrorism .
The charges list the names of 2,973 people killed when four hijacked passenger planes slammed into New York ’s World Trade Center , the Pentagon and a field in Pennsylvania .
Before Mohammed and the others can be tried , the charges and the potential death penalty still must be approved by a Pentagon official overseeing the Guantanamo war court , the first U.S. military tribunals since World War Two .
Under the rules for the Guantanamo court , military lawyers are ordered to put on a “ zealous ” defense for the accused .
But defendants can reject the lawyers and act as their own attorneys .
“ This man is alleged to have done some very bad things .
Personally I have faith in the American people to allow him to have a fair trial , ” Prince told the Herald .
But he said he did not feel a fair trial was possible in the Guantanamo court system designed to try foreign captives outside the regular U.S. civilian and military courts .
Mohammed ’s confession could be troublesome for the U.S. government if used as evidence because the CIA has admitted it subjected him to “ waterboarding ” -- an interrogation technique of simulated drowning that has been widely criticized as torture .
The rules of the court prohibit the use of evidence gained through torture , as does an international treaty the United States has signed .
But it is left up to the trial judge to determine what evidence can be introduced .
“ You start with the fact that you ’ve broken the rules -- a secret prison , torturing .
Waterboarding .
Harsh extreme techniques .
Using cruel , coercive techniques to extract information , ” said Prince .
“ I just do n’t see how you can give him a fair trial . ”

PAHRUMP , Nev. - Nicki Amouri hands her camera to a friend , throws her arm over another and smiles wide as she leans in for a shot with the monument her class came to visit .
It ’s a typical field trip memento — except that Amouri is in a brothel .
The monument is a fluffy , queen - sized bed in a Western - themed party room reserved for VIPs and big spenders .
Amouri was one of a dozen Randolph College students who toured the Chicken Ranch , a legal bordello in the desert 60 miles outside Las Vegas .
Thursday ’s class trip , which included seminars from the working girls , capped a course on American consumption and “ the ideas that consume us . ”
“ I think it ’s fascinating , this is fun for me , ” said Amouri , a junior at the private liberal arts school in Lynchburg , Va. , that until last year admitted only women .
“ Not many people get to do this . ”
Academic and media inquiries are daily occurrences at many of Nevada ’s 27 legal brothels .
Some shy away from the scrutiny , others , like the Chicken Ranch , welcome the publicity .
“ We ’re always open to trying to educate the public about legalized prostitution , ” said Chicken Ranch general manager Debbie Rivenburgh , who acknowledged this was the first class tour request she ’d received in 21 years .
The brothel tour was a natural fit for a class that tells students “ do n’t just study America — live it , ” said Julio Rodriguez , the director of the college ’s American Culture Program .
Each semester the course examines a strain of American culture and ends with a class trip .
Past destinations included post - Katrina New Orleans , Walt Disney World and the Civil Rights Memorial Center in Montgomery , Ala .
This year ’s focus on Nevada started with a professor ’s interest in water rights and conservation .
It grew to include discussions of the wedding and entertainment industries and , inevitably , prostitution .
Nevada is the only state where prostitution is legal .
Brothels are allowed in 10 Nevada counties , though not in Las Vegas .
As part of their research , students were assigned “ The Beauty Myth , ” by feminist author Naomi Wolf , “ Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas , ” by Hunter S. Thompson , and a “ 20/20 ″ episode on prostitution with Diane Sawyer , among other research , professors said .
“ We gave them all the option to either opt out or express reservations privately .
No one did , ” said Rodriguez , adding that he received no objections from parents or administrators .
Prostitutes at the Chicken Ranch had plenty of reservations .
Most do n’t jump at the chance to talk to strangers about what they do , Rivenburgh said .
They worry about friends or family finding out .
They know how others see them .
It can be uncomfortable .
“ Ninety - nine percent of the working girls will not participate .
Each woman ’s got her reason and her limitations , ” Rivenburgh said .
“ I could n’t have done better with the two that said yes , though . ”
Alexis , 38 , and Alicia , “ over 30 , ” sat on white folding chairs in front of the young , earnest women in the brothel ’s Victorian - style parlor , usually the setting for the “ lineup . ”
They would not give their last names .
The group took close notes as a handful of television cameras and reporters looked on .
A blonde in jeans and platform boots , Alexis talked about the job ’s flexibility and the free time it has allowed her to write a book about her life .
Alicia wore a black - and - white gingham nighty and a tattoo on her left breast that read “ Famous . ”
“ I enjoy giving back what some people do n’t get in their lives , as far as companionship , time , just the touch of a woman , ” she said .
The job allows her to take care of her mother and grandmother .
She ’s also in real estate .
The introductions gave way to questions .
Do you consider yourself a feminist ?
Alexis : “ Most women in this business wear the pants in the family . ”
Is there a certain look most men prefer ?
Alicia : Every man wants something different .
“ There ’s all different kinds of girls . ”
Why are n’t there brothels with male prostitutes ?
Rivenburgh : Former Hollywood Madame Heidi Fleiss is trying .
Do you still give a military discount ?
Rivenburgh : Yes .
What ’s the worst part ?
Alicia : “ Being confined , being cooped up .
I have to be here 24 hours a day . ”
With a tour and time to mingle , the students packed up gift bags containing a menu of services , a Chicken Ranch key chain and a brochure .
They had to get back to Las Vegas in time for a backstage tour of the risque revue “ Jubilee . ”
With any luck , they might get to interview the showgirls .

10 Greatest April Fool ’s Hoaxes Of All Time
Lost : A Theory on Time Travel

John McCain got unwanted attention recently when , during a visit to the Middle East , he said that Iran , a nation of Shiite Muslims , was providing aid and comfort to Al Qaeda in Iraq , a Sunni group .
His friend , Joe Lieberman , who was also on the trip , had to famously whisper in his ear to correct him .
This allowed McCain 's two Democratic rivals for the presidency , Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton to criticize McCain for his mistake , which came in the area that 's supposed to be in his wheelhouse : national security and foreign policy .
At today 's Senate Armed Services Committee hearing , McCain once again seemed to make a muddle of the whole Shiite - Al Qaeda thing .
It came in this exchange with Gen. David Petraeus :
MCCAIN : " There are numerous threats to security in Iraq and the future of Iraq .
Do you still view Al Qaeda in Iraq as a major threat ? "
PETRAEUS : " It is still a major threat , though it is certainly not as major a threat as it was , say , 15 months ago . "
MCCAIN : " Certainly not an obscure sect of the Shi'ites , all overall , or Sunnis or anybody else . "
Good thing he quickly threw Sunnis in there .
At least he did n't need Lieberman to bail him out this time .
McCain may want to work on this obvious weakness in his Iraq fund of knowledge .
Maybe flash cards would help .

Rep. Baron Hill , another superdelegate , has announced his support of Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama today .
Hill said , “ Some have advised me to be cautious , to wait and see which way the electoral winds may blow .
I confess that I have listened to those voices and been tempted by their reasoning .
But , the stakes are just too high .
We cannot continue to pursue the same politics of personal destruction we have engaged in for a generation , some never - ending “ groundhog day ” endlessly playing out the cultural wars of forty years ago . ”
Hill said Obama comments on Rev. Wright yesterday revealed strength of character , “ His comments regarding statements made by Reverend Wright showed me another aspect of Senator Obama ’s leadership – strength of character and commitment to our nation that transcends the personal .
One of the tests of a true leader is his ability and willingness to come to a new conclusion based on new events .
Senator Obama did just that yesterday . ”
Advertisements
His also mentioned his belief that Obama can bring about change , “ I believe Senator Obama has the capability to change the tone and tenor of politics in Washington .
I believe that he can and will work with both parties and elevate the level of public discourse .
Hoosiers are independent people who want to see civility and common - sense solutions implemented in Washington .
Like us , Senator Obama strives to put the good of the country before the good of a particular political party . ”
There are a couple of interesting points to be made about Rep .
Hill ’s endorsement .
First , it seems that many superdelegates watched how Obama dealt with the Rev. Wright flare up .
Wright has served one useful purpose .
His comments provided Obama with a tough personal decision .
Secondly , Hill is a member of the Blue Dog Coalition , which is a group of 47 moderate to conservative Democrats who are focused on finding the middle ground on issues .
Hill , and Rep. Chandler , who endorsed him yesterday , is not a liberal Democrat .
They are Democrats who are interested in bi-partisanship , and issues like the budget deficit .
These are the kind of endorsements that Hillary Clinton hoped to get , but are going to Obama because they believe that he can work better with Republicans .
Hill is Obama ’s 246th superdelegate , and the campaign is now 288 delegates short of the nomination .

The operator of two English language schools was charged Wednesday with running a scheme that allowed foreign nationals , including several Russian prostitutes , to fraudulently obtain student visas to enter and stay in the United States .
Bezhad “ Ben ” Zaman , 50 , of Beverly Hills , a naturalized U.S. citizen from Iran , was arrested by federal agents without incident in what investigators believe is the largest student visa fraud scheme ever staged on the West Coast , authorities said .
He was charged with seven counts of fraud and misuse of visa , one count of conspiring to money - launder and six counts of concealment for money laundering .
“ This flagrant violation of our immigration laws shows how greed can compromise our national security , ” U.S. Atty .
Thomas P. O’Brien said .
“ We welcome legitimate students who want to take advantage of educational opportunities in America .
We do not welcome so - called students who have no intention of studying and who simply want to exploit an unscrupulous business owner more interested in lining his pockets than following the law , ” O’Brien said .
Advertisement
Zaman runs Concord English Language Center and the International College for English Studies , both on Wilshire Boulevard .
He is suspected of helping ineligible foreign nationals fraudulently obtain student visas and keeping them enrolled in his schools even though they did not attend classes , authorities said .
The so - called F - 1 visas allow foreigners to remain in the country as long as they are studying full time at a federally approved school .
Both of Zaman ’s schools had received federal approval .
But investigators allege that as early as 1999 , Zaman had been charging foreign nationals several thousand dollars each to obtain student visas .
He allegedly told them that although they did not have to attend his schools , they would be reported to federal authorities if they stopped paying tuition .
Advertisement
On one occasion , Zaman allegedly charged a non-student $ 300 a month to keep her enrollment current , authorities said .
In another instance , a Thai national told agents that she paid $ 2,000 a year to obtain immigration status from International College even though she did not attend classes .

Consumers Falling Behind Utility Bills
Until these hundreds of thousands of laid - off Americans and home owners who have lost the roof over their heads can find work , they wo n't pump money into the economy .
Unemployment benefits coffers are being hit hard .
Not to worry , though .
Last week in a press conference , Bush crowed that the ' economic stimulus ' checks will boost the economy !
He forgot to tell the camera and the factually challenged media too ignorant to ask the right questions , that every one of those ' stimulus ' checks are debt .
There is no money in the U.S. Treasury .
Congress had to borrow every penny from the privately owned " Federal " Reserve ; the staggering interest will double the total " package . "
This is pure insanity , but Bush was n't finished .
This war criminal in the White House wants you to work your fingers to the bone today at your multiple jobs to fund $ 770 MILLION in global food aid .
There is NO authority in the U.S. Constitution for Congress to steal from the people 's purse to give away to the world , yet it will happen unless you get on the phone and call your congress critter and tell them , Hell no !
How can Congress approve this when there is NO money in the treasury , not to mention it is unlawful under the U.S. Constitution ?
If this abomination happens , Congress will simply write another hot check and force the interest onto your back , your children and grand babies .
When will enough be enough for you ?
Of course , all of the blame cannot be laid at Bush 's door step .
The cowards in Congress ( except Ron Paul and a few past congressmen who were willing to take on the FED , i.e. , Louis McFadden , Charles A Lindbergh , Sr. , Wright Patman ) are the ones to shoulder the blame .
It is their refusal to abolish the central bank and return to real constitutional money that has sunk America .
Yet , the masses continue to vote the same craven individuals back into office because that incumbent will continue stealing from the public treasury to appease the mobs .
There 's been a lot of talk on the Internet that people will take their check and buy garbage from the communist Chinese , which is true .
Another nail in our coffin .
Others think it would be a good idea for everyone to buy gold with their " rebate " check .
An excellent idea , but millions of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck with nothing left by payday .
This hot check from Congress will mean paying utilitiy bills , buying gas or food .
I spent about ten minutes reading stories from average Americans and what they 're going to do with this windfall .
A good indicator of just how bad off people are .
Mark my words : the inflation you 're seeing is going to morph into hyper-inflation .
While you 're drowning , Bernanke will continue to make sure the banks are bailed out .
Last week , the smarmy , Neil Cavuto , ( FAUX News ) ended his program with news that the violent , sex filled Grand Theft Auto video game was going on sale that day .
Cost : $ 60 bux a pop with anticipated sales of 9 MILLION copies and since this was discretionary spending , maybe the economy is n't as bad as everyone thinks !
While uttering this nonsense , the screen showed a clerk swiping a credit card to pay for this trash .
( Grand Theft Auto IV review : Intense Violence , Blood , Strong Language , Strong Sexual Content , Partial Nudity , Use of Drugs and Alcohol . )
Debt is not prosperity .
When you have a full 1 /3rd of credit card holders defaulting , what you have are millions of people who have no disposable cash to even make minimal payments .
What they have is going to buy food and absolute necessities .
I have little respect for Ronald Reagan , but he was right about ' trickle down ' and the effect on the economy .
What you see above is killing this economy and that does n't include the massive costs the states are and will continue to incur as crime increases , the cost of funding the mobs and our elderly Americans ( in the tens of millions ) who have no health care , no retirement care set aside and basically depend on the state for their food , housing and medication .
I can't tell you what to do , but I 've known all of this was coming since 1991 when I ' woke up . '
I urge everyone : if you do n't have a plan for survival for you and your family - and do n't forget elderly parents - I hope you will make this a priority THIS WEEK .
Regular readers of my columns know I have been harping on this for years .
The time is here and now .
Remember Katrina ?
The government did n't fail .
The people were n't ready for disaster and the suffering was horrific .

While most people do n't like to think about it , we 're all one heart beat away from our trip to eternity .
I 'm not trying to encourage panic , but rather to hopefully get out the message that the time to make a plan and put it into action is now .
I know , summer is coming and everyone is tired , frustrated , stressed and would like to take some " down time . "
But , remember : you 're one heart beat away and no one knows when our Heavenly Father will call us from this earthly world .
Are you ready for that last heart beat , spiritually , first and foremost , and those you leave behind ?
Make the commitment for survival
Get prepared for any disruption in services ; natural disaster or civil unrest .
I do n't mean 5,000 cans of tuna socked away in the garage , but be prepared with food , water and medical supplies for at least one month as if there are no stores .
My mom remarked last month while I was visiting that she would stock up the freezer .
They 're seeing what I 've been preaching for almost two decades .
I told her , " Ma , the freezer is only good if you have power or a generator . "
We had a long talk while I made a list for her , including converting some of their assets into gold .
Believe it or not , after hounding her and my step father for years , they finally got their wills done ; they 're both over 80 years old .
Emotionally , it 's very hard , but I kept after them until they got things done and squared away .
Now , I 'll have to keep checking to make sure she 's getting her list finished .
Get your financial affairs in order .
I know it 's not much fun to get your will done and pick the place where your body will lie until the earth is no more , but I 'm sure most Americans caught a little of what happened when Anna Nichole Smith did n't get that next heart beat .
I do n't know what to call her profession , but the bottom line is that when she died , she left a massive mess from paternity of her newborn to an outdated will .
The media had a feeding frenzy , but to me it was pathetic .
My husband and I had our wills done as soon as we were married .
We did new ones three months ago to reflect some changes over almost 20 years and yeah , it was a pain .
We had to drive 100 miles to Dyess AFB .
Because my husband 's health is not good , travel is difficult for him , but we took care of our responsibility .
Our children and immediate family will not be left wondering what they 're supposed to do while trying to grieve .
It does n't matter what your financial status is , a simple will ( witnessed ) will save your loved ones a lot of misery and will take a huge burden off your shoulders .
Make a financial plan for now , five years from now and retirement .
No matter what happens over the next few years , and it's not going to be pretty on many levels , the patriots of today will prevail no matter how it unfolds .
Americans still need to make short and long term plans and goals .
Who is going to take care of you when you 're 64 , 74 ?
The state , your family or will you plan for care ?
How about helping your elderly parents ?
Social security has to be funded for those who need it , just like Medicare , but these mathematically bankrupt systems must be allowed to die a natural death because no matter how much phony " money " is pumped into them , they 're never going to be solvent .
Our future and retirement is our personal responsibility , not mother government .
Savings is the lowest in this country since the artificially created ' Great Depression . '
I know people want to save , but can't .
How can you when 40 % - 60 % of the fruits of your labor are being confiscated by city , county , state and federal governments , pushing us into poverty via taxes on everything under the sun ?
It will get worse as the corruption and stupidity continues by incumbents serving in all levels of government .
Change will not happen with the same players .
If you can , make a commitment to put aside something every payday into savings , even if it 's only $ 25.00 .
My parents generation and those before them saved .
Unfortunately , with all the temptations out there ( and the horrendous destruction caused by divorce ) , most Americans are not looking down the road , spending what they do n't have instead of paying attention to their obligation for the future .
As the baby boomer generation is now hitting retirement , too many have nothing left to show and the shock is just now beginning to set in .
How long before mother government raises the retirement age to 75 because of the mess they made ?
Buy Made in America .
Invest in America , not our enemies .
We the people have tremendous power , even as things worsen , to make our spending dollars count towards rebuilding this country .
We have to start by taking the time to buy from American companies who employ Americans and make the product on our soil .
Stop enriching our enemies like commie China .
Roger Simmermaker is a warrior in this area and he tells you how here .
You can also go to the Made in America section on my web site to find just about everything for you , the kids and your dog !
All made by we the people for America .
Stop the hemorrhaging via NAFTA and these other treasonous treaties .
Buy local .
Fruits , veggies , poultry , eggs - try to buy local .
Support our local farmers and ranchers .
Stop funding other countries while America dies .
Your local grocery chain will get the message and start making more domestic food products available or lose business .
I know people want to go play on the weekend , but most towns and even big metro areas like LA have farmers markets on the weekend .
Go get good , fresh food for your family grown here in our country .
Get healthy .
Get your family healthy and become less dependent on the health care system .
My next column will be , Do you have a plan ?
and it deals with activism and rumblings about martial law .
My mail box is full of mail everyday from Americans who are getting the message , want to know more and ask the question : what can I do ?
This column makes number 359 I 've written for NWVs since 2002 .
That does n't count the 900 files on my CD , most written by me .
Plus a year of columns for Worldnetdaily .
I 've written about all these government systems , the fraudulent ratification of the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Amendments and much more , but people who are just finding NWVs , see only one column and want more information .
The ' additional titles ' above this column will direct you to my archives .
Or , just type my name into a search engine with social security or income tax or federal reserve and dozens of columns will be presented .
I have learned from the best over almost two decades and sharing all this information is what my columns are about .
We all have to become activists instead of observers .
In my next column , I will help you get started and get associated with organizations and groups and why everyone must stop patronizing organizations like AARP who oppose abolishing the privately owned Federal Reserve .

So , I thought I ’d try something a little different today .
I thought I ’d wait until after the match to do the match report .
Or , to put it another way , I thought I ’d stay up drinking until 6 am this morning , stay at a friend ’s house , get home at 12 pm , and feel like utter shit today .
In true Arseblog style : * boik * .
Yeah , so , maybe not so different .
Apologies , ladies and gentlemen .
Anyway , the match has just finished and it looks like Arseblogger is our lucky charm .
He loves his lucky charms , so he does .
We were good today , and we should ’ve scored more .
I ’m absolutely made up for Gilberto scoring .
He ’s been the model pro this season ; he lost the captaincy , which I for one thought he was nailed on for ; he ’s lost his place to the Flamster ( FTLOG , STNDP ! ) .
But when he ’s been called on , he ’s done well , and his goal today was well deserved .
Well , played Bert .
I do n’t think he ’ll be around next season , but fair play to him .
But we were good all over the pitch .
Adebayor ’s goal was class , and Kolo ’s cross was inch perfect .
Adebayor ’s touch to set himself up was sublime , but Kolo ’s pass was n’t half bad either .
Hleb was tricky and smashed the ball into some cunt ’s balls , which was highly amusing .
Robin started looking like himself again , and even after a few heavy tackles , he managed to stay on the pitch , which was great .
And say it quietly , but Song was good at centre back , played out of position .
I swapped texts with Blogger who was at The Emirates today and said it looked on TV like Song was doing well , and he agreed , although he thought he was a bit suspect under the high ball .
There were one or two hairy moments , but overall he did well .
Clichy was …Clichy .
I just think he ’s awesome .
Jens did well too , for all it was he had to do .
One save in particular , even though the Reading player was offside , was excellent .
So , all in all , a good day at the office , and it ’s nice to see us playing like that * and * getting the result .
It would ’ve been nice to get the 5 - 0 I thought was possible at half time , but frankly , a win’s a win .
As for Richard Keys , fuck off you hairy handed monkey boy cunt .
Cesc : “ I really hope my future belongs to Arsenal ” .
Keys :
“ Is there a message in that ?
Is he going to go ? ” Really , fuck off .
And fuck off Redknapp too for talking some shit about Theo – another player I thought had a good game .
And that ’s your lot .
Apologies again for the late blog .
Fuck knows what I ’m going to talk about tomorrow now .
Some nonsense , no doubt .
Until tomorrow .
A POINT OF VIEW
By Tim Egan
The pledge of allegiance says ' One nation under God '
The US may be one of the most religious countries in the West but is it undergoing a period of doubt .
A few days ago , I attended a memorial service for a friend who died far too young , of throat cancer .
The service was held at a history museum , and it was packed - standing room only .
What was curious , initially , was the lack of any reference to religion .
My friend had left a final set of instructions : he wanted to be remembered first as a husband to his wife of more than 20 years , and second as a citizen of his city , and third as a lover of history .
During the tributes , there were many references to how the past can inform our decisions in the present .
There were nods to reason and friendship and love .
The closest anyone came to mentioning God or spirituality was when someone told the widow , as an aside , that you often visit the deceased through dreams - when they can appear at no particular prompting .
America seems to be experiencing an atheist moment
Hear Radio 4's A Point of View Even if the formal religion was absent , the habit of expressing a hope for spiritual optimism remains .
The secular funeral is still somewhat of a novelty , at least to me .
But it may be something that we see more and more of in the future - particularly on the West Coast , the most unchurched part of the United States .
It may be daring to say it but America seems to be experiencing an atheist moment .
Although " In God We Trust " was declared the national motto by an act of Congress more than 50 years ago and has been stamped on the currency for longer than that , some considerable doubt has developed of late .
If you look at the bestseller list over the last year , you 'll find a number of books on atheism - to the surprise of the publishing industry .
God has always moved in not - so - mysterious ways when it comes to the literary world .
He can sell books , especially ones that foretell an apocalyptic ending just around the corner .
The so - called Left Behind books , a series of novels envisioning the Rapture , when the good are separated from the evil in a fiery judgment day , sell in the millions .
They are not for the faint of faith .
Another genre , self - help books that invoke God for the sake of making money , losing weight or finding a date , have a permanent home on the bestseller list .
God is kept very busy with this segment of the market .
But until this year , there was thought to be little support - or audience - for tomes by the anti-religious .
Several books changed that .
Full - bore polemics
On the academic side , we have God : The Failed Hypothesis by Victor Stenger and Nothing : Something to Believe In by Nica Lalli .
The three most popular books are God is Not Great : How Religion Poisons Everything by the newly - Americanized Christopher Hitchens , The God Delusion by Richard Dawkins and Letter to a Christian Nation by Sam Harris .
Hitchens , the pied piper of non-believers
These bestsellers are not cursory academic surveys ; they are full - bore polemics against religion , challenging the very idea of God .
Hitchens , with his quick wit and his quiver of quotes from long - dead British luminaries which he carries over from his schoolboy days in England , seems to be having the most fun and the most effect .
You could call him the Pied Piper of non-believers .
He makes it a point to debate with a cleric in every city he visits , and is a frequent guest on conservative and religious radio stations .
The premise of his book is that while religion may have served people well in the age of ignorance , now that science can explain the world there is no reason to attribute the sun , the moon and forces like gravity to higher beings .
As he says , the nine - year - old knows more about the natural world now than the leading scholars of a thousand years ago .
What has rankled his critics most is his suggestion that religion is usually a force for bad .
More than anything , people without faith hate the description of them as empty or soulless
Believers point out that people of faith have been at the forefront of significant improvements in human rights and in caring for fellow humans over centuries - everything from abolition of slavery to the civil rights movement in this country , to church - led efforts to reduce starvation and disease in less - developed countries .
I ran into Hitchens not long ago at a book festival where he was jousting away and getting rich in the process .
He looked just as the New York Times Book Review had described him : " A village atheist standing in the square trying to pick arguments with the good citizens on their way to church . "
I asked Hitchens why he thought his book had such a sudden rise to the top of the bestseller charts when polls show that - at most - barely one - half - of - one - percent of Americans call themselves atheists .
He said that the polls were misleading .
There is a large and fast - growing segment of the population that is lapsed or well onto its way to atheism but is afraid to admit it .
" If you 're a lapsed Catholic , " Hitchens told me .
" You 're part of a very large and fast - growing group . "
Many of those people , of course , might be agnostic rather than atheist ?
Revulsion at zealots
More than anything , people without faith hate the description of them as empty or soulless .
They have long been singled out for a special kind of hell .
The constitution of the state of Texas , for example , allows discrimination against atheists in employment or jury duty - provisions that have been nullified by federal laws .
And even my mother used to lower her voice in the kind of whisper reserved for people with terminal brain cancer when she described a neighbour as .... an atheist .
Non-believers say they have also been aided by the revulsion of fair - minded Americans to the religious zealotry behind the September 11 attacks and the subsequent violence on behalf of radical Islam .
The latest round of atheism books point to countless wars , slaughters and massacres done in the name of My God is Better than Your God .
The 9/11 attacks got people thinking about what sort of God could be summoned for such awfulness .
Obama has talked about his faith Social critics , dating to at least de Tocqueville and Dickens , have always marvelled at the pure number of passionately religious people in this country .
Indeed , no Western democracy has so many devout churchgoers , by percentage , as the US .
On the face of it , the numbers do seem to indicate that the United States is a Christian nation , as politicians often say .
The latest surveys by the Pew Centre show that 76 % of the population - upwards of 230 million people - call themselves Christians .
Jews make up 1.3 % and Muslims are under one per cent - though fast - growing .
Atheists are near the bottom .
There are seven times as many atheists in Europe as the United States , by percentage .
But the second largest group , categorized by belief , are those who call themselves secular or non-religious .
They make up 13 percent of the population .
It is this group that has perhaps been afraid to call themselves atheists , for fear of shunning or other censure .
They could be largely undecided or they could be searching or they could believe , as some friends say with a wink , in the Church of the Outdoors , or the Church of Baseball .
They are also the people buying these books .
But while atheism may have made its way into the public discourse , it remains strictly verboten in our politics .
Even though a majority of people say in surveys that a person can still be a good American without Christian values , to be an atheist and run for high office is to wear the scarlet A . Among the presidential aspirants , half the Republican candidates do not believe in evolution , a view bounded in their religious faith and the imperatives of running in a primary heavily dominated by evangelicals .
Democrats ' more open '
One contender , Senator John McCain of Arizona , made headlines this month when he said the American founders meant to establish the United States as a Christian nation .
In truth , the constitution expressly prohibits establishment of a state religion .
The founders were trying to avoid the entanglements of church with state .
And perhaps the best known founder , Thomas Jefferson himself , may have been an atheist , in the view of many scholars .
No matter .
The Democrats , scorned by a huge sector of the electorate for their perceived secularism , have become more open about faith this time around .
Both Hillary Clinton , and Senator Barack Obama frequently mention God on the campaign trail .
But they also put some distance between themselves and the religious .
Senator Clinton said last week that if she were president she would shield science and research into such things as stem cells from religion and politics .
The United States may never be as secular as Europe .
If you sample even a small share of the reaction , on blogs or Christian talk radio , to these new atheist books , you sense how strongly people feel about their faith .
It 's not passive or abstract .
But , perhaps we have arrived at a moment where doubt is having its day - and for a time , atheists are coming out of hiding .
Below is a selection of your comments :
Hopefully this is the beginning of a world - wide movement where if a person has a religion he sees it as a personal approach to God / Goddess / Gods as opposed to a philosophy which much be imposed upon others .
Paolo , St Albans
I have long admired Europeans for their relaxed approach to religion , which sometimes ranges from the laid - back to the completely apathetic .
While I myself am a devout Episcopalian , I 've always thought that faith has played far too important and unnecessary of a role in public American life .
I would be grateful of a societal movement that casts faith aside as such a major criterion for determining whether someone is ' a good person ' or not .
Eric Campbell , Greensboro , NC , USA Speaking as a lifelong ( American ) agnostic I find Christopher Hitchens and Richard Dawkins the equivalent to how many Christians must view the likes of Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell - they may be nominally on my side but their rhetoric is so patronising and repellent I often wish they were n't .
John R , London
I resent having to be pigeonholed into any kind of belief system - why should I have to choose between Islam , Christianity , Judaism , Atheism ?
I 'm just me , I do n't have a part of my being that needs to have a label to announce what I believe in , even if it 's nothing .
Come on you ' atheists ' , preaching to the faithful about how much better atheism is , is just making you as bad as them .
Ignore the poor medieval moon woofers and get on with your own lives free from guilt , greedy evangelicals , suicidal fundamentalists , and then a bit more guilt .
Richard , Staffordshire , England Watch any BBC programme about geology or natural history , from Coast to The Living Planet , and sooner rather than later the presenter will mention events of millions of years ago , or even the last Ice Age of 10,000 years ago , as a given fact .
There is no debate in the minds of presenters or viewers .
Do they have such programmes in the US , or do they gloss over the timescale of geological events ( it all happened in 4004BC ) ?
I fondly imagine the average Republican politician or supporter watching ( to UK eyes , completely uncontroversial ) presenters like Nicholas Crane or Alan Titchmarsh and going " Lies ! " " Untrue ! " every couple of minutes .
Ken Strong , Hornchurch , Essex
As always , " your mileage may vary ... "
I suppose it 's just possible to have a look around America at the moment and at least suggest that this is a " period of doubt . "
But only in a very relative , hair - splitting , sense .
Even in making this suggestion , the author can't get away from the fact that fervent and frequent references to faith in god abound in American politics as much now as ever .
I 'm pretty certain that most Americans would sooner vote for a Catholic , Muslim , Scientologist , Witch Doctor or even a Satanist than for an atheist .
When ( and if ) that ever changes , then we can talk about a " moment of doubt . "

In a world where religion causes more hurt , division and war than any other cause , this gives me hope .
Steve , London , UK
The vast majority of my friends that claim to be atheist , in my opinion , are not " true " atheists .
As soon as we talk religion and they make their " view " known , they go into a discussion on why they do n't believe in God or Jesus .
Nine times out of ten the reasons are because of people who call themselves Christians .
Basically their opinion on God is based upon his ambassadors .
Therefore they say if God was real , " his " people would be representing God better .
Therefore since Christians are not behaving in the manner their religious beliefs require them to , God does not exist .
However very seldom do my non-religious friends ever explore , in an honest fashion , if God truly does exist .
Their atheism is a surface religion .
They have n't explored their belief in depth .
Just like many of my religious friends .

What are these ?
The Pieces
These are the blocks that the player must use in the game .
Officially , they are known as " Tetraminoes , " but this label is a clear example of how capitalist American pigs have raped the original Communist glory of our holy holy game .
From now on , they shall be referred to simply as pieces or blocks .
As four is key in the numerology of Tetris , all pieces are composed of four elements , or smaller blocks .
The four smaller blocks can only be arranged in seven ways , and those ways are the Tetris pieces : THE COCK PIECE
As is quite apparent for anyone who has seen a game of Tetris being played , or even participated in a competition themselves , Tetris obviously contains sexual undertones .
The most prominent is the coveted phallic block , known officially as the " I - Piece . "
This block plays a crucial role , in that it is the main requirement for the act of a Tetris , or four simultaneous lines .
The Cock Piece is the main source of most players ' misery -- and joy .
THE MIDDLE FINGER PIECE Ah , the Middle Finger Piece .
Unique , as it is the only block , with appendages , that is symmetrical .
The greatest number of lines you can deplete with this piece , unfortunately , is only two ; however , the Middle Finger Piece is the only block that can be used for Rotating the Tires ( see the Catalog of Tetramoves ) .
THE ASS BLOCK
Officially , this block is called the " O Piece . "
Oh , confound that Ass Block .
It is a great source of misery .
If there is no flat space for the Ass Block to rest , this is a great inconvenience .
We suggest always keeping space around for the Ass Block , in case it decides to visit you .
Also , you can keep rotating the Ass Block , but to no avail !
It do n't do shit , as the Ass Block is radially symmetrical .
THE " L " PIECE
Most players ask us , " Why do you call that one the L Piece ? "
Because it looks like a fucking L. THE REVERSE " L " Officially , this is known as the " J Piece , " and like its twisted cousin , the L Piece , it can be used for a maximum of three depleted lines .
Both the L and the Reverse L can be used for the Slide Under ( see the Catalog of Tetramoves ) .
THE " Z " PIECE The Z and S Pieces are somewhat of an oddity in the realm of the Tetris blocks .
Both of these pieces have only two available positions ; rotating them clockwise or counter - clockwise will end with the exact same result .
A total of two depleted lines is maximum with either .
THE " S " PIECE
The sideways younger brother to the Z Piece ; it 's regarded as a black sheep , and everywhere Z Piece goes , it is embarrassed by S Piece .
Did you know ?
There is a Tetris piece for each day of the week .
It ’s not who you are that holds you back , it ’s who you think you ’re not .

If your primary goal in life is to meet an amazing woman , you probably wo n’t .
Setting out on a mission to find a girlfriend is like starting a company to get rich :
It focusses you on the wrong things and you eventually realize that the game you ’re playing is n’t worth winning .
When money is your center of gravity , you make decisions based on dollars rather than sense .
Instead of being a Merchant of Wow
, you become a Merchant of Ow , building boring , ugly , and painful things , hoping you might flip before you flop .
By trading passion for profit you confine yourself to mediocrity , blazing a trail to unhappiness and unwealth as you sink ever deeper into spiritual overdraft .
Likewise , when you make women your focal point , you let go of your I .
Instead of asking what you want most in life , you ask what women want most in life :
What traits do women find attractive in a man ?
What kind of social events do hot women go to ?
What kind of hobbies do women consider sexy ?
What should I say to a girl when I approach her ?
Will she be turned off if I do XYZ ?
Questions are like shovels : they unearth the truth .
But when you ask questions like these , you dig your own grave .
There Is No Secret
In How to Meet Women Without Really Trying , I suggested that the best way to meet women is by talking to them .
This advice is so simple that it ’s almost impossible to understand .
I ’ve experienced the entire spectrum of success with women , from being a chess - playing , virgin , overweight cookie monster in high school all the way to where I am now , where I do n’t even think about meeting girls anymore and It Just Happens .
I know how easy — and , more importantly , how hard — it is to accept and apply the idea of meeting girls by talking to them .
What do I mean by “ talk ” to women ?
What do you say ?
What ’s the best opener ?
What do you say after that ?
Where do you meet them ?
How do you get them interested in you ?
How do you ask for their number ?
How can you possibly meet hot girls without using magic potions and super sekrit seduction techniques ?
To demystify the mechanics of making a connection , I ’ll describe exactly how I met the girl I ’m currently dating .
I ’ll include some philosophical context to paint the bigger picture that led to us finding , meeting , and connecting with each other .
This story is only coincidentally about seduction .
It ’s really more a tale of me just living my life , and how that inevitably leads to meeting charming and beautiful creatures .
Shared Interests Are Everything
I never go out to meet girls anymore .
The success or failure of my social engagements is never measured by how many approaches I did ( ugh ) , how many numbers I walked away with ( ugh ! ) , or how many kisses I got ( UGH !@#*! ) .
Every activity I ’m involved in is fueled by self - interest .
For example , I organize a personal growth group in Montreal because I want to surround myself with like - minded , positive people , and create an environment that promotes the conscious pursuit of happiness .
The more I care about that goal , the better the group gets .
I ’m helping organize BarCamp Canada , a geek conference coming up later this year , because I ’m interested in helping smart people talk to others about what they ’re working on .
And every article on this blog is , first and foremost , a letter written to myself .
Writing helps me crystallize my thoughts and make sense of my experiences .
I use my content to build traffic , rather than letting traffic build my content .
The natural consequence of defining your own hierarchy of values and pursuing them to your utmost ability is that you meet people who share those interests .
For example , by stepping up to volunteer for BarCamp , I ’ve created the opportunity to work with smart hackers .
My choice to start a personal growth group has resulted in forming friendships with some hot girls and cool guys .
From there I get invited to parties and other social events , which leads to meeting more interesting people .
And , of course , starting this blog has added a whole new dimension to my world .
Which brings me to how I met Mary .
Seduction Secret # 172 : Live Your Own Life
Mary was yet another girl I crossed paths with while doing something that mattered to me .
You may remember that a few months ago I did a 30 - day trial on learning to cook .
Since I started from almost zero , I had to make regular trips to a funky little kitchen boutique nearby for crockery and cookware .
I was in there a few times a week during the challenge .
The girls that worked there were really sweet and we started talking more and more .
My requests for kitchen advice eventually led to discussions about the rest of our lives .
I told them about 30 sleeps and how I was learning to cook , and we all got more interested in each other .
There was one girl in particular there who caught my eye .
She had dark hair , a pretty face , a gorgeous body , and radiated an irresistibly feminine sparkle .
We never got around to exchanging names , though I could n’t help but make a mental note of her .
Eventually , I completed the 30 - day challenge and my culinary needs died down .
Time passed .
Life went on .
I did n’t get around to the store much anymore , but I kept bumping into that cute girl around the neighbourhood .
Girl Approaches Guy , Film at 11
One day I got an email from a reader of my blog .
She told me that my articles inspired her .
She confessed a little embarrassment to be writing me out of the blue , but said she had just read my article How to Get a Life and found it really interesting .
One of the points I make in that article is how powerful it can be to just email someone you want to get in touch with .
That ’s exactly what made her decide to email me .
But it was n’t until I reached the bottom of the email that I finally put two and two together .
“ I hope you have n’t stopped cooking ! ” she said .
Signed Mary .
Opportunity Will Knock
When opportunity knocks , you either answer the door , or you light up your internet connection and spank away your sorrows .
So a few days later , I invited her out to a social gathering and things took off from there .
Of course , I ’m not suggesting that pursuing your goals will make the women you desire chase after you .
In most cases , you ’ll have to make the first move .
But shared interests plant the seeds for a healthy social life , and a healthy social life plants the seeds for a healthy sex life .
99 % of the girls you meet will never end up in your bedroom , and that ’s fine .
Mary is the one girl I did connect with out of the dozens and dozens ( and dozens ) that I did n’t .
You do n’t need pickup skills to meet girls ; you need goals that have absolutely nothing to do with girls .
Attracting worthwhile women into your life happens only when you throw the entire force of your existence into creating a life that matters .
" Is Milton Better Than Shakespeare ? " asks Nigel Smith in the title of his new book ( Harvard University Press , 240 pages , $ 22.95 ) .
The obvious answer is no :
It would be hard to dispute that Shakespeare 's plays are more powerful , and more central to our culture , than Milton 's biblical epics or his artfully classical lyrics .
Around the world , when people dream about true love , they think of Romeo and Juliet ; when they thrill with ambition , they think of Macbeth and Lady Macbeth , and so on down the list of Shakespeare 's characters .
Harold Bloom could even speculate , not quite in jest , that Shakespeare invented human nature , so completely does he seem to dominate our imagination of what it means to be human .

An advertisement for the first printing of ' Paradise Lost . '
Ever since " Paradise Lost " was published in 1667 , Milton has been acclaimed as a supreme English poet , Shakespeare 's only rival in linguistic mastery .
Yet even at the height of his prestige , in the 18th century , Milton never inspired the kind of ardent intimacy that readers bring to Shakesepare .
Nor is it simply our lazy generation , unused to reading long poems and deaf to the majesty of Milton 's artifice , that has relegated " Paradise Lost " to the seminar room .
Even Samuel Johnson , in his " Life of Milton , " wrote that " Paradise Lost is one of the books which the reader admires and lays down , and forgets to take up again .
None ever wished it longer than it is .
Its perusal is a duty rather than a pleasure .
We read Milton for instruction , retire harassed and overburdened , and look elsewhere for recreation ; we desert our master , and seek for companions . "
When Mr. Smith writes that " No student of Milton has left Paradise Lost without feeling ... an ardor of admiration , " the very structure of the sentence sounds haunted by Johnson 's famous verdict .
In fact , " Is Milton Better Than Shakespeare ? " is damaged , in several ways , by Mr. Smith 's awkward attempts to sell the reader on Milton .
The very title is a bait and switch , for despite what it seems to promise , Mr. Smith is not at all interested in comparing Milton with Shakespeare .
After a defiantly unconvincing proclamation , early in the book , that " the reach of Milton 's achievements is far greater than Shakespeare 's , " Mr. Smith abandons this doubtful battleground , never to return to it .
Nor does Mr. Smith seem at ease when , in his introduction , he pelts the reader with a series of overingenious claims for Milton 's relevance .
We should be reading the poet , Mr. Smith says , because the Puritans were like Al Qaeda ; or because the Founding Fathers read him ; or because he is " a literary embodiment of so many of the aspirations that have guided Americans " ; or because the popular children 's books of Philip Pullman draw heavily on " Paradise Lost , " or , bizarrely , because Miltonic themes " run through " the lyrics of " the Grammy - winning metal band Slayer . "
By the time Mr. Smith describes " Comus " as " a kind of rap poetry " ( on the basis of lines like " Meanwhile welcome joy and feast / Midnight shout , and revelry " ) , it is clear that he is protesting too much .
Once you get past the misleading title and the hyperbolic introduction , what Mr. Smith has written is nothing more or less than an introduction to some of the major issues in current Milton criticism and scholarship .
Mr. Smith is a professor of English at Princeton , and it is easy to imagine this book as the distillation of his Milton course .
" Is Milton Better Than Shakespeare ? " offers a graduate seminar , however , not a freshman survey .
Mr. Smith does not move through Milton 's works chronologically , or summarize their forms and contents , or sketch in the historical background .
He assumes a reader already familiar with Arminianism and the Long Parliament .
Instead , Mr. Smith organizes his book around a few broad themes  divorce , free will , tyranny  which he then traces through Milton 's poetry and prose .
Within its limits , this is a useful and illuminating method , allowing Mr. Smith to draw on his encyclopedic knowledge of Milton 's works to make unexpected connections .
Mr. Smith is especially interested in connecting Milton the prose writer  the Puritan controversialist who defended the execution of Charles I , the radical defender of divorce rights and free speech  with Milton the erudite and allusive poet .
Thus he shows how the happy eroticism of Milton 's Eden  " nor turned I ween / Adam from his fair spouse , nor Eve the rites / Mysterious of connubial love refused "  contrasts with his vision of unhappy marriage in his pamphlet on divorce : " to grind in the mill of an undelighted and servile copulation , must be the only forced work of a Christian marriage . "
Mr. Smith 's speculations are sometimes unconvincing , and he is perhaps too ready to lend an ear to the latest theories mooted in the professional journals .
( When the newly created Eve gazes at herself in the water , is Milton really offering " an amazing account of same - sex desire ... the story of the lesbian 's denial at the very birth of her self - consciousness " ? )
But Mr. Smith does succeed in giving the reader a sense of the richness and surprise of Milton 's writing , and of the tensions that keep his work vital  between the poet and the prose writer , the Christian and the republican , the Bible reader and the scientific speculator .
When all is said , however , these are not the main reasons why Milton continues to appeal to readers in the 21st century .
What makes any poet live is not the scholarly ingenuity devoted to him , but the aesthetic pleasure and philosophical challenge he offers .
It is on these grounds , not the grounds of " relevance , " that Milton should be defended  or , rather , cherished , for he needs no defending .
Mr. Smith gives many examples of the sheer musical beauty of Milton 's verse , which is like no other in English .
This is a very artificial music , the periods wrought with great deliberation , the lines and sentences setting up an extended counterpoint .
Yet no one who takes pleasure in the sound of language could possibly read Milton without being thrilled , again and again , by cadences like this one from " Lycidas " :
Whether beyond the stormy Hebrides ,
Where thou perhaps under the whelming tide
Visit'st the bottom of the monstrous world ;
Or whether thou , to our moist vows denied ,
Sleep 'st by the fable of Bellerus old ,
Where the great vision of the guarded mount
Looks toward Namancos and Bayona 's hold .
Beyond his music , Milton offers the enduring provocation of his deeply paradoxical understanding of good and evil .
In all his work , Milton only created one Shakespearean character , one character who seems to escape the words on the page and take up residence in our unconscious : Satan , the hero - villain of " Paradise Lost . "
But because Satan is more than a literary character  because he was , for Milton , a really existing being , and remains , for us , a mythic symbol of enormous power  he has an existential weight even greater than Hamlet's .
Satan , in Milton 's epic , is necessarily a figure of horror  the father of Sin and Death , the prince of Pandemonium , the tempter of Eve .
Yet he is also , as readers have noticed for hundreds of years , a much more compelling character than God the Father or God the Son , who cannot escape the abstractness of their omnipotence .
Satan 's pride , which leads him to revolt against God rather than accept the elevation of Jesus to God 's second - in - command , makes him a kind of cosmic Iago or Edmund .
" [ I ] n my choice , " he declares , " To reign is worth ambition , though in hell : / Better to reign in hell than serve in heaven . "
This is , quite obviously , not an attitude that Milton wants the reader to share ; it is his infinite pride that makes Satan the Evil One .
Yet because this striving , fallible figure necessarily drives the action of the poem , it is impossible not to identify with Satan as one reads .
As William Blake put it , " The reason Milton wrote in fetters when he wrote of Angels & God , and at liberty when of Devils & Hell , is because he was a true Poet , and of the Devil 's party without knowing it . "
This paradox , which arises out of Milton 's contradictory conception of a Christian epic , seems to point to a profound and unsettling truth about human nature .
If evil is exciting and goodness dull , if we love our fallen - ness because we cannot imagine a life without action , then what chance do we have for redemption ?
" Paradise Lost , " a poem written in order to " justify the ways of God to men , " serves instead as a mirror held up to human nature to expose its essential sinfulness .
As Mr. Smith writes , " this astonishing literature does not seem to lend itself to coherence "  which is why , in an age even less coherent than Milton 's own , he is still able to speak to us with the intimacy of greatness .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A U.S. appeals court ruled on Friday that four former Guantanamo prisoners , all British citizens , have no right to sue top Pentagon officials and military officers for torture , abuse and violations of their religious rights .
Protestors mark the sixth anniversary of the first transfers of detainees to Guantanamo Bay with a demonstration outside the U.S. Consulate in Edinburgh January 11 , 2008 .

The decision by a three - judge panel to dismiss the lawsuit came exactly six years after the first detainees arrived at the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba .
The prison , which has been widely criticized by human rights advocates , now holds about 275 prisoners .
President George W. Bush has acknowledged the prison ’s damage to the U.S. image and has said he would like to see it closed eventually .
The four who brought the lawsuit -- Shafiq Rasul , Asif Iqbal , Rhuhel Ahmed and Jamal al - Harith -- were released from Guantanamo in 2004 after being held for more than two years .
The suit sought $ 10 million in damages and named then - Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and 10 military commanders .
The men claimed they were subjected to various forms of torture , harassed as they practiced their religion and forced to shave their religious beards .
In one instance , a guard threw a Koran in a toilet bucket , according to the lawsuit .
The appeals court cited a lack of jurisdiction over the lawsuit , ruled the defendants enjoyed qualified immunity for acts taken within the scope of their government jobs and held the religious right law did not apply to the detainees .
Eric Lewis , the attorney who argued the case for the detainees , vowed to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court .
“ AWFUL DAY FOR RULE OF LA W ”
“ It is an awful day for the rule of law and common decency when a court finds that torture is all in a days ’ work for the secretary of defense and senior generals , ” Lewis said .
Another attorney for the plaintiffs , Michael Ratner of the Center for Constitutional Rights , expressed disappointment that the appeals court failed to hold “ Rumsfeld and the chain of command accountable for torture at Guantanamo . ”
The appeals court , in an opinion written by Judge Karen LeCraft Henderson , ruled the lawsuit does not allege the defendants acted as rogue officials who adopted a policy of torture unrelated to the gathering of intelligence .
“ Here it was foreseeable that conduct that would ordinarily be indisputably ‘ seriously criminal ’ would be implemented by military officials responsible for detaining and interrogating suspected enemy combatants , ” she wrote
The judge ruled the prisoners were not covered by the Religious Freedom Restoration
Act because they “ are aliens and were located outside sovereign United States territory ” at the time of the alleged violations .
In a separate ruling , the appeals court rejected a group ’s efforts to obtain information about the advice non-government lawyers gave the Defense Department regarding regulations for trials of Guantanamo prisoners .
In 2001 , Bush issued an order establishing military commissions to try suspected terrorists held at Guantanamo .
The Pentagon issued regulations for the trials , after consulting former high - ranking government officials and academic experts .
A group called the National Institute of Military Justice sued seeking access to those recommendations .
In a 2 - 1 opinion , the appeals court held the records were exempt from disclosure under the freedom of information law .
More than 80 people protesting the Guantanamo prison were arrested at the Supreme Court , which is considering a case on the rights of Guantanamo prisoners .
In New York ’s Times Square , activists marked the sixth Guantanamo anniversary by staging a demonstration of waterboarding in the middle of a rainstorm .
The interrogation practice has been at the center of a bitter dispute about what constitutes torture .

City of Berkeley 2180 Milvia St. Berkeley , CA 94704
April 8 , 2008
Dear members of the Berkeley City Council ,
I have been following with some interest your protest of US Government foreign policy in Iraq and , in particular , your actions regarding the United States Marine Corps , to include your initial vote and subsequent retraction .
While I am sympathetic with your overall aim , I believe the strategy you pursued in this case was less than optimal and fell short of its potential of actually affecting US foreign policy .
The main problem lies in the target of your protest .
The US federal government and its foreign policy are the real problems , not the USMC .
The Marines are merely one of many tools in the executive branch 's toolbox for prosecuting its interventionist policies .
The USMC does not create policy ; it follows that which it is given .
Even if your actions were to reduce recruitment , you could not change that fact .
Additionally , protests at USMC recruiting stations only served to inflame public opinion everywhere outside of the Berkeley city limits , further marginalizing your efforts .
If you are truly serious about asserting your beliefs by taking a stand , as a duly elected local government body , against federal government actions that are grievously injurious to international relations and to the concept of federalism itself , I offer the following practical suggestions :
1. Issue a formal statement to the effect that , while the Berkeley City Council remains adamantly opposed to US government foreign policy in Iraq , protests against the USMC were misdirected and counterproductive .
Effective immediately , the City Council of Berkeley will no longer target the USMC exclusively .
It will now support protests against the IRS , the Social Security Administration , the Departments of State , Energy , Education , Commerce , Agriculture , Transportation , Health and Human Services , all branches of the Armed Forces , and any other federal entity maintaining an office within the city limits .
2. Issue another formal statement to the effect that , because the City of Berkeley is adamantly opposed to US foreign policy in Iraq , the following actions are intended to deprive the federal government of the resources necessary to prosecute its foreign and will remain in effect until all US forces are withdrawn :
Effective immediately , the City of Berkeley will stop withholding federal income taxes on city employees .
( Note : this is not supporting the individual non-payment of federal income taxes , but rather the non-withholding of same by the city .
Non-payment is illegal ; failure to withhold can be fought in the courts . )
The City Council will not object if private corporations within the city limits fail to withhold federal income taxes on their employees .
The City Council will not enforce collection of federal corporate income tax within the city limits nor will it enforce the collection of any federal tariffs , excise taxes or any other federal fees on goods and services traded within Berkeley .
To show resolve in this issue , the City of Berkeley will return all unspent federal payments , including subsidies , grants , and other monies received from any federal agency .
In addition , the city will accept no further federal grants , subsidies , or other payments .
This is not a long list but , by implementing these suggestions , your city council would clearly demonstrate to the federal government and the rest of the world that a local government can understand and practice the principles of federalism and that Berkeley is doing its part to rein in the excesses of a presidential administration run amok .
Will you actually implement any of these recommendations ?
My guess is no , but I 'd like to be proven wrong .
If you did , Berkeley could lead the way for other American communities and become the very nexus of a new freedom movement that recognizes an ever - growing groundswell of public opinion across the entire nation , a groundswell consisting of individuals and organizations that are fed up with the expansion of federal power , influence and intrusion into every aspect of our lives and the lives of others across the globe .
If you do n't implement any of these suggestions , then your protest is revealed for what it truly is ; namely , an empty gesture that appeals only to a small anti-military fringe , having perhaps cathartic value , but no lasting impact .
I will continue to watch with interest and remain ,
Sincerely , Randall Bentz

Obama hits back at inexperience charge from GOP lawmaker Nick Juliano
Published : Monday April 14 , 2008

This GOP congressman calls Obama ' boy ' at fundraiser , later apologizes A Republican congressman used some of the most racially charged language of the election season to attack Barack Obama 's fitness to be president , causing the Illinois Senator 's campaign to issue a sharp rebuke Monday .
Rep. Geoff Davis was speaking to about 400 donors at a fundraiser in Kentucky , when he said of Obama , " That boy 's finger does not need to be on the button . "
Obama 's campaign hit back against the " offensive " comment .
 It 's hard to tell what is more outrageous - Representative Davis ' condescending and personal attack , or his absurd and offensive claim that Barack Obama is not prepared to defend America , " said Obama campaign spokesman Bill Burton .
" Geoff Davis may hide behind offensive tough talk , but he has marched in lock - step with Bush - McCain policies that have devastated our national security while Barack Obama has stood up against a misguided war in Iraq and worked with respected Republicans like Dick Lugar and Chuck Hagel to secure loose weapons and nuclear materials from terrorists .
A Davis spokesperson said the two - term Republican " misspoke " and was not trying to be racist .
Later , Davis issued a written apology to the Democratic frontrunner .
" My poor choice of words is regrettable and was in no way meant to impugn you or the your integrity , " Davis wrote , according to the ABC News blog Political Radar .
" I offer my sincere apology to you and ask for your forgiveness . "
It also appears Davis may have released classified information in the exchange .
He said in his remarks at the GOP dinner that he also recently participated in a " highly classified , national security simulation " with Obama .
" I 'm going to tell you something : That boy 's finger does not need to be on the button , " Davis said .
" He could not make a decision in that simulation that related to a nuclear threat to this country . "
It 's unclear just what kind of classified simulation Davis could be referring to .
A Davis spokesperson would n't talk about it .
Both elected in 2004 , Obama and Davis serve in opposite chambers of Congress , and they sit on different committees , so there 's little chance they would have crossed paths much .
Blogger Mark Nickolas calls Davis 's comments " overtly racist " and reminds readers of previous controversy from the congressman .
In 2005 , Davis once lectured from the House floor that Rep. Jack Murtha ( D - PA ) and similar critics of the Bush war policy were " despicable , dishonorable , uninformed , unhistorical , anti-intellectual and , frankly , un-American . "
In 2006 , Davis -- who reminds voters at every opportunity that he is a veteran -- became the top recipient of the payday loan industry and carried their water in opposing caps on high interest rates for payday loans made on military bases , even sharing proposed legislation with the industry after receiving thousands in contributions .

" It is more blessed to give than to receive , " especially when you can exchange hours of pacing up and down the High Street with a quick bulk purchase of gift vouchers .
It 's estimated we spend about £ 3bn a year on gift cards and vouchers in the UK - that 's about 1 % of everything we spend in the shops .
But the British Retail Consortium says it is thought about a quarter of these vouchers and cards never get redeemed .
In terms of actual money spent , about eight per cent is wasted , according to the Vouchers Association .
Unbelievably , some would forgo this experience for a quick and easy gift card
" The existence of a secondary market , " says US economist Jennifer Pate , " demonstrates a gap between the face value of the card and the value to the recipient . "
While studying the resale market of credit - card - style gift cards on an internet auction site , Ms Pate amassed a wealth of data .
She collected information on about 2,000 completed sales from about 500 unique sellers , covering 31 US stores , between February and June 2004 .
" Sellers accept significantly less cash for their gift cards , at a loss of approximately 15 % of the initial value on average . "
Dr Pate says that when selling fees are taken into consideration , that loss becomes 20 % .
This echoes another economist 's theory about gift - giving , known as " the deadweight loss of Christmas " .
Does thought count ?
Coined by Professor Joel Waldfogel of the University of Pennsylvania , it states that a typical £ 100 gift will be valued at just £ 80 by its recipient .
However , Mr Waldfogel purposefully left sentimental value out of his calculations .
I remember getting a gift card for a store that was really for someone who was five years younger than me ... there was nothing that I could spend this money on
Jennifer Pate
Other economists disagree , arguing that people value presents significantly above their price tag because they appreciate the thought or they are pleased to receive a luxury they could n't normally justify .
But still , the number of unwanted presents up for sale on the internet shows how wide of the mark our gift selections can be .
And we can get it just as wrong with gift vouchers and gift cards .
Ms Pate says you still have to know something about a person 's tastes .
That is , it is no good buying a gift card for a shop they would n't be seen dead in .
Her own experience has taught her that .
$ 11 k gift card
" I remember getting a gift card for a store that was really for someone who was five years younger than me and walking in and just realising that there was nothing that I could spend this money on .
DIY shops are among the best bets for those buying gift cards
You might think you are really treating someone if you get them a gift voucher for a jewellers or a lingerie shop .
But Dr Pate says gift cards from specialist shops do the worst in online auctions .
The most expensive gift card she found on sale was for Tiffany & Co , the jewellers .
It had $ 11,000 credit on it but it was sold for $ 8,800 - a 20 % loss .
At the other end of the spectrum was a Starbucks gift card for $ 3.30 , that sold for $ 2.50 .
Gift cards for pet shops did badly too - again selling at about a 20 % discount .
Cards and vouchers for more general shops , like DIY stores , do better , she says , selling at around 10 % discounts .
" Givers who are less aware of the recipient 's preferences should rely more on gift cards from general - purpose stores that offer greater product variety , " says Ms Pate .
$ 20 sweet spot
According to the Vouchers Association , 98 % of the credit on gift cards and vouchers for supermarkets gets used up , whereas just 85 % of the money spent on vouchers for more specialist shops ends up being redeemed .
' Awesome ... a £ 20 voucher for Homebase "
" I found there are very few gift cards in the range of $ 20 being resold on the internet because people are able to use them much more easily than one for $ 200 and up , " says Dr Pate .
Of course , it could be that people can't be bothered to sell on a card which has a low value .
And there is no way of knowing what proportion of gift cards end up being sold on , so it 's impossible to draw any firm conclusions from this research .
The one thing economists know for sure is that the most reliably efficient present is that friendly £ 10 note slipped inside the Christmas card .
But even they realise that can be a bit of a no - no .
Which leads Ms Pate to a creative answer : " At the end of the day , a gift card is just a cash gift for a certain store so if that 's what it takes to make a cash gift more special , than one could just give money and include a note that says ' I think you 'd really like to spend it at this store ' , and then that adds the thought that counts .

Flashing oncoming motorists with your high beams used to be an effective , if low - tech , way to warn them about speed traps up the road .
But radar - gun wielding cops have increasingly given way to photo - enforcement cameras that nab drivers with a click of a shutter , and those can be hard to spot .
The trend toward cameras has not only increased the number of busted speeders and red - light runners , it 's been a bonanza for municipal coffers .
But now the wonders of Web 2.0 and portable navigation systems can use motorists ' tips and Microsoft Virtual Earth to help keep you from appearing on your local police department 's version of candid camera .
It 's a lot more effective than relying on a bleating radar detector .
Shannon Atkinson launched Njection.com as a place for gearheads to shoot the breeze about anything and everything auto-related .
It was n't long before he sensed a theme in the posts .
“ One of the biggest topics on the site became speed traps and cameras , ” Atkinson told us .
" People want to know about those whether they ’re a truck driver , a road warrior or just someone who wants to drive without worrying about it . ”
So Atkinson added Speedtrap , a feature that combines drivers ' tips with Microsoft Virtual Earth to identify speed traps - either a real , live cop with a radar gun or one of those damned cameras - throughout the U.S.
There 's even a few foreign cities , such as London , Toronto and Rome .
Now , the information can be downloaded directly to portable navigation devices from Garmin , Mio , TomTom and others via Njection.com so that drivers can pinpoint speed traps on a given route .
Atkinson says the identity of Njection ’s many speed - trap tipsters is kept confidential , and they include more than a few police officers who like the site because what " they ’re mostly interested in is getting people to drive safely . ”

Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff Pool photo WASHINGTON 
The Homeland Security Department used its legal authority Tuesday to waive environmental and land management laws , so it can complete 670 miles of fence along the U.S. - Mexican border .
The waivers will allow the department to move ahead with miles of pedestrian and vehicle fence construction as well as roads and detection systems .
Homeland Security , under orders from Congress to build the fence , has run into intense opposition along the border from land owners , ranchers and environmentalists .
Many did n't want their land taken or for wildlife and rare species to be disturbed .
" Criminal activity at the border does not stop for endless debate or protracted litigation , " Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said . "
The waivers will enable important security projects to keep moving forward . "
The waivers apply to sections of the border in California , Arizona , New Mexico and Texas .
They allow Homeland Security to skip required studies of how its construction projects would affect areas with fragile environments , protected wildlife or historic value .
Although Congress gave Homeland Security the authority to waive the laws , some members were furious .
" Today 's waiver represents an extreme abuse of authority , " House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson , D - Miss . , said .
" Waiver authority should only be used as a last resort . "
Environmental groups also expressed alarm .
" The DHS decision … will jeopardize the economy , quality of life and beauty of South Texas , " National Audubon Society President John Flicker said .
It is not the first time Homeland Security has used waivers .
In 2005 , it waived environmental restrictions to build a section of fence in San Diego .
In 2007 , it issued two waivers in southern Arizona .
In a statement , Homeland Security said it " remains deeply committed to environmental responsibility " and will make every effort to " ensure impacts to the environment , wildlife and cultural and historic artifacts are analyzed and minimized . "

In an extraordinary 633 - word retraction , The Los Angeles Times has renounced an article it published last month that claimed to have new information about an attack in 1994 on rap artist Tupac Shakur , who later was killed .
An internal Times investigation confirmed what the Web site The Smoking Gun reported on March 26 : The FBI documents that Pulitzer Prize - winning reporter Chuck Philips used to bolster his story were fraudulent .
The Times said Philips had believed the documents to be genuine .
A mysterious bomb - making experiment that ended with the accidental death of a government scientist has remained an official secret for more than five years , leaving his family in the dark about what went wrong .
Terry Jupp , a scientist with the Ministry of Defence , was engulfed in flames during a joint Anglo - American counter - terrorism project intended to discover more about al - Qaida 's bomb - making capacities .
There has been no inquest into his death , as the coroner has been waiting for the MoD to disclose information about the incident .
An attempt to prosecute the scientist 's manager for manslaughter ended when prosecutors said they were withdrawing the charge , but said the case was too " sensitive " to explain that decision in open court .
The Guardian has established that Jupp was a member of a small team of British and US scientists making bombs from ingredients of the sort that terrorists could obtain .
There is also evidence pointing to experiments to discover more about radiological dispersal devices - so - called dirty bombs - which use conventional explosives to scatter radioactive material .
But such a project would have been controversial as the open - air experiment that ended in Jupp 's death was conducted at a weapons testing centre on an island in the Thames estuary 10 miles from Southend , Essex .
Meanwhile , the scientist 's family despair of discovering what happened .
" I feel these people high up want it swept under the carpet , " said Jupp 's mother Anne .
" The death of one man is nothing to upset them too much , I suppose .
But it does upset us . "
Jupp was 46 , married with two children , and had been with the MoD for almost 25 years .
At the time of the accident he was working with the Forensic Explosive Laboratory , a division of the ministry 's Defence Science and Technology Laboratory ( Dstl ) .
On August 14 2002 , he and his team was conducting a series of highly classified experiments on Foulness , a remote island that is part of MoD 's vast weapons testing centre at Shoeburyness , east of Southend .
Blending several readily - available ingredients , then pouring the mix into old paint tins , they built a number of 10kg bombs .
Sources familiar with the case say the fatal experiment involved mixing three over - the - counter ingredients including ammonium nitrate fertiliser and a powdered metal .
Jupp was asked to prime the mix with a small amount of high explosive , but for reasons that remain unclear it ignited spontaneously .
Jupp was consumed by a fireball and suffered 80 % burns , dying six days later .
Court case
An investigation by the Health and Safety Executive and MoD police resulted in two of Jupp 's managers being charged with manslaughter and being brought before the Old Bailey in April 2005 .
The charge against one man was thrown out when the judge ruled there was insufficient evidence .
The second man denied the charge and the case against him dragged on for years , before being abandoned after a review involving Lord Goldsmith , then attorney general .
Gareth Patterson , prosecuting , told the Old Bailey in March last year that information had emerged from subsequent experiments , but added : " The difficulties of the sensitivities of this case are such that I can not go into too much detail about the information in open court . "
Crown Prosecution Service sources said the case was hampered because one of the American scientists refused to testify , while other officials said there was concern in both countries that a trial could expose the nature of the experiment .
According to a number of officials in Britain and the US , the Dstl had carried out a series of secret experiments with the US national laboratory in New Mexico to find out more about the sort of bombs terrorists could build .
One of the Old Bailey defendants was the key figure on the British side , these officials say .
According to these sources , in August 2002 , less than a year after the September 11 attacks British and American scientists were anxious to establish whether al - Qaida could build a dirty bomb using conventional explosives surrounded by radioactive material .
" They were looking into the most likely explosives to be used to scatter radiation , " said one .
" They wanted to know how big such a bomb might be and how far it would scatter the radiation .
They were experimenting with chemicals available over the counter to see how powerful an explosion could be produced . "
It is unclear whether the bomb that killed Jupp contained radioactive material , and the MoD refuses to say whether he was involved in a dirty bomb project .
Asked whether it has carried out such experiments at Shoeburyness , the MoD would say only : " The Dstl is involved in classified work that is of national importance , protecting UK armed forces and the public from very real threats . "
What is clear is that Shoeburyness has hosted some highly unusual activities involving radioactive material .
According to an Environment Agency report , at the time of the accident it was the scene of " a major programme of nuclear warhead decommissioning " .
Between 1998 and 2003 , the report said , high explosive extracted from free - fall nuclear bombs and Polaris missile warheads , which had been contaminated with tritium and uranium , was taken to Shoeburyness for disposal .
This was achieved by taking the high explosive to a remote corner of Foulness island , and by simply blowing it up .
The agency said these operations posed no risk to human health , as the level of radioactive contamination was low .
But the footpath skirting the bleak coastline south of the site is lined with signs warning the public not to fish there and to never take away shellfish .
Jupp 's family knew nothing about his work and have been told nothing about the experiment that led to his death .
His father Roy said : " He said he worked in plastics .
That was the only thing he ever told us . "
Jupp 's sister Alison Davis added : " We were absolutely stunned when the phone call came though to tell us about an explosion .
We thought : ' Why would Terry be involved in an explosion ? ' "
Delays in the criminal case - which they had hoped would shed light on the tragedy - were a cause of immense frustration .
Now they have no idea when an inquest may be held .
The case was handed over to the local coroner in Essex last March , but it took the MoD 12 months to hand over correspondence relating to the case .
The MoD said this was down to " technical things " but would not elaborate .
A spokesman said that some of the documentation about the death of Terry Jupp remained at the ministry , and that while the coroner will be allowed to view it , " he will not be allowed to take it away " .
TEHRAN ( Reuters ) - Iran will respond to any military attack from Israel by “ eliminating ” the Jewish state , a senior army commander said on Tuesday .

Deputy commander - in - chief Mohammad Reza Ashtiani was echoing Iran ’s late leader of the 1979 Islamic Revolution , Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , who said Israel should be wiped off the map .
Some analysts have speculated that Israel might attack Iran to stop its nuclear activities , which the West fears are a front for weapons development .
Iran , which does not recognize Israel , insists it wants nuclear technology only for electricity .
“ If Israel wants to take any action against the Islamic Republic , we will eliminate Israel from the scene of the universe , ” the semi-official Mehr news agency quoted Ashtiani as saying .
“ Our answer to any military attack against Iran will be strong . ”
The U.S. State Department said the comments showed the international community was right to sanction Iran .
It is “ more unbelievable rhetoric out of the leadership of the Iranian government about attacking a fellow member of the United Nations , ” State Department spokesman Sean McCormack told reporters .
“ Any civilized person finds that disturbing . ”
Israeli Defence Minister Ehud Barak did not respond directly to the remarks but said Israel was pressing ahead with its efforts to counter any Iranian nuclear threat .
Barak told reporters at an air base in central Israel that there remained much to do in “ intelligence , in prevention and in formulating diplomatic and practical sanctions . ”
“ We have to prepare , and if there ’s a need , to take action , not just to talk idly , ” he said , in apparent reference to reported remarks last week by cabinet minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer that Israel would destroy Iran if attacked .
Opposition to Israel is a fundamental principle in Shi’ite Iran , which backs Palestinian militants opposed to peace with the Jewish state but says it offers only moral support .
A 2005 statement by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad saying that “ Israel should be wiped off the map ” outraged the international community .
Washington says it wants a diplomatic resolution to the nuclear dispute but has not ruled out military action if that fails .
Tehran insists it will not bow to Western pressure .
Iran , the world ’s fourth - largest oil producer , says it has developed ballistic missiles able to hit Israel and U.S. bases in the region .
Israel ’s Defence Ministry has announced the successful test of the “ Blue Sparrow , ” a missile that will serve as a target for tests of its Arrow anti-ballistic missile system .
Israeli media have reported that the target missile would simulate the ballistic trajectory of Iran ’s Shehab - 3 missile , which Israel fears could carry a nuclear warhead .
Tehran ’s failure to convince world powers of its peaceful nuclear intentions has prompted three rounds of U.N. sanctions , and the United States is pushing for another , tougher set of penalties .
The five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council plus Germany are due to meet on April 16 in Shanghai to discuss whether to sweeten incentives offered to Iran in 2006 to curb its nuclear work .

Few people can comfortably leave the Windows world behind entirely , whether due to web sites that only play nice Internet Explorer or Outlook / Office requirements of the job .
Luckily , getting Windows up and running inside Linux has never been easier than with VirtualBox , a free virtualization tool that makes running one system inside another as easy as can possibly be .
I used VirtualBox to create seamless XP windows inside Linux , and found that , in most cases , if you can install XP , you can get it running in VirtualBox .

Qing Xu Wei earns a real - life living in China looking after player characters
Enlarge Image
Millions around the world play , meet up , battle , buy and sell in online games and virtual worlds , such as Second Life and World of Warcraft .
But to many , these virtual goings - on can be a total mystery .
Armed with his lens , photo journalist Robbie Cooper has been facing up to gamers , revealing their intricate lives and identities to the rest of the world .
Last year , his Alter Egos exhibition in London showed off the people behind the avatars - their virtual representations .
It was a fascinating and comforting peek into the very ordinary and familiar faces of gamers and virtual worlders .
This year , he has cast his lens further afield into China and Korea to get the stories behind the avatars .
" I wanted to build on what I had done before and get more cultural variety and more personal variety , " he told the BBC News website .
Part of life
" I wanted to see people who use female avatars , women who use male avatars , and also people who earn their living from doing this - from buying and selling virtual goods , or creating programs to operate people 's characters . "
One player he met in the virtual world , Second Life , earns $ 70,000 a year creating female avatar clothing , he says .
Another player , Mark ( aka Marcos Fonzarelli in Second Life ) has turned himself into a " robot tailor " , designing robot costumes that characters can wear .
Admittedly , it is a niche market , says Mark , but he still earns $ 250 a month .
According to the robot tailor , the real money is in the female clothing market .
Mr Cooper says that makes sense when one considers the hugely lucrative beauty and clothing market in the physical world .
It seems natural that the same kinds of rules and practices that occur in physical life will happen in virtual worlds too .
That became evident when residents were urged to donate to the Katrina Hurricane aid effort , via the game .
A virtual memorial with candles was even created .
" We live in a virtual world anyway , " says Mr Cooper .
" Democracy is virtual , politics is virtual ; all this stuff and information we get in the newspaper - a lot of it is public relations stuff . "
When virtual turns real
But Mr Cooper 's pictures show that those boundaries between the virtual and the " real " are blurring in other parts of the world , particularly in Asia .
The photos captured the fascinating and largely unseen world of workers in China and Korea who earn their keep by looking after people 's characters in games while they are at work , or asleep .
A commodity is a commodity .
If it is worth something , people are going to work hard to make the money .
In China , there is matter of fact attitude about it
Robbie Cooper
The programs he creates runs on seven computers , each churning out power points so that gamers can get their characters up to a certain strength and status .
" From their point of view it is understandable .
When a new game comes out , do you want to start at the bottom or have someone do that for you to get to level at which it is fun to play ? " he explains .
One shot shows what , at first glance , might be mistaken for a virtual room from within a game .
With newspapers as wallpaper , posters of fantasy figures , and scruffy bedding , it is in fact a room in a net cafe in Tianjin , China .
It is used by employees who work for a dollar a day levelling up player 's characters .
Up to 30 will work for 16 hours , using the room to sleep in shifts .
Dark economics ?
To Chinese gamers , it does not seem unusual that there would be people working on every level of the economic food chain , says Mr Cooper .
The gamers there , he added , had reams of stories about in - game cheating and stolen accounts .
Buying and selling gaming items such as imaginary weapons is a booming business on the web .
The internet games section of Ebay saw more than $ 9 m ( £ 5 m ) in trades in 2003 alone .
" A commodity is a commodity .
If it is worth something , people are going to work hard to make the money .
In China , there is matter of fact attitude about it , " he says .

This kind of criminal activity which happens as a result of events occurring in a game could become more common .
China has no laws to deal with the theft of virtual property .
But in South Korea , where gaming is treated as a mainstream sport , there is a police unit that investigates in - game crime .
According to Mr Cooper , this shows how seriously gaming is being taken , especially when real - life money and value plays a part .
" A lot of people I met did not have as much sentiment about the games as they do in the West .
In China you do what you have to do to get by , " he explains .
But there is more to " value " in game playing than just economics , says Mr Cooper .
" This whole thing is about value and if people are willing to pay money for something , it has some kind of value to them .
Value is more than money ; it is emotional value , time , and work . "
When gamers find emotional value and a sense of accomplishment through online games and virtual worlds , that can sometimes be just as worthy .
Mr Cooper 's most recent photos will be on show at a PlayStation 2 supported exhibition tour starting 9 November in Amsterdam .
